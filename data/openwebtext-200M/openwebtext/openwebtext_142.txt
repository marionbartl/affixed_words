Republicans antsy for a conservative standard - bearer in the presidential race have begun to rally behind Fred Thompson , propelling the former Tennessee senator to within hailing distance of the lead for the party ’s nomination , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg Poll has found .
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani holds first place in the survey , with support from 27 % of the Republicans and independents who said they plan to vote in the party ’s 2008 primaries .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Wednesday June 13 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 60 words Type of Material : Correction
Presidential poll : A chart accompanying an article Tuesday in Section A reporting the results of a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg Poll said 31 % of Democratic voters surveyed thought it was more important for the candidate they choose in the primary to have “ long experience in government and policymaking ” than to be someone who “ bridges partisan divides . ”
It should have said 39 % .
But Thompson , an actor who played a prosecutor on NBC ’s “ Law & Order , ” runs just behind , with 21 % .
Indications are he will join the race within the next month .
The two other major GOP contenders , Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , fall well short of the leaders and are in a battle for third place .
McCain was backed by 12 % of those polled , Romney by 10 % .
The rest of the crowded field is mired in single digits .

Among the Democratic candidates , the race remains little changed from a Times / Bloomberg poll in April .
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton maintains a solid lead at 33 % , followed by Illinois Sen. Barack Obama at 22 % .
Running third , with 15 % , is former Vice President Al Gore , who continues to say he has no plans to seek the office he barely lost in 2000 .
Fourth is former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards at 8 % .
Despite Clinton ’s lead , Obama is the strongest Democrat in hypothetical match - ups with Republicans in the general election , running even or well ahead of the GOP ’s top contenders .
Clinton , in a showing that could spark concerns among some Democrats , does not fare as well .
Against Giuliani , for instance , the poll found she would lose by 10 percentage points .

Overall , the survey underscored the unsettled nature of the Republican contest , with voters splitting roughly along ideological lines .
Giuliani , whose views on abortion , gay rights and guns are to the left of many in his party , has built a wide base among moderates and independents , while Thompson has drawn conservatives , particularly among the religious right .
That dynamic , however , could change quickly .
Giuliani has faced a swarm of media scrutiny of his weak spots for months , but retains a lead in national polls , although it is somewhat diminished .
Thompson , by contrast , is only starting to introduce himself .
He has never endured the rigors of a high - profile campaign and has not parried with rivals in debates , as Giuliani and nine other Republicans have done three times this spring .

Thompson “ has this allure , but he has n’t been tested yet , ” said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , who conducted the survey .
“ He has gotten a free ride so far . ”
Conservatives uneasy
For months , many conservatives have been uneasy with their choices .
The survey shows that a substantial bloc , voters like poll respondent Ted Uhlemann , 56 , of Littleton , Colo. , is gravitating toward Thompson , an opponent of abortion rights and gun control .
“ He ’s just more conservative than the rest of them , ” Uhlemann , an environmental engineer , said of the top Republicans in a follow - up interview .
“ They ’re all a little more liberal than I would expect the candidate for the Republican Party to be . ”

For Giuliani , an ace remains his leadership of New York after the terrorist strikes of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
More than two - thirds of Republican - leaning primary voters rate a candidate ’s views on terrorism and national security as more important than stands on social issues .
The top pick for those voters : Giuliani , who has focused his campaign heavily on his record and his commitment to fight terrorism .
For McCain , the survey pointed to lasting trouble among conservative Republicans :
One in four would not vote for him under any circumstances .
Their longstanding gripes have included his opposition to President Bush ’s tax cuts and his backing for efforts -- now apparently stalled in Congress -- to put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship .
“ McCain has too much of a liberal bent , ” said Pat Pensa , 60 , a Republican housewife who lives in Kennesaw , Ga. , and leans toward Thompson .
As for Romney , the poll found no advancement despite a “ 60 Minutes ” profile , a Time magazine cover story and other national exposure in recent weeks .
Also , Thompson ’s initial success in attracting conservatives raises doubts about Romney ’s drive to make inroads among those voters .

Still , polls in Iowa and New Hampshire -- early - voting states where Romney has campaigned heavily -- put him in the top tier , offering hope that success there could build momentum for primaries elsewhere .
Stuck on the bottom rungs in the Republican contest are former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who gets 3 % ; former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson , 2 % ; Rep. Duncan Hunter of El Cajon , 1 % ; and Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback , and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo , less than 1 % .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is not in the race and has said he will not decide about running until the fall , gets 9 % .
When GOP primary voters were asked to choose among the top four , the field broke into upper and lower ranks .
On top were Giuliani , 32 % , and Thompson , 28 % ; below were McCain , 17 % , and Romney , 14 % .
In the Democratic contest , Clinton ’s strong support among women , liberals , minorities and older voters has kept her in first place .

“ I just believe that she ’s right for the time , ” said Phyllis Fisher , 67 , an Arkansas independent who plans to vote in the Democratic primary .
The poll found Clinton a heavy favorite among Democratic primary voters who value long experience in government and policy - making over an ability to bridge partisan divides .
But a majority of Democrats and independents who plan to vote in the party ’s nominating contests say a candidate ’s ability to bridge those divides is more important -- and those voters favor Obama .
Among Obama ’s other strengths : Younger voters prefer him to Clinton , and he runs well -- roughly even with Clinton -- among more affluent and more educated voters .

His supporters are also more inclined than Clinton ’s to view the Iraq war as the most important issue in the race .
“ We should have never gotten involved in it , ” said Kentucky nurse Frederick Cole , 52 , a Democrat .
Obama ’s opposition to the war before it started is part of what motivated Cole ’s support .
Beyond the top candidates , the poll found no evidence of a breakthrough by lesser - known Democrats : Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware gets 5 % ; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , 4 % ; Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio , 2 % ; and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , 1 % .
Narrowed to three choices , Clinton finishes first with 42 % , followed by Obama , 32 % , and Edwards , 20 % .

Good news for Giuliani
The hypothetical general - election matchups did not include Thompson , since he has not formally entered the race .
In many cases , the poll found that top Democrats and the top Republicans would be locked in close contests .
The notable exceptions include Giuliani defeating Clinton , 49 % to 39 % , and Romney losing by double digits to Obama or Edwards .
Also lopsided was Obama ’s margin over McCain : 47 % to 35 % .
Obama would defeat Giuliani , 46 % to 41 % , the poll found , and Edwards also ran ahead of the former mayor , 46 % to 43 % .

The poll of 1,056 registered voters was conducted by telephone Thursday through Sunday .
Republican - leaning voters totaled 408 ; Democratic ones numbered 449 .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for all voters , and plus or minus 5 points for voters in each primary .

Gordon Brown will place ' clear blue water ' between himself and Tony Blair when he lays out a vision for Britain - and how it should be governed - which will mark a dramatic departure from Labour 's last decade in power .
As the Prime Minister 's last band of supporters prepares to rally round the Chancellor , Brown spent the weekend finalising his pitch to the nation in which he will pledge to boost the role of Parliament , downgrade the status of political advisers and acknowledge the public 's anger the Iraq war .
With his coronation as Labour leader a certainty after winning the support of Charles Clarke , John Reid and John Hutton , the Chancellor is planning to signal a major break with the Blair era by letting it be known that he has little interest in using Chequers as a weekend retreat for his young family .
Unlike Blair , who spends as many weekends as possible at the Prime Minister 's official country residence in the Chilterns , Brown will return home to Scotland on Fridays and will mainly use Chequers for diplomatic meetings and brainstorming sessions with civil servants .
With the move on Chequers designed to show a change in style , Brown will signal a major change in substance by burying one of the most controversial aspects of Blair 's ' sofa style ' of government and scrapping a special law which gave unprecedented powers to political advisers - most notably the No 10 chief of staff Jonathan Powell and the former press secretary Alastair Campbell - to issue instructions to civil servants .
The move will mark a major breach with Blair who has been dogged by criticism that he politicised Whitehall by giving supporters senior roles normally held by impartial civil servants .
The Chancellor is expected to take special advisers with him into No 10 but the traditional demarcation lines separating them from career civil servants will return .
Lord Butler of Brockwell , the former cabinet secretary who approved the change to the Order in Council governing the conduct of special advisers , in 1997 last night welcomed the proposed change .
' I obviously think it is fine , ' Butler told The Observer .
' What Gordon Brown means is that he will not have special advisers in these positions , which would be great . '
The two - month Brown coronation will move a step closer today when the Blairite cabinet ministers , Reid and Hutton , follow the example of Clarke and announce they will throw their weight behind the chancellor .
The seven - week contest , in which either Michael Meacher or John McDonnell will try to mount a token challenge from the left , is expected to kick off on Thursday when Blair tells the cabinet he will stand down in early July .
Brown will formally announce his bid for the Labour leadership on Friday or Saturday ahead of the opening of nominations on Monday week .
At his leadership launch he will say that he has spent most of the past year listening to people 's concerns in a series of lengthy consultations .
This has convinced him that Labour can retain power at the next general election , but only if it neutralises a series of weak spots to show it understands voters ' deep dismay with the party after a decade in power .
When he does outline his plans in detail over the course of the seven - week campaign , he also will attempt to draw a line under sleaze by announcing changes to the way allegations of ministerial wrongdoing are judged .
Brown has held talks with Sir Alistair Graham , the outgoing standards watchdog , and Sir Philip Mawer , the parliamentary standards commissioner , to examine the ministerial code , the rule book for good behaviour .
' This is not about trashing Blair , ' one Brownite MP said .
' But it is about setting out a distinctive agenda . '
The builders of the bomb found in central London today would have probably been " keen amateurs " , an explosives expert said .
Patio gas cylinders found by police in the light green Mercedes would have been an unlikely weapon for experienced terrorists unless they wanted to create a fireball for the cameras , Sidney Alford , founder of explosives company Alford Technologies , told Guardian Unlimited .
As a readily available combustible material , the propane gas held in such cylinders might be considered by someone unable to source high explosives .
" If you are making a bomb and you are limited in the amount of explosives you can acquire you could easily get some gas cylinders of propane to add to them .
They would give a more impressive fireball on TV , " he said .
" They are probably keen amateurs who could not get their hands on the real thing and do not realise the limits of what they are doing . "
The Metropolitan police 's head of anti-terrorism , Peter Clarke , said there was also a " significant quantity " of petrol and nails in the car , as well as the gas .
A witness reported nails were lying on the floor of the car , which Mr Alford said was another indication the bomb makers were inexperienced .
" Nails could be considered as an additional way of extending the potential damage and lethal range of the device but putting them on the floor is an incompetent way of building a bomb .
They would go straight into the ground , " he said .
Mr Alford said that unless there were also explosives present the main impact of the device would be in the economic disruption caused by closing off the normally bustling shops , restaurants and businesses of central London .
" As the IRA knew , you do not need a real bomb to cause real havoc , " he said .
Police said the " potentially viable explosive device " was made safe .
Mr Clarke said that had it exploded there could have been " significant injuries or loss of life " .
Bomb disposal experts , Mr Alford said , may have used a water disruptor often delivered through a " pig stick " - similar to a gun barrel - to try and separate the components of the charge without triggering an explosion .
Water could be fired at near - supersonic speeds down the stick and its force would be enough to pierce metal and destroy the bomb , but without causing a spark .
It is believed to be unprecedented for gas canisters to be used for a bomb in the UK .
They have sometimes been used elsewhere in the world as bomb casings - opened up and packed with explosives - or used for firing mortars .
Police said they had yet to examine whether the cylinders contained patio gas as indicated on the label .
Michael Clarke , professor of defence at King 's College London , said whoever was behind the intended attack would have left a lot of evidence at the scene that would help police track them down .
He said security services would be concerned that the bomb may be part of a wider plot , and that there could be other devices planted around the capital .
" They will find out about this very quickly , " he said .
" Any car coming into central London would be on a lot of surveillance footage .
Also nobody can make a bomb without leaving behind a lot of DNA . "
Prof Clarke said it was almost certain the bomb was intended to detonate today .

Everyone knew what Bush was going to say before he made his address last night .
And the “ surge ” that Democrats hoped to block had already begun , with advance elements of the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad to arrange for arrivals of 17,500 more troops .
“ If we increase our support at this crucial moment , and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence , we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home , ” Bush said .
What Bush proposed was a straightforward pacification program in Baghdad , made possible by an intensified American occupation — a facade of Iraqis , to be sure , but with Americans running the show , just as GIs ended up running the show in a massive gun battle on Baghdad ’s Haifa Street Tuesday .
As Bush has said in the past , Americans know what the word victory means , So , whatever happens , and no matter what anyone says , America must win : “ Failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States . ”
As usual , observers are grasping wildly for an explanations as to why Bush is doing what he ’s doing .
No matter what one thinks of the President , when push comes to shove , it ’s hard to believe he really wants to drag out the war so it can be handed over to a successor in 2008 ; or that he is such a psycho he can’t stop referring to defeat as victory .
That ’s not the kind of stuff the Bush family legacy is made of .
There may well be a much more sinister game plan here , one that centers around the emergence of Henry Kissinger over the last year as an adviser to Bush and other top officials in Washington .
Gareth Porter , the historian who ran the Indochina Resource Center in the early 70s , points out in a January 11 article in Asia Online that “ although he knows very little about how to deal with Sunnis and Shi’ites , Kissinger does know how to convey to the public the illusion of victory , even though the U.S. position in the war is actually weak and unstable . ”
Porter continues , “ One of Kissinger ’s accomplishments was to sell the news media on the Nixon administration ’s propaganda line that the Christmas 1972 bombing of Hanoi had so unnerved the North Vietnamese that it had allowed president Richard Nixon and Kissinger to achieve a diplomatic victory over the communists in the Paris Agreement .
That line was a gross distortion of what actually happened before and after the bombing . ”
Moreover , it was Kissinger who figured out how Ford could claim a Vietnam victory and blame the whole mess on the Democrats .
So , it ’s quite possible that Bush will plunge into a counterinsurgency operation in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq , and then amidst mass civilian carnage , declare victory and announce negotiations — which sooner or later will have to happen .
But things may not work out that way , as the Haifa Street firefight Tuesday — in which American troops found themselves in the middle of an ongoing ethnic cleansing operation by Shia militias — made clear .
GIs call Haifa Street “ grenade alley . ”
As Juan Cole points out , Haifa Street has become a fixture of the civil war , twisting and turning in one pacification effort after another .
In July 2004 , U.S. commanders deployed 3,000 troops in a mini-surge called Operation Haifa Street .
A police station got blown up in a major bombing there .
In March 2005 , reports had things calming down a bit , and some said the tide had turned .
Today Haifa Street is once again considered a terrorist stronghold — thus the U.S. operation — but things are getting ever more complicated , with at least one report in Arabic claiming Shia invaded the area Sunday , killed residents , and threw their bodies into the street .
“ In this context , some Sunni Arabs see the U.S. as having been duped by the Shiites to join in the ethnic cleansing of the Karkh district , ” says Cole .
And now there are reports that Shia militias are worming their way into the Green Zone , a feat long attempted unsuccessfully by Sunni insurgents .
So is the Bush administration simply throwing in its lot with one set of death squads over another ?
It would n’t be the first time .

Seventy years since Stalin ’s year of terror
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the most terrible year in the history of the Soviet Union .
Having staged in August 1936 a political show trial in Moscow that provided a pseudo - judicial cover for the murder of Lev Kamenev , Grigory Zinoviev , Ivan Smirnov and other leaders of the October Revolution , Stalin launched in 1937 a campaign of terror whose goal was the destruction of all remnants of Marxist political thought and culture in the Soviet Union .
The terror targeted for extermination virtually everyone who had played a significant role in the October Revolution of 1917 , or who had at any point in their careers been identified with any form of Marxian and socialist opposition to the Stalinist regime , or were associated — either personally or through their comrades , friends and family — with a Marxian political , intellectual and cultural milieu .
Even after the passage of 70 years , the number of those murdered by the Stalinist regime in 1937 - 38 has not been conclusively established .
According to a recent analysis by Professor Michael Ellman of the University of Amsterdam , the “ best estimate that can currently be made of the number of repression deaths in 1937 - 38 is the range of 950,000 - 1.2 million , i.e. about a million .
This is the estimate which should be used by historians , teachers and journalists concerned with twentieth century Russian — and world — history . ” [ 1 ]
Ellman notes that the discovery of new evidence may at some point require a revision of this figure .
There now exists substantial archival evidence that provides a detailed picture of how Stalin and his henchmen in the Politburo and NKVD organized and carried out their campaign of mass murder .
The Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court played a central role in the process of judicially - sanctioned mass murder .
A total of 54 defendants were sentenced at the three public show trials in Moscow .
But there were tens of thousands of people who were tried behind closed doors by the Military Collegium and sentenced to death after “ trials ” that usually were completed within ten to fifteen minutes .
[ 2 ]
The victims were drawn from lists of individuals that had been prepared by the NKVD , along with a proposed sentence .
These were submitted for review by Stalin and the Politburo .
The names were those of “ leading Party , Soviet , Komsomol , Trade Union , Red Army and NKVD officials , as well as writers , artists and prominent representatives of economic institutions , who had been arrested by the same NKVD . ” [ 3 ]
Stalin and his Politburo reviewed these lists and , in almost all cases , approved the recommended sentences — mostly death by shooting .
There are 383 lists in the Presidential Archive in Moscow , submitted to Stalin between 27 February 1937 and 29 September 1938 , which contain the typed names of 44,500 people .
The signatures of Stalin and his colleagues , along with their penciled - in comments , are on these lists . [ 4 ]
The Military Collegium handed down 14,732 sentences in 1937 and another 24,435 in 1938 .
Stalin was the principal director of the terror and was deeply involved in its daily operations .
On just one day , 12 September 1938 , Stalin approved 3,167 death sentences for action by the Military Collegium . [ 5 ]
There exists a substantial amount of information on how the Military Collegium conducted its work .
Its secret trials were usually conducted at Moscow ’s Lefortovo prison .
The official mainly in charge of the process was the Collegium ’s President , Vasili Ul’rikh .
On a busy day , the Collegium could handle 30 or more cases .
It was often necessary to set up additional Collegium courts to deal with the crush of prisoners .
The usual procedure was to bring prisoners before the Collegium .
The charge was read to the accused , who was generally asked only to acknowledge the testimony that he had given during his earlier “ investigation . ”
Whether the defendant answered in the affirmative or negative , the trial was then declared to be over .
After hearing five such cases , the Collegium retired to consider its verdicts , which had already been decided and written down .
The defendants were then recalled to hear their fate — almost always death .
The sentences were generally carried out the same day . [ 6 ]
This was hard work for the Collegium members , and they required substantial nourishment to keep them going .
They retired to the deliberation room for their meals , which , according to the account of a Lefortovo prison official , consisted of “ various cold snacks , including different kinds of sausages , cheese , butter , black caviar , pastries , chocolate , fruits and fruit juice . ”
Ul ’rikh washed the food down with brandy . [ 7 ]
The Collegium members did not only hand down verdicts .
Frequently they attended and even carried out the executions that they had ordered .
Ul ’rikh occasionally returned home from his work with the blood of his victims on his greatcoat .
Moscow was not the only city in which the secret trials were held .
Parallel processes were conducted in cities throughout the USSR .
The terror did not subside until the Stalinist regime had murdered virtually all the representatives of the Marxist and socialist culture that had laid the intellectual foundations for the October Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union .
Soviet society was traumatized by the massive killing .
As the Russian Marxist historian Vadim Z. Rogovin wrote :
“ A wasteland of scorched earth was formed around the murdered leaders of Bolshevism , insofar as their wives , children and closest comrades were eliminated after them .
The fear evoked by the Stalinist terror left its mark on the consciousness and behavior of several generations of Soviet people ; for many it eradicated the readiness , desire and ability to engage in honest ideological thought .
At the same time , the executioners and informers from Stalin ’s time continued to thrive ; they had secured their own well - being and the prosperity of their children through active participation in frame - ups , expulsion , torture , and so forth . ” [ 8 ]
Stalin ’s crimes were justified on the basis of grotesque lies , which portrayed the Marxist opponents and victims of the bureaucratic - totalitarian regime — above all , Leon Trotsky — as saboteurs , terrorists and agents of various imperialist and fascist powers .
But the lies that formed the basis of the show trial indictments of Trotsky and other Old Bolsheviks had been prepared over the previous 15 years , that is , dating back to the anti-Trotsky campaign initiated in 1922 by Stalin and his self - destructive allies , Kamenev and Zinoviev .
As Trotsky explained in the aftermath of the first two Moscow Trials — the proceeding of August 1936 was followed by the second show trial in January 1937 — the origins of the judicial frame - up were to be found in the falsification of the historical record that had been required by the political struggle against “ Trotskyism ” — that is , against the political opposition to the bureaucratic regime headed by Stalin .
“ It remains an incontestable historical fact , ” Trotsky wrote in March 1937 , “ that the preparation of the bloody judicial frame - ups had its inception in the ‘ minor ’ historical distortions and ‘ innocent ’ falsification of citations . ” [ 9 ]
No one who has studied the origins of the Stalinist terror and grappled seriously with its consequences is inclined to underestimate the politically reactionary and socially destructive implications of historical falsification .
We know from the example of the Soviet Union that the political process that first manifested itself as the falsification of the history of the Russian revolution eventually metastasized into the mass extermination of Russian revolutionaries .
Before Stalin entered into history as one of its worst murderers , he had already burnished his reputation as its greatest liar .
Trotsky not only exposed the lies of Stalin ; he also explained the objective roots and function of the regime ’s vast system of political and social duplicity :
“ Thousands of writers , historians and economists in the USSR write by command what they do not believe .
Professors in universities and school teachers are compelled to change written textbooks in a hurry in order to accommodate themselves to the successive stage of the official lie .
The spirit of the Inquisition thoroughly impregnating the atmosphere of the country feeds ... from profound social sources .
To justify their privileges the ruling caste perverts the theory which has as its aim the elimination of all privileges .
The lie serves , therefore , as the fundamental ideological cement of the bureaucracy .
The more irreconcilable becomes the contradiction between the bureaucracy and the people , all the ruder becomes the lie , all the more brazenly is it converted into criminal falsification and judicial frame - up .
Whoever has not understood this inner dialectic of the Stalinist régime will likewise fail to understand the Moscow trials . ” [ 10 ]
It may appear , in retrospect , astonishing that so many people who considered themselves on the left were prepared to justify , and even actually believe , the accusations hurled by Vyshinsky , the Stalinist prosecutor , against the Old Bolshevik defendants at the Moscow Trials .
A substantial section of liberal and leftist public opinion accepted the legitimacy of the Moscow Trials and , in this way , lent its support to the terror that was raging in the USSR .
The Stalinist regime — whatever its crimes within the USSR — was seen , at least until the Non-Aggression Pact with Hitler in August 1939 , as a political ally against Nazi Germany .
Pragmatic considerations , rooted in the social outlook of the petty - bourgeois “ friends of the USSR , ” underlay the pro-Stalin apologetics of large sections of “ left ” public opinion .
Even the refutation of key elements of the indictments was ignored by Stalin ’s apologists .
[ 11 ]
The work of the Dewey Commission , which took its name from the American liberal philosopher who served as chairman of the 1937 Inquiry into the Soviet charges against Leon Trotsky , stood in noble opposition to the cynical , dishonest and reactionary attitudes that prevailed in the circles of left public opinion , especially in Britain , France and the United States .
The exposure of Stalinism
Nearly two decades were to pass before the edifice of Stalinist lies erected at the Moscow trials began to crumble .
The decisive event in this process was the “ secret ” speech given by Khrushchev in February 1956 , before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , in which the criminal character of Stalin ’s terror was acknowledged for the first time .
But this exposure was preceded by significant developments in the field of historical research that contributed immeasurably to a factually accurate and more profound understanding of the history of the Soviet Union and to the role of Leon Trotsky .
The first major event in the historical rehabilitation of Trotsky was the publication of E. H. Carr ’s monumental history of Soviet Russia , and especially its fourth volume , entitled The Interregnum .
This volume , making extensive use of official Soviet documents available in the West , provided a detailed account of the political struggles that erupted inside the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party in 1923 - 24 .
Carr was not politically sympathetic to Trotsky .
But he brilliantly summarized and analyzed the complex issues of program , policy and principle with which Trotsky grappled in a difficult and critical period of Soviet history .
Carr ’s account made clear that Trotsky became the target of an unprincipled attack that was , in its initial stages , motivated by his rivals ’ subjective considerations of personal power .
While Carr found much to criticize in Trotsky ’s response to the provocations of Stalin , Zinoviev and Kamenev , the historian left no doubt that he viewed Trotsky as , alongside of Lenin , the towering figure of the Bolshevik Revolution .
In “ many spheres ” of revolutionary political activity , Carr maintained in a later volume , Trotsky “ outshone ” even Lenin .
As for Stalin , Carr wrote that Trotsky “ eclipsed ” him “ in almost all . ”
But the decline in revolutionary fervor inside the USSR , ever more noticeable after 1922 , affected Trotsky ’s political fortunes .
“ Trotsky was a hero of the revolution , ” wrote Carr .
“ He fell when the heroic age was over . ” [ 12 ]
The second major event in the study of Soviet history was the publication of Isaac Deutscher ’s magisterial biographical trilogy :
The Prophet Armed , The Prophet Unarmed , and The Prophet Outcast .
April 2007 marked the centenary of Deutscher ’s birth ; and it is appropriate to pay tribute to his achievement as a historian and biographer .
Even though I speak as one who disagrees profoundly with many of Deutscher ’s political judgments — particularly as they relate to Trotsky ’s decision to found the Fourth International ( which Deutscher opposed ) — it is difficult to overestimate the impact of Deutscher ’s Prophet .
He was not being immodest when he compared his own work to that of Thomas Carlyle who , as the biographer of another revolutionary , Oliver Cromwell , “ had to drag out the Lord Protector from under a mountain of dead dogs , a huge load of calumny and oblivion . ” [ 13 ]
Deutscher proudly cited a British critic , who wrote that the first volume of the trilogy , The Prophet Armed , “ undoes three decades of Stalinist denigration . ” [ 14 ]
In addition to the work of Carr and Deutscher , a new generation of historians made , in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s , significant contributions to our understanding of the Russian revolution , the origins and development of the Soviet Union , and its leading personalities .
Leopold Haimson , Samuel Baron , Robert Daniels , Alexander Rabinowitch , Robert Tucker , Moshe Lewin , Marcel Liebman , Richard Day and Baruch Knei-Paz come immediately to mind .
To recognize the value of their work and to appreciate their scholarship does not , and need not , imply agreement with their judgments and conclusions .
The enduring significance of their collective efforts , and those of others whom I have not named , is that they contributed to the refutation of the lies , distortions and half - truths in which the history of the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union had been enshrouded for so many decades .
And not only falsifications of the Soviet government , but also the stultifying anti-Marxist propaganda of the US government in the era of the Cold War .
To have some sense of the impact of these historians ’ work on the intellectual climate of their times , permit me to cite several passages from the text of a study of Trotsky ’s life that was published in 1973 as part of the well - known “ Great Lives Observed ” series .
This series — published by Prentice - Hall , the long - established distributor of academic textbooks — was a mainstay of university history courses in the 1960s and 1970s .
Thousands of students taking courses in Russian or modern European history would have been introduced to the figure of Leon Trotsky through this volume , and this is what they would have read in its very first paragraph :
“ With the passage of time historical figures either shrink or grow in stature .
In the case of Leon Trotsky time , after a brief eclipse , has increased his image so that he appears today , for good or evil , as one of the giants of the first half of the twentieth century .
The renewed interest in Trotsky ’s life is reflected by the numerous studies which are beginning to appear , and by the sudden availability of almost all his writings .
For many of the New Left generation he has reclaimed both the prestige and the mantle of the revolutionary leader . ” [ 15 ]
The introduction provided , on the basis of the findings of contemporary scholars , a concise assessment of Trotsky ’s revolutionary career .
“ The argument supporting Trotsky ’s claim to importance , ” it stated , “ rests on his contribution to political theory , his literary legacy , and above all his role as a man of action . ”
As a theorist , Trotsky ’s analysis of Russian social forces and his elaboration of the theory of permanent revolution “ suggests that as a Marxist thinker he could , on the power of his creativity , go beyond the formulations of Marx and Engels . ”
Trotsky , therefore , deserved to be placed within the “ brilliant coterie of Marxist theorists such as Plekhanov , Kautsky , Luxemburg , and , for that matter , Lenin himself . ”
As a literary figure , Trotsky stood above even these great Marxists .
“ Magnificent word play , scathing sarcasm , and brilliant character sketches are the hallmarks of his writing .
To read Trotsky is to observe the literary artist at work . ”
And then there were Trotsky ’s achievements as a man of action .
The introduction noted “ Trotsky ’s role in Russian revolutionary history is second only to Lenin ’s , ” and his “ decisive leadership in the Military Revolutionary Committee that paved the way for the October insurrection ... ”
It also called attention to Trotsky ’s “ determined efforts to build the Red Army in the face of enormous obstacles ... ” [ 16 ]
None of these achievements was known to the mass of Soviet citizens .
There existed no honest account of Trotsky ’s life and work within the USSR because “ Soviet historians have long since abandoned the responsibility of historical writing and have busied themselves with the grotesque efforts to create a new demonology . ”
Within the Soviet Union , Trotsky remained “ an abstraction of evil — a militating force against the future of the Soviet people . ” [ 17 ]
But outside the USSR , the situation was different :
“ Soviet demonology , absurd from its inception , has been largely vanquished , at least in the Western world .
Part
Three of this book contains selections of relatively recent writers on the problem of Trotsky .
The best examples of this more objective scholarship are Edward Hallett Carr ’s multi-volume study , The Bolshevik Revolution , and Isaac Deutscher ’s painstaking three - volume study of Trotsky .
The historical debate may be never ending , but in the light of these more recent studies Trotsky ’s role in the Russian experience can be seen in a new and positive perspective .
In the West , the miasmic cloud has disappeared ; the demonic hierarchy has been exorcized .
We can now come to grips with the material forces and issues which motivated and inspired the action and deeds of Leon Trotsky . ” [ 18 ]
I have quoted extensively from this text because it provides a clear summary of what the general student studying history at the college level would have been told about Leon Trotsky some 35 years ago . [ 19 ]
When one turns to the texts that are now being presented to students , it becomes immediately apparent that we are living in a very different — and far less healthy — intellectual environment .
But before I may do so , it is necessary to examine , if only briefly , the treatment of Trotsky in Soviet historical literature in the aftermath of the 20th Congress and Khrushchev ’s “ secret speech . ”
Soviet history after the 20th Congress
The official exposure of Stalin ’s crimes in 1956 placed the Kremlin bureaucracy and its many apologists on the defensive .
The party - line version of history had been for nearly two decades Stalin ’s own Short Course of the History of the CPSU .
From the moment Khrushchev ascended the podium of the Twentieth Party Congress , this compendium of incredible lies , soaked in human blood , lost all credibility .
But with what could it be replaced ?
To this question the Stalinist bureaucracy never found a viable answer .
Every important question relating to the history of the Russian revolutionary movement — the events of 1917 , the Civil War , the early years of the Soviet state , the inner-party conflicts of the 1920s , the growth of the Soviet bureaucracy , the relation of the Soviet Union to international revolutionary movements and struggles , industrialization , collectivization , Soviet cultural policy , and the Stalinist terror — posed unavoidably the issue of Lev Davidovitch Trotsky .
Every criticism of Stalin raised the question , “ Was Trotsky right ? ”
The historical , political , theoretical and moral issues that flowed from the exposure of Stalin ’s crimes and the catastrophic impact of his policies and personality on every aspect of Soviet society could not be dealt with by simply removing Stalin from his glass - encased mausoleum alongside Lenin and reburying his corpse under the wall of the Kremlin .
Isaac Deutscher had nourished the hope — a hope that reflected the limitations of his political outlook — that the Stalinist bureaucracy would finally , at long last , find some way to come to terms with history and make its peace with Leon Trotsky .
It proved a vain hope .
To deal honestly with Trotsky would have required , at some point , that his writings be made available .
But notwithstanding the passage of decades , Trotsky ’s exposure and denunciations of the Stalinist regime remained as explosive in their revolutionary potential as they had been during his own lifetime .
After Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and unveiled his policy of glasnost , there was a great deal of public discussion about the official rehabilitation of Trotsky .
As the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution approached , it was widely anticipated that Gorbachev would take this opportunity to acknowledge Trotsky ’s role in the leadership of the October Revolution and his struggle against Stalin .
But the very opposite occurred .
On November 2 , 1987 , speaking in a televised address to a national audience , Gorbachev again denounced Trotsky in traditional Stalinist terms .
Trotsky , he said , was “ an excessively self - assured politician who always vacillated and cheated . ” [ 20 ]
By the time Gorbachev delivered his shameful speech , interest in Trotsky and the struggle of the Left Opposition against Stalinism was developing rapidly in the Soviet Union .
Soviet journals that published , for the first time since the 1920s , documents relating to Trotsky , such as Argumenti i Fakti , enjoyed a massive increase in their circulation .
Trotskyists from Europe , Australia and the United States traveled to the Soviet Union and delivered lectures that were widely attended .
Gorbachev ’s speech was clearly an attempt to respond to this changed situation , but it proved utterly unsuccessful .
The old Stalinist lies — denying Trotsky ’s role in the October Revolution , portraying him as an enemy of the Soviet Union — had lost all credibility .
Within little more than four years after Gorbachev ’s speech , the Soviet Union had ceased to exist .
Trotsky ’s warning that the Stalinist bureaucracy , unless overthrown by the working class , would ultimately destroy the Soviet Union and clear the way for the restoration of capitalism was vindicated .
The study of Trotsky after the fall of the USSR
The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 raised with new urgency the issue of the historical role of Leon Trotsky .
After all , the Soviet implosion demanded an explanation .
Amidst the bourgeois triumphalism that attended the dissolution of the USSR — which , by the way , not a single major bourgeois political leader had foreseen — the answer seemed obvious .
The Soviet collapse of December 1991 flowed organically from the October 1917 Revolution .
This theory , based on the assumption that a non-capitalist form of human society was simply impossible , found its way into several books published in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse , of which the late Professor Martin Malia ’s The Soviet Tragedy was the most significant example .
However , books of this sort evaded the problem of historical alternatives ; that is , were the policies pursued by Stalin and his successors the only options available to the USSR ?
Had the Soviet Union pursued different policies at various points in its 74 - year history , might that have produced a significantly different historical outcome ?
To put the matter as succinctly as possible : Was there an alternative to Stalinism ?
I am not posing this as an abstract hypothetical counterfactual .
Did there exist a socialist opposition to Stalinism ?
Did this opposition propose serious and substantial alternatives in terms of policy and program ?
The answers to such crucial questions demand a serious reengagement with the ideas of Leon Trotsky and the oppositional movement that he led within the USSR and internationally .
This , however , has not happened .
Rather than building upon the achievements of earlier generations of scholars and drawing upon the vast new archival resources that have become available over the past 15 years , the dominant tendency in the historiography of the Soviet Union has been in a very different direction .
The years since the fall of the USSR have seen the emergence of what can best be described as The Post - Soviet School of Historical Falsification .
The principal objective of this school is to discredit Leon Trotsky as a significant historical figure , to deny that he represented an alternative to Stalinism , or that his political legacy contains anything relevant in the present and valuable for the future .
Every historian is entitled to his or her viewpoint .
But these viewpoints must be grounded in a serious , honest and principled attitude toward the assembling of facts and the presentation of historical evidence .
It is this essential quality , however , that is deplorably absent in two new biographies of Leon Trotsky , one by Professor Geoffrey Swain of the University of Glasgow and the other by Professor Ian D. Thatcher of Brunel University in West London .
These works have been brought out by large and influential publishing houses .
Swain ’s biography has been published by Longman ; Thatcher ’s by Routledge .
Their treatment of the life of Leon Trotsky is without the slightest scholarly merit .
Both works make limited use of Trotsky ’s own writings , offering few substantial citations and even ignoring major books , essays and political statements .
Despite their publishers ’ claims that the biographies are based on significant original research , there is no indication that either Swain or Thatcher made use of the major archival collections of Trotsky ’s papers held at Harvard and Stanford Universities .
Well - established facts relating to Trotsky ’s life are , without credible evidentiary foundation , “ called into question ” or dismissed as “ myths , ” to use the authors ’ favorite phrases .
While belittling and even mocking Trotsky , Swain and Thatcher repeatedly attempt to lend credibility and legitimacy to Stalin , frequently defending the latter against Trotsky ’s criticism and finding grounds to justify the attacks on Trotsky and the Left Opposition .
In many cases , their own criticisms of Trotsky are recycled versions of old Stalinist falsifications .
The formats of the Swain and Thatcher biographies are similar in design and page length , and are clearly directed toward a student audience .
The authors know , of course , that the books will be the first acquaintance with Trotsky for most of their readers ; and they have crafted these two books in a manner calculated to disabuse readers of any further interest in their subject .
As Professor Swain proclaims with evident satisfaction in the first paragraph of his volume , “ Readers of this biography will not find their way to Trotskyism . ” [ 21 ]
Nor , he might have added , will they derive any understanding of Trotsky ’s ideas , the principles for which he fought , and his place in the history of the twentieth century .
The “ myth ” of Trotsky
Both biographies proclaim that they challenge , undermine and even disprove “ myths ” about Trotsky ’s life and work .
In a brief foreword to the Thatcher biography , the publisher asserts that “ Key myths about Trotsky ’s heroic work as a revolutionary , especially in Russia ’s first revolution in 1905 and the Russian Civil War , are thrown into question . ” [ 22 ]
Swain asserts that in his book “ a rather different picture of Trotsky emerges to that traditionally drawn , more of the man and less of the myth . ” [ 23 ]
What “ myths ” are they setting out to dispel ?
Significantly , both authors denounce the work of Isaac Deutscher , whom they hold responsible for creating the heroic historical persona that prevails to this day .
Thatcher asserts condescendingly that Deutscher ’s trilogy reads like “ a boy ’s own adventure story , ” a characteristic which “ gives an indication of the attractions , as well as the weaknesses , of Deutscher ’s tomes . ”
Thatcher implies that Deutscher ’s biography is a dubious exercise in hero - worship , which “ abounds with instances in which Trotsky saw further and deeper than those around him . ”
With evident sarcasm , Thatcher suggests that Deutscher credited Trotsky with an improbably long list of political , practical and intellectual achievements .
He accuses Deutscher of indulging in improper “ invention ” and of “ diversions into fiction . ”
These flaws , writes
Thatcher , “ do detract from the work ’s status as a history , and as historians we must approach Deutscher both critically and with caution . ” [ 24 ]
In fact , all historical works — even masterpieces of the genre — must be read critically .
But Thatcher denigrates Deutscher ’s work not for its weaknesses , but for its greatest strength — its masterly restoration of Trotsky ’s revolutionary persona .
As for the specific example used by Thatcher to support his claim of invention and diversions into fiction , he provides what turns out to be an incomplete citation from The Prophet Armed .
When read in its entirety , Deutscher ’s use of analogy to recreate the mood that prevailed within the Bolshevik leadership at a time of intense crisis — the conflict over the Brest Litovsk treaty in February 1918 — may be appreciated as an example of the author ’s extraordinary literary skills and psychological insight . [ 25 ]
The significance of the two authors ’ antipathy toward Deutscher ’s trilogy emerges quite clearly in Swain ’s biography .
He writes accusingly that “ Deutscher went along with , and indeed helped to foster the Trotsky myth , the idea that he was ‘ the best Bolshevik ’ : together Lenin and Trotsky carried out the October Revolution and , with Lenin ’s support , Trotsky consistently challenged Stalin from the end of 1922 onwards to save the revolution from its bureaucratic degeneration ; in this version of events Trotsky was Lenin ’s heir . ” [ 26 ]
A “ myth , ” as defined by Webster , is “ an unfounded or false notion . ”
But all the items listed by Swain as elements of the Deutscher - propagated “ Trotsky myth ” are grounded in facts supported by documentary evidence that has been cited by numerous historians over the past half - century .
While Swain implies that Deutscher was involved in a conspiracy against historical truth ( he “ went along with , and indeed helped foster the Trotsky myth ” ) , his real aim is to discredit historical work — that of Deutscher and many others — that shattered decades of Stalinist falsification .
Well - established historical facts relating to Trotsky ’s life are subjected to the literary equivalent of a drumhead court - martial and declared to be mere “ myths . ”
No evidence of a factual character that is capable of withstanding serious scrutiny is produced to support the summary verdict pronounced by Swain and Thatcher .
The aim of their exercise in pseudo - biography is to restore the historical position of Trotsky to where it stood before the works of Deutscher and , for that matter , E.H.
Carr were published — that is , to the darkest period of the Stalin School of Falsification .
The appeal to authority
Let us now examine the method the two professors employ to discredit well - established historical facts .
One of Swain ’s and Thatcher ’s favorite techniques is to make an outrageous and provocative statement about Trotsky , which flies in the face of what is known to be factually true , and then support it by citing the work of another author .
Their readers are not provided with new facts that support Swain ’s and Thatcher ’s assertion .
Rather , they are simply told that the statement is based on the work of some other historian .
Thus , Swain announces that he has “ drawn heavily on the work of other scholars .
Ian Thatcher has rediscovered the pre-1917 Trotsky as well as showing clearly how unreliable Trotsky ’s own writings can be .
James
White has completely reassessed the Lenin and Trotsky relationship in 1917 , showing that the two men ’s visions of insurrection were entirely different .
Eric van Ree demolished the notion that Trotsky was Lenin ’s heir .
Richard Day , writing more than 30 years ago , argued convincingly that Trotsky , far from being an internationalist , believed firmly in the possibility of building socialism in one country .
More controversially , Nikolai Valentinov suggested nearly 50 years ago that in 1925 , far from opposing Stalin , Trotsky was in alliance with him ; although Valentinov ’s suggestion of a pact sealed at a secret meeting has not stood the test of time , other evidence confirms a period of testy collaboration . ” [ 27 ]
Presented here is what is known in logic as an appeal to authority .
However , such an appeal is valid only to the extent of the authority ’s credibility .
In this particular instance , the argument is not settled simply by citing Thatcher , White , van Ree , Day and Valentinov .
We must know more about them , their work , and the evidence upon which they based their conclusions .
And we must also know whether they actually held the position being attributed to them .
As we shall see , the last question is particularly important , for when dealing with the work of Professors Swain and Thatcher , absolutely nothing can be taken for granted .
In regard to Swain ’s reference to Professor James White of the University of Glasgow , the latter hardly qualifies — for anyone familiar with his work — as a historian whose judgments on the subject of Trotsky can be accepted as authoritative , or , for that matter , even credible . [ 28 ]
As for van Ree , who is also one of Thatcher ’s favorite sources , his work as a historian must certainly be approached with caution , if not a face mask .
As an ex-Maoist who is now a passionate anti-Communist , he recently offered , in a book entitled World Revolution : The Communist Movement from Marx to Kim il - Jong , the following assessment of Lenin and Trotsky :
“ Yet all things considered they too were rogues , leaders of gangs of political thugs .
They enjoyed prosecuting civil war .
They proclaimed the Red Terror because they imagined themselves to be actors in a fantastic historical drama .
They had the privilege of being allowed to repeat the performance at which Maximilien de Robespierre failed , and they were determined that this time round no one would be left alive who could possibly turn their fortunes against them .
Lenin and Trotsky took pride in the fact that they did not care a jot about democracy or human rights .
They enjoyed the exercise of their own brutality . ” [ 29 ]
Aside from their overheated character , none of these statements could be cited as an example of sober historical judgment .
Professor van Ree is evidently a very angry man with quite a few political chips on his shoulder .
He is not qualified to render decisive judgment on the nature of the Lenin - Trotsky relationship .
However , I should note that according to the account given by van Ree in the above cited work , Lenin and Trotsky were partners in crime who shared the same criminal world view .
Holding that view , how could van Ree “ demolish the notion that Trotsky was Lenin ’s heir ” ?
Moreover , in a discussion of the relationship between Lenin and Trotsky , the word “ heir ” has a political rather than legal connotation .
Whether or not Trotsky should be considered Lenin ’s “ heir ” is precisely the sort of question over which historians will probably argue for decades to come .
It is not likely to be settled in one essay , even one written by a scholar of substantially greater skill , knowledge , insight and judgment than Mr. van Ree .
For Swain to assert that van Ree “ demolished the notion that Trotsky was Lenin ’s heir ” proves only that Swain has not thought through with sufficient care the complex historical , political , social and theoretical issues that arise in any serious study of the Lenin - Trotsky relationship .
Let us now consider Swain ’s invocation of Professor Richard Day to substantiate his own provocative thesis that Trotsky , “ far from being an internationalist , firmly believed in the possibility of building socialism in one country . ”
I must confess that I rubbed my eyes in amazement upon seeing Professor Day cited as an authority for such an outlandish statement .
In contrast to the gentlemen to whom I have already referred , Professor Day is an outstanding and respected historian who for many decades has carried out serious work on the struggles within the Soviet government during the 1920s over economic policy .
In particular , he has subjected the work of E. A. Preobrazhensky to serious analysis and shed light on significant differences that existed within the Left Opposition on important problems of economic theory and policy .
Swain ’s reference to Day contains both distortion and falsification .
In the work cited by Swain , Leon Trotsky and the Politics of Economic Isolation , Day employs certain formulations suggesting that Trotsky did not reject the possibility of socialism in one country , but opposed the conception that this could be achieved , as Stalin proposed , on an autarchic basis .
Moreover , Day ’s discussion of Trotsky ’s position on “ socialism in one country ” must be read in the context of the book ’s presentation of the debate over Soviet economic policy .
Swain , however , seizes on several ambiguous phrases employed by Day in the opening pages of his book , and proceeds to misrepresent the central analytical line of Leon Trotsky and the Politics of Economic Isolation .
Whatever the limitations of Day ’s argument , there is absolutely nothing in his book that supports Swain ’s claim that Trotsky was not an internationalist . [ 30 ]
This is a blatant falsification of the argument presented in Leon Trotsky and the Politics of Economic Isolation . [ 31 ]
I will not waste my time refuting the reference to Valentinov , an old Menshevik and bitter opponent of Trotsky .
Swain does not even bother to provide us with an actual quote from Valentinov .
No evidence whatever is offered to substantiate this claim .
As for Valentinov ’s tale of “ a pact sealed at a secret meeting , ” Swain himself acknowledges that it “ has not stood the test of time . ”
In other words , it was a fabrication .
But why , then , does Swain even bring it up ?
Rhetorical internationalism
Swain ’s use of sources whom he acknowledges to be unreliable is characteristic of his cynical attitude to the historical record .
He has no compunction about making statements that contradict everything that is known and documented about Trotsky life .
He tells us that “ Trotsky believed in world revolution , but no more and no less than every other Bolshevik , and like all other Bolsheviks this belief was largely rhetorical . ” [ 32 ]
In other words , there was , according to Swain , no difference in the place that the perspective of world revolution played in the lifework of Leon Trotsky from that which it played in the thoughts and activities of Molotov , Voroshilov , and Stalin !
How does one even begin to answer an absurdity of this magnitude ?
Readers are to believe that the political conceptions that governed Trotsky ’s political activity over a period of nearly 40 years , and which found expression in countless speeches and thousands of pages of written documents , represented nothing more than external posturing , devoid of serious intellectual , emotional and moral substance .
Everything was merely a political subterfuge , a cover for what were essentially nationalist preoccupations related to the factional power struggle that Trotsky was conducting in the Soviet Union .
As Swain writes :
“ His critique of the failed German Revolution in 1923 was simply camouflage for an attack on his then domestic opponents Zinoviev and Kamenev .
It was the same with his writings on the British General Strike , although here his opponents were Bukharin and Stalin .
As for his enthusiasm for China in 1927 , that too was essentially domestic in focus ...
It was only in emigration , in 1933 , when he had buried the concept of Thermidor , that Trotsky explored the idea of how the revival of the working class movement in Europe might have a beneficial impact on the Soviet Union and halt the degeneration of the workers ’ state .
Then internationalism became central to his cause . ” [ 33 ]
Swain evidently assumes that his student readership will be totally ignorant of the events and issues under discussion .
He produces no evidence of a factual character to back his conclusion .
Nor does he attempt to support his argument on the basis of an analysis of Trotsky ’s writings .
This glaring omission reflects his general disinterest in Trotsky as a writer .
Swain makes a point of telling his readers that his biography makes no reference to the “ great ” work by Professor Baruch Knei-Paz , The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky .
Swain acknowledges that this may come as a surprise to Trotsky scholars .
But he defends his omission by arguing that Knei -Paz attributed greater importance to Trotsky ’s writings than they merit : “ Knei -Paz collects together Trotsky ’s writings under certain themes , bringing together earlier and later essays into a coherent exposition ; this exposition makes Trotsky a far greater thinker than he was in reality .
Trotsky wrote an enormous amount and as a journalist , he was happy to write on subjects about which he knew very little . ” [ 34 ]
When a historian delivers such an unqualified judgment , it is to be expected that he will proceed to substantiate his claim .
Swain should have supported it by pointing to specific essays or articles in which Trotsky showed himself to be ignorant of the subject matter with which he was dealing .
Swain fails to present a single citation to support his argument .
Instead , he continues in the same vein : “ Trotsky could write beautifully , but he was no philosopher . ” [ 35 ]
In fact , Trotsky never claimed to be one .
But this did not prevent him from grasping more profoundly and precisely the social , political and economic realities of the age in which he lived than the philosophers of his generation .
Who better understood the nature of twentieth century imperialism and fascism : Martin Heidegger , who ostentatiously proclaimed his allegiance to Hitler , or Trotsky ?
Who had deeper and clearer insights into the bankruptcy of Fabian reformism in Britain : Bertrand Russell or Trotsky ? [ 36 ]
A more honest and capable historian might have included in an analysis of Trotsky ’s stature as a writer the following extract from the diaries of the great German literary critic , Walter Benjamin : “ June 3 , 1931 ...
The previous evening , a discussion with Brecht , Brentano , and Hesse in the Café du Centre .
The conversation turned to Trotsky ; Brecht maintained there were good reasons for thinking that Trotsky was the greatest living European writer . ” [ 37 ]
One can only imagine what Swain might have contributed to this conversation had he been present at the Café du Centre .
“ Well perhaps , Bertolt .
But Trotsky is no philosopher ! ”
As one works through the entire biography , one cannot help but be amazed by the indifference that Swain displays toward Trotsky ’s writings .
Many of his most important works are barely mentioned , or even totally ignored .
Though he acknowledges Trotsky ’s decisive role in the victory of the Red Army in the Civil War , Swain ignores his important writings on military theory .
This is a significant omission , because many of the political and theoretical differences that arose between Trotsky and the Stalinist faction in later years were anticipated in the earlier conflicts over military policy . [ 38 ]
There is no reference to Trotsky ’s extraordinary manifestos and speeches prepared for the first four Congresses of the Communist International ( 1919 - 1922 ) .
He makes no mention of Trotsky ’s far - sighted analysis of the emergence of American imperialism to a position of world domination and its evolving relationship with a declining and dependent Europe .
This does not prevent Swain from proclaiming pompously that Trotsky “ had absolutely no understanding of European politics . ” [ 39 ]
One might just as well write that Einstein had no understanding of physics !
Such ludicrous statements are written for only one purpose : to fill the minds of students who are unfamiliar with Trotsky ’s life and the historical period in which he lived with intellectually disorienting absurdities .
Swain ’s effort to convert Trotsky into an enthusiastic partisan of the Stalinist program of “ socialism in one country ” amounts to a grotesque distortion and outright falsification of his actual views .
Swain attributes to Lenin the authorship of this conception , noting that Stalin ’s lecture in which the new program was introduced invoked a quotation from an article Lenin had written in 1915 .
He fails to explain that Stalin ripped this quote out of context , and conveniently ignored the innumerable statements by Lenin emphatically linking the fate of socialism in Russia to the world revolution .
More seriously , whether from ignorance , sheer incomprehension or design , Swain falsifies the views of Leon Trotsky .
Referring to the 1925 series of articles by Trotsky published under the title , Towards Socialism or Capitalism ? , Swain asserts that its logic “ was clear .
Socialism in one country could work if the correct economic policy was followed and state industrial investment gradually accelerated . ” [ 40 ]
If one identifies the possibility of initiating socialist construction within the USSR ( which Trotsky advocated and encouraged ) with the long - term viability of a Soviet form of nationalism ( which Trotsky emphatically rejected ) , the theoretical content and political implications of the debate over economic policy are rendered incomprehensible .
Even in Towards Socialism or Capitalism ? , written in 1925 when he was still working through the implications of the nationalist shift in the theoretical basis of Soviet economic policy , Trotsky explicitly warned that the long - term survival of world capitalism meant that “ socialism in a backward country would be confronted with great dangers . ” [ 41 ]
In September 1926 he declared that “ The Opposition is profoundly convinced in the victory of socialism in our country not because our country can be torn free of the world economy but because the victory of the proletarian revolution is guaranteed the world over . ” [ 42 ]
In other words , socialism could be built in Russia if the working class conquered power in revolutionary struggles beyond its borders .
Trotsky ’s speech to the Fifteenth Conference on November 1 , 1926 was a comprehensive attack on the perspective of national socialism . [ 43 ]
Swain , of course , ignores this and other crucial texts that must be examined in order to deal correctly with the issue of “ socialism in one country . ”
Swain on 1923
Swain ’s treatment of the crucial opening round of Trotsky ’s struggle against the degeneration of the Soviet Communist Party is little more than a defense of the emerging Stalinist faction against Trotsky ’s criticisms .
Especially significant is Swain ’s condemnation of a letter and series of articles written by Trotsky in early December 1923 under the title , The New Course .
Swain writes :
“ In the programmatic essay The New Course , written on 8 December and published after some haggling in Pravda on 11 December 1923 , Trotsky denounced the increasingly bureaucratic leadership of the Party , asserting that the old , established leadership was in conflict with a younger generation .
In one of those exaggerated parallels he loved , he compared the situation among the Bolshevik leaders with the time in the history of the German Social Democratic Party when the once radical allies of Marx and Engels slipped almost imperceptibly into a new role as the fathers of reformism .
It was a nice image , but Kamenev , Stalin and Zinoviev were hardly going to relish the implication that only Trotsky was the true revolutionary and that they were mere reformists .
“ In writing The New Course , Trotsky not only insulted his Politburo colleagues but , in Bolshevik terms , he gave them the moral high ground .
He had reached an agreement and then broken it .
He had done the same with Lenin at the height of the Brest Litovsk crisis .
During the Trade Union Debate he had joined the Zinoviev Commission only to declare he would take no part in its work .
The resolution against factionalism adopted at the Tenth Party Congress had been aimed specifically at preventing this sort of behavior .
Whether or not Trotsky ’s behavior had verged on factionalism in autumn 1923 could be open to interpretation , but The New Course was factionalist beyond doubt .
He had signed up to a compromise , and then broken with it , challenging the revolutionary credentials of his Politburo comrades in the process . ” [ 44 ]
What Swain offers here is not an objective account of the political origins , issues and events related to the conflict that erupted inside the Soviet Communist Party , but rather his own highly partisan defense of those who were the objects of Trotsky ’s criticisms .
Swain ’s angry references to Trotsky ’s behavior during the Brest Litovsk crisis in 1918 and the trade union conflict in 1920 read as if they were copied from the texts of Stalin ’s own speeches .
Swain tells us that Kamenev , Zinoviev and Stalin “ were hardly going to relish ” Trotsky ’s criticisms , as if that somehow invalidates what Trotsky wrote in The New Course .
It is peculiar , to say the least , for a historian writing in 2006 to upbraid Trotsky for having engaged in “ factionalist ” behavior in launching what was to become one of the epochal political conflicts of the twentieth century .
Swain , enjoying the benefit of hindsight , knows how all of this was to eventually turn out .
The suppression of inner-party democracy , against which Trotsky raised his protest , was ultimately to grow into a murderous totalitarian dictatorship that carried out mass murder .
And while Trotsky ’s criticisms may have bruised the egos of Kamenev and Zinoviev , the two Old Bolsheviks suffered a far more terrible fate at the hands of Stalin 13 years later .
Moreover , for Swain to chastise Trotsky ’s warning of the danger of political degeneration of the older generation of Bolshevik leaders as “ exaggerated ” is nothing less than incredible .
As history was to demonstrate all too tragically , Trotsky ’s invocation of the example of the German Social Democratic leaders was , if anything , an underestimation of the dimensions of the tragedy that awaited the Bolshevik Party .
As for the specific charge that the writing of The New Course was inappropriate and factional behavior , it is not based on an honest reading of the historical record .
Swain conveniently fails to note that the Politburo was dominated by a secret faction formed by Stalin , Zinoviev and Kamenev , which was grounded not on programmatic agreement , but rather on a shared determination to undermine Trotsky ’s political influence .
Thus , Trotsky was working inside a Politburo whose deliberations were tainted by ex parte agreements worked out behind the scenes by Stalin , Zinoviev and Kamenev .
Moreover , as E. H. Carr explained quite cogently in 1954 , Trotsky ’s letter of December 8 — part of the set of documents known as The New Course — was of an entirely principled character .
“ The letter took the form of a commentary on the resolution of 5 December : it was an exposition of what Trotsky assumed the resolution to mean and a rebuttal of any other potential interpretations .
It was not , as was afterwards pretended , a deliberate attack on the agreed text or on other members of the Politburo and of the central committee .
The views were those which Trotsky , as he naively believed , had persuaded or compelled his colleagues to share .
All that the letter did was , in Trotsky ’s intention , to dot the i’s and cross the t’s of the resolution and to register his victory . ” [ 45 ]
Carr also explains that the triumvirate and Trotsky had approached the drafting of the December 5 , 1923 resolution on party reform with very different aims and criteria .
For Stalin , Kamenev and Zinoviev , the actual content of the resolution was of secondary or even tertiary significance .
Their interest in arriving at an agreement with Trotsky was based on purely tactical considerations , related to the struggle for power .
With opposition spreading to the increasingly bureaucratic and high - handed methods of the leadership , the triumvirs were seeking to prevent , or at least delay , Trotsky ’s open break with the central committee leadership .
For Trotsky , in contrast , the resolution raised matters of high principle .
Carr noted the difference between Trotsky and his opponents .
“ Trotsky , accustomed to see differences within the party fought out and settled through the drafting of party resolutions , attached to a victory on paper a practical value which , in the new conditions of party leadership , it no longer possessed . ” [ 46 ]
Carr ’s assessment is endorsed by historian Robert V. Daniels in his influential The Conscience of the Revolution .
Explaining the sequence of events that led to the writing of The New Course , Daniels writes : “ Trotsky , aware of the hostility toward him that was barely concealed behind the resolution , undertook to stress the reform implications in an open letter to a party meeting on December 8 .
The New Course letter was an enthusiastic endorsement and explanation of the resolution of December 5 , with emphasis on the role of the party rank - and - file in its execution ... ” [ 47 ]
Entirely absent from Swain ’s account is an analysis of the objective processes that underlay the deepening political conflict .
Swain offers virtually no assessment of the changes that were taking place under the impact of the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) within the Soviet Union and their reflection within the Party .
He provides no political or intellectual portraits of Trotsky ’s opponents .
He does not examine the changing composition of the Bolshevik Party , or examine the phenomenon of bureaucratism that was to have such catastrophic consequences for the fate of the Bolshevik Party and Soviet society .
Swain ’s treatment of Trotsky ’s final exile
Swain devotes just 25 pages to the last 12 years of Trotsky ’s life .
To describe his treatment of those years as superficial would be a compliment .
The most catastrophic event in post - World War I European history , the accession of Hitler and his Nazi party to power in Germany , barely receives a mention .
Swain takes no note of the relationship between this event and the most important political decisions made by Trotsky during his final exile — his call for a political revolution in the USSR and for the founding of the Fourth International .
After briefly noting that Trotsky , upon arriving in Prinkipo in 1929 following his expulsion from the USSR , called on his supporters to remain inside the Communist International , Swain writes : “ By 1933 he had changed his mind ... ” [ 48 ]
No reference is made to the cataclysmic event that produced this change in policy — the accession of Hitler to power as a result of the betrayal of the Communist International and its German party .
Swain makes no assessment of Trotsky ’s writings on the German crisis .
One has only to compare Swain ’s near silence on the subject to E.H.
Carr ’s treatment of Trotsky ’s efforts to rouse the German working class against the fascist threat .
In his last work , The Twilight of the Comintern , Carr considered Trotsky ’s writings on the German crisis of 1931 - 33 to be of such importance that he included an appendix devoted to this subject .
“ Trotsky , ” he wrote , “ maintained during the period of Hitler ’s rise to power so persistent and , for the most part , so prescient a commentary on the course of events in Germany as to deserve record . ” [ 49 ]
Similarly the Moscow Trials and the ensuing purges are assigned a few sentences , substantially less than Swain devotes to Trotsky ’s brief personal relationship with Frida Kahlo in Mexico .
The writing of Trotsky ’s most important political treatise , The Revolution Betrayed , is noted in one sentence .
Trotsky ’s passionate essays on the Spanish Revolution , warning that the popular front policies of the Stalinists were clearing the path for a Franco victory , go unmentioned .
The Transitional Program , the founding document of the Fourth International , is not referred to .
Swain also ignores the last great polemical documents written by Trotsky on the nature of the USSR .
Finally , Swain concludes his biography with the observation that Trotsky might have done better had he quit politics after the 1917 October Revolution and devoted himself entirely to journalism , in which , presumably , Trotsky would have been able — as Swain has already told us — “ to write on subjects about which he knew very little . ”
The method of Ian Thatcher
I have already made brief reference to the method of Ian Thatcher .
Let us return to this subject by reviewing three paragraphs that appear in the introduction to Thatcher ’s biography of Trotsky .
“ From Trotsky ’s account of 1917 only he emerges with honor .
If in 1924 one accepted the arguments of ‘ Lessons of October , ’ then only one man could replace the now dead Lenin , namely Leon Trotsky .
It is perfectly understandable , then , that having been accused of the sins of Menshevism in 1917 , Trotsky ’s colleagues sought to refute his ‘ Lessons of October . ’
This they did in a series of speeches and articles , which were then gathered together and published in Russian and in translation in book form .
“ Leading Bolsheviks ( including Kamenev , Stalin , Zinoviev and Bukharin ) and key representatives from the Communist International ( the Comintern ) and the Communist Youth League ( the Komsomol ) argued that Trotsky ’s essay was not a genuine history of the October Revolution .
If one consulted the key documents of the time and a growing supply of memoir literature , for example , Trotsky ’s detractors claimed one would discover how far his memory had painted a distorted picture .
Most notably , Trotsky had minimized the roles played by Lenin and the Bolshevik Party and had exaggerated his own contribution .
It was , for example , wrong to claim that in 1917 there was a long and sustained battle between a Lenin seeking to rearm the party with Trotsky ’s theory of permanent revolution and a right - Menshevik faction within Bolshevik ranks .
In actual fact Lenin ’s analysis of the events of 1917 grew out of a long - held theory of the Russian Revolution .
Once Lenin had convinced colleagues of the correctness of his developing strategy , neither Lenin nor the party was in any way influenced by Trotsky or Trotskyism .
“ Indeed , the anti-Trotsky case continues , the whole history of Leninism and Bolshevism before and after 1917 was one of opposition to Trotskyism .
Unfortunately , Trotsky had failed to realize that he was only effective in 1917 because he acted under the guidance of the Bolshevik Party .
He had not made a full commitment to becoming a Bolshevik .
If he had , then he would have produced a very different history .
Trotsky would , for example , have admitted his past and recent theoretical , as well as organizational , errors .
Only in this way would youth understand the proper relationship between Leninism and Trotskyism , and how to avoid the sins of the latter .
‘ Lessons of October ’ was an attempt by Trotsky to replace Leninism with Trotskyism .
This , however , the Bolshevik Party would not allow him to achieve .
The leadership understood the dangers of Trotskyism , revealed in Trotsky ’s underestimation of the peasantry , and in his mistaken policies during the peace negotiations with Germany , in the debate over trade unions and on the issue of currency reform . ” [ 50 ]
The significance of these paragraphs is that they exemplify a highly - contrived stylistic technique repeatedly employed by Thatcher in order to mask his falsification of history — that is , his construction of a seemingly objective historical narrative out of the factional statements of Trotsky ’s mortal political enemies .
Virtually everything written in the above - cited three paragraphs is a lie .
The “ criticisms ” of Trotsky have been drawn together by Thatcher from a series of mendacious attacks written by Stalin , Zinoviev and Kamenev in November and December 1924 in order to discredit Trotsky ’s brilliant analysis of the political differences and struggles within the Bolshevik Party during the critical year of the Revolution .
Trotsky ’s Lessons of October explored events and controversies that Zinoviev , Kamenev and Stalin — whose right - wing and conciliatory policies had placed them in opposition to Lenin at various points in 1917 — did not wish to have aired .
Stalin and Kamenev had allied themselves with the Mensheviks in March 1917 , prior to Lenin ’s return to Russia .
In October 1917 , Kamenev and Zinoviev had opposed the insurrection .
Furthermore , the role of Trotsky in securing the victory of the Bolsheviks in October 1917 was rivaled only by that played by Lenin himself .
The arguments presented in the above - cited paragraphs were fabricated in order to deflect the impact of Trotsky ’s criticisms in Lessons of October as well as to destroy his reputation as a revolutionary leader .
As the historian Robert V. Daniels has written , the charges made against Trotsky in response to Lessons of October “ were either entirely fabricated or exaggerated beyond all measure — it was the man that the offended leaders were bent on destroying , not doctrinal error . ” [ 51 ]
Thatcher , however , neither explains the context of the attack on Trotsky nor challenges its factual validity .
He adopts a pose of studied even - handedness in his presentation of lies and fabrications .
The “ anti-Trotsky case ” — Thatcher ’s euphemism for the bureaucracy ’s gigantic slander campaign — is endowed with reasonableness , dignity and legitimacy .
In effect , Thatcher offers the pages of his biography as a dumping ground for the political and historical falsifications upon which the emerging Soviet bureaucracy built its struggle against Trotsky .
This insidious and dishonest technique , in which old lies are repackaged as objective historical narrative , is employed repeatedly by Thatcher .
The “ myth ” of 1905
Like Swain ,
Thatcher promises to expose “ key myths ” about Trotsky ’s life , such as his role in the 1905 Revolution .
Let us examine how Professor Thatcher goes about his work .
Given the fact that Trotsky ’s crucial role in the 1905 Revolution has been universally accepted by scholars throughout the world , one would imagine that Thatcher would recognize that a challenge to this scholarly consensus required a careful marshalling of new facts and arguments .
As it turns out , despite the attention called to this very issue by the publisher ’s introduction ( which is also cited on the back cover of the volume ) , Thatcher ’s “ demythologizing ” of Trotsky ’s role in 1905 takes up no more than one relatively brief paragraph .
He begins by writing that “ It is difficult to gauge the exact influence that Trotsky had upon the course of the 1905 Revolution . ”
Yes , it may be difficult to determine the exact influence , but there exists a substantial body of information that permits certain informed judgments about the degree and scale of his influence .
Numerous memoirs from the period testify to his commanding political presence .
Trotsky became the chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet , and edited two newspapers , Russkaya Gazeta and Nachalo , which enjoyed large circulations .
As if anticipating the latter objection , Thatcher claims that “ We have no way of knowing how many people were affected by his journalism . ” [ 52 ]
Again , this is not true .
In an article that appeared under his by - line in History Review in September 2005 , Thatcher himself acknowledges that the circulation of these two newspapers may have been as high as 100,000 , which was at least 20,000 higher than those of their rivals . [ 53 ]
Then ,
Thatcher abruptly introduces a new line of argument , which is irrelevant to the issue of Trotsky ’s political influence in the 1905 Revolution .
“ It is unlikely , ” writes Thatcher , “ that his words reached many peasants .
He simply lacked connections with the villages , and there was not a mass distribution of his appeals to the peasantry . ” [ 54 ]
This is really beside the point .
The influence of Trotsky and the Russian Social Democratic movement as a whole in 1905 arose on the basis of the mass urban proletarian constituency .
The St. Petersburg Soviet was a political organ of the working class .
It arose on a wave of revolutionary working class activity that included the mass general strike of October 1905 .
The peasantry joined the unrest en masse only in 1906 , in the aftermath of the physical suppression of the socialist - led working class movement .
Thatcher continues : “ Even in the capital , his main stomping ground , he did not create or found any specific institute or faction .
He was not , for example , the guiding force behind the emergence of the Soviet of Workers Deputies , even though he may subsequently have been , as one participant records , ‘ the unchallenged leader of the Mensheviks in the Petersburg Soviet ’ [ emphasis DN ] . ” [ 55 ]
Like the issue of the peasantry , the question of Trotsky ’s factional affiliations is tossed in by Thatcher for no other reason than to try to build a case against the established historical record .
At that point in the history of the Russian Social - Democratic movement , factional identities were far more fluid than they were to become by 1917 .
Indeed , Trotsky ’s political position was actually strengthened by his relative independence from the main political factions .
Let us note
Thatcher ’s awkward formulation : Trotsky “ may subsequently have been ” the unchallenged leader of the Mensheviks in the Soviet .
Only “ may have been ? ”
Thatcher presents no evidence to the contrary , even though one can safely assume he would have trumpeted it had he been able to find it .
However , he proceeds to make a novel argument .
“ In the memoirs of the prime minister of the day , Count Witte , Trotsky does not merit a mention ... this only confirms the limited impression Trotsky made at the time on the popular consciousness . ” [ 56 ]
This is the argument of a sly trickster , not of a conscientious scholar .
Count Witte , the tsar ’s prime minister , failed to mention Trotsky in his memoirs .
This single detail is endowed by Thatcher with extraordinary historical significance .
From the failure of Witte to mention Trotsky , Thatcher claims we can draw far - ranging conclusions about Trotsky ’s place in popular consciousness in the autumn of 1905 .
One must ask , why has Thatcher made no reference to other memoirs , written by individuals who were more familiar than Count Witte , an aged aristocrat who was most at home in palaces and vast leafy estates , with what was happening in the workers ’ districts of St. Petersburg ?
It is characteristic of unscrupulous and bad scholarship to conceal or disregard historical evidence that runs counter to one ’s argument .
But this is precisely what Thatcher has done .
For example , he should have brought to the attention of his student readers the recollections of Anatoly Lunacharsky , who was a participant in the 1905 Revolution as a member of the Bolshevik faction .
In his renowned Revolutionary Silhouettes , Lunacharsky provided this estimate of Trotsky ’s role in 1905 :
“ His popularity among the Petersburg proletariat at the time of his arrest was tremendous and increased still more as a result of his picturesque and heroic behavior in court .
I must say that of all the social - democratic leaders of 1905 - 06 Trotsky undoubtedly showed himself , despite his youth , to be the best prepared .
Less than any of them did he bear the stamp of a certain kind of émigré narrowness of outlook which , as I have said , even affected Lenin at that time .
Trotsky understood better than all the others what it meant to conduct the political struggle on a broad , national scale .
He emerged from the revolution having acquired an enormous degree of popularity , whereas neither Lenin nor Martov had effectively gained any at all .
Plekhanov had lost a great deal , thanks to his display of quasi -Kadet tendencies .
Trotsky stood then in the very front rank . ” [ 57 ]
Lunacharsky also recalled an incident during which Trotsky was praised , in the presence of Lenin , as the strong man of the St. Petersburg Soviet .
This was a time of factional conflict between Lenin and Trotsky , and so the former did not necessarily enjoy hearing of his rival ’s political triumph .
According to Lunacharsky , “ Lenin ’s face darkened for a moment , then he said : ‘ Well , Trotsky has earned it by his brilliant and unflagging work . ” [ 58 ]
Thatcher also chose not to mention another contemporary memoir — that of the Menshevik leader Theodore Dan — which leaves no question about the immense political influence of Leon Trotsky in 1905 .
The political perspective with which Trotsky was now associated — the recognition of the proletarian and socialist character of the revolution — captured the imagination of substantial forces among both the Bolshevik and Menshevik tendencies .
Dan recalled “ that practically speaking both Mensheviks and Bolsheviks were pushed toward ‘ Trotskyism . ’
For a short time ‘ Trotskyism ’ ( which at that time , to be sure , still lacked a name ) , for the first and last time in the history of Russian Social - Democracy , became its unifying platform .
Hence it was no accident also that after the arrest ( in November ) of Khrustalyov , the chairman of the Petersburg Soviet of Workers ’ Deputies , it was precisely Trotsky ... who became his natural heir , challenged by no one — for the few short days the Soviet itself still had to live . ” [ 59 ]
Thatcher ’s failure to cite important eyewitness sources that contradict and disprove his attempt to call into question Trotsky ’s role in the 1905 Revolution , discredits not only his biography but places his integrity as a historian under a shadow .
I must stress that his improper handling of this particular issue , i.e. , Trotsky ’s role in 1905 , is not an isolated episode .
It is emblematic of the method he employs throughout his biography to discredit Trotsky .
Thatcher ’s falsification of the inner-party struggle
Thatcher ’s treatment of the political struggle that arose within the Russian Communist Party in the early 1920s is a travesty of scholarly writing .
As in the introduction , Thatcher incorporates the arguments of Trotsky ’s factional opponents into what he attempts to palm off as an objective presentation of historical events .
For example , in a crucial section of the biography that deals with the eruption of the inner-party struggle in October 1923 , Thatcher writes that Trotsky “ took up his anti-bureaucracy program with his usual urgency and passion , believing that the party was entering a new epoch through which only his methods would ensure a safe passage [ emphasis DN ] . ” [ 60 ]
Thatcher continues , “ His colleagues on the party ’s leading bodies were , however , not convinced .
They doubted whether matters were really as bad as Trotsky depicted .
Yes , there were economic problems , but these were quite expected .
In any case there was no imminent danger of collapse .
The party anticipated several years of hard and steady work before it could claim to have fully rectified the economy .
Looking at the party , Trotsky ’s comrades claimed that they could congratulate themselves on educating a new generation of cadres .
The influx of this fresh blood would no doubt expedite the resolution of important tasks .
Having rejected Trotsky ’s analysis of imagined ills besetting the regime , a majority of the old Bolsheviks wondered whether he could be trusted to develop sound and sensible policies .
If Trotsky was prone to exaggeration of difficulties , he was , they argued , remarkably vague in his solutions .
For a majority of the Politburo , Trotsky was part of a problem , not an answer .
For example , if he was concerned by an absence of systematic leadership why did he not attend important meetings of the Council of Labour and Defense and of the Cabinet ?
There was little evidence of conscientiousness in Trotsky ’s work habits .
Furthermore , there was a marked absence of concrete proposals from Trotsky .
This was hardly surprising , since his policy record was far from promising .
In recent times Trotsky had suffered a series of defeats as he opposed Lenin over , amongst other matters , the Brest - Litovsk peace and the trade unions .
For his colleagues , Trotsky ’s discontents were not rooted in reality , but in a hurt sense of pride stemming from personal disappointments .
Thus , Trotsky could not have been pleased when , in April 1923 , the Twelfth Congress shelved his more militant approach to religious affairs .
In September 1923 , Trotsky was certainly upset by personnel changes to the Military - Revolutionary Committee .
Finally , and most annoying of all for Trotsky , came the Central Committee ’s refusal to grant him dictatorial powers .
Trotsky was warned that his unfounded criticisms were encouraging anti-party platforms , sowing unnecessary disruption to important party work , and threatening a war between older and younger generations . ” [ 61 ]
This passage , as written by Thatcher , creates the impression that the majority on the Politburo — euphemistically referred to as “ Trotsky ’s comrades ” — was responding to Trotsky ’s criticism in a manner that was both restrained and reasonable .
It was confronted , in the person of Trotsky , with something of a loose cannon , with whom it was hard , if not impossible , to work .
He pestered his “ colleagues ” with exaggerated warnings and unreasonable demands , while failing to carry out the assignments for which he was responsible .
Moreover , Trotsky had a poor grasp of reality and a history of stirring up trouble , even with Lenin ; was motivated by subjective bitterness , and , worst of all , was demanding dictatorial powers .
Thatcher ’s presentation clearly invites his students to form a negative opinion of Trotsky and his political work .
What Thatcher has not communicated to his readers is that the above - quoted passage is his own tendentious rephrasing of an unscrupulous and dishonest factional document produced by Trotsky ’s bitter political opponents — soporifically referred to by Thatcher as “ comrades ” and “ colleagues ” — on October 19 , 1923 , in response to Trotsky ’s important letter of October 8 , 1923 and the famous oppositional Letter of the 46 of October 15 , 1923 .
There are no quotation marks and no footnotes .
There is no clear indication given by Thatcher that the arguments he so benignly summarizes were , in fact , a pack of factionally - motivated lies and half - truths . [ 62 ]
Nor does
Thatcher inform his readers that Trotsky prepared a withering response to this letter , dispatched on October 23 , 1923 , in which the accusations of Zinoviev , Kamenev and Stalin ( who had formed an unprincipled anti-Trotsky faction known as the Triumvirs ) were refuted .
One has only to consult E. H. Carr ’s The Interregnum , in which this material is reviewed ( or at least that part of it that had come to light by the early 1950s ) , to recognize the deliberately misleading character of Thatcher ’s approach .
Carr cites passages from Trotsky ’s “ stinging retort ” to the Triumvirs , and leaves no doubt as to where truth lay in this exchange . [ 63 ]
Trotsky ’s speech at the 13th Congress
One of Deutscher ’s great achievements as a biographer was his portrayal of the heroism and pathos of Trotsky ’s struggle , under increasingly difficult circumstances , against the immense and reactionary bureaucracy arrayed against him .
Thatcher , determined to erase the historical record , employs rhetorical tricks , incompatible with serious scholarship , to belittle Trotsky ’s struggle and portray it in a demeaning and unflattering light .
Once again I must call attention to his deceptive use of citations .
Thatcher refers to Trotsky ’s main speech at the Thirteenth Party Congress in May 1924 , and writes , “ It was , it has been argued , ‘ the most inept speech of his career . ’ ” [ 64 ]
Who , one wonders , was the original author of this damning judgment ?
Was it written , perhaps , by a participant at the Congress , either an opponent or supporter of Trotsky ?
As it turns out , the source is to be found in a volume , published by the University of Toronto Press in 1974 , of Resolutions and Decisions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union .
This volume includes a set of documents from the Thirteenth Congress , which is briefly introduced by Professor Richard Gregor , the volume ’s editor .
Gregor writes that Trotsky “ made what may well be the most inept speech of his career . ” [ 65 ]
He offers no argument in support of this appraisal , and the speech itself is not reproduced .
Furthermore , Gregor is hardly a historian to whom one turns for a well - considered and unbiased judgment of Soviet politics . [ 66 ]
Other than serving the utilitarian purpose of belittling Trotsky , there is no compelling reason why Gregor ’s passing remark about the speech to the Thirteenth Congress should have been cited as if it were an authoritative judgment .
Let us further examine Thatcher ’s use of Trotsky ’s Thirteenth Congress speech , which concluded with the well - known and oft - cited phrase , “ Right or wrong this is my party , and I will take responsibility for its decision to the end . ”
Thatcher himself quotes several sentences from Trotsky ’s speech , including the sentence cited above .
He then writes , “ Trotsky could thus have no grounds for complaint when the Thirteenth Congress affirmed the anti-Trotsky resolution of the Thirteenth Conference . ” [ 67 ]
It all seems rather straightforward .
Trotsky said , my party right or wrong , so how could he object when it passes a resolution directed against him ?
But Thatcher has withheld from his readers those passages that show Trotsky ’s speech to be far more subtle and combative than the citation , as provided in Thatcher ’s text , indicates .
Trotsky states emphatically his disagreement with the resolution , and asserts his responsibility to argue against those policies he considers incorrect . [ 68 ]
By presenting a bowdlerized citation , Thatcher misrepresents Trotsky ’s position and legitimizes the actions taken against him by his opponents .
Thatcher falsifies the Lenin - Trotsky relationship
Thatcher asserts that “ Lenin ’s relationship with Trotsky was highly problematic . ”
He contends that in Lenin ’s political Testament of December 1922 “ Trotsky was not given a recommendation higher than any other comrade . ”
This is not true .
While expressing reservations over Trotsky ’s “ excessive self - assurance ” and “ excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of work , ” Lenin said he was “ distinguished by his outstanding ability ” and “ personally perhaps the most capable man in the present C.C. [ Central Committee ] ... ” [ 69 ]
The same Testament warned against Stalin ’s accumulation of “ unlimited authority concentrated in his hands ... ” [ 70 ]
Lenin ’s famous addendum to his Testament , which Thatcher fails to mention , urged the Central Committee to remove Stalin from the position of general secretary . [ 71 ]
Thatcher then writes : “ Lenin was unlikely to have given his seal of approval to Trotsky for the post of leader because , even in 1922 - 23 when he relied upon the Commissar of War to present some of his views , he remained suspicious of him .
Lenin ’s biographer has emphasized that he would have dropped Trotsky at the next available opportunity [ emphasis DN ] . ” [ 72 ]
This is a deliberately misleading and false presentation .
Numerous historical studies have established , based on a well - documented record , that the last months of Lenin ’s life were dominated by his growing suspicion of and hostility to Stalin .
Lenin ’s increasing distrust of Stalin was expressed in several documents that he wrote in the months and weeks before his career - ending stroke in March 1923 .
During the same period , Lenin drew ever closer to Trotsky , whom he viewed as his most important ally in the developing struggle against Stalin .
But let us concede that the political developments in the critical period between December 1922 and March 1923 allow for varied interpretations .
That still leaves us with Thatcher ’s reference to the alleged finding of “ Lenin ’s biographer ” that Lenin , had he lived , “ would have dropped Trotsky at the next available opportunity . ”
The biographer cited in the relevant footnote is Robert Service , author of a three - volume study of Lenin .
This is not the place for an evaluation of the qualities of Mr. Service ’s biography , of which I do not have a high opinion .
But the issue here concerns
Thatcher ’s use of citations .
Turning to page 273 - 74 of the Service biography ( as indicated in the footnote ) , there is no reference to a plan by Lenin to get rid of Trotsky .
In fact , Service offers an entirely different assessment of Lenin ’s plans .
While in the past , according to Service , Lenin had used Stalin to control Trotsky , “ the disputes with Stalin over policies on foreign trade and other matters reversed the situation : Trotsky was needed in order to control the ever more rampant Stalin . ”
Despite his past conflicts with Trotsky , “ The October Revolution and the Civil War had brought them together , and Lenin was inviting Trotsky to resume close collaboration . ” [ 73 ]
A few pages later , Service comments further on Lenin ’s view of Trotsky and Stalin : “ Of the two men , he had come to prefer Trotsky despite his reservations .
This was obvious in Lenin ’s recent letters seeking an alliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way .
In late December [ 1922 ] , too , Lenin asked Krupskaya to confide the message to Trotsky that his feelings towards him since Trotsky had escaped from Siberia to London in 1902 had not changed and would not change ‘ until death itself . ’ ” [ 74 ]
Once again , we see that Thatcher , in the interest of his own campaign to discredit Trotsky , has attributed to another historian a statement he has not made .
Historians , like everyone else , are fallible .
They make mistakes .
Not every incorrect citation is proof of professional incompetence , let alone of a secret plan to distort and falsify .
When one comes across such errors it is necessary to maintain a sense of proportion .
But the problem that presents itself in the Thatcher biography is not a series of isolated mistakes but a system of distortion and falsification .
Thatcher ’s presentation is designed to create among readers — especially students — not only a false image of Trotsky , but also a disoriented and distorted conception of an entire historical epoch .
What finds expression in the biographies written by Thatcher and Swain is a process that may be legitimately described as the erosion of historical truth .
The historical image of Trotsky as a great revolutionary fighter and thinker that emerged out of the exposure of Stalin ’s lies and crimes — that is , out of the discrediting of the pervasive anti-Trotsky demonology that was pumped out of the Soviet Union ( and , for that matter , all of Eastern Europe and China ) and sustained by countless academics affiliated with Stalinist parties all over the world — is once again under attack .
A sort of anti-historical intellectual counter - revolution is in progress , to which Thatcher and Swain are making their own disreputable contributions .
Only in this way can we understand their zeal in attempting to belittle Trotsky , in even making him appear ridiculous .
Problems of Everyday Life
Let us , for example , examine Thatcher ’s treatment of Trotsky ’s remarkable essays published under the title Problems of Everyday Life .
Thatcher strains to present Trotsky as an effete snob , who “ was far from impressed with the general mores of Russian society .
He viewed the mass of Russians as uncultured .
He described them as illiterate , inefficient , dirty , unpunctual , prone to swearing and abusive language , and under the sway of superstition . ” [ 75 ]
Presented in this way , the reader is clearly encouraged to view Trotsky as an elitist , distant and remote from the great mass of the Russian people .
This intended image is reinforced by Thatcher ’s sarcastic remark that “ one can not help thinking that his ideal human type consisted of his own habits writ large .
His advice is littered with its own brand of simplification . ” [ 76 ]
Thatcher ’s summary is a spiteful and dishonest caricature of Trotsky ’s writings on Problems of Everyday Life .
What is portrayed by Thatcher as an example of Trotsky ’s self - aggrandizing conceit , an immodest tribute to his own special qualities , is , when properly and knowledgeably viewed in the context of the history of the Russian revolutionary movement , one of the finest and most deeply felt elucidations of the relationship between culture , the development of proletarian class consciousness and the struggle for socialism .
Presented by Thatcher as an irritating laundry list of Trotsky ’s personal objections to the Russian workers , the characteristics that are cited — illiterate , inefficient , prone to swearing , etc. — were all manifestations of the terrible oppression suffered by the masses in Tsarist Russia .
They were part of what generations of the best elements in the democratic and socialist intelligentsia often described as “ our terrible Russian reality . ”
Their struggle against the shameful expressions of human degradation eventually found a profound response in the working class . [ 77 ]
When these writings are read as contributions to the development of class consciousness and kul ’turnost , it is possible to appreciate the broader dimensions and ramifications of the issues raised by Trotsky in his Problems of Everyday Life , and of the significance of his essays such as “ The Struggle for Cultured Speech ” and “ Civility and politeness as a necessary lubricant in daily relations . ”
Interestingly , as Professor S. A. Smith points out , “ the struggle for cultured speech faded from the political agenda ” in the late 1920s , after Stalin secured his grip on power . [ 78 ]
It is only necessary to add that much of what Trotsky writes in these articles is not only of historical interest , let alone merely relevant to a Russian audience .
As we today confront our own terrible reality , where culture is under relentless attack and every form of social backwardness spawned and encouraged , Problems of Everyday Life remains a book for our times .
At certain points in his biography , Thatcher descends to levels that can only be described as utterly absurd .
He declares that “ One can even claim that Trotsky was as dismissive of his female compatriots as any other egocentric male . ” [ 79 ]
He offers as proof a passage from a librarian ’s memoir , which recalled that Trotsky ’s wife apparently went to borrow a journal on his behalf .
And so , writes
Thatcher , “ we discover Trotsky using his wife as a ( unpaid ? ) secretary ... ” [ 80 ]
Thatcher also berates
Trotsky for failing , as he had advised in one of his essays , “ to view reality through a woman ’s eyes very seriously . ”
What evidence does Thatcher present to support this reprimand ?
“ Certainly he did not advocate a female candidate to replace Lenin ; nor did he produce the promised fuller account of what he thought a woman ’s perspective on the world might be . ” [ 81 ]
How does one begin to reply to such criticisms ? [ 82 ]
Thatcher on the impossibility of revolution
There are two persistent and interrelated arguments
Thatcher makes repeatedly in his biography : 1 ) There is no reason to believe that either Russian or European history would have developed any differently had Trotsky defeated Stalin ; and 2 ) Trotsky ’s criticisms of Stalin were , on the whole , unfair .
Dealing with economic policy , Thatcher states , “ Of course , even if by some miracle Trotsky had been able to grasp the reins of power , there are many reasons to doubt whether he would have enjoyed the sorts of policy successes his program promised .
One can question , for example , whether a Soviet economy managed by Trotsky could have provided industrial expansion and improved living standards . ” [ 83 ]
Yes , “ one can question ” anything .
But the issue is not whether one can determine , to the point of certainty , the success of the program of the Left Opposition .
Certainty is not attainable , nor is that the issue .
The real question is : did the Left Opposition demonstrate significantly greater understanding of the problems of the Soviet economy than the Stalinist leadership , and did the Left Opposition exhibit far greater foresight than the bureaucracy in anticipating problems and proposing ameliorative action before disaster struck ?
To these two critical questions , we can reply unambiguously in the affirmative .
On this basis , we can then ask whether — based on a more timely response to looming dangers and the avoidance of their worst consequences — it is reasonable to believe that the Soviet economy would have achieved greater successes and with far fewer human sacrifices .
Here , too , the answer is clearly yes .
Thatcher never explores the issues in this way .
He makes no reference to the detailed program produced by the Left Opposition in 1927 .
Instead , we are left with a peculiar form of fatalism that translates into a historical apology for Stalin and Stalinism .
Thatcher takes this same approach to every important issue of international revolutionary policy .
Turning to the disastrous defeat of the Chinese Revolution in 1927 , in which Stalin ’s subordination of the Chinese Communist Party to the bourgeois Kuomintang of Chiang Kai - shek played a major role , Thatcher asserts that “ even had the CCP abandoned the Kuomintang in 1926 , there is no evidence to suggest that it could have enjoyed any greater success in 1927 . ” [ 84 ]
What “ evidence ” has Thatcher assessed ?
Where did he conduct research into the events of 1925 - 27 ?
There is a rich body of political and historical literature , a significant amount of which was produced by Chinese revolutionaries , analyzing the catastrophic consequences of Stalin ’s policies in the period of 1925 - 27 .
There is no evidence that Thatcher is in the least familiar with this literature .
It is a historical fact that Chiang Kai - shek ’s massacre of Shanghai workers in April 1927 was facilitated by the failure of the Communist Party to take defensive measures that might have either forestalled the attack , or at least allowed the cadre to beat it back .
The passivity of the CCP was dictated by Stalin ’s insistence that the Chinese Communists avoid antagonizing Chiang and the bourgeois Kuomintang .
For nearly a year , Trotsky and the Left Opposition warned of the suicidal dangers arising from such a policy .
To claim that even if their warnings had been acted upon in a timely manner they would have made no difference is to elevate hopelessness to the status of an immutable historical condition , at least as far as socialist revolution is concerned .
On the question of Germany , Thatcher argues along the same lines .
“ There is a certain attraction to Trotsky ’s account of KPD blunders and the possibility that had the German communists adopted a different course Hitler ’s triumph could have been avoided , ” Thatcher writes .
“ The support such a case has received in subsequent studies is hardly surprising .
After all , who does not wish that the National Socialist German Workers Party ( NSDAP ) had never taken power ?
One can still question , however , whether history would have been so different had Trotsky had a greater influence on events .
...
Trotsky overestimated the power of the workers and underestimated the strength of fascism .
It is possible that Hitler would have risen to power even over a coalition of communists and social democrats .
... A change in KPD policies as demanded by Trotsky might have been insufficient to keep the NSDAP from government . ” [ 85 ]
The critical role played by the catastrophic policies of the two main working class parties — the SPD and KPD — in facilitating Hitler ’s victory is not a matter of serious historical controversy .
There are , of course , many questions as to why these parties pursued such disastrous and self - destructive policies .
But it is as close to a historical certainty as anything can be that the working class parties , despite their millions of members , pursued policies that ultimately reduced themselves to a state of complete political impotence .
To state that the action or inaction of two mass parties would , in any event , have had no effect on the outcome of the political struggle in Germany , that Hitler would have conquered no matter what , is to render the whole subject of the working class movement and socialist politics politically and historically irrelevant .
This is the conclusion that flows inevitably from Thatcher ’s argument . [ 86 ]
While Thatcher repeatedly insists that the adoption of Trotsky ’s policies would have made no difference whatsoever , he argues time and again against Trotsky ’s criticisms of Stalin .
He is so unshakeable in his hostility toward Trotsky and sympathy for Stalin that one cannot help but think that his work is driven by an unstated political agenda .
Long ago , in his justly famous What Is History ? , E.H.
Carr advised us to listen carefully for the buzzing of bees in a historian ’s bonnet .
The bees in a good historian ’s bonnet emit a pleasing and sophisticated sound that harmonizes beautifully with the factual material that it accompanies .
But the bees in Mr. Thatcher ’s bonnet emit a very loud , discordant and tendentious sound , rather like Stalinist hornets .
My concern here is not Thatcher ’s politics — to which he is personally entitled — but his treatment of historical facts .
The bees ( or even hornets ) only become a serious problem when their buzzing is so loud that one cannot hear the history .
Thatcher defends Stalin
Defending Stalin against Trotsky ’s criticism , Thatcher declares that the latter ’s “ thesis of a Stalinist betrayal of world revolution is as one - sided as it is unconvincing .
It ignores , for example , the positive aspects of the Popular - Front tactic , evident in the expansion of the communist parties ’ support and influence . ” [ 87 ]
At this point , as Professor Thatcher approaches the conclusion of his biography , the distinction between history writing and tendency polemics has been obliterated .
The pretense of writing a biography is virtually dropped , and the reader is being fed what used to be called the Stalinist party - line .
Thatcher , extolling the Stalinist “ successes ” of the Popular Front era , ignores Trotsky ’s analysis of the Seventh Congress of the Comintern in 1935 , which implemented — in the aftermath of the catastrophes of Stalinist “ Third Period ” ultra - leftism — the shift toward alliances with bourgeois parties .
Thatcher makes no mention of Trotsky ’s assessment that the Seventh Congress and the adoption of Popular Frontism signified the repudiation of any link between the Comintern and the perspective of socialist revolution — a development rooted in the foreign policy interests of the Stalinist regime in the USSR .
This assessment , it should be pointed out , was endorsed by E.H. Carr , in The Twilight of the Comintern . [ 88 ]
Thatcher continues , “ There is also no evidence to confirm Trotsky ’s contention , however , that Comintern tactics were dependent on the demands of Soviet diplomacy . ” [ 89 ]
Here , Thatcher is not only arguing against Trotsky , but the overwhelming weight of historical evidence .
An author who makes such a claim surrenders any right to be taken seriously as a historian .
How would Thatcher explain the overnight change in the policies of Communist parties all over the world , after the negotiation of the Stalin - Hitler Pact of August 1939 ?
There is also the matter of the physical liquidation of large numbers of leading members of national Communist parties during the Stalinist Terror of 1937 - 39 .
Virtually the entire leadership of the Polish Communist Party was wiped out , because Stalin deemed it susceptible to Trotskyist influences .
Large sections of the old leadership of the German Communist Party , which had escaped Hitler by fleeing to the USSR , were executed in Moscow during the Terror .
The KPD General Secretary , Ernst Thaelmann , who had been captured by the Nazis , was abandoned by Stalin , who declined an opportunity to have him released to Soviet custody after the signing of the Pact with Hitler .
Thaelmann perished in a concentration camp .
The leadership that emerged from Soviet exile in 1945 to assume control of what was to become the East German state consisted of individuals who had been left alive by Stalin — often at the price of denouncing their KPD comrades .
Does not all this constitute a form of subordination of Communist parties to the dictates of the Soviet regime ?
An understanding of the pervasive Soviet influence in the policies of the Comintern requires an examination of the activities of the GPU ( which became the NKVD ) , the secret police of the Stalinist regime .
Trotsky examined this issue in detail in one of his last articles , The Comintern and the GPU , which he completed less than two weeks before his own assassination by a Stalinist agent . [ 90 ]
Citing the testimony of Walter Krivitsky , who defected from the GPU , and Benjamin Gitlow , an ex-member of the leadership of the American Communist Party , Trotsky documented the control exerted by GPU agents over the Stalinist organizations .
He included an analysis of financial transactions , demonstrating how the flow of cash was used to direct and control the policies of local Stalinist parties .
He also demonstrated the financial dependence of these parties on cash from Moscow .
Thatcher does not examine , analyze and reply to this document — the last major statement written by Trotsky before his death on August 21 , 1940 .
He simply ignores it .
Thatcher also mounts an impassioned defense of Stalin on another front .
He writes , “ Finally , Trotsky clearly underestimated the capacity of the USSR to withstand a German declaration of war , which eventually occurred in June 1941 .
Stalin proved himself a capable war leader , standing firm at the helm in the initial confusion surrounding the first moments of the German attack . ” [ 91 ]
Two issues are raised here : first , Trotsky ’s assessment of the resilience of the Soviet Union in the event of war ; second , Stalin ’s role as a war leader .
In response to the first , Thatcher again falsifies Trotsky ’s position .
He does not cite from Trotsky ’s most comprehensive statement on the Soviet Union ’s powers of resistance in the event of war .
The Red Army , written by Trotsky in March 1934 , came to a conclusion that is the exact opposite to the one attributed to him by Thatcher .
“ He who is able to read the books of history , ” wrote Trotsky , “ will understand beforehand that should the Russian Revolution , which has continued ebbing and flowing for almost 30 years — since 1905 — be forced to direct its stream into the channel of war , it will unleash a terrific and overwhelming force . ” [ 92 ]
This statement hardly qualifies as an underestimation of the USSR .
As for Thatcher ’s special tribute to Stalin as a war leader , it is curious that he chooses to cite specifically his activities during the “ first moments of the German attack . ”
He certainly knows that there are many questions surrounding Stalin ’s response to the German invasion of June 22 , 1941 .
In numerous books , including the memoirs of leading Soviet officials , it has been claimed that Stalin was emotionally devastated by the news of the invasion , which exposed the utter bankruptcy of his diplomatic game with Hitler and now confronted the USSR with the possibility of total ruin .
Thatcher is not unaware of this , and includes a footnote , which states : “ Several textbooks claim that when Germany invaded the USSR Stalin was thrown into a panic and it would have been possible to overthrow him ...
These claims are convincingly refuted by S.J. Main , ‘ Stalin in
Your Car Is Not An Investment – And Neither Are Some Of the Other Things You ’re Pretending Are
In order to justify expensive purchases , many people , including plenty of otherwise very intelligent folks , like to refer to certain types of spending sprees as “ investments . ”
Luckily for me , from the time I was about four years old , my father took any opportunity he could to tell me that anything that loses value after you buy it is not an investment .
To pass along a bit of my father ’s knowledge and help you be more honest with yourself about your own spending habits , here are some of the purchases I most commonly hear people lie to themselves about by calling them “ investments . ”
Cars :
A car loses value the second you drive it off the lot , and a $ 50,000 new BMW does n’t get you to work any more effectively than a $ 2,000 used Honda .
Even if you ’re buying an antique that you expect to retain or increase its value , it costs an incredible amount of money to insure and maintain a vehicle — money that you ’ll never get back .
The only situation where your car might be considered an investment is if it is required for your line of work–and I do n’t mean buying a Mercedes because you work in commercial real estate , I mean buying a truck or cargo van for a physical labor job that requires you to haul around a lot of equipment .
Even then , you ’d be wise to get a used vehicle .
Clothes and shoes :
If you buy expensive sneakers , they will not help you become a successful professional basketball player with a multi-million dollar contract .
And , unless you work in an appearance - obsessed industry such as fashion , that expensive interview suit is no more likely to land you the job than an inexpensive one .
I may not be turning any heads in my $ 50 polyester interview suit , but I ’ve gotten hired about five times while wearing it .
Comic books and collectible toys :
Most toys , most of the time , do not go up in value .
Even if one toy out of 100 does , it probably wo n’t go up by very much , and you probably wo n’t even break even after the expense of the other 99 toys , let alone make a profit from your purchases .
Also , the notion that any comic book or toy will become more valuable with the simple passage of time is n’t really true .
The advent of eBay has also driven down the price of collectibles by lifting geographic difficulties on acquiring items .
The market is a lot bigger now , and items once considered rare can be easy - to - find online .
The most likely outcome of collecting comic books and toys with the hopes of making money one day is that you ’ll end up with a closet full of bulging boxes and shelves full of dust - coated figurines .
Just ask all the people who lost their wits in the Beanie Baby craze of the late 90’s .
An undergraduate degree from a prestigious university : A college degree is certainly one of the best ways to increase earning potential for many people , but will a degree from a prestigious university really give you greater earning power over the course of your lifetime and make up for its higher cost ?
This debate will probably never end , but I ’d argue that the flexibility and peace of mind that come from graduating debt - free or with a small , manageable amount of debt may outweigh the supposed benefits of having a prestigious name on your diploma and $ 80,000 in student loans .
Private school degrees do n’t necessarily carry more weight than public school degrees ( in Los Angeles , a degree from the University of Southern California , a private school , is not really looked upon any better than a degree from the public UCLA ) and neither degree will have carry any special weight if you move to the East Coast after school .
Some of the highest ranked , most expensive private schools in the country actually have no name recognition whatsoever outside of their immediate geographic regions .
Glasses :
Yes , glasses are necessary for most people , and they can certainly contribute to your financial success in many ways if you ca n’t function without them .
However , glasses can be purchased cheaply online or at Costco .
Do n’t justify the purchase of a $ 300 pair of glasses by calling them an investment .
Computers :
A computer is certainly a great thing to have , but these days you can get a basic , very good desktop computer and monitor for $ 400 and a laptop for $ 500 if you watch the ads and time your purchase .
Unless you are a graphic designer or other professional requiring a specialized computer , do n’t tell yourself that the $ 3000 top - of - the - line model will help you get ahead in life somehow .
Jewelry : Wedding rings , watches and any other type of jewelry is not an investment .
While you may want to get a nice one for your partner or for yourself , the fact is that jewelry is extremely difficult to resell .
Do n’t fool yourself into upgrading because you think it will give you a bigger return in the future because it wo n’t .
Jewelry should be looked at as something that you are going to enjoy and wear yourself , but not as an investment .
Ultimately , there ’s nothing wrong with buying any of these things , or even spending a lot of money on them if you can afford it .
The important thing is to be honest with yourself about your purchase when thinking about what you really need , why you ’re buying it , and how much money you really can afford to spend .
The converse to XML parsing is SXML pretty - printing : a translation from an abstract to a concrete XML syntax , to an XML or HTML document .
The pretty - printing makes it possible to author and compose XML documents in their SXML form .
SXML is more concise and expressive than a raw markup language .
SXML representing regular Scheme code can be entered in any Scheme - sensitive editor .
SXML as a data structure -- a list -- can likewise be composed as a literal or quasi-literal expression .
Furthermore , SXML can be produced by regular Scheme functions , which may make authoring more succinct , advanced , and less tedious , as the code below illustrates .
The pretty - printing consists of two passes .
The first one traverses an s-expression tree in post- order , and converts it into a tree of HTML fragments .
The tree of fragments , when flattened and concatenated , yields the resulting HTML document .
Of course there is no need to flatten the tree and concatenate strings explicitly .
Rather , we traverse the tree of fragments depth - first and write out fragments .
In this approach , all character and other data , once created , stay where they were originally allocated .
No data are ever copied .
Functions such as string -> number are implied as well .
The second pass , a pre-order traversal of a tree of fragments , is performed by a function SRV : send - reply .
Besides writing out character data it encounters , the function executes thunks and ignores '( ) and #f .
This feature lets us , for example , embed conditional forms into an s-expression representing HTML :
( SXML -> HTML `(p " par1 " " par2 " , ( and test ( list " par3 " " par4 " ) ) ) )
test
Here is a more meaningful example , which intelligently generates a " navigation bar " , a pair of links to the preceding and the following slides .
Obviously the first and the last page must have only one navigation link .
( define ( print - slide n max - count ) ( SXML -> HTML `(( h2 " Slide number : " , n ) ; Note n is used in its native form , ( and ( positive ? n ) `( a ( @ ( href " base-url&slide= " , (- n 1 ) ) ) " prev " ) ) , ( and (< (+ n 1 ) max - count ) `( a ( @ ( href " base-url&slide= " , (+ n 1 ) ) ) " next " ) ) ( p " the text of the slide " ) ) ) )
SXML makes composing XML or HTML documents even more convenient by enabling higher - order " tags " -- just as LaTeX helps typeset documents by offering higher - order " macros " .
LaTeX macros are eventually expanded by TeX ; SXML " tags " are evaluated by Scheme .
The SXML specification is an example of such an advanced composition .
The SXML . html web page that describes SXML is actually written in SXML itself .
* TOP *
( productions ( production 1 ( nonterm " TOP " ) ( ( sexp ( term - lit " * TOP * " ) ( ebnf - opt ( nonterm " aux - list " ) ) ( ebnf - * ( nonterm " PI " ) ) ( ebnf - * ( nonterm " comment " ) ) ( nonterm " Element " ) ) ) ) )

Using SXML to express its grammar has another important advantage : you can easily write a transformation or an SXPath query on the whole SXML.scm to make sure that every nonterm mentioned on the right - hand of some production appears on the left - hand side of exactly one production .
The SXML.scm code thus lends itself not only to a flexible presentation to a human but to a formal reasoning about as well .
As a matter of fact , the ability to treat SXML as a " code " or as " data " is used during SXML transformations .
The expansion process of a tag can re-scan the SXML document , with a different stylesheet .
That is how hierarchical tables of contents are generated .
Unlike LaTeX , you do not need to write auxiliary files and do not need to re-run the document processor .
The definition of SXML ->HTML is given below .
The function also handles " higher - level " HTML tags , for example , html : begin .
These tags make HTML code even more succinct and expressive , as the SXML code for this page clearly shows .

One senior officer calls it a " moral imperative , " and others see it as a no - brainer , but four years into a deadly war , there are only some 350 blast - resistant trucks protecting US troops in Iraq .
Officials inside and outside the military want to know why .
When it comes to safeguarding troops against roadside bombs , the top killer in Iraq , the new must - have truck is an MRAP – a Mine Resistant , Ambush Protected vehicle .
It 's a hulking machine , at 31,000 pounds , with a ' V ' - shaped hull that diverts blasts away from the carriage – and the troops riding inside .
No one has ever been killed riding in one version of the vehicle , called a Cougar .
So why are n't thousands of the trucks , first available in 2003 , in Iraq ?
" How is it possible that with our nation at war , with more than 130,000 Americans in danger , with roadside bombs destroying a growing number of lives and limbs , we were so slow to act to protect our troops ? " asked Sen. Joseph Biden ( D ) of Delaware in a letter Tuesday to Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The answers to Senator Biden 's question illustrate how hard it can be for the government – and the private sector – to respond to urgent battlefield needs while weighing legitimate concerns about how government contracts are awarded and production lines are cranked up .
In the case of the MRAP , the process has been especially slow and tangled .
In 2004 , a year after the invasion of Iraq , the insurgency was mounting and roadside bombs were killing American troops .
The conventional thinking about how to protect troops was to field " up - armored " Humvees .
At the time , the insurgency did n't look as if it would go on much longer , so there was no need to invest in a new vehicle , and the Humvee already had an established industrial base .
But the enemy was adapting , placing roadside bombs in such a way to cause blasts that ripped through the underside of vehicles , causing casualties .
At the same time , a small company in South Carolina called Force Protection Inc. was pushing a different solution .
It had designed a truck with a steel undercarriage shaped like a ' V , ' which diverted the force of blasts to the side of the vehicle .
But the company and those who supported the initiative could n't provide enough data to prove the effectiveness of the MRAP design .
And even if it had had the data to make the case to the Pentagon , the company was too small to mass - produce the vehicle .
A year earlier , its 11 - employee workforce had taken a month to produce just one truck .
" In the beginning , we really were n't good enough to mass produce enough to be a good , mainstream solution , " says Mike Aldrich , the company 's vice - president of marketing and government relations .
But Marines with the I Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp Pendleton , Calif. , knew the design would save lives and made a request in February 2005 for more than 1,100 of the trucks .
More than a year later , they made a second request .
The Pentagon ultimately approved just 185 vehicles in mid-2006 .
Even as the Pentagon gears up to buy thousands more of the vehicles , Biden wants Secretary Gates to investigate the delay .
The Pentagon wants 21,000 of the vehicles and Congress is paying for 7,700 of them .
The company is now producing each month about 100 Cougars – the version most wanted by the military – and it's preparing to go to a 200 - per- month production rate , hiring 25 new employees a week .
Aldrich says his company can make 10,000 vehicles by December 2008 – but that 's if he gets an order from the US government by July 1 .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misstated the date for Force Protection ’s production goal . ]
" That will get a lot of people protected in a hurry , " he says .
" Now we 're clearly putting the ball back in the government 's court , we 're saying ' place the order , ' " he says .
But he declines to say how he can meet the surge in demand .
At least eight other companies are also vying for MRAP contracts .
The process by which the Pentagon awards contracts has long been slow .
But the process moved quickly once the decision was made to move forward .
While there was interest in the MRAP , it was hard for the services initially to make a " strategic decision " to buy thousands of them , says a Washington , D.C. , attorney familiar with the MRAP contracting issue .
If the military put all its acquisition eggs all in one basket and then found it did n't need the truck a year or so later , that would be seen as poor judgment at best and a boondoggle at worst .
" The problem they had was more of strategy – where to you put your money , what makes the most sense – and not so much of the nuts and bolts of government acquisition , " he says .
" Once the decision was made at the strategic level to go with MRAP , they moved out pretty darn quick , warp speed . "
Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway says the Corps is pushing the envelope when it comes to working through – and if necessary , around – contracting regulations that can delay such purchases .
" I could be wearing stripes [ of enlisted men ] when this is all over , " General Conway joked during a Pentagon briefing recently , saying nevertheless that it is a " moral imperative " to get these vehicles to Iraq .
Some question why there 's all the fuss about a vehicle that will not have a big impact protecting forces until thousands more can be fielded next year and the year after – about the same time that many Americans believe the bulk of US forces will have left Iraq .
That 's not the way Aldrich sees it .
As long as roadside bombs are effective , enemies of the US will use them wherever they may be , he says .
Plainfield , N.H. — SHE sits on the lookout in a lawn chair on their front porch , her forehead glossy with sweat , Bible next to her left foot , wind chimes clinking at her back .
Her husband of 24 years is by her side , German shepherd at his knee , handgun tucked beneath the belt on his jeans .
High in these humid hills , Ed and Elaine Brown have been holed up in their home for six months , refusing to serve a five - year prison sentence for tax evasion .
They all but dared law officials to come and get them .
This , they say , is a fight they ’re ready to die for .
“ Show me the law ! ” says Ed , a trim 64 - year - old with a silver mustache , whose forehead crinkles when he gets heated .
The Browns stopped paying income taxes in 1996 .
They say the Constitution and Supreme Court decisions support their claims that ordinary labor cannot be taxed .
But a judge ruled against them in January , convicting the Browns of conspiring to evade paying taxes on $ 1.9 million in income from Elaine ’s dentistry practice .
Now , the Browns say they ’re in a battle for freedom , and it just might end in bloodshed right here , in a towering turreted house with 8 - inch - thick concrete walls and an American flag fluttering over the double - car garage .
They have garnered national support , with blogs devoted to news about the standoff and supporters regularly showing up on the couple ’s doorstep with groceries .
Government and law officials have cut off power , Internet , house phone , cellphone , television and mail service to the couple ’s 110 - acre compound .
But their house is equipped with solar panels , a watchtower , a satellite dish and a stockpile of food .
“ We are self - sustained like a ship , ” Ed says .
“ We do n’t need power from the shore to run the ship . ”
FBI agents are trying to avoid a deadly shootout reminiscent of Waco , Texas , or Ruby Ridge , Idaho .
They have tried negotiating , waiting , begging .
“ We are proceeding carefully to make sure no one gets hurt , ” says U.S. Marshal Stephen Monier , the lead officer handling the siege .
“ We are aware that there are guns in there . ”
Monier says the couple broke the law and should turn themselves in peacefully .
“ They have been tried and convicted and sentenced . ”
But the Browns are n’t budging .
“ You remember that little gentleman in China , Tiananmen Square ? ”
Ed says , peering through his sunglasses .
“ He was the same as we are .
You can scare me , you can kill me , but you ca n’t intimidate me . ”
“ We ’re fighting for you , your country , ” adds Elaine , 66 , a calm woman with short , wavy dark hair .
“ This is n’t just taxes . ”
“ There ’s no more America , ” Ed says .
“ It ’s already gone . ”
“ I ’ll die fighting , rather than live in slavery , ” Elaine says .
“ I ’ll tell you that . ”
--
Another guest , who refuses to give his name and makes it a point to tell everyone he is armed , drove here from Massachusetts .
He talks about illegal immigration and government corruption in a slow deep drip of a voice that seems to irritate Ed , who frequently cuts him off .
The government , Ed says , is at a point of “ communism in its purist form . ”
Elaine nods .
“ It ’s not communism though , ” says the Massachusetts man .
“ It ’s totalitarianism . ”
“ It ’s Marxism , ” interjects Tibbetts , 60 .
“ No , no , no , guys , guys , do n’t give me that , ” says Ed , raising his voice .
“ I ’ve done 15 years of research here . ”
Since the standoff began , the Browns ’ home has turned into a commune for anti-government activists .
Admirers from across the country make their way to the secluded home on Center of Town Road in Plainfield , population 2,200 , in a state where license plates carry the motto “ Live Free or Die . ”
To get to the Browns ’ house , travelers ascend along a jagged gravel and dirt road , stopping at a silver sign nailed to a tree trunk on the couple ’s property , which warns : “ If not friendly , Go , Go Away ! ”
Unable to telephone the Browns and notify them of their arrival , some visitors proceed slowly down the long driveway or attach small flags to their trucks to show that they ’ve come in peace .
The guests often come bearing gifts : hamburger buns , ginger ale , cellphones with prepaid minutes , gun ammunition .
Someone gave the Browns their German shepherd , named Zoey .
The visitors pitch tents in the Browns ’ yard or sleep inside the house .
Some bring laptops from which they manage the Browns ’ blog and MySpace page , both created by volunteers .
Shaun Kranish , 21 , of Rockford , Ill. , read about the Browns online earlier this year .
In March , he drove to New Hampshire and spent a few nights at their home talking about politics and freedom .
A gun rights advocate , he started a website , MaketheStand.com , devoted to the couple ’s battle .
He has solicited rechargeable flashlights and candles for the Browns and helped promote concerts supporting them .
People back the Browns , he says , because they are standing against everything that is wrong with government .
“ It ’s about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Kranish says .
“ It ’s about the truth about the 9/11 attacks .
They ’re saying , ‘ We ’re not going to be a part of it ; we ’re not going to fund it . ’ ”
There are 250,000 to 500,000 people in the United States who are tax protesters , says JJ MacNab , a financial analyst who has written a book on the issue and testified before Congress on behalf of law enforcement .
Some , she says , are elderly , uneducated or disenfranchised people who buy into tax evasion scams .
Others are disgruntled — sometimes dangerous — citizens who believe the wording of tax laws does not make them liable to pay .
“ The tax laws are almost 100 years old , and no one has ever won , ” she says .
“ Thousands and thousands of people have challenged them .
It ’s a constant flow of the same tired arguments over and over . ”
MacNab says the Internet has connected Iraq war veterans , college students , minorities and women to the tax protest movement , which was once associated mostly with white supremacists and militia groups that held meetings at local diners .
Supporters have hailed the Browns as heroes , akin to Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , which has made law enforcement officials cautious about turning them into martyrs .
“ There are lots of people that want it to be over , ” says Stephen Halleran , Plainfield ’s town administrator .
“ They feel Ed and Elaine need to play by the same rules as the rest of us . ”
Halleran says the Browns have always had strong beliefs , but they have n’t been considered dangerous until now .
Residents are anxious , he says , because of the steady stream of out - of - towners — white supremacists , anarchists and other activists — roaming through Plainfield and showing up at community meetings .
Neighbors with children worry about what could happen if the standoff ends in gunfire .
MacNab , who has studied tax protesters since 1997 , says some supporters of the Browns have compiled a list of enemies — including judges and journalists — and their families .
People have warned that if the couple die , retaliatory killings will follow .
MacNab has little faith the Browns will turn themselves in without a fight .
“ I think there ’s going to be death and violence , ” she says .
“ I do n’t see it happening another way . ”

THE way the Browns see it , they skirted a bloodbath on June 7 .
That was the day their compound was surrounded by armed officers , armored vehicles , state police cruisers , trucks and roadblocks .
Law officials say the showing of force was intended for surveillance of the compound while its agents seized Elaine ’s dental practice a town away .
A houseguest of the Browns noticed the convoy while walking Zoey .
The Browns believe that a confrontation between the houseguest and law enforcement helped them avert an attack .
“ Whenever we go into the vicinity , we go in a manner to ensure the community is protected and the officers are protected , ” says Monier , the marshal .
He added that law enforcement conducted surveillance on the Brown compound “ from time to time . ”
Elaine does n’t buy it : “ We know they were on their way in to kill us that day . ”
Two weeks later , Randy Weaver , whose wife and child were killed in Ruby Ridge 15 years ago , held a news conference at the Browns ’ home , in which he vowed to stand with them .
“ What makes people willing to put their lives on the line ? ” said Weaver , holding up a picture of his late son for reporters .
“ They ’ll take so much B.S. from the so - called government , the de facto government , that they just say , Back off .
This is just what has happened right here . ”
It was the Ruby Ridge siege , along with his brewing anger over paying taxes , that inspired Ed to rebel .
In 1992 , U.S. marshals converged on Weaver ’s remote mountain cabin to arrest him on a federal weapons trafficking charge .
A marshal shot and killed Weaver ’s teenage son .
In another gun battle a marshal was killed .
The next day , an FBI sharpshooter shot Weaver , then fatally shot his wife , Vicki , as she was holding the couple ’s baby girl .
A year later , Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers were engaged in a 51 - day standoff with federal agents surrounding their compound in Waco , Texas .
Ed watched it all on television .
Federal agents were trying to carry out search and arrest warrants against Koresh because of reports that his group was stockpiling illegal weapons .
In a shootout , four agents were killed and 20 others injured .
The siege ended with a raging fire .
When it was over , 82 Branch Davidian members were dead .
“ I was calling him the Waco wacko at the time , ” says Ed , “ and I said , ‘ Wait a minute , they ’re planning to go in and kill these people . ’
You ca n’t do that .
Now they lost me .
Now I was angry . ”
The events at Ruby Ridge and Waco energized conspiracy theorists and anti-government activists , including the bomber of the Oklahoma City federal building , Timothy J. McVeigh .
Ed focused his fury on the Internal Revenue Service .
“ It affected so many people , ” he says .
“ The IRS is the most brutal , ruthless organization out of all there is . ”
--
INSIDE their home , Elaine boils hot dogs over a gas stove .
Sunlight shines through windows offering the only light .
The dim kitchen is cooler than outside .
The shelves are lined with plastic containers of dry beans , bottles of hot sauce , bags of potato chips , a can of Folgers coffee , a watermelon .
A bouquet of pink and blue daisies sits on the table , near a copy of the local newspaper featuring an article about the Browns .
There is a rumble in the driveway .
Zoey begins to bark .
Everyone runs to the front window .
“ Check the side door ! ” Ed yells to Elaine .
It ’s just a visitor with a flag on his truck .
He stopped by to tell the Browns that he , too , has stopped paying taxes .
“ You must understand , ” says Ed , sitting in his rocking chair , “ this is personal for each and every one of us . ”
He brings up how law officials have bullied him and harassed his wife .
He becomes flustered when he recalls his wife being handcuffed when she was arrested for tax evasion .
“ This is American , what he ’s talking , ” Tibbetts says .
“ This is what made America .
Not sitting back and getting abused .
Standing up for what ’s right .
Standing up for what God gave you . ”
Elaine offers Tibbetts another hot dog .
“ There ’s two freight trains going just like this toward each other , ” Ed says .
“ So you better take a side , buddy , because when they hit , it ’s going to be hellacious .
“ And , ” he says , “ it all could start right here . ”

Paperback or Kindle
There was n't time to talk about the sinister absurdity of sanctioning a law that compels old ladies to offer up a mouth swab , whether they want to or not .
No time to state that the Home Office and police are engaged on a programme to introduce mass DNA testing by stealth .
No time to wonder at the complete absence of parliamentary debate on this crucial issue of liberty .
No time to ask whether we can truly trust the police ; or to consider what the relatively new science of genetics may be used for in the future ; or to wonder at the alarming disappearance of the liberal reflex in British political life .
The show ended and we were on to the news and traffic updates .
People were more worried about a lorry blocking the M4 .
There were supermarkets to visit , jobs to be done , planes to be caught .
But before we all shut up shop for the holidays , it is worth underlining one sentence that needs to be written in neon across every town centre : Britain is on the way to becoming a police state .
Writing about the crisis of liberty in Britain , I have been careful not to use these words , but today I see no other conclusion to draw .
Taken in the context of the ID card database , the national surveillance of vehicles and retention of information about every individual motorway journey , the huge number of new criminal offences , the half million intercepts of private communications every year , the proposed measures to take 53 pieces of information from everyone wishing to go abroad , which will include powers to prevent travel , this widening of the DNA database for minor misdemeanours confirms the pattern of attack on us all .
It is time to pay attention to what the government under Labour has done to British society and what may be awaiting us just a short distance down the road .
Some will say I am being alarmist , but they should consider what we have lost since the mid-Nineties .
The inventory of freedoms is eroded every week with measures and laws that individually seem just about acceptable but which accrue to alter the nature of a society where rights and liberty were believed to be as natural as summer rain .
People might be reassured by Gordon Brown 's talk of a constitutional settlement and a new Bill of Rights , but they should look at his statist views and what is happening in the Home Office , surely one of the most incompetent of the ministries , yet , with its vision for a totally controlled society , also one of the most malign ?
Our liberal society is threatened because we do n't think it is .
This crisis is a crisis because we have not yet acknowledged it .
Let me explain why extension of the database should worry us all .
The taking of a swab from a person 's mouth - by force when necessary - and retaining that sample indefinitely , whether that person has committed a crime or not , is a very serious intrusion .
The state owns and has access to the essence of that individual 's being .
In the future , it may share the information with whom it likes , investigate the as yet unknown secrets of that sample and make deductions which are prejudicial to that individual or the individual 's blood relations .
Once on the DNA database , a person is regarded as being in a pool of potential criminals and in an oblique way likely to be guilty of something or other .
DNA is a very useful tool in solving serious crime , but to force people to give a sample because they are not wearing a seatbelt , have littered or let their dog foul a pavement is wrong because it is a measure designed to increase the database , driven by a bureaucratic rather than judicial imperative .
In the words of Alex Marshall , deputy chief constable of Thames Valley Police : ' Extending the taking of samples to all offences may be perceived as indicative of the increasing criminalisation of the generally law - abiding citizen .
That is exactly right .
Any democratic society with a respect for rights must strike a balance between the needs of crime detection and the principle that a person 's privacy is inviolate and their basic innocence unaffected even when they have committed a minor misdemeanour .
To compel the sampling of DNA from someone who has driven past a stop sign is a greater offence to society than driving past the stop sign .
The cynical minds of the Home Office concede that the DNA database is inadequate - that the proportion of young black men represented is unacceptable , that the presence of 90,000 innocent minors is regrettable .
They argue that these ' anomalies ' would disappear if everyone was on the database and DNA was taken at birth as matter of routine .
Very well , let the matter of a compulsory national DNA database come before Parliament .
Better still , let it become the subject of a referendum so that each party takes a clear stand one way or the other .
This is a very important issue which we are letting slip from our grasp .
It surely wo n't be long before someone at the Home Office suggests a DNA sample is added to the information on the ID card database .
Indeed , I would guess that is already part of their long - term planning .
Overall , our concern must be that we are allowing the state to accumulate too much power over the individual .
The more that power is concentrated , the more likely it is to be abused .
On the morning that the Home Office announced the proposals for extending the database , two police officers in Nottingham were found guilty of leaking intelligence to a gangster named Colin Gunn and in London the Independent Police Complaints Commission found that Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman had misled the public about the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes .
These cases underline that police officers are not beyond unlawful or irregular behaviour .
If DNA evidence was available during the 1974 Birmingham or Guildford bombings , it seems likely that the police would have used samples to clinch convictions , which would then have been that much harder to overturn .
DNA evidence goes unchallenged in court and as the database expands clearly the opportunities to ' fit up ' suspects will increase .
The vast majority of police officers are upstanding servants of the community , which is how I 'd like them to remain .
But too much power will change that .
As a nation , we need to have more confidence in people 's ability to determine the course of society during difficult times .
In an excellent article in the Daily Telegraph , Janet Daley commented on the ingenuity of and the sacrifice made by ordinary people during the floods .
She ended with a suggested sentence for David Cameron 's speech writers .
' It is because of that faith we have in ordinary people and their ability to do the right thing that we want to entrust them with more power over their lives and communities . '
We begin by resisting this demonic move to criminalise us with this database .

Commuter Story : Commuting in Atlanta
Ed – This story from Chris of Atlanta , GA .
Share your story by emailing diggers@commutebybike.com .
My commuting by bike story starts like many others .
My car broke down .
What I believed to be the need for a simple tune - up repair evolved over the course of two weeks into a warranty fight with the dealership .
I started commuting by bike to get back and forth to work until my car was fixed and have discovered all kinds of great benefits from riding .
( my car is still in the shop , and I could care less ) I have 02 Jamis Hybrid mountain bike that has served me well in the casual ride department and is working great so far as a commuter ( although it is a little heavy ) .
I ride my bike three miles to the MARTA rail station , ride MARTA to the closest stop and bike the rest of the way ( another two miles ) .
I get more exercise in the rail station by carrying my bike up and down long stairs to and from the platforms .
While my actual ride time is not great , Atlanta is fairly hilly and most of my riding is up or down a hill .
When I get to work I am awake , my metabolism is humming , and I feel great .
The real challenge for me has been getting to work and still dressing in suit / tie every day .
As a lawyer , I do n’t have the luxury of sitting around in shorts all day .
I have to dress professionally most days and that requires some forethought and planning .
Here is how I am doing it .
Once a week , my wife brings a load of dry - cleaned shirts to work .
I keep three pairs of pants , one sport coat and two pairs of shoes / belts at work .
On the bike , I take a towel , underwear and whatever else is required for the day .
When I get to work , I go to the office gym ( a shower is essential ) , work out just one body part with the weights , and then shower .
At the end of the day , I put back on the same clothes I biked in on , pack up the worn dress shirt and I am on the bike headed home .
Here is a partial list of benefits I have experienced since I started cbb :
Exercise – for the first time in a long time I am getting meaningful daily exercise which is productive as well !
Money Savings – I spend $ 52 a month on MARTA pass , when my car is fixed , I will sell it and save over $ 400 per month .
No After Work Drinks – I used to stop on the way home and have a couple before getting home , it was expensive and bad for me , now I ride home and even if I wanted to get a drink I am too sweaty to go anywhere but home .
I am exercising and saving money !
Stress - Relief – I have experienced that wonderful calm you get when you are freshly exercised .
This is important in my field where stress kills !
Positive Esteem –
It feels great to know that I am not wasting money on gas , polluting the environment with smog , noise , etc .
These are just a few of the things I have noticed in the weeks I have been commuting by bike .
There are lots of unknowns , but I suspect I can make this a real change in my lifestyle that will have all kinds of wonderful benefits .
Atlanta is a car heavy city and my commute takes me into the heart of Midtown – the financial center .
I often ride on the sidewalks because there is no room on the road and I am not ready to ride fully in traffic just yet .
I am taking it slow , I have a wish to get to work safely – not a death wish .
I have been shocked to see how few people actually commute by bike in this town .
MARTA is great for bikes you can put them on the train or bus for no additional charges .
If more people knew how much bang for the buck they would get out of commuting by bike they would do it .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A spine specialist trying to figure out why people so often have bad backs says he has come up with a new theory about when and how early humans evolved the ability to walk upright .
The uncannily human - looking backbone of a 21 million - year - old precursor of humans and apes gives the first clue , said Dr. Aaron Filler of the Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles .
A major change in the vertebrae that allowed this pre-human to stand upright and carry things also made it easier to crush and strain the spongy discs between each vertebra , Filler , a medical doctor with a doctorate in anthropology proposes .
That , in turn , explains why back pain is a leading cause of disability , he said .
Writing in the journal Neurosurgical Focus on Sunday , Filler said one main clue was a bone feature called the transverse process , which sticks out from the side of the hollow , round vertebrae , Filler said in a telephone interview .
This is where muscles attach to the spine .
“ The vertebra is transformed in a way that literally reverses the mechanics of the spine , ” Filler said .
“ The bone lever of the vertebrae gets switched from bending the spine forward to bending the spine back . ”
Most vertebrates are oriented forward , to walk on all fours .
The transverse process is at the front of each vertebra , facing the animal ’s belly .
This is true of monkeys , too .
But in humans and in the 21 million - year - old fossil of a creature called Morotopithecus bishopi , a tree - dwelling , ape - like creature that lived in what is now Uganda , the transverse process has moved backward , behind the opening for the spinal cord .
Great apes , such as chimpanzees , share this feature .
‘ THE UPRIGHT APE ’
The fossil was discovered in the 1960s but no one noticed the important change until 1997 , when paleontologist Laura MacLatchy of the State University of New York at Stony Brook reported on the remarkable features of Morotopithecus .
“ That means that upright posture bipedalism goes back 20 million years , not just 5 or 6 million years , ” said Filler .
In his study and in a book published last week called “ The Upright Ape -- a new origin of the Species , ” Filler argues that this common ancestor , and ancestors going back many millions of years before , walked upright .
Homo sapiens , the human species , continued upright , while apes evolved back toward all fours , he argues .
“ When you look at most ape species , their spines and most of their bodies still look pretty monkey - like , ” Filler said .
He also said humans evolved a new structure of muscles that pull the body from side to side while standing .
“ This is very important for carrying an infant or child , ” Filler said .
“ From the point of view of back pain , now we have big muscles doing this heavy work that never did before .
They can get torn and strained . ”
The backward orientation also allows the cushiony discs to get crushed , Filler said .
“ In most animals the vertebrae get spread apart when they carry infants on their backs when on all fours , ” he said .
What further differentiates humans from apes is the positioning of the place where the spine attaches to the hips , said Filler , who dissected the backbones of dead gibbons , chimpanzees and macaque monkeys and compared them to bones from living and extinct species of other animals and fossils from various pre-humans .

The Agonist ( cross- posted at The Seminal ) :
A bill introduced last week by Representative Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) is beginning to raise eyebrows .
[ It ] would require ISPs to record all users ' surfing activity , IM conversations and email traffic indefinitely .
The bill , dubbed the Safety Act by sponsor Lamar Smith , a republican congressman from Texas , would impose fines and a prison term of one year on ISPs which failed to keep full records .
( emphasis mine )
This is a terrifying development and it must be stopped before it gains any significant momentum .
Background , Action items and contact information below the fold .
Under the guise of reducing child pornography , the SAFETY ( Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today 's Youth Act )
Act is currently the gravest threat to digital privacy rights on the Internet .
Given the increasing tendency of people , especially young people , to use the Internet as a primary means of communications , this measure would effect nearly all Americans in ways we are only beginning to understand .
Also , given the fact that the Act requires all Internet Service Providers to record the web surfing activity of all Internet users , this amounts to the warrantless wiretapping of the entire Internet .

Senator Sam Brownback has reportedly introduced a bill that would require the people rating videogames to play the games in their entirety before giving a rating .
This reflects a misconception common among policymakers : that it ’s possible to inspect a program and figure out what it ’s going to do .
It ’s true that some programs can be completely characterized by inspection , but this is untrue for many programs , including some of the most interesting and useful ones .
Even very simple programs can be hard to understand .
Here , for example , is a three - line Python program I just wrote :
import sys , sha h = sha.new ( sha.new(sys.argv[ 1 ] ) .digest ( ) [ : 9 ] ) .digest ( ) if h.startswith ( “ abcdefghij ” ) : print “ Drat ”
( If you do n’t speak Python , here ’s what the program does : it takes the input you give it , and performs some standard , complicated mathematical operations on the input to yield a character - string .
If the first ten characters of that string happen to be “ abcedfghij ” , then the program prints the word “ Drat ” ; otherwise it does n’t print anything . )
Will this program ever print a four - letter word ?
There ’s no practical way to tell .
It ’s obvious that the program ’s behavior depends on what input you give it , but is there any input that causes h to start with the magic value abcedfghij ?
You can run the program and inspect the code but you wo n’t be able to tell .
Even I do n’t know , and I wrote the program !
Now you might object that even if we ca n’t tell whether the program will output a four - letter word , the presence of print “ Drat ” in the code shows that the programmer at least wanted “ Drat ” to be a possible output .
Fair enough ; but here ’s a slightly more complicated program that might or might not print “ Drat ” .
import sys , sha h = sha.new ( sha.new(sys.argv[ 1 ] ) .digest ( ) [ : 9 ] ) .digest ( ) if h.startswith ( “ abcdef ” ) : print h [ 6:9 ]
The behavior of this program again depends on its input .
For some inputs , it will produce no output .
For other inputs , it will produce an output that depends in a complicated way on the input it got .
Can this program ever print “ Drat ” ?
You ca n’t tell , and neither can I .
Nonexperts are often surprised to learn that programs can do things the programmers did n’t expect .
These surprises can be vexing ; but they ’re also the main reason computer science is fun .
There is a huge scandal developing about the behaviour of Godaddy .
The owner of FamilyAlbum.com was surprised to find that he no longer owned the domain , which had not expired .
Godaddy had received a complaint about invalid email address and sent an email to this invalid email address demanding the owner correct his invalid email address and predictably when no action was taken by the unaware domain owner ( whose mailing address and phone number were correct ! ) godaddy grabbed the domain to itself and then either sold it for profit or kept it and with it valuable typein traffic .
Godaddy 's explanations are vague and the domain still points to godaddy 's inhouse domain parking program which makes godaddy a lot of money for each click and the domains new owner is hidden by godaddy service Domains by Proxy .
It seems to me that it would be common sense to try other contact methods instead of email when the whole basis for the godaddy complaint is an invalid email address !
If I would have any valuable domains at godaddy I would be transferring them away right about NOW to another registrar who cares about their customers and their customers business and domain property and is NOT trying to screw their customers for profit the first chance they get .
That this kind of a thing happened means that godaddy is prepared to destroy their customers business without a second thought for undeliverable email address even while phone number and mailing address are CORRECT !
Imagine your best earning website domain taken away on whim like this because of invalid email ...

A year ago , Hillary Clinton said she “ would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table ” when it came to confronting Iran about its expanding nuclear program .
That comment contrasts conspicuously with her more recent statement , on Aug. 2 , in response to fellow Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ’s similar statement that nuclear weapons were “ not on the table ” for him in a hypothetical discussion about targeting terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
“ Presidents should be careful at all times in discussing the use and nonuse of nuclear weapons , ” Clinton countered later that same day .
“ Presidents since the Cold War have used nuclear deterrents to keep the peace , and I do n’t believe any president should make blanket statements with the regard to use or nonuse of nuclear weapons . ”
Once again , as with her stance on the Iraq war , Clinton ’s record has been inconsistent when it comes to how , when and against whom she would take military action were she to become the U.S. commander in chief .
Perhaps she has decided , or been urged by her advisers , to strike an aggressive pose in order to compensate for being a woman in a race for the presidency , a situation that some voters might view as virtually irreconcilable .
But balancing “ I ’m your girl ” wink - wink affability with “ I can play with the big boys and their big guns ” credibility is one thing , and going so far as to introduce even the dim possibility of pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons in a notoriously volatile region is entirely another .
In their coverage , such as it was , mainstream media outlets largely focused on Clinton ’s apparent self - contradiction — as her campaign reps gestured at contextual differences in an attempt to integrate her two remarks — or on her bids to cast Obama as a foreign policy neophyte .
However , for Rep. Dennis Kucinich , the biggest issue raised by Clinton ’s comments is n’t so much consistency as it is her character , and by extension her ability to effectively serve as America ’s president .
Here , Kucinich sounds off to Truthdig ’s Associate Editor Kasia Anderson about his concerns about Clinton ’s nuclear politics and their global implications .
Kasia Anderson :
What ’s your reaction to Sen.
Clinton ’s comeback to Sen. Obama about the possibility of using nuclear weapons against terrorists in Pakistan or Afghanistan ?
Dennis Kucinich : I think that that single comment by Sen.
Clinton raises questions about her fitness for the presidency .
In a week in which we observe the [ anniversaries of the ] tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , any American presidential candidate who rattles the nuclear saber must be viewed with the greatest amount of skepticism .
Given Sen. Clinton ’s commitment to the neocon doctrines of pre-emption , unilateralism and first strike , all Americans should be very concerned about how she would use the power of the presidency .
There ’s another question here , and that is :
Is she unaware of the fragility of conditions on the Asian subcontinent with respect to nuclear parity and first - strike concerns ?
Does she really mean what she says , and is she ready to take responsibility for potentially catalyzing a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan ?
Has she really thought this through ?
This really raises questions about whether she has the thoughtfulness to be able to lead the nation .
Given her willingness to attack Iraq without any evidence whatsoever , without having read any of the documents , without having done any of the research — is she that susceptible that she ’s willing to reach for the nuclear football ?
Anderson : Can you say more about first - use doctrine in this context ?
Kucinich :
There ’s a doctrine of first use which really is a violation of international law .
The first - use doctrine is the prelude to Armageddon .
We live in a time where the entire world understands the imperative of getting rid of nuclear weapons , and Sen .
Clinton ’s lack of awareness of the danger of that kind of rhetoric legitimates the first - strike doctrine among all nations .
And so , in some ways , her comments necessitate a deep discussion within the Democratic Party about what we stand for .
I believe in strength through peace , through enforcing the [ Nuclear ] Non-Proliferation Treaty , which at its heart calls for nuclear abolition .
We should be talking about nuclear abolition , not about first strike .
This desire for aggressiveness with nuclear weapons is chilling and requires the most intense scrutiny of someone ’s position on the most basic issue of survival of the planet .
Jonathan Schell was writing about these things decades ago — about the effects of the use of nuclear weapons .
I do n’t understand why [ Clinton ] feels this need to look tough with respect to weapons .
What kind of calculations could she possibly be making ?
Everyone knows that there is no survivability from a nuclear attack , and that the use of nuclear weapons brings about ecocide .
At a time when we ’re worried about the health of the planet , that someone would talk about using nuclear weapons shows a willingness to misuse power that could lead to the destruction of the planet itself .
We can all have these discussions about global climate change , and we all want to work together to improve the quality of life on the planet .
But the first - strike doctrine changes everything , because it invites the use of nuclear weapons , which destroy not only the target nation but the nation that uses them .
I think that what we ’ve seen in the past is a real weakness that comes from a willingness to use deadly force without regard to the facts .
This is not only a political question ; this is a question of character .
Coffee shop , post - protest .
Today ’s youth : there ’s a guy at the adjacent table at the coffee shop ; he has a Mac open with an email client and three IM programs .
And he has a cellphone out .
He just made a call to someone , then said “ I ’m over here ” and waved to the back of the cafe , and a guy six rows of chairs away waved back and came over .
Yes , I went to a protest Sunday afternoon .
My first one !
Or rather first counter - protest .
Granted , it consisted of seven guys standing on the other side of the block with signs and a flag , but I ’d just seen “ 300 , ” so naturally I equated our small numbers with the rightness of the cause , and imagined I was participating in the modern - day Battle of Thermopylae !
It was so cool !
Then we all vowed we were going to “ dine in hell ” that night , although the Falafel King restaurant would have to stand in for Hades .
AARRWWWWGGGH !
Well , that ’s what some will no doubt think I was feeling , so I might as well pretend and make them happy .
Let me be clear :
There are serious , reasonable critics of the war whose arguments deserve attention and consideration .
You generally do n’t find them at protest rallies .
There are people on the left who are concerned about , say , losing the values of the Enlightenment in order to accommodate misogyny in the name of cultural tolerance ; they promote different responses to the problem than those offered by the right , but are unlikely to march next to a fellow wearing a Hamas T - shirt or a Truther who thinks the Jews got advance warning on 9/11 so they could move their tanks of Gentile blood out of the giant Zionist Abbatoir on the 94th floor .
So I do n’t think that the march spoke for all critics of the war .
It spoke for those who think that “ Halliburton ” and “ Mission Accomplished ” represent piercing arguments that dispense with the need to even consider the matter of radical Islam and its enablers , or the possible downside of ceding the battleground .
No , the world is a garden of flowers and lambs , with one bad wolf .
( Who is also a racist wolf . )
Remove it , and peace can only flourish .
Anyway : I do n’t go to rallies or protests of any kind , because they ’re like Led Zeppelin concerts without the Led Zeppelin .
There ’s lots of people who agree that Led Zeppelin is incredible , but no actual Zep .
Instead you have giant banners , chants , giant puppets , drums .
These are not a few of my favorite things .
But I ’ve opined on these things based on reporting done from a distance , so I thought it would be a good idea to see it all first - hand .
Some fellows I know were assembling on the counter side , and I figured I 'd join .
See what all the fun 's about .
This example will disappoint people who enjoy good flaming craziness , since there was n’t much of the F - the- troops / Hands off North Korea / Bush = Hitler stuff .
It began here , with a large contigent from yawp.org or yarw.org or rowrlbazl.org , or something :
The actual gathering point was not Milo's , but an Army recruitment station , which was closed for Sunday – cowards !
– and as soon as enough people had assembled , they limbered up with a few basic slogans :
Hell no , we wo n’t go , we wo n’t die for Texaco .
To which one wants to respond , well , then do n’t .
Or perhaps
You must be drinking David , Mogen /
That explains your clichéd slogan or something like that .
We followed the group down the street , where they blocked traffic for four blocks ; the Man having been duly Stuck To , they returned to the sidewalk , threaded through a largely deserted mall , came out the other side and headed north , chanting : “ Who is the Terrorist ? ”
The chant - leader used the cadence that traditionally indicates an inquiry about the identity of the person responsible for letting out the dogs .
“ BUSH ! ” was the overall consensus , I ’d say .
Some of us answered “ Ahmadinihjad . ” Merry Pranksters , we !
Next week we ’re going to drop copies of Abbie Hoffman ’s book on the Stock Exchange floor .
Oh , there 's no end to our devlish monkey - wrenching .
Some random shots and stats .
I did n't get a shot of the people with a flag that said PACE , which I found impressive : Latin protestors !
They 'd been protesting for 2000 years .
They probably protested the first occupation of Palestine .
Number of home - made signs printed up that morning : beyond measure Number of people who asked if I was FBI because I was taking pictures : six .
Number of people who seemed confused when I said I was Section 31 : six Number of guys who threw his weight into a much larger counter - protestor then screamed the F word in front of two little girls while shouting about his eight years of military service : one Number of fellows who met the criteria above and insisted he had just had brain surgery : also one Number of men dressed up as penguin , or perhaps a nun impaled by a rusty car part : one Number of people whose idea of “ dialogue ” consisted of screaming “ WHAT DO YOU DO TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS ? YOU WATCH TV ” and then backing away with a look of pure fury on his face : one .
The Pure - Fury sorts were in the minority , though ; the protest was half Unitarian think - happy - thoughts people , and half Shaggy / Velma types .
Plus the Code Pink Men's Auxillary : Number of new colors for ‘ 07 offered in the Che button line : one ( it ’s blue ! )
Explanation offered by kind nice middle - aged lady who was asked why she was beating on that drum : it gathers the energy , and provides a beat and a focusing point .
I had to ask , because they always have drums .
They 'd do so much better with a brass band , like a New Orleans funeral .
A little mournful music , then some jazz .
But no , it 's always drums .
As the characters in anime always say with tiresome , ponderous voices , it has begun : Number of people incensed about Costco 's decision to abandon its no-questions - asked / no time - limit policy on consumer electronics return : one Conversational line not pursued with woman wearing a white trash bag that said “ IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE ” : since that Lennon song also encourages imagining the absence of religion , how do you feel about all those Unitarians here today ?
Or are they okay , because deep down you think that Unitarians are what you get after you ’ve successfully imagined no religion ?
Number of people who , judging from their first qestion of the counter - demonstrators , appear to believe that military service is a prerequisite for free speech : two Number of people carrying " NOT ONE MORE DEATH " signs who will show up next year if all the troops leave tomorrow and the killing continues :
Well , you answer that one .
That said , a lot of people in nice cars honked their support for the protestors .
A lot .
It was amusing to watch a steady stream of big expensive cars pour down Hennepin , honking approval at the NO BLOOD FOR OIL brigade .
I also struck by how shabby and empty Uptown felt .
When I lived there it had its gritty patches , but it was a going concern .
There ’s a big dead GAP store on one corner ; the Calhoun Square mall , mired for years in redevelopment limbo , might as well have tumbleweeds bouncing across the floor ( excess stock from the upscale tumbleweed - only boutique on the second floor ) .
In the summer the sidewalk cafes will fill up again , and the streets will be filled with enthusiastic young drunks and stick - thin spotty runaways who dress like it ’s 1977 , and it ’s London , and they ’re on the dole , and it ’s even worse for them than the real punks because they have full foreknowledge of the Thatcherite horror to come .
Video ?
Why , yes !
This Veoh version might work by Monday , but I 'm not hopeful ; I 've been having no luck with this host at all .
The credits are small and grainy , so I 'll provide a transcript : 1 . There was a protest , and there were n't any puppets 2 .
The chant was refined and perfected 3 .
The protest invaded the MALL , holiest of holy places where capitalism happens
There 's a backup here , but I expect the bandwidth will be consumed quite quickly .
I did see “ 300 , ” and count me among the fans .
Many reviewers found it chilly , empty and distant – visually stunning , as the cliché goes , but all shine and no boot .
I expected to feel the same way , based on the previews ; I expected to be impressed and awed but not quite engaged , except on that adolescent fanboy level that detects the presence of coooool , and responds with shiny eyes and an idiot ’s grin .
But it connected from the first frame to the last .
Neil Stephenson nailed the reason some despised it : it did not acknowledge the presence of Camp and Irony , which I ’d add are the two defining critical postures of the post - modern age .
It was what it was – but even more than that , it seemed to come from an era when everything was what it was , even the falsehoods .
Especially the falsehoods .
( I have no idea what that means , but it sounds transgressively post - modern . )
I enjoyed this observation :
The less politicized majority , who perhaps would like to draw inspiration from this story without glossing over the crazy and defective aspects of Spartan society , have turned , in droves , to a film from the alternative cultural universe of fantasy and science fiction .
Styled and informed by pulp novels , comic books , video games and Asian martial arts flicks , science fiction eats this kind of material up , and expresses it in ways that look impossibly weird to people who are n’t used to it .
Yes .
And this is something many people cannot bring themselves to do : draw inspiration from a particular culture at a particular time without glossing over the defects .
The people who ca n’t do that are , in my limited experience , the ones most likely to excuse evil in other cultures , and exaggerate evil in their own .
Last summer I read an excellent book about the Persian / Greek conflict – it ’s a wonderful primer if you know nothing , and a merry refresher if you know the basics .
The author reminded us that the Greeks were not all Noble Philosophers who spent their time sitting on the weathered steps of the Parthenon debating Truth and Beauty ; in the case of the Athenians , they were riven by the usual petty concerns of politics , and in the case of the Spartans , they were just plain batshite mad , at least to modern eyes .
But such judements make sense only to modern sensibilities , and he does a grand job of explaining Sparta in the context of its time .
As for the Persians , well , they had a grand and magnificent empire with astonishing accomplishments , and I had a new respect for them after reading the book .
Still rooted for the Spartans , though .
Because no matter how you adjust for politics or historical distortions or modern template - overlays or Marxist theory or any other Ism you clutch to your breast , the point of the story is universal : individuals defending liberty against tyranny .
( To use the crazy words . )
That said , you can split hairs : the individuals were drawn from the upper classes ; liberty was not extended to slaves ; tyranny as defined by the upper class might have meant certain liberties for the lower classes , according to the rules of the invading empire .
Maybe .
Point is , the Spartans were asked to kneel , and chose not to .
Every culture has a myth like this .
If they do n’t , they will be vassals to culture that do .
In the general non-specific post - modern sense that understands camp and irony , of course .
Anyway :
On the way out of the theater I looked around for signs of the culture we ’d just seen .
Anything : Greek architecture , Spartan Sporting Goods , Leonidas ’ Gym .
Nothing , of course .
The suburbs are not rich with classical architecture , and the rise of “ relevant ” education means that no one knows about the old names and the old stories anymore .
But over here , well , ah hah .
I pointed out a car to the Giant Swede : Mazda .
This was the Lord of Light in whose name the Persian king fought and conquered .
Ahura Mazda .
( Which explains those Maxfield Parrish posters for Edison - Mazda bulbs that may have confused many . )
The name survives now in the car company , chosen because it represented the ideas of wisdom and harmony set down by the Zoroastrian religion .
Also because it sounded like the auto - maker ’s name .
Imagine waking up in 4007 and discovering that 17 % of the population flies around in Allah or Yaweh or El - Ron personal transport vehicles : same thing .
To get home we took York , named after the Englishman ; it turned into one of the main north - south roads in Minneapolis .
They ’re arranged alphabetically .
Naturally , York is followed by Zenith .
But it is preceded by Xerxes .
It 's 2500 years after the battle .
People leave the theater , get into their Mazdas , and drove north on Xerxes .
History haunts our every step .
Particularly the ones that move backwards .
The DVD format fight has echoes of the 1980s VHS - Betamax war
The BDP - S300 now costs $ 499 - half what the firm 's first Blu-ray player cost at its launch six months ago .
Sony said growing demand for the next generation technology and falling production costs had allowed for the price cut .
Electronics company Toshiba sells its rival high - definition ( HD ) DVD player format for less than $ 300 .
Both companies have struggled to win customers for their respective systems as the battle of the formats is causing confusion , according to analysts .
They believe customers will wait to see which one the market will settle for in an echo of the 1980s Betamax - VHS videotape battle .
Most sales of Blu-ray discs are for use on the Sony Playstation 3 console , which contains a Blu-ray player - although film purists say that they are not ideal for watching DVDs .
Format war
The introduction of two next - generation formats has split both the electronics industry and Hollywood film studios .
Players and discs for Toshiba 's HD DVD and the Sony - led Blu-ray system went on sale last year .
The two technologies are incompatible but offer similar features .
Both are able to store large amounts of data , important for high - definition images and high - fidelity audio , and both use a blue laser to read information .
Used in games consoles , the two formats offer detailed graphics and stunning sound on one disc .
Backers of Sony's Blu-ray discs include Samsung , Dell and Apple , while NEC , Sanyo and others have been pushing Toshiba 's HD DVD .
In Hollywood , companies like Disney and 20th Century Fox have sided with Sony , while the supporters of HD DVD include Universal .
Earlier this year , South Korean firm LG announced it would build the first DVD player to play both rival high - definition DVD formats .
The player will be launched at the same time as a hybrid double - sided Blu-ray HD DVD disc , developed by Warner Bros , although no release dates have been given .

Digging through history to a time before agriculture , archaeologists from Cornell University and the University of California at Berkeley have found evidence of a village that was continuously occupied from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1000 as well as hints to the secret of the community 's remarkable longevity .
" My guess is , it all comes down to chocolate , " says John S. Henderson , professor of anthropology at Cornell and co-director , together with Rosemary Joyce of Berkeley , of the archaeological dig at Puerto Escondido , Honduras .
The type of ceremonial pottery uncovered by the archaeologists points to that region of Mesoamerica as a possible " Cradle of Chocolate . "
Excavations in the lower Ulúa river valley of northwestern Honduras , conducted by the North American scientists under the auspices of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History , have added at least 1,000 years to the documented story of a region where a hunting - and - gathering society settled and skilled pottery - makers flourished .
John Henderson
" Our deepest excavations at Puerto Escondido show building activity and obsidian tools but no pottery , " Henderson says .
" The pottery we 're finding , dating between about 1100 and 900 B.C. , shares the shape and decorative style of pottery from communities to the west , in present - day Mexico -- the Olmec art style of Mesoamerica 's first civilization . "
The same site also is yielding pre-Olmec pottery made between 1600 and 1100 B.C. , the earliest known period of pottery - making in Meso - and upper -Central America .
The author of The World of the Ancient Maya ( Cornell University Press , 1997 ) , Henderson says the Olmec people rose from the Neolithic culture of Mesoamerica and held forth until about 500 B.C. , at which time the later and better - known civilizations of the Maya , Zapotec and Teotihuacanos were in their formative stages .
Olmecs are generally associated with the Veracruz and Tabasco regions of Mexico , and the Puerto Escondido discoveries make that ancient village the eastern - most known site of Olmec activity .
One possible explanation for similar pottery styles is trade among geographically separated peoples .
The question for Henderson and Joyce became :
What social mechanisms were responsible for the similarities in pottery ?
" Trade is a typical interpretation , " says Joyce , the director of the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology and associate professor of anthropology at UC - Berkeley .
" But we suggest a more complex web of social relations , possibly centering on marriage relations between prominent families in separate areas .
Access to Ulúa valley cacao would be an important factor motivating distant partners . "
" Historic records show that when the Spaniards arrived , the best chocolate in all of Mexico and Central America was growing in the Ulúa valley , " Henderson says , noting that the finest cocoa beans come only from intense cultivation and special preparation techniques .
" Cocoa beans were so valuable , they were a form of currency for the Aztecs , the late Maya and presumably their predecessors .
It was a place where money literally grew on trees . "

Adding to evidence of the chocolatl connection ( to use the Aztec word for " warm liquid " ) is the type of pottery archaeologists are finding at Puerto Escondido : small , delicate vessels used for drinking .
Not surprisingly , the Cornell and Berkeley archaeologists also are finding heavier , more utilitarian pots for cooking and food storage .
But it is the delicate pottery , with its similarity to styles found farther to the West , that proves most intriguing .
Many of the small Olmec vessels are decorated with symbols of the supernatural , indicating their ceremonial use in rituals by the elite of the community , Joyce and Henderson report .
Most likely , Henderson says , the royal liquid in the Olmec ceremonial vessels was chocolatl , centuries later craved by Emperor Montezuma , who reportedly drank 50 portions a day .
" The Ulúa valley was an ideal place to grow cacao , which needs the understory shade of other trees and rich soil , " Henderson says , adding that the valley also was a likely gateway for the introduction of cacao , which is native to South America , to Mexico and upper Central America .
The rich , alluvial soil has been accumulating in the Ulúa valley for thousands of years and is found between successive levels of occupation in the village Henderson and Joyce are excavating .
Newer and newer versions of the community , they have determined , were built upon the burned or flooded remains of the previous ones .
As they prepare to resume excavations at Puerto Escondido in 1999 and puzzle over the discoveries made so far , the Berkeley and Cornell archaeologists sometimes mix up a mug of instant cocoa .
It is a poor imitation of the elite drink they believe may have drawn together distant peoples for 3,000 years .
Today , a Federal Judge in Philadelphia struck down a 1998 law that made it illegal for online content providers to allow children access to “ harmful ” material :
PHILADELPHIA —
A federal judge on Thursday dealt another blow to government efforts to control Internet pornography , striking down a 1998 U.S. law that makes it a crime for commercial Web site operators to let children access “ harmful ” material .
In the ruling , the judge said parents can protect their children through software filters and other less restrictive means that do not limit the rights of others to free speech .
“ Perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment protections , which they will with age inherit fully , are chipped away in the name of their protection , ” wrote Senior U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed Jr. , who presided over a four - week trial last fall .
The law would have criminalized Web sites that allow children to access material deemed “ harmful to minors ” by “ contemporary community standards . ”
The sites would have been expected to require a credit card number or other proof of age .
Penalties included a $ 50,000 fine and up to six months in prison .
The judge accepted the arguments of the opponents of the law that software filters and parental supervision are sufficient means to protect children from seeing inappropriate content online , and have the added benefit of not infringing on the right of adults to view such material if they wish .
The response of one of the government ’s attorneys to this argument is particularly galling :
“ It is not reasonable for the government to expect all parents to shoulder the burden to cut off every possible source of adult content for their children , rather than the government ’s addressing the problem at its source , ” a government attorney , Peter D. Keisler , argued in a post - trial brief .
In other words , the government knows better than parents what is appropriate for children .
This is only the latest in a long line of defeats for the Federal Government on this issue .
In 1997 , the Supreme Court struck down a 1996 law that would have banned online pornography which would have meant the end of tube videos hd xxx and other websites like it .
And , in the years since , the Supreme Court twice granted injunctions forbidding enforcement of the law because it found that the opponents of the law were likely to prevail .
And prevail they have .
One would like to think that this will be the end of it , but the government is likely to appeal this ruling .
Which is fine , because it will be good to have a good anti-censorship case coming out of the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court .
Full text of the opinion is here .
What is the most outrageous piece of news that is n’t being discussed ?
I would venture to say it is the strange tale of Dov Zakheim and the missing trillions .
I hear all kinds of numbers .
I hear 2.3 trillion from Rumsfield and I hear about one trillion that Zakheim ca n’t explain .
Still , you ’ll need to check the dates of Zakheim ’s days in the saddle as Pentagon Comptroller and then you can wonder to your hearts content .
There ’s no doubt the money is gone and there ’s no doubt about who should know where it went but ... what do I know ?
I know one trillion dollars is a lot of money .
Is n’t one trillion dollars a million million ?
Zounds !!!
Has the cost of the entire Iraqi incursion come to a trillion dollars yet ?
It certainly is n’t anywhere near 2.3 trillion .
Why is n’t this under discussion ?
Is it just too big a thing , too enormous to comprehend , that our minds go blank when we think about it ?
Hmmm ...
There are a number of researched sources for all of the details you need to get a grasp of the situation .
I ’m not going to go into that kind of detail here .
It ’s been done better than I can manage at places like here
and here :
this last link gives you many further links .
You might want to read some of this before you continue here .
And you should probably read this , by the author of the first link .
The man at the center of this sub rosa controversy is Dov Zakheim .
Here is what is said about him .
He ’s a dual national Zionist and also a Rabbi .
He ’s the co-author of this PNAC gem ...
or , he is n’t the co-author but he signed off on it and it was really written by Kristol and Kagan .
I read different things and , having been burned once , I ’m in no mood for putting anything out that is n’t just as close to the truth as I can get .
If you read the sources I have given and you extrapolate out to some degree you will find that Rabbi Zakheim is right there in the bed and under the covers snuggled up tight with all the other names that keep coming up .
You ’ll also find an alarming amount of connections to 9/11 .
WTF ?
Here are a few salient features that struck me .
He resigned in March 2005 when it was discovered that a a trillion dollars was missing .
On September 10th , 2001 ( note this auspicious ‘ night before Christmas date ) Rumsfield announced that 2.3 trillion was missing .
Now wait a minute ... does n’t this come to over 3 trillion dollars ?
Is Zakheim responsible for all of it or part of it ?
Is it a mere trillion for him and someone else lost the rest ?
I ’m relying on you to square this away for me .
This blog is interactive .
How can you not account for this amount of money in this day and age with computers ?
Why has this , along with other news , ( such as the WTC being near condemned status , prior to the attacks , because of billions in required refurbishments ) with which we are familiar , disappeared from the landscape ?
Most importantly , what was a dual nationality cat like Rabbi Zakheim doing in charge of the Pentagon ’s money supply ?
Forget that , what is Chertoff , another dual nationality cat doing in charge of Homeland Security ?
You might find a number of things in this article interesting , one of which is this , " Chertoff allowed scores of suspected Israeli terrorists and spies to quietly return to Israel .
In several cases , Israeli suspects working for phony moving companies , such as Urban Moving Systems from Weehawken , N.J. , were caught driving moving vans which tested positive for explosives .
On September 14 , Dominic Suter , the owner of the moving company , which was found to be a Mossad front company , fled to Israel after FBI agents requested a second interview .
One group of 5 Israelis was seen on the roof of Urban Moving Systems videotaping and celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center .
These Israeli agents were returned to Israel on visa violations .
These Israeli suspects , and others , who had apparently transported explosives in the New York area , were allowed to return to Israel without being properly interrogated or their presence and activities in the United States having been vigorously investigated . " ( 1 )
Does it all sound like science fiction to you ?
Put “ Chertoff dual nationality ” into Google and see if you have enough time in your life to read the things you find .
Any time you start looking into the rabbit hole you run across the same names .
There is this handful of people who constantly show up .
Why are there continuous connections to Israel ?
As I have said before , I do n’t enjoy having to reach these conclusions .
There is no more heavyweight subject than Israeli involvement in 9/11 .
There is nothing that causes more screeching and name calling , slander and opprobrium .
But ... every time you look and everywhere you look , the same names , the same connections , the same events pop to the surface of the lake like a dead body and smell as bad .
Now , either this is the most fantastic , most outrageous set of coincidences of which there is no parallel in human history or ... there is something to it .
What are so many members of one of the smallest groups of people in the world doing in so many sensitive areas of the American government ?
How come they have so many irrefutable connections to one of the biggest events in American history ?
Honestly , I just want some answers .
I do n’t know what to think and I do n’t like having to think about and speak about things that can make me a target of powerful interests that seem to be in control of a whole lot of bad shit .
Now , once again , either there is something to all of this or it is an unbelievable chain of coincidence that defies reason .
What do we make of this ?
This website had to remove it due to Zakheim ’s lawyers .
There ’s a lot of information from several sources here ...
... I do n’t speak to the truth of the contents .
I ’d just appreciate it if you would READ , THINK , REFLECT and REASON .
What I have placed before you is a small , small portion of what you can find which all speaks to the same thing .
And speaking of outrageous coincidences , what is Zakheim doing as Corporate Vice President of System Planning Corporation ?
... more freaking coincidences .
I ’ve got more coincidences than there are illegal immigrants .
Unfortunately for me , this has gone way past coincidence and the circumstantial .
This is some unknown animal hiding in plain sight .
I do n’t know what to call it .
It ca n’t be coincidence or circumstantial , there are enough grains of sand here to create your own beach .
It blares at me through klaxons .
It ’s screaming from rooftops .
It ’s dancing with ten thousand Broadway revues surrounded by all the lights of Las Vegas .
I have to conclude what I fear to conclude .
How do we come to empirical fact ?
We get there by repeating experiments , by observation and by weighing evidence to the point where doubt is removed from our conclusions .
I ’d really appreciate the readers weighing in with their thoughts and any further information they might have .
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck and looks like a duck and you see it mating with other ducks and producing more ducks ; what do you think it might be ?

Elcomsoft has discovered a backdoor in Intuit ’s Quicken software .
Millions of people worldwide have chosen Quicken as their financial software , in part because of Intuit ’s assurances that they have taken the steps to protect the privacy of their data by means of a highly secure password system .
The latest version of Elcomsoft ’s Advanced Intuit Password Recovery allows businesses and individuals to remove password protection from Quicken files .
Ã‚Â
Beginning with Quicken 2003 , Intuit protected its Quicken files with very strong encryption .
This protection made it impractical for people to use brute force techniques to discover passwords that would unlock Quicken files .
Ã‚Â
It appears , however , that Intuit included a backdoor in the product , from Quicken 2003 through Quicken 2007 .
This backdoor allows Intuit to offer their own affordable service whereby Intuit will unlock a customer ’s file .
To deliver this service , Intuit uses a 512 - bit RSA key known only to Intuit .
Before Elcomsoft ’s discovery of Intuit ’s backdoor , Intuit was the only organization that could unlock their customers ’ files .
Ã‚Â
“ It is very unlikely that a casual hacker could have broken into Quicken ’s password protection regimen , ” said Vladimir Katalov , Elcomsoft ’s CEO .
“ Elcomsoft , a respected leader in the crypto community , needed to use its advanced decryption technology to uncover Intuit ’s undocumented and well - hidden backdoor , and to successfully perform a factorization of their 512 - bit RSA key . ”
Ã‚Â
The existence of such a backdoor and escrow key creates a vulnerability that might leave millions of Quicken users worldwide with compromised bank account data , credit card numbers , and income information .

New Justice Dept. logs suggest more White House engagement in Attorneys firings Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 1 , 2007 Print This Email
This A second log of e-mails and documents that the Justice Department considers " privileged " has been released by the House Judiciary Committee .
The Committee 's Chairman , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , called the logs evidence of greater White House engagement in the firing of 8 US Attorneys in 2006 and 2007 .
" While the Committee appreciates the production of these logs as a first step toward responding to our subpoena , the logs only further highlight the need to review the listed documents , " Conyers said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" The information listed in these logs raise further concerns about the White House 's involvement in the process of hiring and firing US Attorneys , as well as the way that process was communicated to Congress . "
The two documents contain tables of materials used to discuss news media accounts of the firing of the Attorneys , as well as preparations for responses to inquiries from members of Congress .
Similar logs were released last Friday .
In related news , the Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law issued a subpoena today for former Deputy Attorney General James Comey , who was the second in command at the Justice Department when the firing of the US Attorneys began .
The committee 's chairwoman , Rep. Linda Sánchez ( D - CA ) , said in a statement , " I believe Mr. Comey can clear up some of the confusion created by the contradicting stories we 've been presented . "
Comey will testify on Thursday , May 3 .
On Friday , RAW STORY showed that the earlier set of logs suggested the Justice Department had considered employing the example of a former Attorney General who was said to have " tarnished " the administration of President Jimmy Carter in its responses to Congressional inquiries .
The PDF logs are accessible at these two links : Log one ; Log two .

Did you know our primitive brains were n’t wired very well to read this paragraph ?
Scientific research conducted by Walker Reading Technologies , a small Minnesota startup that has been studying our ability to read for the last ten years , has concluded that the natural field of focus for our eyes is circular , so our eyes view the printed page as if we ’re peering through a straw .
And a very bad - behaving straw at that , because not only do our eyes feed our brain the words we ’re reading , they ’re also uploading characters and words from the two sentences above and below the line we ’re reading .
Every time we read block text , we ’re forcing our brain to a wage a constant subconscious battle with itself to filter and discard the superfluous inputs .
This mental tug of war slows reading speed and diminishes comprehension .
When our ancestors first invented written language about 5,000 years ago , they unfortunately did n’t have armies of neuroscientists standing by to tell them block type was the wrong way to format their papyrus rolls .
But fret not .
Help is on the way .
Walker Reading Technologies ’ CEO and co-founder , Randall Walker MD , believes he and his team have developed a solution with a product called Live Ink that allows online publishers to improve reading speed and comprehension .
Live
Ink works by analyzing written language for meaning and language structure , and then applies algorithms that reformat the text into a series of short , cascading phrases .
It breaks complex syntax into simpler syntax , which makes it easier for the brain to absorb the material .
The company presented its latest findings yesterday at the sold out Digital Book 2007 conference here in New York .
( Click the thumbnail at left for an example of how Live Ink re-formats online text )
Early results have been encouraging .
According to Walker , a study funded by the U.S. Department of Education found that students who read text books in Live Ink are adding 10 - 15 percentile points on nationally standardized reading tests .
Non native English speakers are seeing similar improved proficiency .
A more detailed article about the technology and science behind Live Ink can be found here .
If the technology lives up to its promise , Live Ink represents a veritable breakthrough that could change the way people read online content .
With eyeballs moving from dead tree media to a screen near you , readability of online text will become a competitive differentiator for many online content providers .
In 2003 , the company signed a big licensing deal with Holt , Reinhart and Winston , one of the world ’s largest publishers of textbooks and a division of publishing giant Reed Elsevier .
The deal allowed HRW to integrate the Live Ink technology into the company ’s line of online text books .
Now that the company has proven its technology ( through the HRW deal , and Dept. of Education study ) , it ’s looking to aggressively expand by signing additional licensing deals with publishers of ebooks , blogs and newspapers .
The company has protected its intellectual property with a portfolio of international patents that its says covers 80 percent of the global economy .
The company was founded in 1996 , and has taken in a little over $ 4 million in angel capital from private investors and $ 400,000 in U.S. Department of Education grants in 2001 and 2002 .
The company is profitable .
Randall Walker tells VentureBeat the company is currently evaluating whether to fund its next stage of growth from cash flow or from a new funding round .
If the company pursues a new funding round , Walker says the company may for the first time entertain funding participation from top - tier VCs .
Although Live Ink offers the potential to improve world wide literacy and support the growth of screen - based reading , it still faces the challenge of overcoming our entrenched reading habits .
Since grade school , we were all taught to read block text .
It ’s not perfect , but it ’s comfortable and familiar .
Yet the Internet has a way of forcing rapid evolution of communication habits , especially when the communication methods are faster , easier and more direct .
One only has to look as far as email , cell phones , or recent innovations such as texting and Twittering to understand that we humans crave immediate communication .
If Live Ink is truly a breakthrough , those who use it will have competitive advantage over those who do n’t .
At a minimum , Digital Ink reminds us that as human evolution collides with Moore ’s Law , we ’re bound to learn more about ourselves .

How to build a religion ( and then watch it fade ) .
[ soundtrack for this post : theme from 2001 … play it in your head ]
The New York Times has a piece today about Zoroastrians .
The religion is fading , almost certainly to extinction .
After more than 3,000 years , one of the most important monotheistic religions is going to go away .
We can learn an important lesson about ideaviruses from religions , because they are in many ways the original ( and longest - lasting ) examples of the genre .
If you want to build a religion that spreads , here are some things to build into it :
Bias for evangelism
Sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders
Presumption that insiders are ‘ right ’ or ‘ blessed ’ or ‘ advantaged ’
Proscription against intermarriage without conversion
Forbid one gender to work outside the home
Central hierarchy that maintains the faith and settles disputes
Offer significant ( very ) long - term benefits to believers
Very few organizations have the ability to deliver on all of these opportunities , but in the secular world , many brands do most of them .
This works for Harley - Davidson ( and certainly the Hells Angels ) .
It works for the latest teenage trends .
It works for some politicians .
It even works for some computer operating systems and languages .
According to the Times , the Zoroastrians are fading away because they believe being good is just about enough and did n’t build enough of the elements of an ideavirus into their culture .
As they traveled the world , their attitude and hard work rewarded them with success and the ability to mix with other cultures .
As a result , they were successful as a people but a failure as a long - term growing religion .
It ’s a fascinating choice , is n’t it ?
How To Root Out A Liar Like An Interrogator
One of the best tools we all have at our disposal is information .
With information , we can make better decisions .
We can save money .
Life becomes generally a lot easier .
But what if someone is lying to you about something or holding back the truth ?
You ca n’t make a good decision based on bad information or lies can you ?
Take all the “ Free Disney Vacations ” people take unwittingly take advantage of .
These people do n’t know up front that the condo - tour they take as a requirement ends up being a timeshare hard - sell that very few people can escape without leaving a hefty deposit and signing a contract .
Missing information leaves us in the dark and vulnerable .
We make mistakes and stumble .
If the information being withheld affects us personally , we can suffer embarrassment and unnecessary expense .
Being lied to is no fun .
Especially in matters you consider personally important .
That ’s why rooting out the lies are so important .
If the subject matter is none of my business , I butt out .
But if it is my business , here are some of the strategies I use to get to the heart of the matter .
Ask lots of dumb questions
Now hear me out .
If you feel you are being lied to or the wool is being pulled over your eyes , it ’s time to start getting dumb .
Dumb like a fox .
If the person you suspect is lying is telling you a story .
Ask questions closely related to but unrelated to the lie itself .
For instance , if you are buying a car and you sense the dealer is trying to pad in some hidden charges it ’s time for some good old fashioned dumb questioning .
Something along these lines should work :
I need to know how many coats of paint are on the car ?
And is there an extra charge for paint ?
What do you guys do with the hubcaps after you sell the car ?
I have kids ; do you guys have car seats that match the interior ?
After you ’ve established how far you are willing to dig , then it ’s time to go in for the kill and attack the suspicion directly .
“ Hey , what ’s this BRB charge for $ 379.99 ?
On the Internet that stands for be right back .
Are you charging me for some Internet slogan ? ”
You might find out some car dealers have a sense of humor and it really was a charge for the slogan BRB .
It may feel weird to do , but in a situation like this , the dealer is under time pressure to make a sale , you are starting to eat away at his time .
Even though , he may seem like he has all the time in the world , he really does n’t .
Besides , what do you care if someone who charges you $ 379.99 for BRB thinks you are stupid ?
Use the Interrogator ’s questioning method
Ask the person to repeat their story .
Police interrogators are famous for this one .
And amazingly , it works equally well with kids , coworkers and spouses who are planning your surprise birthday party .
Here ’s how it works :
Someone tells you a story you suspect is a lie .
You sit and listen carefully to the story .
When they are done , you go back towards the beginning of the story and deliberately mess something up about the story so they have to tell it to you again .
Example :
You : “ You said you saw Uncle Al crossing the street when you realized you were n’t drinking and driving ? ”
Young driver : “ No , I said I saw a police officer as I was driving downtown , it reminded me I had n’t had a drink all day . ”
Their flaw of referring to a police officer as an it is another point in the story you can go back to for clarification .
You : “ Now tell me again what the thing was that reminded you ? ”
Young driver : “ huh ? ”
You : “ You tell such an entertaining story , I want to make sure I got it .
Before , you said “ it ” reminded you had n’t had a drink all day .
What was the it thing you were talking about ? ”
The key to this method is people who do n’t tell the truth expand on their lies to make the story more interesting .
After someone has told a long drawn out lie once or twice , the third time they start to get bored with it .
But not only that , they think of “ improvements ” to their story to cover their bases .
The only problem is , if you ’ve been keeping track , these new details will stick out like a sore thumb .
“ Ok , so what you are telling me is you saw a police officer dressed as a dog walking your uncle Al across the street right ? ”
When you have a clear example of a lie you can point to , you can leverage that to discredit the entire story .
“ You ’re obviously not telling the truth .
You were drinking and driving were n’t you ? ”
Use Time to Your Advantage
Drawing out someone ’s lie can take a very long time , so prepare yourself .
In fact , if you are determined to draw out the lie , plan on working the situation twice as long as you think the other person will talk to you .
Since you are prepared for the long drawn out conversation , and the other person is n’t you have a distinct advantage .
You ’ve heard the term “ breaking down the witness . ”
Time pressure is the influencing factor .
People who are lying do n’t have a lot of time .
They want to go in , tell the lie and get out as fast as possible .
If you lean back , pour some hot chocolate and take your shoes off without any rush at all , then the liar will feel the pressure from the first second .
Their instinct will be to build an even more convincing story so you ’ll buy it and let them go .
Not on your watch .
You ’ll get to the bottom of it .
Overall , it ’s no fun to be lied to or for you to operate on information someone is holding back .
It ’s painful and troubling when it involves you personally .
But when confronted with one of these situations , these are some good ways to root out the hidden information .

Senior doctors and medical experts in Haikou of Hainan Province are stumped as well .
Zhu , whose hair had turned gray in his 40s , recently started to grow new black hair on his head and develop acne like a young man .
His skin has begun to become satiny and delicate like a teenage boy's .
Many local medical experts have failed to determine the secret of why Zhu , a retired printing worker , has recently gained new youth .

Elizabeth Edwards : Why I called Ann Coulter David Edwards and Adam Doster
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
In front of a Republican - leaning crowd on Chris Matthew 's " Hardball " Tuesday , Ann Coulter received an unexpected phone call from Elizabeth Edwards , wife of presidential candidate John Edwards , asking the " journalist " to raise the level of public discourse in America above personal attacks .
" In the South , when somebody does something that displeases us , we like to ask them politely to stop doing it , " said Edwards .
" I 'd like to ask Ann Coulter too .
If she 'd like to debate on issues , on positions -- we certainly disagree with nearly everything she said on your show today -- but it 's quite another matter for these personal attacks . "
The call comes on the heels of a " Good Morning America " appearance yesterday where Coulter was asked about her homophobic cutdown of the former North Carolina Senator a few months ago .
" So I 've learned my lesson .
If I 'm going to say anything about John Edwards in the future , " she replied .
" I 'll just wish he had been killed in a terrorist assassination plot . "
Although Coulter flippantly agreed to a debate , Edwards kept pushing back .
" It did not start with [ yesterday ] .
You had a column a couple years ago which made fun of the moment of Charlie Dean 's death and suggested that my husband had a bumper sticker on the back of his car that said , 'ask me about my dead son . '
This is not legitimate political dialogue .
It debases political dialogue .
It draws people away from the process .
We can't have a debate about the issues if you 're using this type of language . "
Coulter later questioned why the presidential candidate did n't phone in himself , to which Elizabeth had a ready answer .
" I have n't talked to John about this call .
I 'm phoning in as a mother , " she said to much applause .
" I 'm the mother of that boy who died . . .
These young people behind you are the age of my children .
You 're asking them to participate in a dialogue that 's based on hatefulness and ugliness instead of on the issues and I do n't think that 's serving them or this country very well . "
When given time to respond by Matthews , Coulter railed on Edwards for what she deemed a first amendment violation .
" I think we 've heard all we need to hear , " she says .
" The wife of a presidential candidate is asking me to stop speaking .
No . "
On Wednesday , the Edwards campaign sent out a letter to supporters written by Elizabeth which explained " why I called Ann Coulter . "
" Last night I had an important talk with Ann Coulter and I want to tell you what happened , " Elizabeth Edwards wrote .
" On Monday , Ann announced that instead of using more homophobic slurs to attack John , she will just wish that John had been " killed in a terrorist assassination plot . "
The letter continues , " Where I am from , when someone does something that displeases you , you politely ask them to stop .
So when I heard Ann was going to be on ' Hardball ' last night , I decided to call in and ask her to engage on the issues and stop the personal attacks .
I told her these kinds of personal attacks lower our political dialogue at precisely the time when we need to raise it , and set a bad example for our children . "
" How did she respond ? " Edwards writes .
" Sadly , perhaps predictably , with more personal attacks .
John 's campaign is about the issues but pundits like Ann Coulter are trying to shout him down .
If they will not stop , it is up to us cut through the noise . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Hardball , broadcast on June 26 .

Banaz Mahmod 's body was found in a buried suitcase
Mobile footage
The body of Banaz Mahmod , 20 , was found in a suitcase buried in a garden in Birmingham last year .
Her father Mahmod Mahmod , 52 , and uncle Ari Mahmod , 50 , from Mitcham , south London , were both convicted of murder at the Old Bailey .
A third defendant , Darbad Mares - Rasull , was cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
Ari Mahmod was also found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
Mohamad Hama , 30 , of West Norwood , south London , an associate of Ari , has pleaded guilty to the murder .
Miss Mahmod was killed after falling in love with a man her family did not want her to marry .
Her father and uncle ordered the murder because they believed she had shamed the family , the three - month trial heard .
Banaz had made several attempts to warn police that her life was in danger , even naming those she thought would kill her .
In footage recorded following an earlier attempt on her life by her father in December 2005 , she said she was " really scared " .
However her statement following the assault was allegedly not taken seriously enough by investigating officers .
Several officers are being investigated as part of an internal review of the case by Scotland Yard 's Directorate of Professional Standards .
Banaz fled but later went back to her family and tried to carry on her relationship with boyfriend Rahmat Sulemani in secret .
Mr Sulemani broke down in tears when giving testimony , saying they had been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other .
He later said : " My life went away when Banaz died .
" The only thing which was keeping me going was the moment to see justice being done for Banaz . "
' Ultimate betrayal '
Banaz was urged to stay at a safe house but told officers she believed she would be safe at home because her mother was there .
She disappeared on 24 January and her decomposed body was discovered in Handsworth , Birmingham , three months later .
Her sister Bekhal , 22 , who is in hiding from the family , condemned her relatives for taking Banaz 's life .
She said : " To do this to their own flesh and blood was unforgivable .
Forgiveness is n't even a question .
They do n't deserve to be on this earth . "
After the verdict , Detective Inspector Caroline Goode , said : " Clearly there is no honour in killing ...
I think it is the ultimate betrayal for a parent to kill a child . "
CPS spokesman Paul Goddard said : " The murder of Banaz Mahmod by her father , uncle and their associates not only took away the life of a young woman , it left her boyfriend in fear of his life and also left other members of the family and the community in fear . "

Statement on the Iraq War Resolution Before the U.S. House of Representatives February 14 , 2007
This grand debate is welcomed but it could be that this is nothing more than a distraction from the dangerous military confrontation approaching with Iran and supported by many in leadership on both sides of the aisle .
This resolution , unfortunately , does not address the disaster in Iraq .
Instead , it seeks to appear opposed to the war while at the same time offering no change of the status quo in Iraq .
As such , it is not actually a vote against a troop surge .
A real vote against a troop surge is a vote against the coming supplemental appropriation that finances it .
I hope all of my colleagues who vote against the surge today will vote against the budgetary surge when it really counts : when we vote on the supplemental .
The biggest red herring in this debate is the constant innuendo that those who do n’t support expanding the war are somehow opposing the troops .
It ’s nothing more than a canard to claim that those of us who struggled to prevent the bloodshed and now want it stopped are somehow less patriotic and less concerned about the welfare of our military personnel .
Osama bin Laden has expressed sadistic pleasure with our invasion of Iraq and was surprised that we served his interests above and beyond his dreams on how we responded after the 9/11 attacks .
His pleasure comes from our policy of folly , getting ourselves bogged down in the middle of a religious civil war , 7,000 miles from home that is financially bleeding us to death .
Total costs now are reasonably estimated to exceed $ 2 trillion .
His recruitment of Islamic extremists has been greatly enhanced by our occupation of Iraq .
Unfortunately , we continue to concentrate on the obvious mismanagement of a war promoted by false information and ignore debating the real issue which is :
Why are we determined to follow a foreign policy of empire building and pre-emption which is unbecoming of a constitutional republic ?
Those on the right should recall that the traditional conservative position of non-intervention was their position for most of the 20th century — and they benefited politically from the wars carelessly entered into by the political left .
Seven years ago the Right benefited politically by condemning the illegal intervention in Kosovo and Somalia .
At the time conservatives were outraged over the failed policy of nation building .
It ’s important to recall that the left , in 2003 , offered little opposition to the pre-emptive war in Iraq , and many are now not willing to stop it by de-funding it , or work to prevent an attack on Iran .
The catch - all phrase ,  War on Terrorism ,  in all honesty , has no more meaning than if one wants to wage a war against criminal gangsterism .
It ’s deliberately vague and non-definable to justify and permit perpetual war anywhere , and under any circumstances .
Do n’t forget : the Iraqis and Saddam Hussein had absolutely nothing to do with any terrorist attack against us including that on 9/11 .
Special interests and the demented philosophy of conquest have driven most wars throughout history .
Rarely has the cause of liberty , as it was in our own revolution , been the driving force .
In recent decades our policies have been driven by neo - conservative empire radicalism , profiteering in the military industrial complex , misplaced do - good internationalism , mercantilistic notions regarding the need to control natural resources , and blind loyalty to various governments in the Middle East .
For all the misinformation given the American people to justify our invasion , such as our need for national security , enforcing UN resolutions , removing a dictator , establishing a democracy , protecting our oil , the argument has been reduced to this :
If we leave now Iraq will be left in a mess — implying the implausible that if we stay it wo n’t be a mess .
Since it could go badly when we leave , that blame must be placed on those who took us there , not on those of us who now insist that Americans no longer need be killed or maimed and that Americans no longer need to kill any more Iraqis .
We ’ve had enough of both !
Resorting to a medical analogy , a wrong diagnosis was made at the beginning of the war and the wrong treatment was prescribed .
Refusing to reassess our mistakes and insist on just more and more of a failed remedy is destined to kill the patient — in this case the casualties will be our liberties and prosperity here at home and peace abroad .
There ’s no logical reason to reject the restraints placed in the Constitution regarding our engaging in foreign conflicts unrelated to our national security .
The advice of the founders and our early presidents was sound then and it ’s sound today .
We should n’t wait until our financial system is completely ruined and we are forced to change our ways .
We should do it as quickly as possible and stop the carnage and financial bleeding that will bring us to our knees and force us to stop that which we should have never started .
We all know , in time , the war will be de-funded one way or another and the troops will come home .
So why not now ?
The Best of Ron Paul
Ingredients :
a YouTube video that you want to steal the music from for your collection .
For example , the MC Rove rap .
Who does n’t want to listen to that again and again ?
Not to be missed !
a means of downloading the video , for example DownloadHelper for Firefox , or one of the zillion online youtube video downloaders .
ffmpeg , an open source video manipulation program .
I checked mine out from Subversion and compiled my own , but there may be easier ways to get ahold of it .
a command line to run ffmpeg on .
This ai n’t no gui , baby .
Sorry .
Anyway — download the flv file .
See what you ’ve got , like this :
ffmpeg -i Rapping_Rove.flv
You ’ll get back a bunch of stuff , hopefully including something like this :
Input # 0 , flv , from ‘ Rapping_Rove.flv ’ :
Duration : 00:01:55.7 , start : 0.000000 , bitrate : 64 kb/s
Stream # 0.0 : Video : flv , yuv420 p , 320×240 , 29.97 fps(r )
Stream # 0.1 : Audio : mp3 , 22050
Hz , mono , 64 kb/s
Hey , there ’s an mp3 in there , trying to get out !
Score !
Let ’s help it .
Here ’s the magic command :
ffmpeg -i Rapping_Rove.flv -vn -acodec copy Rapping_Rove.mp3
And now you ’ve got the file Rapping_Rove .mp3 , ready to slurp into iTunes and put on infinite loop .
It ’s that easy !
Thanks to this posting on some mailing list which helped me figure out the magic command in the absence of comprehensible documentation for ffmpeg . :)
If all this is a little too much , the vixy .
net guys have an interface to do it for you on the web .
I am not sure however whether it actually extracts the mp3 out of the flv itself , or else pulls the audio out of the flv and re-encodes it as an mp3 , possibly losing precious sound quality !
But it ’s probably a better bet than this ffmpeg voodoo for 99 % of people .
HOW does a treasure chest boost a politician 's odds of getting nominated as a presidential candidate ?
Barack Obama did well in fundraising in the second quarter of the year , comfortably beating Hillary Clinton ( see chart ) .
Perhaps as a consequence , the future odds of him becoming the Democratic candidate are almost as good as Mrs Clinton 's , even though their respective poll ratings are much wider apart .
On the Republican side , John McCain 's dreadful financial position — he said recently that he has just $ 2 m remaining of some $ 11.2 m raised — is reflected in the poor odds of him becoming the candidate .

I 've always thought Cheney was way out there - the most Voldemort - like official I 've run across .
But even in my harshest musings about the vice president , I never imagined that he would declare himself not only above the law , not only above the president , but actually his own dark planet - a separate entity from the White House .
Maureen Dowd
Now we have it -- clear evidence that Cheney is again hiding , evading , avoiding the transparency and checks and balances that keep America safe and fair .
Today , the lamestream media are covering the story .
But , if they follow the same old M.O. , they will be off the story by tomorrow and on to the next kidnapping , the next off the wagon celebrity , the next siamese twins surgery , or an update on Paris , Anna Nicole or Michael Jackson .
Let 's try something different .
Tell them you want them to cover the Cheney story .
Tell them you want them to put investagive journalists on the story -- if they still have any .
Tell them that you want to hear about this more than about any of the distrations they usually waste the airwaves on .
Tell them failure to do so is failure to do their job to protect democracy .
Tell their advertisers that you do n't want to see more Paris Hilton , that you are disappointed in Larry King for giving her airtime .
Make two phone calls .
Send two emails .
Send two snail mail messages .
You ought to be able to do it in ten minutes .
Send this on to ten friends .
Cheney 's arrogant abuse of the constitution , the secrecy in which he 's operated has been going on since the first days he was in office .
He 's gone too far .
It 's time to call for hearings and investigations .
Reps conyers and Waxman should be subpoenaing Cheney current and former staffers to start building pressure .
There 's no need for a full impeachment .
It will never go that far .
As soon as Cheney sees the writing on the wall , he 'll get a note from his doctor and resign for health reasons .
I repeat .
Cheney will resign for health reasons as soon as the heat starts to build under him .
That 's okay .
We can prosecute after the 2008 elections are over .
So make the calls , send the emails and letters today .
Recruit your friends .
This is doable .
Keep the stories about Cheney coming .
Demand that the lamestream news network break their pattern and do their job .

About every third visitor who comes here is German , according to Jerzy Szynkowski , who guides people through the site .
Many are older , but only a few are die - hard Nazis , he said .
" That 's really just a few , not more than a few percent , " Szynkowski said , adding that he 's had mainly good experiences with German tourists .
" Neonazis do n't really come here . "
On this day , he 's guiding a group from Berlin and Cologne through the well - kept area .
Most are impressed by the size of the buildings that were all blown up by the Germans before the end of the war .
Many are sensing the oppressive atmosphere of this place , where Hitler lived for almost three years .
" These buildings are a shocking madness , " one visitor told German public broadcaster WDR .
" It 's a sign that something like this must never happen again . "
Another visitor agreed .
The ruins of Wolf 's Lair 's movie theater , where Hitler watched the trial and execution of the men who tried to assassinate him on July 20 , 1944
" This regime spent all this money to destroy everything and dirty a Germany that was once known for its scientific , literary and cultural achievements , " he said .
During summer , up to 3,000 people come to Wolf 's Lair in a single day .
The tour starts at the former barracks , passes never - used buildings for Hitler 's deputy , Martin Bormann , and ends at the completely destroyed Hitler bunker .
Only one of the bunker 's walls remains today : Nazi officials had ordered the building to be destroyed in Nov. 1944 .
A new memorial , macabre souvenirs
On Tuesday , the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt on Hitler , a new memorial will be unveiled to honor the German resistance .
Another memorial already exists exactly on the spot where Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg detonated a bomb that was meant to kill the dictator .
But outside Wolf 's Lair , souvenir merchants are trying to make a living by selling macabre items related to the place :
Among other things , they offer ashtrays in the shape of a skull and a chess game with SS officers and German soldiers and Hitler as king .
Update 2018 : The excellent Our World In Data has a Causes Of Death section .
Do you remember how we were all going to die of Ebola , then S.A.R.S. , and more recently Avian flu ?
Have you got the memo that the job creation program at airports is because Terrorism is such a big threat to your life ?
In England at the moment you are , according to the media , at great threat from drug dealing teenagers , and anyone younger than you in general .
And yet , here you are , reading safely .
So instead of tolerating idiots pretending to be journalists , I went looking for what we should really be wary of – what really does kill people .
Rational Fear
Many countries keep very good records for mortality statistics .
There is an international standard , known as ICD - 10 , for recording causes of death .
Records are submitted yearly to the World Health Organisation , which makes them available to the public .
I downloaded them , applied a bit of Python / MySQL / Django magic , and produced a searchable database of causes of death , called Rational Fear ( now defunct ) .
This allows you to search causes of death by country , sex , and age group .
Try it , it ’s quite instructive .
The Western world – killing yourself
The first thing you remember , because you already really know all of this , is that the older you get the more you are at risk .
In Western countries you ’re quite safe into your fifties and sixties , after which chances of death pick up significantly .
People in their late seventies , eighties and nineties die of heart attacks , cancer , and pneumonia .
As you work down through the years , you stop being at risk of dying .
In the U.S.A , Japan , and all of Western Europe , no male age group under 80 lost more than 1 % of it ’s numbers for any recent year .
For women , you have to go above 85 , above 90 in many countries , to get more than 1 % loss in any one year .
What ’s even more interesting , is that the very small number that did die , largely killed themselves , in a manner of speaking .
Let ’s work backwards through the ages , seeing where the real risk lies .
The biggest killer of 60 year old men in the U.S.A , Japan , Austria , Denmark , and many other developed countries is lung cancer .
Wikipedia has a great graphic on the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer .
Skip down to 40 – heart attacks and lung cancer are still high , but the biggest killers are n’t those that make the papers :
Alcoholism is the biggest killers of 40 year old men in Germany , Finland and Hungary .
Suicide is the biggest killer of 40 year old men in Canada , Denmark , Sweden and Japan .
Cars are the biggest killer of 40 year old men in Portugal , and the second biggest in France .
The biggest killer of women at 40 in the U.S.A. , England , Japan , France , Spain , Poland , all over , is breast cancer .
The second biggest killer of women tends to be the same as the men .
Suicide , Alcohol , and road traffic accidents continue to take Western men and women down through their 30s and 20s .
In teenage years alcohol drops away , leaving road traffic accidents and suicide as pretty much the only causes of death amongst Western teenagers of both sexes .
Below teenage years , children die so rarely that the figures start to be meaningless .
Once we get all the way back to babies , the danger increases sharply under 1 year old .
About 10 to 20 times more babies die before their first birthday than between their 1st and 2nd birthday .
The causes of death amongst Western babies are varied and often unknown .
The first or second recorded cause of death in most countries is Sudden infant death syndrome , also known as ‘ cot death ’ or ‘ crib death ’ .
The rest of the world – killing each other
Outside of the ‘ Western ’ world , many less rich countries run an effective health service , and report mortality statistics to the World Health Organisation .
Aside from the presence of ‘ Unattended death ’ in the records , because many die away from medical attention , the main causes of death are similar .
For example , Peruvian women in their 80 ’s die of pneumonia , heart attacks , and cancers .
Belarusian men in their 80 ’s die of heart attacks .
The differences start to appear at the ages when you really should n’t be dying .
At 40 , heart attacks and cancers ( lots of lung cancer ) are still high , like in the richer countries .
Alcoholism and suicide are big threats in Eastern Europe , but road traffic accidents drop off somewhat .
The noticeable additions , which are almost absent in richer countries , are murder and H.I.V .
Being shot is the biggest cause of death of men aged 40 to 44 in Ecuador and Colombia .
H.I.V. is the biggest killer of both sexes in their 40 ’s in Thailand .
As you go down through the years , murder and H.I.V. rapidly become almost the only causes of death in non-Western countries .
The main cause of death for men of all age groups between 15 and 40 in Brazil is a gunshot wound inflicted by a third - party .
In Argentina H.I.V. overtakes murder when men reach 30 , as it does in Haiti at 35 .
Prior to entering what seems to be the sex and gun years around 15 or 20 , children in less rich countries die in such small numbers that it ceases to be meaningful .
Drowning comes up in Cuba , and road traffic accidents in Chile and Peru , but in very small numbers .
Dangerous drugs ?
The only illegal drug that features in mortality statistics is Heroin .
For men in Scotland between 20 and 35 it is the most important cause of death ( after 35 suicide takes over ) .
In most other countries is features in the 20 – 35 age group , because they have few other causes of death , but even then usually below several varieties of suicide ( each method of suicide has it ’s own code ) , and several types of road traffic accident .
The drug that does kill people is , of course , alcohol .
Staying alive
If you ’re reading this , you are probably over 1 year old and under 80 .
Relax .
You ’re very unlikely to die .
Judiciary Committee sends contempt charges against Miers , Bolton to full House Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 25 , 2007 Print This Email This The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday formally recommended criminal contempt charges against former White House counsel Harriet Miers and chief of staff Joshua Bolten for their failure to comply with an investigation into the firing of eight US Attorneys .
The charges were presented in a resolution that , if passed by the House as a whole , would present a case for criminal proceedings to the US Attorney for the District of Columbia .
But the justice department has said it will not purse the charges because the White House has invoked executive privilege .
The House Judiciary Committee voted 22 - 17 along party lines to send the Democratic measure to the full House .
Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , introduced the resolution accompanied by a 52 - page report outlining the criminal charges against the administration officials .
The hearing also brought harsh denunciations of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who Democrats accused of obfuscating his own role in the attorney firing scandal .
" They have sent the Attorney General here to lie and to insult us with his lies , " said Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y .
Republicans sought to convince members of the majority not to get involved in a prolonged constitutional fight over executive privilege and accused Democrats of pursuing a partisan witch - hunt without basis in facts .
Democrats argued the contempt filing was necessary because of the utter disrespect with which the White House treated members of the committee .
There is no legal basis for a witness subpoenaed by Congress to simply refuse to show up for a hearing , as Harriet Miers did when she was called to testify earlier this month .
" We have rolled over with every claim of executive privilege , " said Rep. Adam Schiff , D - Fla. , who called Miers snub of the committee " beyond the pale . "
Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , said the contempt charges were being sought " only as a last resort . "
" What I am not open to is accepting a take - it - or leave it offer , which would not allow us access to the information we need ... this is the only proposal we have received from White House counsel , " Conyers said .
Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner said he thought the White House would prevail in court against criminal charges .
Instead , he suggested a civil lawsuit that would focus narrowly on the claim of executive privilege in this particular case .
Rep. Chris Cannon , R - Utah , said Democrats on the committee have offered no evidence of corruption and should not file contempt charges until they can prove inappropriate conduct within the White House .
The amendment failed on a 14 - 23 party - line vote .
Conyers said the lack of evidence was the fault of the White House for not cooperating , and said that is exactly why the charges were being filed .
" We ca n't get to the evidence before we get to the witnesses and the documents that we 've requested , " Conyers said .
President Bush has invoked executive privilege in refusing to allow Miers to appear before the committee .
She did not show up to testify when called July 12 ; Bolton has refused to hand over White House documents sought by Democrats on the committee .
Republicans said Bush is entitled to confidential advice from his aides , and Congress does not have the right to subvert their ability to have private conversations with advisers .
Conyers said the president has yet to " personally " invoke privilege and reminded the committee that testimony has yet to reveal whether Bush was directly involved in the decisions leading to the attorneys being fired .
The White House has offered to allow Miers to testify before the committee behind closed doors but refused to allow for a transcript of the proceedings .
If the full House approves the contempt charges , Miers and Bolton are still unlikely to face any criminal penalties .
The Justice Department on Tuesday informed the committee that it would not pursue criminal contempt charges against White House officials when executive privilege is invoked .
Brian A. Benczkowski , principal deputy assistant attorney general , sent a letter to Conyers citing the department 's " long - standing " position , " articulated during administrations of both parties , that the criminal contempt of Congress statute does not apply to the president or presidential subordinates who assert executive privilege , " according to The Associated Press .
Developing ...
After a very thorough description of the series of events which culminated in many complicit Democratic and Republican Senators killing the New Mexico impeachment resolution after it had successfully survived the leaderships attempts to kill it in 3 committees , this open letter requests the Governer use his powers to restart the process :
Democracy for New Mexico -… Therefore , I , Joe Thornton , am appealing to your best side to use your natural born ability to persuade the Senate to reconsider / revisit SJR5 by allowing the Senate Judiciary Report to be accepted on the Senate Floor and debated and voted upon as soon as possible .
This very special Senate Floor Session should be absolutely on the up and up , with no trickery or slight of hand allowed .
The Senate Floor hearing should designate a specific time so We The People would be able to attend the session and observe from the gallery the hearing .
It would also be proper to allow select people in the gallery to speak to the issue , either for or against , which would require some microphones up in the Senate Gallery .

Tony Blair has said he will go to the gym more often
The Cambridge University study looked at over 25,000 people .
It found that stopping smoking , exercising more and eating better could give you the life expectancy of a person 11 to 12 years younger .
The government is backing the research , and launching an initiative to encourage people to make small changes to improve their health .
This is about showing people that there are everyday , simple choices they can make in their lives which will have a direct impact on their health
Caroline Flint , Health minister
The study , carried out in Norfolk , is part of the European Prospective Investigation and Nutrition ( Epic ) study , involving over half a million people in 10 European countries .
The UK arm of the study is following 25,663 men and women aged between 45 and 79 years old since 1993 , looking at their diet , environment , lifestyle and health .
The participants have regularly filled in questionnaires about their diet , lifestyle and health and had periodic check - ups from nurses .
These latest results from the study showed eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day can give you the life expectancy of someone three years younger .
Not smoking turned the clock back by four to five years .
Even increasing exercise by a moderate amount can take up to three years off .
But the amount of exercise someone would need to do to achieve that depends on their job .
An office worker would need to do one hour of exercise , such as swimming or jogging , every day , while a person with a moderately active job , such as a hairdresser , would need to take 30 minutes exercise a day .
People with active jobs , including nurses and bricklayers , do not need to do any extra exercise - as their work is strenuous enough .
' Daunting prospect '
Professor Kay - Tee Khaw , who led the study , said : " Many of us find it difficult to change our usual lifestyle .
" However , there is increasing evidence that even relatively small changes can make a big difference to our health and well being . "
Government ministers highlighted the research as they launched an initiative called Small Change Big Difference , aimed at showing people how to improve their health by making small easily available changed to lifestyle .
Prime Minister Tony Blair has vowed to make lifestyle changes such as using the stairs instead of the lift , visiting the gym more often and boosting his intake of fruit and vegetables .
Public Health Minister Caroline Flint said : " We all know that we should eat more fruit and veg and get more exercise to improve our health , but sometimes improving our own health can be daunting .
" This is about showing people that there are everyday , simple choices they can make in their lives which will have a direct impact on their health .
" Eating an extra piece of fruit or walking up the stairs can help people add years to their lives . "
James Johnson , chairman of the British Medical Association , said : " Today 's campaign is to be welcomed .
" But we would also like to see funding questions urgently addressed if the agenda is to make a sustained difference to the health of our communities . "
This is n’t just a note — it ’s a work of art .
And it ’s about 100 shades of amazing .
I ’ll let Rich explain : “ I had a party at my house once in college , and one of our roommates who was going to be gone was really scared that someone was going to sleep in his bed .
so , instead of , you know , telling us not to use his room , he decided to post this hilarious note that only an aspiring personal injury lawyer could produce . ”

Ludwig von Mises argued that ballots are to be preferred to bullets because while they bring about similar outcomes , the former has less bloodshed than the latter .
Murray Rothbard ( Mises 's student ) criticized this conclusion ( which Mises shared , after all , with David Hume ) , because , he argued , democratic rule promotes political arrangements — not social optimality — as the ultimate end .
This hardly seems like an improvement , and it guarantees no less amount of bloodshed .
Still , both men would have been intrigued by the election crisis brewing down in Mexico , and it is unlikely that bullets or ballots would have produced something as enjoyable ( or possibly even as socially optimal ) .
The crisis is reminiscent of the 2000 presidential elections in the United States .
Andrés Manuel López Obrador is Mexico's Alberto Gore , the candidate on the short end of the election , down by an incredible one - half of one percent of the popular vote , forced into playing the legal cards necessary to avoid having the election certified for his opponent .
The left - wing candidate ( and former Mexico City mayor ) who did n't distance himself enough from Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez , López Obrador has staged seemingly impromptu rallies in the capital calling for a recount , an impressive feat the unlovable Gore would never have been able to accomplish in the days following November 7 , 2000 .
López Obrador calls the vote - count rigged and demands both a vote - by - vote recount and for the election to be declared illegal by the Mexican Supreme Court , bypassing the country 's special election court .
His opponent , the former Secretary of Energy Felipe Calderón , playing the part of Mexico's Jorge Bush , collected more legal votes ( which is different from the total votes cast ) and is now accepting congratulatory calls from foreign leaders and setting forth goals for a six - year term .
( The Mexican press is calling him the " virtual President - elect " of the Republic . )
Correctly assuming that many people simply want the dreaded election to end and are indifferent to the results — is there a peso 's worth of difference between these two lifelong pols ?
—
Calderón is hoping that by acting presidential , he can turn public opinion against López Obrador , making him seem like a sore loser and a pest .
But the situation is not all that simple .
First , presidential elections are as corrupt in Mexico as they are anywhere , and memories linger from 1988 , when another Mexico City mayor , Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas , lost an election many thought stolen by Carlos Salinas ( a character so reviled in Mexico today that he spends most of his time outside the country ) .
Although many outside observers called this year 's election quite clean , many bad feelings from that time remain .
On the other hand , elections have become little more than advanced auctions of stolen goods , so that supporters of the losing candidates have more reason to rally and complain about the election results .
This is much less of a problem in countries where power is less centralized and where redistributive urges are restrained .
When the losing candidates ' supporters wail in the streets about democracy denied , their indignation might well be fueled by lost income transfers they would have received had their candidate won .
( But since whoever wins needs to appease his opponents ' supporters , the policies turn out to be similar no matter who wins .
Remember that joke that is updated repeatedly in the United States : " They told me that if I voted for Gore ( or Kerry ) I 'd get a growing welfare state .
And they were right .
I voted for Gore ( or Kerry ) , and I got a growing welfare state . " )
Second , a vote - by - vote recount might be great for López Obrador 's case because the few recounts allowed so far have reduced Calderón 's lead from 400,000 votes to 230,000 .
But the problem with this solution is twofold .
There are some pesky Mexican laws , with which both candidates agreed to comply prior to the election , that forbid recounts of vote packets except in cases in which tampering is discovered .
You can't change the rules of a game ( or an election ) after it has started .
Also , who is to say that vote stealing in favor of Calderón in ( say ) northern Mexico would not be balanced by vote stealing in favor of López Obrador in southern Mexico ?
Again , consider the case in the United States .
Any possible smarmy electioneering in South Florida in 2000 in favor of the Republicans was surely countered by equally smarmy electioneering in places like Philadelphia , Milwaukee , New Mexico , and Oregon in favor of the Democrats .
Squeaky clean elections , if they ever take place , are unlikely to change the eventual results of corrupt ones .
Perhaps this has always been the case , although it surely did n't matter in previous decades — certainly throughout US history prior to FDR — when executive powers were more restrained , making the president irrelevant to the average person .
Third , even if the current Calderón margin is correct , the closeness of this election reflects the growing resentment toward US intervention in the affairs of other countries throughout Latin America .
While this resentment against " neoliberalism " has contributed to the electoral success of leftists in Venezuela , Bolivia , Argentina , Chile , and Peru , it had not yet fully surfaced in Mexico which is , after all , the most dependent of any Latin American country on trade with the United States .
With free trade , such resentment would not exist today .
But the fact is that for many countries , trade with the United States requires IMF and World Bank loans and comes with strings that reward politically well - connected industries .
Indeed , if trade were truly free , it would n't require trade treaties ( such as NAFTA and CAFTA ) with tens of thousands of pages of confusing ( read : easy - to - violate ) rules or a court that makes criminals of those who engage in voluntary exchanges unapproved by treaty signatories .
It 's no surprise that Calderón 's strongest support comes from those regions that benefit the most from regulated trade with the United States , while López Obrador 's support comes from areas that are excluded and therefore suffer from such treaties .
The result is a mess in Mexico , and neither Mises nor Rothbard would be surprised by it .
Rothbard , in fact , would surely have welcomed it , because any event that has the effect of reducing the legitimacy of the state increases the realm of social cooperation — as was happening in the United States throughout the 1990s .
Mises was close friends with Otto von Habsburg , whose family once ruled Mexico under a model that , whatever its faults , endeavored to decentralize power and respect the rights of the individual .
Many countries — not the least of which being Mexico — would benefit from finding models that accomplished the same .
Under decentralized government , close elections might still make for enjoyable standoffs , but the stakes would not be nearly so high .
“ There is something comical , and maybe silly , about relying on kids , ” said Paul Romer , a professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business .
“ It seems risky . ”
But Mr. Romer noted that it was getting tougher to pick the winners among start - ups .
Young people , Mr. Romer said , may be better equipped than investors , who tend to be in their 30s or older , to see nuances and identify trends .
“ The people making the decisions may not appreciate some of the small differences that might be apparent to end users , ” he said .
Those end users include Mariana and Tatiana Megevand , who live in Geneva .
Last year , Neil Rimer , their uncle , heard the girls , 14 and 12 , talking about one of their favorite Web sites , Stardoll.com .
The site lets visitors create and dress up virtual paper dolls .
Mr. Rimer is not just an uncle but also a venture capitalist , a partner with Index Ventures , based in Geneva .
He decided that his nieces ’ interest constituted one of the better tips he had heard in a while .
“ The next Monday I went in and talked about it with my partners , ” he said , “ and that week we were on the phone to the company . ”
Index and other firms , including the venerable Sequoia Capital , have invested more than $ 10 million in Stardoll this year , and the company has moved to Geneva from Finland .
Mr. Rimer says he still talks to the girls about what they like and what they would improve .
He has given them some incentive , too : a small stake in Stardoll that could be valuable if the company prospers .

People will only wake up to the destruction of their civil liberties when it is too late to do anything about it .
Tony Blair was a ' handy villain ' for the film
That is the fear driving a new documentary film which aims to do for civil liberties what Fahrenheit 9/11 , Michael Moore 's anti-George Bush polemic , did for the anti-war movement .
Director Chris Atkins wants Taking Liberties to shake the British public out of their apathy over what he sees as the dangerous erosion of traditional rights and freedoms under Tony Blair .
" This film uses shock tactics .
We needed to be unashamedly populist .
" We wanted to give people a slap around the face and then they can go away and unearth some of the more complex cases , " says Atkins .
But although it shares a producer - and some stylistic tricks - with Fahrenheit 9/11 , Atkins is wary of too many comparisons with Moore 's film .
Tony Blair was a " handy villain " , he says , but it is not enough to try and pin the blame on one political leader who is , in any case , standing down soon .
" We did n't want to make the British Fahrenheit .
We did n't just want to say ' this guy's an arsehole , let 's get rid of him ' .
" This issue is far more important than one leader .
Once you give up traditional liberties such as free speech and the right to protest you are not going to easily get them back , " says Atkins .
Personal freedom
Tony Blair has often insisted that he understands the need to balance new police powers with the protection of civil liberties - but he is also confident he has public opinion on his side when it comes to fighting terror .
Brian
Haw has been a thorn in Labour 's side ( PIC : Marc Vallee )
His argument , as he explains in an archive clip in the film , is that it would only take one more atrocity to silence the civil libertarians , and have people asking why he had not gone further .
Atkins ' argument - told through a mix of animation , news footage and interviews - is that Labour has over - reacted to the terror threat , using it as an excuse to bring in a series of alarming curbs on personal freedom .
" If I had died , I would not have wanted the constitution to be shredded on my behalf , " says Rachel North , who was injured in the 7 July attacks , at one point .
There are interviews with Walter Wolfgang - the veteran peace campaigner ejected from the 2005 Labour conference and briefly held under anti-terror laws for heckling Jack Straw - and Maya Evans , arrested for breaking the ban on unauthorised protests in Westminster for reading out names of soldiers killed in Iraq near the Cenotaph .
Sinister tales ?
David Bermingham and " the NatWest Three " , the bankers extradited to America on fraud charges , and Parliament Square protester Brian Haw , also feature .
It can happen to anyone .
It is n't just middle class lefty protesters
Chris Atkins , director
Analysis : Blair and liberties
The film also tries to highlight what Atkins sees as the more absurd aspects of new anti-terror laws .
There is much footage of gleeful protesters trying to outfox baffled - looking police officers , struggling to apply the new laws .
But there are more apparently sinister tales too .
In one sequence , climate change protesters picketing an airport are held for a day and a half under anti-terror laws before being released in an unknown location , without phones or money , and told not to speak to each other again .
Atkins claims the film is " politically neutral " - the only MPs to give their views are Conservatives Boris Johnson and Ken Clarke and former Labour minister Clare Short .
Rendition flights
But he says his requests for interviews with senior Labour figures , such as Mr Blair and Jack Straw , were rejected - and found himself being held under anti-terror laws as he attempted to buttonhole Home Secretary John Reid at last year 's Labour conference .
" We actually interviewed Geoff Hoon but then he refused to appear on film , " he adds .
Climate change protesters were arrested under anti-terror laws
Mr Hoon 's comments , on the issue of rendition flights , will appear instead in an accompanying book , which like the film will be released next Friday , 8 June .
Atkins is a recent convert to the civil liberties cause .
Until two years ago , he was a producer of low - budget dramas in Scotland , mostly known for his work with director - and former lead singer of punk band The Skids - Richard Jobson .
He says he raised the cash for Taking Liberties by borrowing from friends and persuading his girlfriend to mortgage her flat - " something she wo n't let me forget . "
As a result , he says , he is conscious of avoiding the sort of dull but worthy film that will be seen " by about seven people " .
' Lefty protesters '
He keeps interviews with " civil liberties nerds " - as Liberty chief Shami Chakrabati describes herself at one point - to a minimum , focusing instead on the personal stories of those who have fallen foul of new anti-terror laws .
" It can happen to anyone .
It is n't just middle class lefty protesters , " says Atkins .
" It is n't just people you read about in the papers .
A lot of people have n't gone out of their way to find trouble .
Trouble has found them .
" That was the message we wanted to get across - if it can happen to them it can happen to you . "
Atkins ' only hope is that , with an initial release on just 20 cinema screens around UK , in London and other big cities , it will create enough of an impact to break through to the mainstream audience at which it is aimed .

Trackbacks Virtual Analogies , Physical Searches , and the Fourth Amendment :
Here 's the quick version of the facts .
The cops think that Ray Andrus may have downloaded child pornography onto his home computer , so they go to his house to do a " knock and talk . "
Andrus lives with his elderly parents , and Andrus 's elderly father is the only one home .
The father consents to the cops searching his home and any computers there .
The cops take away a computer , and then search it off - site using computer forensic software .
They quickly find child pornography .
Okay , now here 's the interesting twist .
After the agents discover the child pornography , they learned that the child pornography files were accessible to users only using the son's user profile , which was protected by a password that the father did not know .
That is , a user wanting to find the file would need to know the son 's password to see it ; to another user , the file would be hidden .
How could that happen ?
As I have explained [ D ] igital evidence searches generally occur at both a " logical " or " virtual " level and a " physical " level .
The distinction between physical searches and logical searches is fundamental in computer forensics : while a logical search is based on the file systems found on the hard drive as presented by the operating system , a physical search identifies and recovers data across the entire physical drive without regard to the file system .
Most users think of computer searches as occuring at the virtual level , because that 's the user experience .
But computer forensic software works at the physical level : it treats the hard drive as a physical device that contains millions of zeros and one , not as a virtual " box " of information accessed through an operating system .
User profiles and most password protection operate only at a virtual level , so a goverment forensic analyst operating at a physical level would n't even notice the difference unless he was specifically looking for it .
Why does it matter ?
Well , it matters because the answer to the legal question seems to hinge on whether you apply the Fourth Amendment from a virtual perspective or a physical perspective .
From a virtual user 's perspective , the child pornography was hidden to the father ; it was behind a password - protected gate .
Under these facts , the father could n't consent to a search because he would lack common authority over it .
From a physical perspective , however , the file was present on the hard drive just like all the other information .
Under these facts , the father could consent to the search because he had access rights to the machine generally .
It 's the classic
The Court divided on which perspective to take .
The majority ( Judge Murphy , joined by the recently - arrived Judge Gorsuch ) did not directly address the question of " common authority , " relying instead on the " apparent authority " doctrine .
Under the apparent authority doctrine , officers can rely on third - party consent if they reasonably conclude that a person has the right to provide consent even if later turns out that he does n't .
This was a sensible move by the majority , because the apparent authority doctrine focuses more on the physical perspective that the officers have rather than a virtual perspective that a user has .
Viewed from the physical perspective , the investigators reasonably did not know about the user profile and reasonably believed that the father had rights to consent to that part of the hard drive .
Judge McKay dissented , and instead adopted a virtual perspective .
To Judge McKay , the virtual perspective was the only one that mattered : a computer file was a container , and a password - protected computer file was a locked container .
Using forensic software to look at a computer from a physical perspective was therefore avoiding the virtual locks .
Judge McKay argued that officers should not be allowed to rely on the apparent authority from the physical perspective without first making an inquiry into whether there might be password protection of some kind from a virtual perspective .
I think the majority is probably right , but it 's a tremendously interesting case either way .
How do you measure the reasonableness of a belief when understandings of what computers are and how they work are so different among typical users and forensic analysts ?
Should the law follow the understandings of the experts who understand the techology or the general users who do n't ?
Thanks to Related Posts ( on one page ) : Another Clash Between Virtual And Physical Perspectives in Internet Law : Virtual Analogies , Physical Searches , and the Fourth Amendment : The Tenth Circuit has handed down an opinion on how the Fourth Amendment applies to computers that raises a fascinating clash between virtual analogies and physical facts .
The case involves the effect of user profiles and password protection on third - party consent rights , which turns out to be an issue that has a lot of practical importance for computer forensic searches ; it 's certainly come up in discussions within the government , and now for the first time a court has suggested the framework for an answer .
The case is United States v. Andrus
Here 's the quick version of the facts .
The cops think that Ray Andrus may have downloaded child pornography onto his home computer , so they go to his house to do a " knock and talk . "
Andrus lives with his elderly parents , and Andrus 's elderly father is the only one home .

It 's the classic problem of perspective that I wrote about in the Georgetown Law Journal in 2003 : the facts hinge on whether you take a physical ( external ) or virtual ( internal ) perspective .
The Court divided on which perspective to take .
The majority ( Judge Murphy , joined by the recently - arrived Judge Gorsuch ) did not directly address the question of " common authority , " relying instead on the " apparent authority " doctrine .

WASHINGTON , July 2 — President Bush ’s decision to commute the sentence of I. Lewis Libby Jr. was the act of a liberated man — a leader who knows that , with 18 months left in the Oval Office and only a dwindling band of conservatives still behind him , he might as well do what he wants .
The decision is a sharp departure for Mr. Bush .
In determining whether to invoke his powers of clemency , the president typically relies on formal advice from lawyers at the Justice Department .
But the Libby case , featuring a loyal aide to Vice President Dick Cheney who was the architect and chief defender of the administration ’s most controversial foreign policy decision , the war in Iraq , was not just any clemency case .
It came to symbolize an unpopular war and the administration ’s penchant for secrecy .
Even as he publicly declined to comment on the case , Mr. Bush had privately told his aides that he believed Mr. Libby ’s sentence , to 30 months in prison , was too harsh .

Software developed for the Classmate could run on the XO Chip - maker Intel has joined forces with the makers of the $ 100 laptop .
The agreement marks a huge turnaround for both the not - for - profit One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) foundation and Intel .
In May this year , Nicholas Negroponte , the founder of OLPC , said the silicon giant " should be ashamed of itself " for efforts to undermine his initiative .
He accused Intel of selling its own cut - price laptop - the Classmate PC - below cost to drive him out of markets in the developing world .
" What happened in the past has happened , " Will Swope of Intel told the BBC News website .
" But going forward , this allows the two organisations to go do a better job and have a better impact for what we are both very eager to do , which is help kids around the world . "
Nicholas Negroponte , founder of One Laptop per Child , said : " Intel joins the OLPC board as a world leader in technology , helping reach the world 's children .
Collaboration with Intel means that the maximum number of laptops will reach children . "
Intel inside
The new agreement means that Intel will sit alongside the 11 companies , including Google and Red Hat , which are partners in the OLPC scheme .
It will also join rival chip - maker AMD , which supplies the processor at the heart of the $ 100 laptop .
" Intel 's apparent change of heart is welcome , and we 're sure they can make a positive contribution to this very worthy project for the benefit of children all over the world , " read a statement from AMD .
Initially there are no plans to switch the processor to one designed by Intel .
However , the servers used to back - up the XO laptops , as they are known , will have Intel technology at their core .
Decisions about the hardware inside the XO laptop would be made by OLPC , said Mr Swope .
" OLPC will decide about which products they choose to offer or not offer , " he said .
OLPC , however , indicated that it would consider using Intel chips in its machines in the future .
Walter Bender , head of software development at OLPC , told the BBC News website that he believed OLPC would eventually offer different computers with different hardware .
" I think we will end up with a family of products that run across a wide variety of needs , " he said .
" Intel will be part of that mix . "
Price test
In addition , the partnership will have a practical pay off for software developers .
" Any software you build is going to run at least on our two platforms , " said Mr Swope .
The $ 100 has already been tested in many countries An application developed for the XO laptop should work on the Classmate and vice versa .
" That 's the exciting thing for me , " said Mr Bender .
Currently both laptops are being tested in schools around the world .
In parallel , OLPC is finalising orders for the first batch of computers .
Participating countries are able to purchase the XO in lots of 250,000 .
They will initially cost $ 176 ( £ 90 ) but the eventual aim is to sell the machine to governments of developing countries for $ 100 ( £ 50 ) .
Intel says it already has orders for " thousands " of Classmates , which currently cost over $ 200 ( £ 100 ) .
Like the OLPC machine , Intel expects the price to eventually fall .

What are these ?
Posted by Pete McBreen 23 Jul 2007 at 19:51
I wrote this article for InformIT back in 2002 , and someone on Reddit discovered it this week .
“ While Java and C# have been receiving all of the publicity of late , a lot of software is still being written in C and C ++.
Indeed , many traditional languages such as COBOL , FORTRAN , and Ada are still in widespread use .
Although I harbor a certain fondness for COBOL , and have written more Java code over the past five years than is probably good for me , I ’m finding more and more that I ’m drawn back to C and C ++. ”
“ I ’m coming back to C and C++ in part because I prefer stable development environments , and because I ’ve come to appreciate the power of object - oriented scripting languages , particularly Ruby .
Ruby is evolving rapidly , but then I do n’t try to write really long - lived code in a scripting language .
I use scripting languages for code that I want to be able to write rapidly , to test ideas or to implement some valuable functionality quickly . ”
Java is not in the news as much , but Ruby is growing in popularity thanks to Rails .
Overall I still stand by what I wrote back then ,
“ What this means for developers is that the future of C and C++ is secure for a long time .
Other languages might have nicer development environments and be marginally more productive , but for the core business logic of mission - critical applications I still prefer C and C ++.
I ’d choose other languages for the rapidly evolving parts of the application such as the user interface and the web front - end , but for the core of the application I have nothing but praise for C and C ++. ”
I wonder how many Rails apps out there have some key bit of functionality coded in C while Ruby handles the rest of the application ?
Many of us have seen service agreements that specify that the terms could be changed at any time without notifying the user .
Well , a recent court decision could change all that .
Service providers should not be able to change their terms of service arbitrarily without notifying their registered users , according to the judges in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit .
The decision on the case of Douglas v. Talk America ( PDF ) could affect how web site operators handle changes made to user agreements , regardless of what the user originally agreed to .
The case involved an AOL voice customer named Joe Douglas whose account was transferred to Talk America when Talk America purchased that segment of AOL 's business .
Talk America changed the terms of Douglas ' contract , which he did not notice for a number of years because his service and billing continued on as expected .
Upon discovering the change , however , Douglas filed a class action lawsuit against Talk America , but the company moved to compel arbitration — as per a change to the terms of service .
Talk America argued that the updated terms of service was freely accessible via the company 's website and that Douglas could have checked it at any time .
The District Court handling in the case ruled in favor of Talk America , but Douglas appealed the decision .
The Ninth Circuit disagreed heavily with the original ruling , saying that it was not reasonable to expect Douglas to check the company 's web site every day just to see if the terms of service had changed .
" Parties to a contract have no obligation to check the terms on a periodic basis to learn whether they have been changed by the other side , " wrote the judges .
" Indeed , a party can't unilaterally change the terms of a contract ; it must obtain the other party 's consent before doing so ...
This is because a revised contract is merely an offer and does not bind the parties until accepted . "
But what if the original user agreement involved signing away rights to be notified of subsequent changes ?
There is some question as to whether this ruling would also affect that type of agreement , but as Eric Goldman of the Technology & Marketing Law Blog says , it 's relatively safe to assume that the decision applies to this situation , " despite contract provisions putatively permitting unilaterally posted website amendments which put the onus on users to check back frequently for updates . "
As TechDirt points out , many lawyers are still pushing this type of unilateral change stipulation as part of new terms of service agreements .
It 's clear from the Ninth Circuit 's decision that the judges feel that users need to be notified whenever a change is made to an agreement , and there are some sites that already do this by e-mail or via a notice on the web site .
Some site operators even go so far as to require users to agree all over again every time a change is made by forcing them to read the new agreement when they log in .
Would you be more likely to buy a product that is 45 percent off , or the same product in a storewide 25 percent off sale with an additional 25 percent off that product ?
A new study suggests shoppers are more attracted to the double discount , even though it involves less savings .
In department store tests , double discounts increased the number of purchasers , sales volume , revenue and profit .
In the case of a 25 percent off sale with an additional 25 percent off for a certain product , math - challenged consumers assume they are getting a 50 percent price break , the researchers found .
In reality , they are getting about a 43 percent discount , because the second discount is taken on the reduced amount after the first discount .
On a $ 100 product , they pay $ 56.25 , not $ 50 .
" When consumers have to deal with more than one percentage at a time , they make errors that can be costly , " said Akshay Rao , professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management .
And what 's costly for the consumer can be profitable for a store .
" The effects of consumer miscalculation when confronted by multiple percentage changes can benefit firms at the expense of numerically challenged consumers , " write Rao and colleague Haipeng Chen .
Their findings will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Consumer Research .

The Perfect Xen 3.0.1 Setup For Debian
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial provides step - by - step instructions on how to install Xen ( version 3.0.1 ) on a Debian Sarge ( 3.1 ) system .
Xen lets you create guest operating systems ( * nix operating systems like Linux and FreeBSD ) , so called " virtual machines " or domUs , under a host operating system ( dom0 ) .
Using Xen you can separate your applications into different virtual machines that are totally independent from each other ( e.g. a virtual machine for a mail server , a virtual machine for a high - traffic web site , another virtual machine that serves your customers ' web sites , a virtual machine for DNS , etc. ) , but still use the same hardware .
This saves money , and what is even more important , it 's more secure .
If the virtual machine of your DNS server gets hacked , it has no effect on your other virtual machines .
Plus , you can move virtual machines from one Xen server to the next one .
I will use Debian Sarge for both the host OS ( dom0 ) and the guest OS ( domU ) .
In an additional section at the end I will also show how to create a virtual local network with virtual machines , with dom0 being the router .
This howto is meant as a practical guide ; it does not cover the theoretical backgrounds .
They are treated in a lot of other documents in the web .
This document comes without warranty of any kind !
I want to say that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Install The Debian Host System ( dom0 )
You can overall follow these instructions , but with a few changes :
However , it 's important that you type linux26 at the boot prompt to install a kernel 2.6 system .
dom0 's FQDN in this example will be server1.example.com , so I specify server1 as Hostname and example.com as Domain name .
server1.example.com 's IP address will be 192.168.0.100 in this tutorial .
When it comes to the partitioning , I select Manually edit partition table .
I create the following partitions :
/ boot 100 MB ( Primary ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) ( ext3 ) ( Bootable flag : on <-- important , otherwise your system will not boot ! )
100 MB ( Primary ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) ( ) ( <-- important , otherwise your system will not boot ! ) swap 1GB ( Logical ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning )
1GB ( Logical ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) / 2GB ( Logical ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) ( ext3 )
2GB ( Logical ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) ( ) / vserver the rest ( Logical ) ( Location for the new partition : Beginning ) ( ext3 )
( Side note :
You can also install everything in one big partition ( as described here : http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_debian_sarge), but then you have to keep in mind that the Grub stanzas I describe in this howto are slightly different .
For example , when I write that I add
title Xen 3.0.1 / XenLinux 2.6.12-xen0
root ( hd0,0 )
kernel /xen.gz dom0_mem=65536
module / vmlinuz-2.6-xen0 root=/dev/hda6 ro console=tty0
to / boot / grub / menu.lst then you should probably use
title Xen 3.0.1 / XenLinux 2.6.12-xen0
root ( hd0,0 )
kernel / boot / xen.gz dom0_mem=65536
module / boot / vmlinuz-2.6-xen0 root=/dev/hda6 ro console=tty0
in that file instead ... )
When the Debian installer prompts Choose software to install : I make no selection and go on ( dom0 should run as few software as possible in order not to be vulnerable to attacks .
To the outside world it will be accessible only over SSH . ) .
2 Configure dom0 's Network
Because the Debian Sarge installer has configured our system to get its network settings via DHCP , we have to change that now because a server should have a static IP address .
Edit /etc / network / interfaces and adjust it to your needs ( in this example setup I will use the IP address 192.168.0.100 ) :
vi /etc/network / interfaces
# /etc/network / interfaces -- configuration file for ifup ( 8 ) , ifdown ( 8 )
# The loopback interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
# The first network card - this entry was created during the Debian installation
# ( network , broadcast and gateway are optional )
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.0.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1
Then restart your network :
/etc/init.d/ networking restart
Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add some nameservers : AdvertisementAdvertisement
vi /etc/resolv.conf
search server
nameserver 145.253.2.75
nameserver 193.174.32.18
nameserver 194.25.0.60
Then set dom0 's hostname :
echo server1.example.com >
/etc/hostname
/bin/hostname -F /etc/hostname
3 Install Xen
There are two ways to install Xen : install the binary package from the Xen website , or compile Xen and the Xen kernels from the sources .
Advertisement
The first way is easier , but it has the disadvantage that the domU kernel that comes with the binary package has no support for quota and iptables , both features that I need in my virtual machines ( domU ) .
Plus , the dom0 kernel has no support for the dummy network driver , which might come in handy for more advanced network setups .
In chapter 3.1 I describe how to install the Xen binary package which is recommended for beginners ( skip chapter 3.2 and continue with chapter 4 ) .
If you need quota and iptables in your virtual machines , then skip chapter 3.1 and continue with chapter 3.2 where I show how to install Xen from the sources .
I just spoke with Dan from NY .
We had a good conversation about Internet ideas and doing fun things with the new wave of web opportunities .
Dan told me about his idea ( no one steal it ) to create a lunch meet web application for his college .
Basically , if you 're not in class , maybe you can find out about someone you 'd like to talk to , and join them for lunch .
Cool .
Maybe I could have a quick lunch with someone who is in Biology one year ahead of me .
Maybe I can pick their brain about how to do better in some killer courses .
I can have lunch with some people who want to play ultimate frisbee on Sunday afternoon .
I can have lunch with someone who took that film class , and see if I should take it too .
I can have lunch with someone who would like to learn about and possibly help me with a cool web app for bringing hungry like minded students together .
I was pleased to get a call request after so long , b/c this experiment basically died down after the first two days .
I kind of was scared of it getting out of control , and it did n't .
But now part of me wishes it had grown .
I 'm just so pleased that I got to talk to some interesting people that I would never normally have had a chance to speak with .
I 'm also glad that I was able to help in the act of reaching out to someone .
Just to chat .
All our barriers are imaginary .
Well , Dan may be the last person I speak to through this .
It was fun doing this , and I definitely have to say , that even in its small scale , this was a positive and successful experiment , given that I started it in less than an hour .
I have many more ' silly ideas ' , and I plan to play with them for some time .
Unless I have more people to call .

Italy blocks trial of CIA agents over alleged kidnapping of Muslim cleric
• Constitutional court asked to annul the trial , the Italian Justice Ministry says
• Osama Nasr Mostafa Hassan allegedly kidnapped in 2003
Adjust font size :
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
The Italian government has moved to block the trial of 26 Americans , mostly CIA agents , in connection with the alleged kidnapping of a Muslim cleric more than four years ago .
Italy 's constitutional court is being asked to annul the trial , scheduled to start June 8 , the Italian Justice Ministry told CNN on Thursday .
The case was considered largely symbolic because none of the Americans is in custody in Italy and the Italian government has not asked for their extradition to Italy .
Thirty - five people have been charged in the case -- 26 Americans and six Italians would stand trial for kidnapping and three Italians would stand trial on a charge of complicity .
All were indicted last month .
The proceedings revolve around the alleged kidnapping of Osama Nasr Mostafa Hassan , an Egyptian - born Muslim cleric , also known as Abu Omar , in February 2003 .
At the time of his disappearance , Milan prosecutors were investigating him for alleged links to terrorism .
Prosecutors allege that a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials seized him , eventually flying him to Egypt , and used torture as part of an interrogation there .
In an earlier interview , former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer said the Italian military secret service had approved the operation , and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction .
But the Italian government of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has vigorously denied having authorized Hassan 's kidnapping , which it called illegal .
Human rights groups condemn the practice known as " extraordinary rendition , " saying suspects have often been sent by the U.S. to countries that practice torture .
Washington acknowledges making secret " rendition " transfers of terror suspects between countries , but denies using torture itself or handing suspects over to countries that do so .

FOR EXAMPLE : One evening last week , my girlfriend and I were getting intobed .
Well , the passion starts to heat up , and she eventually says " I do n't feellike it , I just want you to hold me .
" I said " WHAT ??!!
What was that ?!" So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear ...
" You 're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for meto satisfy your physical needs as a man . "
She responded to my puzzled lookby saying , " Ca n't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you inthe bedroom ?
" Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night , I went to sleep .
The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time withher .
We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big , bigunnamed department store .
I walked around with her while she tried onseveral different very expensive outfits .
She could n't decide which one totake so I told her we 'd just buy them all .
She wanted new shoes tocompliment her new clothes , so I said lets get a pair for each outfit .

She must have thought I wasone wave short of a shipwreck .
I started to think she was testing me becauseshe asked for a tennis bracelet when she does n't even know how to playtennis .
I think I threw her for a loop when I said , " That 's fine , honey .
" She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement .
Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said , " I think this is alldear , let 's go to the cashier .
" I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out , " No honey , I do n't feellike it .
" Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffledWHAT ?
" I then said " honey !
I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while .
You 'rejust not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfyyour shopping needs as a woman . "
And just when she had this look like shewas going to kill me , I added , " Why ca n't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you ?
" Apparently I 'm not having sex tonight either .
Report details CIA prisons in Europe
By Joe Kay
9 June 2007
A report released Friday by the Council of Europe confirms that the CIA has used interrogation centers in Europe , including in Romania and Poland , to secretly hold and torture prisoners captured in Afghanistan , Iraq and other parts of the globe .
The report is the most detailed description of a secret program initiated by the US government , with the collaboration of Europe .
In addition to Poland and Romania , many European and other powers have taken part in the program , including Germany , Italy , Britain and Canada .
An earlier report from the council released in June 2006 provided some information on the program , and singled out 14 European governments for complicity .
The report was prepared by Dick Marty , a rapporteur for the council , which is tasked with monitoring human rights in Europe .
It was issued the same day as a trial began in Italy against CIA agents suspected of involvement in capturing one of the prison network ’s victims ( see today ’s article on CIA trial in Italy ) .
“ What was previously just a set of allegations is now proven , ” the report began .
Providing a portrait of lawlessness on an international scale , it noted , “ Large numbers of people have been abducted from various locations across the world and transferred to countries where they have been persecuted and where it is known that torture is common practice .
Others have been held in arbitrary detention , without any precise charges leveled against them and without any judicial oversight — denied the possibility of defending themselves .
Still others have simply disappeared for indefinite periods and have been held in secret prisons , including in member states of the Council of Europe , the existence and operations of which have been concealed ever since . ”
The CIA program examined by the report is merely one part of this broader system of detention and abuse ( including Guantánamo Bay as well as the network of prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan ) .
“ We believe we have shown that the CIA committed a whole series of illegal acts in Europe by abducting individuals , detaining them in secret locations and subjecting them to interrogation techniques tantamount to torture , ” Marty wrote .
The newest report by the Council of Europe is based on extensive testimony from current and former intelligence officials in Europe and the US .
Marty also obtained raw data on flights in Europe in order to trace the movements of CIA planes transporting prisoners .
Known within the US government as the “ High - Value Detainee Program , ” the system of secret detention was established shortly after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
A presidential directive signed at that time substantially increased the powers of the CIA , exploiting the “ war on terror ” to establish a network of prisons that could be used as part of future wars planned by the US .
In addition to Poland and Romania , the report indicates that there is some evidence that detention or processing centers were also located for some time in Diego Garcia , which is overseen by the UK but houses a US military base , and Thailand , which the report says was the location of the first CIA “ black site ” interrogation center .
But as the program was developed , it was Poland and later Romania that were the principal countries used by the CIA .
In developing contacts with these countries — which were selected in part because of their economic dependency and their eagerness to establish relations with the US — the CIA sought to ensure unilateral control over the prisoners .
The US intelligence agency established direct ties with the military of these countries , bypassing all but top - level civilian officials .
Of those who had knowledge of the program , the report singles out several high - ranking officials , including former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former Romanian President Ion Iliescu .
Agreements were reached with these countries in order to allow the CIA to operate outside any legal constraints of the host country .
“ I consider that the stated US policy has , in fact , on the pretext of guaranteeing security , intentionally created a framework enabling it to evade all accountability , ” the report stated .
The CIA sought deliberately to remove itself from “ conventional democratic controls in the foreign countries . ”
While those originally transferred to Poland were alleged top officials in Al Qaeda , including Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohamed , the types of prisoners broadened as the program expanded .
The report states that among those imprisoned in Romania were “ leaders of branches of suspected ‘ support networks ’ for the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan ” and “ suspected leaders of terrorist factions in the Middle East , ” in addition to leaders of the Taliban .
These categories are broad enough to include anyone considered harmful to US interests in the Middle East .
As evidence of its assertion that secret CIA prison camps were operated in Poland and Romania between 2002 and 2005 , the report cites the testimony of intelligence officials and the fact that flight recordings for CIA planes tend to correspond with the capture of significant prisoners by the US .
In addition , the team that prepared the report analyzed “ hundreds of pages ” of aeronautical data , which demonstrates that “ in the majority of cases these CIA flights were deliberately disguised so that their actual movements would not be tracked or recorded .... ”
Dummy flight plans were filed in order to disguise the destination of CIA - operated planes , an example of which can be found here .
The report also devotes a significant amount of space to depicting the conditions faced by prisoners caught up in the program .
It describes truly horrendous conditions of isolation , psychological abuse and torture .
The conditions were designed deliberately to dehumanize prisoners and destroy their will .
According to the report , prisoners were taken to their cell by “ strong people who wore black outfits , masks that covered their whole faces , and dark visors over their eyes . ”
They were stripped and kept naked for weeks .
A common feature at the beginning of the prison time was a four - month isolation regime .
“ During this period of over 120 days , absolutely no human contact was granted with anyone but masked , silent guards . ”
Physical torture was also used .
Prisoners were subjected to extreme temperatures , regulated by airflow from a single hole at the top of a prisoner ’s cell .
“ There was a shackling ring in the wall of the cell , about half a metre up off the floor , ” the report states .
“ Detainees ’ hands and feet were clamped in handcuffs and leg irons .
Bodies were regularly forced into contorted shapes and chained to this ring for long , painful periods . ”
In addition , prisoners were subjected to sensory deprivation and overload .
They were at times bombarded with loud music or other sounds , including “ distorted verses from the Koran , or irritating noises — thunder , planes taking off , crackling laughter , the screams of women and children . ”
Marty condemns in particular the role of European governments in facilitating the CIA program and attempting to obstruct the council ’s investigations .
“ Many governments have done everything to disguise the true nature and extent of their activities and are persistent in their uncooperative attitude , ” the report states .
“ Some European governments have obstructed the search for the truth and are continuing to do so by invoking the concept of ‘ state secrets . ’ ” Within the later category , the report singles out in particular Germany and Italy .
Many countries , as well as NATO , did not respond to questionnaires distributed by the investigation .
A further section of the report details the case studies of captured individuals that highlight the complicity of different governments , including Khaled El - Masri ( Germany ) , Abu Omar ( Italy ) and Maher Arar ( Canada ) .
European governments continue to deny involvement in or knowledge of the CIA interrogation program .
The current Polish president , Lech Kaczynski , issued a statement that Poland has never housed a prison , and a similar statement was released by former Romanian President Iliescu .
Paul Gimigliano , a CIA spokesperson , claimed not to have read the report .
Without explicitly denying its contents , he declared , in what amounted to a veiled threat , “ Europe has been the source of grossly inaccurate allegations about the CIA and counterterrorism .
People should remember that Europeans have benefited from the agency ’s bold , lawful work to disrupt terrorist plots . ”
Bush himself admitted in September 2006 the existence of the CIA prisons , at which he said an “ alternative set of procedures ” were used to interrogate detainees .
However , he provided no information on where the prisons were located .
At the time , Bush insisted that there were no more prisoners at the secret facilities .
However , he also insisted that the program was necessary and would have to be continued .
In November 2006 , Congress passed the Military Commissions
Act with bipartisan support , granting the president wide latitude to authorize the CIA to use abusive interrogation methods .
Last week , the New York Times reported that Bush is preparing to issue a new directive that will permit the CIA to continue abusing prisoners in countries around the world .

LONDON , Nov. 16 ( UPI ) --
The British clinic that initially told a man his body had rid itself of HIV now says the man did not have the virus in the first place .
" It is probably there was never any evidence of him having the HIV virus , " the Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust admitted .
" We do n't know exactly what happened .

The clinic initially told Andrew Stimpson , 25 , of London , he had contracted the virus that causes AIDS and later told him that by some miracle , his body had rid itself of the disease .
Stimpson said Wednesday he had lost " all confidence " in the clinic , the Mirror reported .
It brought us Swedish meatballs , Billy bookshelves and endless queues on the London North Circular on Saturday afternoons .
Now Ikea is going one step further and opening the Ikea Hostel , where customers can stay overnight if they have n't finished their shopping .
Later this month , Ikea Norway will let shoppers sleep overnight in one of its two Oslo warehouses , an operation that will last a week .
" It will be like an alternative hostel , " said company spokesman Frode Ullebust .
" There will be the regular dormitory with lots of beds stacked up together .
We will also have a bridal suite , with a round bed and a hanging chandelier , and the luxury suite , where customers can enjoy breakfast in bed , " he said .
Family rooms will also be available for parents and children to join into the Ikea fun .
None of the guests will be charged for their stay .
Mr Ullebust said that , as far as he knew , this was Ikea 's first foray into the hotel business .
Every night , the 30 lucky few will be able to stack up on meatballs , Norwegian salmon and cranberry mousse , as Ikea is offering free dinner and breakfast at the usual canteen .
Whereas Brits may associate the Swedish furniture giant with screaming kids , traffic jams in the parking lot and an occassional riot when a new warehouse opens , it seems Norwegians see a trip to Ikea as the ultimate tourist attraction .
" Around 900,000 visitors come to visit Ikea during the summer holidays .
It 's more than one of the biggest attractions in Norway , the Holmenskollen ski jump , gets in one year , " claimed Mr Ullebust .
" We have five Ikea stores in Norway , all situated next to the four biggest cities , which are all in the south in the country .
We found that people from the north of Norway include a visit to Ikea as part of their holidays , " said the spokesman .
" The Ikea Hostel will make the destination complete . "
Overnight stayers can check in to their new abodes from 10 pm , an hour before closing time , but will have to be quick in the morning .
" The shop opens at 10 am so if they are lazy , people might get woken up by shoppers testing out their mattresses , " said Mr Ullebust .
Customers will also be able to take their bedsheets home afterwards .
" It 's a nice souvenir , " he added , " We will also give them bathrobes with the Ikea Hostel logo on , and some slippers , so they wo n't get cold at night . "
Upon my movie theater deciding to offer a new size of large popcorn , I was motivated to see what kind of chunk of our daily intake of fat s we would be consuming by eating popcorn .
Popcorn is healthy , a great snack , and eaten in moderation ( 3 cups seems to be the recommended serving size ) .
Our popcorn is , while delicious and horrendously overpriced when compared to real - world expectations , extremely unhealthy for any one individual to consume , even without butter .
I can understand getting a large , and sharing with all your friends ... but still , the numbers are f rightening .
Note : Some numbers have been rounded .
First , some nutrition facts :
POPCORN ( popped in vegetable oil , with salt )
55 calories / cup
3 grams of fat / cup
. 5 gram of saturated fat / cup
CLARIFIED BUTTER OIL
( 204 grams fat / cup , 127 g saturated fat / cup , 1796 calories / cup )
1 oz = 0.120095 cup = 24.5 grams fat , 15 saturated , 216 calories
1.5 oz = 0.1801425 cup = 37 grams fat , 23 saturated , 324 calories
2 oz = 0.24019 cup = 49 grams fat 31 saturated , 431 calories
Thusly , our sizes of popcorn by themselves are as follows :
" Small " : 85 oz = 10.208074 ( 10 ) cups = 30 grams of fat ( 5 grams saturated fat ) , 550 calories
Medium : 130 oz = 15.612349 ( 15.5 ) cups = 46.5 grams of fat ( 7.75 grams saturated fat ) , 852 calories
Large : 170 oz = 20.416149 ( 20.5 ) cups = 61.5 grams of fat ( 10.25 grams saturated fat ) , 1127 calories
Our sizes of popcorn with butter :
Small with butter ( 10 cups , 1 oz butter oil ) : 54 grams of fat , 20 saturated , 766 calories .
Medium with butter ( 15.5 cups , 1.5 oz butter oil ) : 83 grams of fat , 31 saturated , 1,176 calories .
Large with butter ( 20.5 cups , 2 oz butter oil ) : 110 grams of fat , 41 saturated , 1,559 calories .
In the average 2,000 - calorie - a - day diet , the recommended fat intake is no more than 65 grams .
Saturated fat is no more than 20 grams .
Thusly , to have popcorn at my theatre is as follows :
" Small " , without butter : 25 % saturated fat intake for the day , and just under half your total fat for the day .
But , with butter , the % of your daily intake of saturated fat goes to 100 % , and total fat goes to 83 % .
Medium , without butter : 71 % of your fat , 39 % of your saturated fat intake .
With butter : 128 % of your fat for the day , 155 % of your saturated fat .
Large , no butter : 95 % of your fat , 51 % of your saturated .
With butter , that jumps to a frightening 169 % of your fat , and 205 % of your saturated fat for the day .
I am still on the fence as to whether it is appalling that we offer these sizes because people buy them , or that people buy these sizes because we offer them .
Uluru , formerly known as Ayers Rock , is a popular tourist draw
The threat to close Uluru , or Ayers Rock , comes amid growing alarm .
Some 50 community , church and indigenous groups are meeting in Canberra to discuss the situation .
The government 's measures include a six - month ban on pornography and alcohol in the Northern Territory , where evidence of sex abuse was found .
It also includes compulsory medical checks for Aboriginal children .
Growing fears
The Aboriginal backlash is growing in ferocity against what are increasingly being described as John Howard 's shock - and - awe proposals , says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney .
Although some Aboriginal leaders have welcomed the proposals , many call the prime minister 's plan unnecessarily authoritarian and overbearing .
" What the prime minister and his minister , Mal Brough , are proposing is in the view of the combined Aboriginal organisations in Alice Springs totally unworkable , " said their spokesman Pat Turner .
" We believe that this government is using child sexual abuse as the Trojan horse to resume total control of our lands . "

Some of the fiercest criticism has come from Mutitjulu , a township in the shadow of Uluru , the iconic red rock in central Australia visited by some half a million people each year .
Mutitjulu leader Vince Forrester said Uluru 's traditional owners are considering a civil disobedience campaign that would include a ban on climbing the rock .
" The tourist industry brings a lot of dollars into the territory and tourists all come to Uluru , " he told Australian radio .
" Obviously , civil disobedience can come in protest form . "
Painful memories of the infamous stolen generation have been revived - dating back to discredited assimilation policies under which generations of Aboriginal children were forcibly sent to live with white Australian families , correspondents say .
There have been reports from some Aboriginal communities that mothers are fleeing with their children , fearful they are going to be taken into care .
But many Aboriginal leaders and academics have been supportive of the proposals , believing the scale of the child abuse problem justifies such radical action , our correspondent adds .
The government has said there is no need for women and children to flee Aboriginal townships , for they have nothing to fear from the federal authorities .
Australia 's ' Katrina '
Mr Howard continues to defend his proposals , likening Australia 's failure on indigenous child abuse to the Bush administration 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina in the US in 2005 .
Australians had been aghast at the crisis in New Orleans , but a similar kind of lawlessness had taken hold at home , he said .
" We should have been more humble .
We have our Katrina here and now .
" That it has unfolded more slowly and absent the hand of God should make us humbler still , " Mr Howard said .
The prime minister has also been accused of politicising the issue in an election year , especially since his proposed ban on alcohol and pornography lasts only six months , our correspondent adds .
Many in the opposition Labor party have said his programme is a short - term political gesture rather than offering a long - term solution to the problem .
Exploited child worker becomes millionaire
He was just a child , just 14 , working long hours for Western exploiters at low wages .
Seven years later he still works hours on end .
His mother complained that he eats too little and worked until 4 am only to start work again at 8 am .
That ’s one way to look at the story .
But it is one that the young man , Suhas Gopinath might dispute .
His career started before puberty did .
An internet cafe opened up near the boy ’s home in India and his older brother took him there .
From that moment on he was hooked .
Every spare rupee he could find was used to spend more and more time on the internet .
He taught himself how to build web pages .
At the ripe old age of 13 he began his first website .
Then he received a call from a major softwar company in the United States .
They brought the boy to the United States and made him an offer .
They would pay for his education if he would come to work for them .
He turned them down .
He said : “ Why should I do for another company what I could do for my own ?
” So at the age of 14 he started his own company .
He had to skirt the laws set up to protect children like himself .
He was not allowed to set up a legitimate company as he was a mere child .
So he went on - line and registered a company outside India with a few friends .
Strictly speaking he was a child being exploited albeit by himself .
Regularly he faced a problem .
The moment clients found out he was 14 years old they dropped his services .
But in spite of that his company continued to grow .
Two years ago an investment firm from Texas approach the boy and offered to purchase a majority share in his company .
They offered him $ 100 million .
He rejected the offer preferring to keep ownership himself .
Today he employs over 400 people directly in eleven different countries .
Apparently he outsources a lot of his work to employees in the United States , where he has 125 employees .
Once Suhas was asked to address a group of business executives at a conference .
He rushed to the auditorium straight from school and did n’t have time to change .
He showed up in jeans and a t - shirt .
The security guard refused to admit him and would n’t believe the boy was the main speaker .
When he recently met the president of India he had some advice .
He wanted the laws restricting young people from starting their own companies removed from the books .
He has lots of faith in the ability of the young .
And that is shown when you realize the typical employee in his company is just 21 years old .
The oldest employee is 26 and the youngest is 12 but he is forbidden to hire him full time .
He gave the boy a laptop and in his spare time the boy works on web designs for the company .

HASTERT’S BONANZA ….
I made a brief , snarky reference to this a couple of days ago , but Norman Ornstein and Scott Lilly give Dennis Hastert ’s shady real estate dealings the attention they deserve in the New Republic today .
Here ’s the nickel summary :
In 2002 Hastert bought some land for a house along with some adjoining fields .
He paid about $ 5,200 per acre for the fields .
Eighteen months later , he formed a land trust with a couple of local Republican politicos .
The trust bought 69 acres of land adjacent to Hastert ’s for about $ 15,000 per acre ( it was nearer a road and therefore more valuable ) and Hastert then added 69 acres of his own land to the trust .
Although his 69 acres had been worth only $ 5,200 per acre a year and a half earlier , the trust valued his land at the same $ 15,000 per acre as the new land , three times its original price .
Sweet , huh ?
Then , Dennis Hastert decided to enter the earmark hall of fame .
A highway bill was wending its way through Congress at the time , and Hastert took a special interest in it :
There was no better object lesson in the case against earmarks than the Prairie Parkway Corridor , pushed by none other than Denny Hastert .
This new highway , designed to connect the counties west of Chicago to the metropolis itself , had neither the support of the public nor the Illinois Department of Transportation … .
But the Prairie Parkway did offer one important convenience :
It was located just over a mile from the property owned by Hastert ’s trust .
….
In December of 2005 , four months after the signing of the new Federal Highway Bill containing the $ 207 million inserted by Hastert for construction of the nearby Prairie Parkway , the 138 acres held by the trust were sold to a developer as part of planned 1600 home housing development .
The trust received $ 4,989,000 or $ 36,152 an acre for the parcel of which 62.5 percent or $ 3,118,000 went to Hastert .
Klatt and Ingemunson also did well .
Their profit equaled 144 percent of their original investment .
Hastert , however , received six times what he had paid for his investment , a profit equal to 500 percent of his original investment .
What ’s more , Hastert still has over a hundred acres left from the parcel he originally bought in 2002 .
That land is worth double , or maybe more than double , what he originally paid for it .
Ornstein and Lilly finish up with this observation :
The speaker has n’t exactly helped his case with his accounts of the transaction .
His office has , for instance , described the Prairie Parkway as located over five miles from his property .
But U.S. Geological Survey aerial photographs clearly show it to be about four miles closer than that .
We cannot say at this juncture whether the actions taken by the speaker are illegal .
We can say that they do not meet the standards we expect ?
or should expect ?
from a member of Congress .
And they certainly do not meet the standards we expect from the speaker of the House .
No , they do n’t .

The FCC reply comment period for network neutrality came to an end yesterday , with hundreds ( if not thousands ) of last - minute filings from businesses and consumers alike .
In fact , the complete docket now runs to nearly 27,000 unique comments , including one from an angry Brazilian who speaks " from a great University of brazil ( sic ) and we will create chaos if they destroy net 's neutrality . "
The FCC can also " kiss my ass . "
Another commentator told the agency , " This is rediculous ( sic ) . "
Passions , it appear , are running high .
All the major players have submitted comments : Hands
Off the Internet , Public Knowledge , the Center for Democracy & Technology , the CTIA , etc .
Many have also submitted " reply comments " which were due by yesterday .
That 's not surprising , but what is fascinating to note is how many ordinary people and unlikely organizations have gotten involved in the debate .
Even Senators Dorgan and Snowe , who have cosponsored a network neutrality bill , submitted additional comments yesterday — a highly unusual event for an FCC Notice of Inquiry .
The senators want to " demonstrate our continuing interest " in network neutrality , and one of the points they make strongly is that the market will not , in fact , take care of itself because there is no truly competitive market for broadband .
" Some believe the market will take care of competition and ensure that those who own the broadband networks wo n't discriminate , " they write in the filing , but add that this " cannot be so when at best consumers have a choice of two providers . "
Other bits of government have also provided opinions .
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction , for one , submitted comments supporting network neutrality and the broader positions of the American Library Association .
The DPI believes that in a non-neutral world , " libraries , which do not have deep pockets , will be among the disadvantaged .
Failure to retain an open Internet will result in libraries unable to provide their patrons with access to all the content that is available now via the Internet . "
Plenty of comments — in fact , these appear to be the vast majority — were submitted over e-mail by ordinary Internet users .
Many appear to have used a template , but others chose to go it alone .
" The internet is my most important source of news and political opinion , " reads one .
" Please leave the internet alone . "
Such comments exemplify one of the issues with private comments : many are not directly addressing the questions raised by the FCC .
Those that are can be ambiguous .
" Please leave the internet alone " is the rhetoric used by both sides in the debate , though in one case this means regulation and in the other , no regulation .
Numerous comments also opposed the idea of government - mandated network neutrality , of course .
Two weeks ago we covered a paper which argued that a neutral network would require nearly double the peak capacity to operate at the same level of service .
The lead authors , Shivkumar Kalyanaraman of Rensselaer Polytechnic and Murat Yuksel of the University of Nevada - Reno , submitted a copy of that paper into the FCC record .
“ No American President can stand up to Israel . ”
These words came from feisty Admiral Thomas Moorer , Chief of Naval Operations ( 1967 -1970 ) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( 1970 - 1974 ) .
Moorer was , perhaps , the last independent - minded American military leader .
Admiral Moorer knew what he was talking about .
On June 8 , 1967 , Israel attacked the American intelligence ship , USS Liberty , killing 34 American sailors and wounding 173 .
The Israelis even strafed the life rafts , machine - gunning the American sailors leaving the stricken ship .
Apparently , the USS Liberty had picked up Israeli communications that revealed Israel ’s responsibility for the Six Day War .
Even today , history books and the majority of Americans blame the conflict on the Arabs .
The United States Navy knew the truth , but the President of the United States took Israel ’s side against the American military and ordered the United States Navy to shut its mouth .
President Lyndon Johnson said it was all just a mistake .
Later in life , Admiral Moorer formed a commission and presented the unvarnished truth to Americans .
The power of the Israel Lobby over American foreign policy is considerable .
In March 2006 , two distinguished American scholars , John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , expressed concern in the London Review of Books that the power of the Israel Lobby was bending US foreign policy in directions that serve neither US nor Israeli interests .
The two experts were hoping to start a debate that might rescue the US and Israel from unsuccessful policies of coercion that are intensifying Muslim hatred of Israel and America .
The Israel lobby was opposed to any such reassessment , and attempted to close it off with epithets : “ Jew - baiter , ” “ anti- semitic , ” and even “ anti-American . ”
Today Israeli citizens who oppose Zionist plans for greater Israel are denounced as “ anti-Semites . ”
Many Americans are unaware of the influence of the Israel lobby .
Instead they think of the US as “ the world ’s sole superpower , ” a macho new Roman Empire whose orders are obeyed without question or the insolent nonentity is “ bombed back to the stone age . ”
Many Americans are convinced that military coercion serves our interest .
They cite Libya , Serbia , Afghanistan , Iraq , and now they are ready to bring Iran and Pakistan to heel with bombs .
This arrogance results in the murder of tens of thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands , of men , women and children , a fate that many Americans seem to believe is appropriate for countries that do not accept US hegemony .
Coercion is what American foreign policy has become .
Macho superpatriots love it .
Many of these superpatriots derive vicarious pleasure from their delusions that America is “ kicking those sand niggers ’ asses . ”
This is the America of the Bush Regime .
If some of these superpatriots had their way every “ unpatriotic , terrorist supporter ” who dares to criticize the war against “ the Islamofacists ” would be sent to Gitmo , if not shot on the spot .
These Bush supporters have morphed the Republican Party into the Brownshirt Party .
They cannot wait to attack Iran , preferably with nuclear weapons .
Impatient for Armageddon , some are so full of hubris and self - righteousness that they actually believe that their support for evil means they will be “ wafted up to heaven . ”
It has come as a crippling blow to Democrats that “ their ” political party is comfortable with Bush ’s America , and will do nothing to stop the Bush regime ’s aggression against the Iraqi people or to prevent the Bush regime ’s attack on Iran .
The Democrats could easily impeach both Bush and Cheney in the House , as impeachment only requires a majority vote .
They could not convict in the Senate without Republican support , as conviction requires ratification by two - thirds of Senators present .
Nevertheless , a House vote for impeachment would take the wind out of the sails of war , save countless lives and perhaps even save humanity from nuclear holocaust .
Various rationales or excuses have been constructed for the Democrats ’ complicity in aggression that does not serve America .
Perhaps the most popular rationale is that the Democrats are letting the Republicans have all the rope they want with which to produce such a high disapproval rating that the Democrats will sweep the 2008 election .
It is doubtful that the Democrats would assume that men as cunning as Karl Rove and Dick Cheney do not understand the electoral consequences of a low public approval rating and are walking blindly into an electoral wipeout .
Rove ’s departure does not mean that no strategy is in place .
So what does explain the complicity of the Democratic Party in a policy that the American public , and especially Democratic constituencies , reject ?
Perhaps a clue is offered from the Minneapolis - St. Paul Star Tribune news report ( August 1 , 2007 ) that Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison will spend a week in Israel on “ a privately funded trip sponsored by the American Israel Education Federation .
The AIEF  the charitable arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC )  is sending 19 members of Congress to meet with Israeli leaders .
The group , made up mostly of freshman Democrats , has plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and [ puppet ] Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
The senior Democratic member on the trip is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , who has gone three times … .
The trip to Israel is Ellison ’s second as a congressman . ”
According to the Star - Tribune , a Republican group , which includes Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R , Minn ) , led by Rep. Eric Cantor ( R , Va ) is already in Israel .
According to news reports , another 40 are following these two groups during the August recess , and “ by the time the year is out every single member of Congress will have made their rounds in Israel . ”
This claim is probably overstated , but it does show careful Israeli management of US policy in the Middle East .
Elsewhere on earth and especially among Muslims , the suspicion is rife that the reason the war against Iraq cannot end , and the reason Iran and Syria must be attacked , is that the US must destroy all Muslim opposition to Israel ’s theft of Palestine , turning an entire people into refugees driven from their homes and from the lands on which they have lived for many centuries .
Americans might think that they are merely grabbing control over oil , keeping it out of the hands of terrorists , but that is not the way the rest of the world views the conflict .
Jimmy Carter was the last American president who stood up to Israel and demanded that US diplomacy be , at least officially if not in practice , even - handed in its approach to Israel and Palestine .
Since Carter ’s presidency , even - handedness has slowly drained from US policy in the Middle East .
The neoconservative Bush / Cheney regime has abandoned even the pretense of even - handedness .
This is unfortunate , because military coercion has proven to be unsuccessful .
Exhausted from the conflict , the US military , according to former Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Colin Powell , is “ nearly broken . ”
Demoralized elite West Point graduates are leaving the army at the fastest clip in 30 years .
Desertions are rapidly rising .
A friend , a US Marine officer who served in combat in Vietnam , recently wrote to me that his son ’s Marine unit , currently training for its third deployment to Iraq in September , is short 12 - 16 men in every platoon and expects to be hit with more AWOLs prior to deployment .
Instead of reevaluating a failed policy , Bush ’s “ War Czar , ” General Douglas Lute , has called for the reinstitution of the draft .
Gen .
Lute does n’t see why Americans should not be returned to military servitude in order to save the Bush administration the embarrassment of having to correct a mistaken Middle East policy that commits the US to more aggression and to debilitating long - term military conflict in the Middle East .
It is difficult to see how this policy serves any interest other than the very narrow one of the armaments industry .
Apparently , nothing can be done to change this disastrous policy until the Israel Lobby comes to the realization that Israel ’s interest is not being served by the current policy of military coercion .
A Guardian investigation has found evidence of serious irregularities at the heart of the process the world is relying on to control global warming .
The Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) , which is supposed to offset greenhouse gases emitted in the developed world by selling carbon credits from elsewhere , has been contaminated by gross incompetence , rule - breaking and possible fraud by companies in the developing world , according to UN paperwork , an unpublished expert report and alarming feedback from projects on the ground .
One senior figure suggested there may be faults with up to 20 % of the carbon credits - known as certified emissions reductions - already sold .
Since these are used by European governments and corporations to justify increases in emissions , the effect is that in some cases malpractice at the CDM has added to the net amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere .
The problems focus on the specialist companies that validate and verify the projects in the developing world which produce the certified emission reductions .
Three of those companies have failed spot checks , which revealed a catalogue of weakness .
Separately , one of the CDM 's experts calculates that as many as one third of the projects registered in India are commercial ventures which do not produce any additional cut in greenhouse gases and were wrongly approved .
There are only 17 of these validating and verifying companies .
Most of them have a clean track record and will have approved reliable emissions reductions , but three of them have been performing so poorly that the CDM 's executive board ordered spot checks - and all three companies failed on multiple grounds .
The findings on one company , which is believed to have validated dozens of projects and verified millions of tonnes of carbon reductions , were so bad that the board considered suspending its right to work .
The chairman of the CDM board , Danish energy consultant Hans Jürgen Stehr , insisted that in the end the problem was not bad enough to require any of the companies to be suspended .
However , he said : " This has been serious .
We are talking about competence and the ability of the company to do a proper job . "
He ruled that none of the three companies be named .
In the formal language of the UN , the minutes record findings for each of the three companies variously of " non-conformities regarding ...its competencies to perform validation and verification functions , its quality assurance and quality control mechanisms and compliance with the CDM requirements ... procedural and operational requirements , such as its management and operational structure , contract control ... and compliance with its own stipulated procedures . "
The board has called for a new regime of surveillance of their work .
One source who has been working closely with the CDM board had seen some companies filing reports with " all kinds of basic errors which make you wonder if they have any idea what they 're doing " .
They included an entire report in a foreign language when basic rules require it to be in English ; submitting a report containing remarks such as " we must check this before we submit the report " .
Other errors are said to be more serious , including conjuring up numbers when projects on the ground failed to provide them ; giving a green light to commercial projects which make no contribution to reducing greenhouse gases ; and approving existing projects which cannot claim to be part of the drive to cut emissions .
Most of the concern is around the crucial CDM test of " additionality " - proof that a project is delivering cuts in greenhouse gases that would not otherwise have happened .
In an unpublished report , one of the CDM board 's expert advisers , Axel Michaelowa , examined all 52 Indian projects which had been registered up to May 2006 and found that a third of them failed this additionality test .
Mr Michaelowa found evidence of projects supplying false information which was then accepted by the companies who were supposed to check it .
In one case cited in the report , he accuses an Indian company of making statements which were " blatantly false " .
Despite his protests , that scheme was approved .

Important Update
For an update of the Boost .
Threads library , see the article What 's New in Boost Threads ? by Anthony Williams , maintainer of the Boost .
Threads Library .
This update appears in the November 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb 's Journal .
Just a few years ago it was uncommon for a program to be written with multiple threads of execution .
Today Internet server applications run multiple threads of execution to efficiently handle multiple client connections .
To maximize throughput , transaction servers execute services on separate threads .
GUI applications perform lengthy operations in a separate thread to keep the user interface responsive .
The list goes on .
The C++ Standard doesnt mention threads , leaving programmers to wonder whether its even possible to write multithreaded C++ programs .
Though it is not possible to write standards - compliant multithreaded programs , programmers none the less write multithreaded programs in C++ using the libraries provided by their OS that expose the systems support for threads .
However , there are at least two major problems with doing this : these libraries are almost universally C libraries and require careful use in C++ , and each OS provides its own set of libraries for handling multithreaded support .
Therefore , the resulting code is not only non-standard , but also non-portable [ 1 ] .
Boost .
Threads is a library designed to address both problems .
Boost [ 2 ] is an organization started by members of the C++ Standards Committee Library Working Group to develop new source libraries for C ++.
Its current membership includes approximately 2,000 members .
Many libraries can be found in the Boost source distribution [ 3 ] .
To make these libraries thread - safe , Boost .
Threads was created .
Many C++ experts provided input to the design of Boost .
Threads .
The interface was designed from the ground up and is not just a simple wrapper around any C threading API .
Many features of C++ ( such as the existence of constructors / destructors , function objects , and templates ) were fully utilized to make the interface more flexible .
The current implementation works for POSIX , Win32 , and Macintosh Carbon platforms .
Thread Creation
The boost : : thread class represents a thread of execution in the same way the std :: fstream class represents a file .
The default constructor creates an instance representing the current thread of execution .
An overloaded constructor takes a function object called with no arguments and returning nothing .
This constructor starts a new thread of execution , which in turn calls the function object .
At first it appears that this design is less useful than the typical C approach to creating a thread where a void pointer can be passed to the routine called by the new thread , which allows data to be passed .
However , because Boost .
Threads uses a function object instead of just a function pointer , it is possible for the function object to carry data needed by the thread .
This approach is actually more flexible and is type safe .
When combined with functional libraries , such as Boost .
Bind , this design actually allows you to easily pass any amount of data to the newly created thread .
Currently , not a lot can be done with a thread object created in Boost .
Threads .
In fact only two operations can be performed .
Thread objects can easily be compared for equality or inequality using the == and != operators to verify if they refer to the same thread of execution , and you can wait for a thread to complete by calling boost : : thread : : join .
Other threading libraries allow you to perform other operations with a thread ( for example , set its priority or even cancel it ) .
However , because these operations dont easily map into portable interfaces , research is being done to determine how they can be added to Boost .
Threads .
Listing
One illustrates a very simple use of the boost : : thread class .
A new thread is created that simply writes  Hello World  out to std: : cout , while the main thread waits for it to complete .
Listing One :
The boost : : thread class
#include < boost / thread / thread.hpp > # include < iostream > void hello ( ) { std::cout << " Hello world , I 'm a thread ! " << std::endl ; } int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { boost : : thread thrd ( &hello ) ; thrd.join ( ) ; return 0 ; }
At the beginning , everyone thought everything on the Internet is going to be free , forever .
Yeah , right .
Right now , the net is being constantly monitored , people are getting arrested for even thinking about piracy , DRM is preventing us from sharing stuff with friends , and web sites and services are getting closed down on a daily basis .
The last few weeks have been no different : Microsoft wants to nail Linux for infringing patents ( hey , they can look at Linux code , but no one can look at their code .
See the problem there ? ) , Imeem is being sued by Warner Music Group for copyright infringement , while YouTube gets sued , well , every damn day .
Unfortunately , people are slowly accepting the fact that some cool things are gone - and they 're not coming back , because someone somewhere needs to make more money .
Let 's take a trip down memory lane and remember some of the things that were taken from us .
OLGA
OLGA , or OnLine Guitar Archive , was one of those cool places on the Internet where you could find anything on a particular subject ; in this case , guitar tablatures .
But , I guess the sales from guitar tablatures were so big that copyright owners had to shut them down , too .
Most of the guitar tablatures on the site were done by the users ; but that obviously does n't matter much .
OLGA had ups and downs since then , and it 's currently offline again , while guitar tabs can be found scattered across many smaller site , some of which you can find here .
The original Napster
Remember those days ?
One guy got the idea of making software which enables you to share your files with others .
Hey , what a great idea !
Now I can share my music with my friends , and find out about new cool music !
Well , that one did n't last long .
The RIAA came down at Napster hard , and the service got shut down .
Sharing was not a good thing , unless you own the copyright , we were told .
Well , the problem is that most people do n't have the copyright rights to share anything , so sharing as a concept is something the lawyers and copyright owners would like to prohibit .
In any case , today 's Napster is but a shadow of the original one , while us oldtimers who still remember the golden days can only long for the time when sharing was OK .
Lik-Sang
If you were European and you needed a hard to find gadget from the Far East , you went to Lik - Sang ; that was the thing to do .
Some of these gadgets never show up in European shops , and some are months late .
Lik -Sang.com was a popular gaming retailer from Hong Kong which specialized in getting PSP consoles from Asia to Europe .
Jumping to the rescue of poor consumers who might electrify themselves with these gadgets - or at least that 's what they said - Sony did everything in their power to shut Lik - Sang down .
And shut down it was .
Instead of cool Japanese gadgets , the site now sports only an ugly " we 're forced to shut down " notice .
Gee , thanks a lot , Sony .
Fonpods
Fonpods was a service that offered free podcast listening over the phone .
For some reason , this allegedly cost the telecommunications industry " millions " ( back then they did n't yet invent billions and trillions , hence the modest numbers ) , so the service was shut down .
Ok , we can understand why they went after Allfreecalls .
net ( which is , btw , online again ) and FreeConferenceCall.com , but podcasts ?
Millions , they say .
Grokster , i2hub , WinMX ...
If the US were the only country in the world , p2 p would probably be only a theoretical concept .
Grokster , i2hub , WinMX , and everyone else within the grasp of US laws and regulations , went down , never to come back .
Grokster 's current page gives you a nice overview with the current state of affairs on the Internet with this sentence :
" YOUR IP ADDRESS IS xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx AND HAS BEEN LOGGED .
Do n't think you can't get caught .
You are not anonymous . "
Caught doing what ?
Writing an article for Mashable ?
Does even visiting a web site with nothing on it except a ( ugly one , we might add ) takedown notice , constitute some felony ?
Hey , I know where you live , too .
BTW , eMule is still live .
Eat that , RIAA .
SuprNova
Hey , but SuprNova was full of illegal stuff , you cry in disbelief !
Well , BitTorrent sites usually only host trackers and not the files themselves .
If you think all sites for sharing anything should be shut down , think about YouTube and the current lawsuits against it , and ask yourself : what 's the difference ?
BitTorrent sites and P2P sites and sites like YouTube are tools .
Someone will always use them to upload copyrighted material .
And guess what , if you shut them down , they 'll find a new tool to do it .
MP3.com
MP3.com was , in fact , perfectly legal , and it was n't directly shut down by anyone .
It was a service where lesser known bands could upload their music and promote themselves , communicating with the community directly .
It had a huge archive of music .
In 2000 , the owners started a new service - My.MP3.com - which enabled users to register CDs they legally own and make online copies on MP3 . com 's servers .
Although this about as legit as you can get , the record industry managed to sue them (! ) and win ( !? ) , and MP3.com had to settle the lawsuit , paying 200 million dollars in damages , which turned out to be a blow from which they would never recover .
And then , Vivendi bought the service ; did n't know what to do with it , and resold it to CNET , which bought the MP3.com domain .
Not the archive ; they did n't care about the archive , neither the users .
They bought only the domain , and started a nice and dandy online music sales operation .
The user archive was on the verge of deletion , but Trusonic took over and started GarageBand , which still lives on today .
The archive , thus , is n't gone , but the original flare of MP3.com , which was a huge site in the dot - com era , has disappeared .
Luckily , MySpace continued pretty much where MP3.com left off , becoming a new popular vessel for promoting music .
SingingFish
Singing
Fish was a cool audio video search engine , and users loved it because of its ability to find very rare tracks .
It was acquired by AOL in 2003 , which took it under its wing and did ... nothing .
They integrated parts of it into their own site , and they let the site die out , wiping it completely in February 2007 , without notice or even a " we 're sorry " note to the users .
A relatively small but disappointed group of users still claim that AOL 's search is n't as good as Singing Fish , but no one listens .
Except us , of course .
But we can only write about it .
( the original ) Alexaholic
Well , I know what you 're thinking : it 's still there , right ?
Actually , the Alexaholic domain name is now held by Amazon ( Alexa ) , and the original service that resided there is now known as Statsaholic .
And , while it is in fact still live and operational , it 's bruised and battered from all the C & D letters it received , followed by a lawsuit , and finally received another blow when Alexa started insisting that everyone ( except them ) can only use the crappy version of their stat graphs .
This , among other things , means that you can now only compare three sites at a time , instead of five as it were before .
Thus , we mention Alexaholic / Statsaholic - although it does n't fully belong to this group - to show how sometimes a bigco need not kill the little company dead ; it 's enough to cripple it enough to make it harmless .
Pandora ( for international users )
Sure , if you 're living in the USA , Pandora works just fine .
But , for the rest of the world ( since the 14th of May , that also includes Canada ) , Pandora 's site is one ugly notice which says : sorry , we can't serve music to you any more .
Reason ?
Legal complications in negotiating the rights with international copyright holders .
But , that 's nothing ; if the RIAA manages to pass that new Internet radio bill , almost all services that stream music over the Internet will be forced to shut down .

Murtha says Rumsfeld appointees frustrate oversight , cuts Pentagon agency budget Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 27 , 2007
Print This Email This Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) halved the budget of a Pentagon liaison office to the Congress in retaliation for what he sees as Defense Department foot - dragging on Congressional oversight .
The Congressman 's staff suggested leftovers from the tenure of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld were at fault for the lapses in cooperation with Congress .
The Office of Legislative Affairs , which serves as a go - between for Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Capitol Hill , is slated to lose $ 1.9 million .
" Mr. Murtha said that they have failed to answer Congressional questions in a timely matter , " Matthew Mazonkey , spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democrat , said .
The congressman chairs the powerful Defense Appropriations Subcommittee .
Legislative Affairs spokeswoman Tracy Scott referred RAW STORY to the Pentagon 's press office .
Pentagon spokesman Brian Maka , in turn , was reticent .
" The Office of Legislative Affairs performs a very important function as a liaison with Congress , " Maka told RAW STORY Thursday afternoon .
" It 's inappropriate to talk about proposed legislation . "
The Hill 's Roxana Tiron reported Wednesday that in a markup of the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill , Murtha called the Pentagon ' uncooperative , ' and singled out one particular office in explaining his punishment .
" Murtha Wednesday took issue with the office of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness , David Chu , for failing to supply requested documents , " she wrote in the paper .
" But the Pentagon overall has been unresponsive to the committee ... While several Pentagon offices have not cooperated with the committee , the cut in funding comes only to the Office of Legislative Affairs , the conduit between the Pentagon and Congress . "
Murtha 's spokesman added to that account , suggesting that Rumsfeld - era appointees were the problem .
" Secretary Chu is a Rumsfeld guy , " Mazonkey said Friday morning .
" The Congressman has repeatedly said that under Secretary Gates the Pentagon has become much more open , honest , and accessible . "
While Murtha criticized Chu on Wednesday , the Office of Legislative Affairs itself has earned the ire of some congressmembers in recent months .
The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs , Robert Wilkie , penned a memo that restricted which members of the Armed Services were allowed to testify before Congress , according to a May report in the Boston Globe .
" Robert L. Wilkie , a former Bush administration national security official who left the White House to become assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs last year , has outlined a half - dozen guidelines that prohibit most officers below the rank of colonel from appearing in hearings , restricting testimony to high - ranking officers and civilians appointed by President Bush , " wrote Bryan Bender in the paper .
Using the memo's guidelines , Pentagon lawyers disrupted a close House Armed Services Committee hearing in April that was considering the performance of US - trained Iraqi Security Forces .
" Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress see the move as a blatant attempt to bog down investigations of the war , " Bender added .
President George W. Bush appointed Wilkie to his post in June 2006 , but his confirmation was held up due to a number of disputes between the Pentagon and Members of Congress over a variety of issues .
He was not confirmed until September , months before Rumsfeld stepped down as Secretary of Defense .
The Pentagon 's Maka would not comment on whether the Defense Department would seek to restore Legislative Affairs ' budget with an amendment during debate on the appropriations bill .

Searching for Johnny Salami
The perfectly - named Satin Dolls patron told a Reuters reporter that the enigmatic ending to ' The Sopranos ' " left us hanging . "
Then , he disappeared .
Gelf went looking for him .
Michael Gluckstadt
Throughout its celebrated run , The Sopranos featured some of the most intriguing characters on television : an overweight homosexual mobster ; a comely hostess who suffered from Irritable Bowel Syndrome and her murderer / addict / screenwriter husband ; and of course Tony Soprano himself , the heavy - breathing physical embodiment of American entitlement .
But no character on the HBO show save perhaps for the man in the Members Only jacket was as enigmatic as one who was introduced to the world after the screen went dark : the elusive Johnny Salami .

Advertising that Makes You Laugh / Think
Advertising .
You 're soaking in it .
The average person is exposed to upwards of 4000 commercial impressions per day ... and most of it is ... simply awful .
The amount of money wasted by advertisers is beyond belief .
Big , big companies can often get away with wasteful ad campaigns ... for a while .
They 've got so much market inertia and presence they never really know what 's working or not .
For the rest of us , different rules apply .
If you own or run a small / medium business , advertising , done right , can take you to the next level .
However , for us , running an ad campaign is a major budget item .
Here 's the key idea though : it costs no more to run a good ad than a bad one .
Duh !
The magazine or TV station or mail house will charge you exactly the same whether your ad pulls in new customers and orders -- or not .
Bearing that in mind , does n't it make sense to study the creative ( i.e. design ) aspects of good advertisements ?
Whether you actually place ads or not , there 's always something interesting to be learned .
So , without further ado , I bring you some clever ads from my swipe file :
Tires that Really Stick to the Road
As seen in a German airport .
How better to get the point across that your tires just wo n't let go ?
Super - expensive to produce and deploy , but this one really stopped traffic .
Your take - away ?
How can you creatively display the * benefit* of your product or service to your marketplace ?
My friend , Bob Smith , a marketing genius , once came up with a trade show display for a company which manufactures coin - operated equipment for gas stations .
Bob got huge sacks of quarters and poured them all over the floor of their booth .
It became a carpet of money .
Since they were selling coin-operated air pumps , it truly communicated the message that the station - owner could , " Get money out of thin air ! "
Nicotine Gum
Now , that 's product placement for you .
Really clever .
" Klar for å slutte ? " translates to " Ready to quit ? "
Creative design is important , but so is being smart about when the message will be best received .
This ad campaign ran in January , when people are thinking about their New Year 's resolutions ( and bus exhaust was most visible ) .
Matrimonial / Trial Law Firm
After it appeared in a local magazine , somebody scanned this ad was and posted it on the Internet .
From there it went viral , gaining worldwide exposure for the firm .
You can't buy this kind of publicity .
Or maybe you can ...
3M Security Glass
Integrated into an actual bus shelter , I love this real - life demo / ad of a product .
Even though it 's filled with fake money , it screams out , " Try and hit me with a sledge hammer . "
I 'm not sure if anybody actually attempted that .
Probably .
Mini Cooper Print Ad
All of the Mini-USA advertising and marketing is extremely well done .
They capture ( and capitalize on ) , the iconoclastic Mini - owner mentality .
Often harmlessly poking fun at " The Man . "
Mortuary Billboard
As seen in a London tube station .
At first I was n't sure about this one .
Upon reflection , I began to realize how smart it really is .
Can you imagine how hard it is for the " death industry " to advertise well ?
Anything other than a tongue - in - cheek campaign would only serve to turn people away from an unpleasant subject .
Playing it cheeky like this is a great way to get people to pay attention , chuckle a bit , and hopefully remember you when the time comes .
There was another good one : a highway sign outside a funeral home .
It said , " Drive safely .
We 'll wait . "
Environmentally - Friendly Car
Taps in to the anti-SUV sentiment that 's all the rage right now .
Slim - Fast
This is another print ad that went viral on the Internet .
Besides being really funny , it ties a product benefit directly into the message .
Contrast this with virtually any beer commercial or car insurance ad .
Those Budweiser and Geico ads are entertaining all right , but do they actually say anything meaningful about the product ?
Not to me .
Accident - Prevention Tires
I 've got many more ads I could show you , but I 'm supposed to be taking it easy in the summer .
Hah !
As if .
The fashion for " web mashups " just got a steroid boost with the release of a browser that is really a desktop database , with full SQL scripting and the ability to manipulate tabular data found on the Internet .
The browser , Kirix Strata , started life two years ago as a Linux desktop database , said Kirix founder and president , Nate Williams .
He told The Register that " the world seemed very excited about it at the time , but sadly , the demand for a Linux desktop database , however powerful , was n't large ... people really wanted server products like MySQL . "
Also , the original database lacked two features , said Williams .
" People asked us ' Does it do scripting ? ' and ' Can I work on data in existing files ? ' and we had to admit , it did n't . "
What Strata does n't lack is muscle .
Nate Williams told us that it's a full - blooded database , capable of handling a billion records .
" We already have clients using it with 100 m record data bases , " he said .
" We can sort a million records in a minute ; so if you sort a ten million record data base , it takes ten minutes . "
Even so , Williams and his brother , Kirix Chief Scientist Aaron Williams , felt that the market for a Windows and Linux database on the desktop was n't going to get them famous :
" We felt we wanted to differentiate ourselves a bit , and go beyond a Me - Too product .
So we looked at the entire Web as a database , and decided to build a product that would handle that . "
Today , as Kirix Strata enters public beta , it takes all those powerful database features , and embeds them in a Gecko - engined specialist browser .
A tutorial screen cast will show how the browser works , and it can be downloaded in beta versions for Windows or Linux format .
" When it comes to working with data on the web , standard tools like spreadsheets or even web browsers behave like fish out of water , " Williams told us .
" Strata puts web data front and centre so you can deal with it in context and then manipulate it quickly . "
It handles many data formats natively , such as HTML tables , CSV files and RSS feeds .
Right - click , and pick a tool , and you have an on - screen , structured table which you can manipulate with your mouse in real time , can control with ECMA standard versions of Javascript , or even , mount a remote MySQL database and link .
" We really did n't think it was worth trying to embed this very powerful database engine as a FireFox extension , " said Nate Williams .
" There are now quite a few special purpose Gecko - based browsers , like the Flock browser for social networking , or the Songbird music browser .
We think that auditors will simply cry out for this ability built into a browser , and we think people are quite willing to try these speciality browsers , nowadays . "
In any case , he said , a data engine capable of handling 60 billion records per table would probably never fit into FireFox as an add-on .
In the meantime , Kirix is building up a list of web sites with CSV and structured data , which would otherwise require tedious manipulations with mark , cut , and paste into spreadsheets or standalone databases , but which Strata can simply manipulate directly .
" We 're asking people to try it out for us and let us know if they run into problems or have any suggestions for making it better , " said Williams .
" To return the favour , we 're giving our free licences of the final version to anyone who provide us with good feedback during the beta period .
Check the beta information page for further details . " ®
The Superior Works : C.A.Jewett's Patternmaking Chest
[ This story ( no names have been changed to protect the innocent ) appeared in rec.norm ( aka rec.woodworking ) on May 22 , 1995 .
The event really happened , and the images are proof of that . ]
It all started on a recent trek home from doing the 9 - 5 selling my soul to the ' man ' thing , when I happened to notice a yard sale in my rear - view mirror .
I say to myself " screw it , I never find chi-chi at yard sales " ( in choicer expletives ) , and continue home .
Besides , it was a Friday and yupster pal was coming over the following morning to play with that bubinga - the wood that launched a thousand slams in rec.norm - and I wanted to get a start on jointing it .
Next week , on Monday , the yard sale is once again going on as I again notice it in my rear - view mirror .
This time , however , something told me to turn around .
I made a quick u-turn in the Dunkin Donuts pahking lot , and pull into the driveway .
My first impression of the wares was that it was the typical tchotchkas one always finds at suburban yard sales , but at least there were no kids ' toys or baby furniture .
So , I decided to get out of my bubba - mobile and have a look .
I walk into the garage , which right off the bat indicated to me that it was n't really a yard sale , but a garage sale .
Out here in New England , we have several kinds of sales - like tag sales , moving sales , yard sales , garage sales , and I 've even seen signs that read " Yard Sale in Basement " ( but that was in Fitchburg , so it 's no wonder ) .
Anyway , I digress .
Inside the garage , I immediately notice some tools hanging on a pegboard .
As I 'm scoping them out , the owner of the place comes out and greets me .
He 's a friendly fellow , in his mid-70's , who , if he lived anywhere near Hollywood , woulda been a celebrity double for Burgess Meredith ( but not as the Penguin ) .
He sees me eyeing the tools and tells me that they 're not for sale , that they are his users .
I 'm sorta pissed since there 's a nice centering head from a Standard Tool Co. combination square hanging there .
I apologize for checking out his tools , and walk around looking at all the knickknacks of days long past ( salt and pepper shakers really do come in an infinite variety ) arranged nicely on two picnic tables .
I 'm about ready to punt , and start to chant my standard mantra " I never find chi-chi at yard sales " when I notice a hollow auger and a wooden tap and die sitting on one of the table 's benches .
I asked him how much , and he began asking me questions about them , to see if I knew what they were .
I was thinking to myself " hmmmm , he 's either starved for company or he must be thinking I 'm a total post - Neanderthal maroon what would n't know an old tool if it came up and nipped him in the arse . "
So , I answer his question , and then proceeded to the next round by telling him a bit of the history behind each tools ' manufacturer .
This is when the game started to get interesting .
For some unknown reason I mentioned the word ' patternmaker ' .
When I did , it was like correctly answering the Final Jeopardy question of " The profession of my long - dead father " .
I instantly became his long lost son , as he and I slugged it out trading patternmaker volleys in a game of one upsmanship .
He was totally amazed that I , being a 30 - something - Chuck - Taylor - wearing - in - sore - need - of - a - shave - who - looks - like - he - oughta - be - tending - a- garbage - scow - for - a - living - ' murican - male would have even a remote clue about a trade that 's all but dead .
He tells me about all the patternmaking that his father did while employed at a firm just down the road from where he lives .
His father made patterns for machinery used to process wool .
He then tells me that his great uncle was also a patternmaker .
The chat is going back and forth , and I 'm thinking " OK , it 's time to leave - do n't want the poochie tinkling on the Sheraton sofa if I 'm not home in time to let him out " .
I again ask him the price for the two tools that I was interested in , and he says " 20 bucks . "
I counter with " American ? " as I whip out a Jackson , and hand it over to him .
But , he 's not through talking about patternmaking with me .
He knows he 's got a sucker on the line , and he 's playing him for all he 's worth .
This is when he decides to tell me that he has a patternmaker 's chest that belonged to his father .
This is when I decide to say the hell with the dog , my wife can clean up the puddle .
I then start to probe him for the particulars , and he responds with vague answers , but he tells me that I can go look at it .
I 'm starting to get this throbbing sensation in my groin area , imagining what 's to come .
But it was all premature since he told me that we could n't look at it then , that he was expecting a phone call , and that I 'd have to come back later to have a look .
We agreed that it be the following day , and finally bid each other good - bye .
My mind is going nuts , with visions of # 56 's dancing in my head for several hours , when reality suddenly hits .
I tell myself to get a grip , that the chest will be crap , filled mostly with air , and that all he 'll have in the way of tools are rusted - solid Coe 's wrenches , crappy cherry Stanley levels , taps and dies , and the usual tool detritus I luck into .
So , I set my expectations at that level , hoping that finding a # 5 will be a pleasant bonus .
I arrive at the guy 's place the next day , and he greets me right away .
He asks me if I 'm ready , and I tell him it 's time to rock n' roll .
The chest is in the garage down at his son's house , which is a short walk through the woods from where he lives .
We 're fighting the black flies , chit - chatting about his acreage , when we have to cross a field of dog jigs and the creator of them , right before the garage .
We negotiate that successfully ( if you 're wearing Chuck Taylor 's , you learn early on to avoid dog crap ) , and proceed to the garage , with Fido endeavoring to introduce himself to my crotch and leg .
Inside the garage is a pile of stuff , all arranged about its perimeter .
We move to one side of it , and he begins to show me the feared pile of rusted Coe 's wrenches , etc .
Sure enough , I thought , it 's as predictable as stink on crap that I 'm gonna be offered rusted Coe 's wrenches and cruddy Stanley levels .
They were all there , in their filthy glory , before my dejected eyes .
The view is salvaged somewhat by my noticing some old patterns hanging on the wall , so I give them a look and comment to the guy about what nice work his father did .
We turn a corner , and there 's an oil - covered , beat - to - hell bench piled up with open end wrenches , screwdrivers , and a host of other junk that all belong in the Land of Misfit Tools .
But , on the bench is an Emmert 's patternmaker 's vise .
I scope it out , asking him if it's all there , including the near - impossible to find bench attachment which allows it to swing up from the face of the bench .
It 's there , as he demonstrates .
I give the vise a closer look to see if the mounting bracket was broken and repaired , commenting to the guy that most are damaged one way or another .
His was n't broken there , but the face plate was cracked .
He did n't know that it was , but it 's a no -harm damage .
He also has the original instructions for mounting the vise .
First time I ever saw them , and he later gave me a photocopy of them .
He then leads me to the other wall of the garage , finally to show me the chest .
My eyes are sweeping across the floor trying to beat him to it .
Thing is , my eyes shoulda been looking up , since he was fumbling with a lock that was chest - high .
It 's then when I first noticed the chest - there it was , hanging on the wall , with two raised panels on the front , looking like some 4 ' x 3 ' x 1.5 ' piece of furniture you'd have behind your wet - bar to keep junior outta the drambuie and cognac .
This is when it finally dawned on me that there was some real potential here ; that this was no John Q. Pattern - maker we were dealing with .
More like John Q. Rembrandt , I thought .
The lock was giving him a bit of a hassle , but he finally managed to pop it free .
The massive hinges creaked as the front of the chest swung open to the right .
I damn near fainted with what treated my eyes !
A chest that was virgin , jam - packed with every freakin ' tool what ever went into it .
A chest that had n't had a tool added to it in over 75 years .
A chest that you only dream about or find on the back page of FWW .
To get an idea of what this chest is like , imagine a functional , non-decorative version of the Studley chest .
This is it , with perhaps more tools in it than that one has .
This chest was n't made to be pretentious , just purely functional , with every available space crammed with the tools of the trade - saws galore , 3 sets of chisel ( none of which are cranked , strangely enough ) , machinist 's tools , bench planes , shrink rules , trammels , braces , drills , marking gauges , drawers filled with whatever , blah - bity , blah - bity , blah .
And get this , there is even a mint Coe 's wrench .
There are two internal hinged doors that swing open to reveal even more tools .
It was tools - a - go - go and I was booga - looing in my drawers .
The chest originally belonged to the current owner 's great uncle , who was a patternmaker at Simonds Saw and Heywood Wakefield ( the chest even has his 15 year anniversary pin in it ) .
When that guy died , the guy 's father inherited it since he was a practicing patternmaker .
He used it for years , until he retired in the mid-1960's .
He took the chest and hung it in his garage where it remained , mostly unused .
For two hours it was tool - orgasm , as he and I talked about the tools , his father , and the state of the nation .
Toward the end of talking , he decides to ask me " well , what do you think about it ? "
I told him that I was just lucky to be able to see , touch , and experience the tools of his great uncle and father , and that I would kill to own it .
He then asked me what it was worth to me .
I answered that there are 3 ways to value it - one , which is the way that pains me to witness it as it happens , is the value of the tools as they are thrown to the wolves when the chest is pillaged for profit ; two , the value where the sum is greater than the individual parts ; and three , the value as a family heirloom , which is impossible for anyone but family to assess .
He indicated to me that he did want to sell it , but only for the right price and to the right person .
I told him that I would get back to him in a few days with my offer , what it was worth to me , after I had time to stew on it .
When offering somebody money for something that they hold near and dear , you always run the risk of insulting them , if they place a value higher than what you intend to offer .
Naturally , we all like to get good buys and I try to make fair offers for stuff that I want to keep .
I decide that I 'm not gonna mess around , and that I 'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse .
I returned to pay the guy a visit , with cash in hand , a few days later .
I tell him that a minute had n't gone by without my thinking about the chest , and that I was going to be heart - broken if I did n't get it .
He asked me what my offer was , and instead of my blurting it out I handed him a fistful of Benny J. Franklin's to let him count it , to let him get the feel of cold , hard cash .
He nonchalantly counted it , handed it back to me , and said that it was a fair offer , about what he had in mind .
And then he drove a stake in my heart - he told me that two other guys had to look at it over the week - end .
I got thinking that I was going to get involved in one of those dreaded bidding wars , where you never know what 's going to happen , that even perhaps he was just using me to ' appraise ' the value of the chest .
All impure thoughts since I was so sure that I was going to go home with it that day .
He told me that he would have the others over to look at it , and that he would get back to me .
He re-assured me that my offer was fair , that he had good vibes about me , and that he was n't so sure about the intentions of the others coming to look at it .
This tempered my anxiety a bit , but the pessimist in me had taken control of my mind 's jukebox , where the tune " You Ain't Gonna Get It " played over and over and over .
I find waiting for some - thing big to be the worst part .
My mind races over the shoulda's , woulda's , and coulda's , which had I done them , I might have been able to take immediate ownership .
I had a full week of listening to this tune , and I was about to snap , when the phone rings while I 'm watching TOH re-runs for excitement .
Wifey - pooh answers the phone , as she always does , since she 's nice to the unsolicited huckstering of all expenses paid vacations to sunny Sarajevo if only we come to a seminar on home devices for underwater fire protection .
I 'm summoned to the cordless , and it's the owner of the chest telling me to come n' gits it the next day .
I got about 1 hour of sleep that night .
It was a bit over a week ago that I took ownership of it .
It was a very emotional time for the owner .
As I was jamming it with bubble - pack , to keep the tools in place , he told me that everytime he opened the chest , the smell of it reminded him of his childhood and his father .
He only relunctantly parted with it since he was fearful that his children , who had no appreciation for the tools nor the trade , would n't take care of it .
He wanted it to go to someone who has that same emotion about tools that he , his father , and his great uncle have / had .
He later told me that he was looking for the right person to sell it to for about a dozen years , and that he had a chance to sell it for more than I offered .
But fate stepped in the way and set a course for he and I to meet years later .
I 'm fortunate that he chose me since I must have convinced him of my sincerity to keep it together and to use the tools .
I know that he could sense my passion for the stuff - I sometimes wear it on my sleeve ( though never in this newsgroup ) .
I reassured him that the chest was going to be well - loved and that he could make the half - hour drive to my place to see and whiff it anytime he wanted .
The final act was played out as I was loading it to take it away .
He wanted me to hold the wedding picture of his mother and father and stand behind the chest so that he could take a picture of it .
Sounds kinda whacked , but these are n't just tools .
They 're the legacy of the man 's family .
He needed the photo to link the past with the present , and the present with the future .
I arrive with chest back at my cave , and a fellow rec.norm'er , who was coming over for a visit , arrived right after me .
He , my father , and I carried the chest into the house , and plopped it down on my walnut work - bench .
I fumble at the lock to open it , and only one tool falls to the bench , which is a relief since I thought many more would have come free during the trip .
Ah , bubblepack , is there nothing it can't do ?
Like a proud father , showing off his new John Deere riding lawn mower , I stand there as the crowd of two ooh 's , aah's , and gasps at the marvel of 19th century toolchest efficiency that leaves Snap - On in the starting blocks .
After the viewing , the throng exits , content that they 've gotten their money 's worth .
I 'm left alone and continue to absorb the pleasure of my new toy while thinking about what the previous owners made with it .
A spiritual sense overtakes me as I too take in the sights , the smells , and the feel of the tools .
I began to think what I 'll do with it once I go to that YB - plane in the sky .
My only hope is that I , too , can find someone who'll worship it as much as C.A. Jewett , J.A. Crocker , B.Crocker , and P. Leach do .
The end .

Hello Blog .
Here ’s a lovely little publication , apparently available at convenience stores , courtesy of friend Steve ( who took the trouble to purchase , scan , and help publicize this issue ) .
Entitled “ GAIJIN [ sic ] HANZAI URA FILE ” , it publicizes all the underground evils that gaijin in Japan do , including seducing our women on the street …
Here ’s a scan of the cover , with all manner of caricature which would be deemed offensive in any other developed country .
And to give you an example of the hate speech within , some excerpts ( Steve ’s translation ) , and links to scanned images follow .
Please excuse the language .
Turning the keyboard over to Steve , as he has portrayed the goods most effectively .

ENDS
What it certainly did not need were more of Mr. Bush ’s open - ended threats to Iran and Syria .
Before Mr. Bush spoke , Americans knew he planned to send more troops to pacify lawless Baghdad .
Mr. Bush ’s task was to justify that escalation by acknowledging that there was no military solution to this war and outlining the political mission that the military would be serving .
We were waiting for him to detail the specific milestones that he would set for the Iraqis , set clear timelines for when they would be expected to meet them , and explain what he intended to do if they again failed .
Instead , he said he had warned the Iraqis that if they did n’t come through , they would lose the faith of the American people .
Has Mr. Bush really not noticed that the American people long ago lost faith in the Iraqi government  and in him as well ?
Americans know that this Iraqi government is captive to Shiite militias , with no interest in the unity , reconciliation and democracy that Mr. Bush says he wants .
Mr. Bush said yet again that he wanted the Iraqi government to step up to the task of providing its security , and that Iraq needed a law on the fair distribution of oil money .
Iraq ’s government needs to do a lot more than that , starting with disarming the sectarian militias that are feeding the civil war and purging the police forces that too often are really death squads .
It needs to offer amnesty to insurgents and militia fighters willing to put down their weapons .
It needs to do those things immediately .
Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government has heard this list before .
But so long as Mr. Bush is willing to back that failed government indefinitely  enabling is the psychological term 
Iraq ’s leaders will have no reason to move against the militias and more fairly share power with the Sunni minority .
Mr. Bush did announce his plan for 20,000 more troops , and the White House trumpeted a $ 1 billion contribution to reconstruction efforts .
Congress will debate these as if they are the real issues .
But they are not .
Talk of a “ surge ” ignores the other 132,000 American troops trapped by a failed strategy .
From a speech made by Dubya in March 2005 ,
Throughout the speech , Bush said the spread of democracy is crucial to defeating terrorists and safeguarding the United States from another attack .
“ It should be clear that the advance of democracy leads to peace because governments that respect the rights of their people also respect the rights of their neighbors , ” he said .
“ It should be clear the best antidote to radicalism and terror is the tolerance kindled in free societies . ” ( emphasis mine )
Iranians : Do They Say They Want a Revolution ?
In the fall of 2006 , WorldPublicOpinion.org conducted a face - to - face poll of the Iranian public and found strong support for democracy .
Respondents were asked , “ How important is it for you to live in a country that is governed by representatives elected by the people ? ” and told to answer on a 0 - 10 scale , where 10 signified the greatest importance and 0 the least .
A large majority ( 68 % ) of Iranians chose the highest possible score of 10 ; on average the Iranian response was a 9.1
The survey also allowed Iranians to evaluate the level of democracy in their country , using the same scale .
Asked to rate how much their own country was “ governed by representatives elected by the people , ” few Iranians ( only 9 % ) gave their country a perfect 10 , but a clear majority ( 61 % ) gave their country a score of 7 or higher .
As WPO notes Iranians have there own ideas about what democracy is and whether or not their ideas of what constitutes democracy correlate with a Jeffersonian concepts , they do see themselves as living in a relatively democratic country .
There would seem to an outsider that the average Iranian is suffering from a certain level disconnect from what actually constitutes a democracy , but this should n’t be too difficult to comprehend because American Conservatives see themselves as pro democracy even as they support the most authoritarian and lawless administrations in American history .
Other polls are consistent with WPO ’s findings that a majority of Iranians both support democracy and feel that their government is at least somewhat democratic .
In June 2005 , a survey by the Iranian Student Polling Agency found that 65 percent of respondents said it was “ absolutely important ” to live in a democratically governed country and 90 percent believed that democracy was better than any other form of government .
Smaller numbers — but still a majority — said that they believed Iran was “ fairly democratic ” ( 59 % ) .
Abu Aardvark has an interesting post about how some Iraqis view Bush ’s continued occupation , in particular the Islamic Army of Iraq .
First let ’s acknowledge that these guys are extreme nationalists and as one would expect they use a lot of hyperbole , Islamic Army of Iraq takes issue with certain American claims
First , the letter from the Amir .
Much of the letter advances a series of arguments that Iran is the real problem for Iraqis and Americans alike .
It ’s full of sectarian complaints , as you ’d expect , and its aggressive assertions of Iranian mischief in Iraq might find a welcome reception in certain quarters .
While the occupation of Iraq has proven a disastrous , expensive failure for the United States , it argues , Bush has at least achieved great strategic gains for Iran .
Iranian influence is on the march throughout the Gulf while Baghdad and the southern provinces have become the property of Iranian intelligence .
He writes that he knows that Americans do n’t care about Iraq ’s suffering or about millions of Iraqi refugees , only about hegemony and wealth and Israel ’s security .
But even so , why has America given Iran hegemony over Iraq at such a bargain price ?
Iran , a country that sees itself as democratic and has offered to help the U.S. fight al - Qaeda has gained power and influence in the region because of Bush .
The majority of Iraqis are Shia as is the government the Iraqi government that Bush props up and those same Shia feel more allegiance to Iran then they do to America or more accurately Bush .
Bush can have surges from now till the Martians land , but he ’ll never make head way in Iraq without a political solution that addresses the issue of his contradictory view of what Iraq should be .
He ca n’t simultaneously marginalize the Sunni minority one day , arm them the next then try and get them on America ’s side when America has designed a government that caters to the Shia .
The average person might well have a difficult time understanding how these small fractures in religious and tribal beliefs and traditions can mean so much that people will kill each other .
Not a perfect analogy but think of the violence between Protestants and Catholics that lasted for hundreds of years in Europe and fueled the terrorism in Northern Ireland in recent history ( a problem that ended with a political solution not a military one ) .
Listen to what the leaders of the insurgency groups actually say , not to what American spokesmen project upon them : the major insurgency factions remain committed to fighting until the Americans withdraw and the current political system is revised .
Abu is n’t approving of insurgent behavior only acknowledging it and their determination .
Even discounting the propagandistic tone of the announcements made by these insurgent groups Bush ’s escalation or “ surge ” is of dubious and only short term benefit if any .
Since Bush and of course his supporters will continue to ignore the realities and Congressional Democrats do n’t have a large enough majority to make Bush change course it is very likely this quagmire will continue well into 2008 .
Paul Krugman and Matthew Yglesias both take a look at the morass of muck that is the current philosophy of conservatism as it applies to health - care for children , but it also applies to Bush and Conservatives contradictory behavior in Iraq , Can’t Do Conservatism
One way of thinking about what the country ’s experienced since the fall of 2001 is just large - scale consequences of perverse incentives .
We have a president whose ideological goals on the domestic front are , on some level , advanced every time he screws up , with his own failures , his own corruption , providing evidence for the correctness of his ideology .
Meanwhile , on the security front , his own inability to tackle the al - Qaeda problem — and , indeed , the fact that his policies are making the problem worse — serve to heighten a climate of fear that his advisers regard as political ( ly ) useful .
The more Bush screws up Iraq the more supposed justification for the surge .
The surge goes sideways at best and Bush both declares we ’ve turned another corner and need another Friedman Unit .
At the end of which we ’ll need another surge and those that oppose this deadly farcical cycle are defeatists .
What we have is the Conservative Cycle of Defeat .
They ’re like gambling addicts that have tied their destructive behavior to patriotism .
Madison Avenue could n’t have done a better job of not only selling America a defective product , but having repeat sells .
Bill Oreilly : The Conservative Clown of Hate
DIGG THIS
Hillary Clinton is more and more likely to become the next President of the United States .
The price of her nomination contract on Intrade has jumped to the 60 area , meaning she has a 60 percent chance of winning the nomination .
No one else is even close .
The market thinks that Bill Richardson is likely to be her running mate .
Speculators think that this ticket will win the election , although they are not as sure of that .
They are very sure that Democrats will retain both Senate and House control .
A Clinton II presidency will affect taxes , stock and bond prices , dollar and gold prices , and a great deal else .
Speculators and planners will be watching closely her every word in order to discern the material impacts of her possible policies .
Long before she is elected , asset prices will begin to move in anticipation of potential legislation and policy changes .
There are certain areas that Hillary Clinton is very interested in that will affect many Americans and the portfolios of many Americans .
Interesting questions arise .
Will Bill Clinton serve in a new Clinton administration ?
Will he have a marked influence on Hillary ’s policies ?
Will her fiscal and monetary policies look like his ?
Will she be her own woman ?
I will briefly summarize a few of Hillary ’s currently indicated directions .
This usually is a valuable exercise .
Elected officials often follow the signals they emit during their campaigns .
But it is an iffy exercise .
Events overtake a president and lead to unexpected twists and turns .
I also cannot resist offering a few of my own jaundiced reflections .
It is extremely difficult to watch multiple American tragedies unfolding before our eyes and not say something about them .
And who knows ?
Maybe Hillary or someone close to her will read this and see some light .
Hillary would like to end the war in Iraq .
Bill Richardson even more plainly wants to end it .
The idea is to shift the $ 450 billion going into warfare into domestic concerns like health care , education , and energy .
Such a platform is a sure winner .
But Richardson as Vice - President will have limited influence .
Hillary will find herself drawn into the foreign policy game just as her husband was .
Hillary as President will curtail U.S. military operations in Iraq but not end them .
She has promised to end the war , but at the same time she promises to transform and continue it .
She says she will retain a significant force and continue to try to produce country - wide military and police forces , attack terrorists , and provide materiel .
She will call for more equipment for the area and fewer personnel .
She will talk tough to Iraq ’s leaders .
Her promise to end the war is an empty one .
Since she and the U.S. establishment want to produce a stable Iraq allied to the U.S. , she ca n’t end the war because that will produce the opposite consequences .
Iraq will disappear and be replaced by a partitioned country with many frictions : between Iranian and Iraqi Shiites , between Iraqi Shiite factions , between Sunnis and Shiites , between Turkey and Kurds , etc .
The bloodthirsty terrorists of Al - Qaeda will ally themselves with whomever they can to lever their position .
Events in Iraq are unpredictable .
Both the U.S. and Hillary are willing hostages to them .
Even under the cover of a democracy , a strong man could arise , another Saddam .
Which way will Hillary go ?
Will she bite the bullet and withdraw , letting the chips fall where they may ?
Or will she succumb to the urge to shape events and control Iraq ’s future ?
Like her husband , she will do both .
She will straddle the issue .
Just as he bombed and bombed , she will try to substitute equipment for manpower .
She will withdraw some men but not all ; and she will not withdraw power and interference .
She will compromise between those voices urging faster exit and those counseling disaster if she withdraws too quickly .
In other words , the war will drag on until the balance of power shifts to install a regime or regimes that keep power .
Hillary on the Iraq War is a continuing disaster .
She will not exercise a foreign policy leadership that will make a real difference .
She has already joined others in her party who promise to heat up U.S. efforts in Afghanistan .
Adjacent Pakistan also continues to heat up as another hot spot .
On energy , Hillary is a booster of the Apollo Alliance .
She supports renewable energy sources , ethanol , biofuels , clean coal , and measures to reduce global warming , which are all popular but costly , wasteful , and ineffective ideas .
None of these measures will reduce America ’s oil dependence , as she claims to want .
Only a big shift into nuclear power will accomplish that .
However , she is at best lukewarm and / or really cold on nuclear power plants .
She thinks the public is against them ( " so hard to site them " ) and that they cost too much ( " so hard to fund them . " )
Since she could exercise leadership on nuclear power and is n’t , she is unlikely to go in that direction .
Instead , in a speech on Feb. 26 , 2007 , she called for an Apollo Project for energy that would end " tax breaks for big oil " and subsidize research and development of clean fuels .
Hillary on energy is a disaster , but so has been every administration for a long time .
U.S. energy policy is a huge and stupid tragedy , and Hillary will play a lead role in continuing it .
Hillary has n’t moved an inch on HillaryCare .
The Congress , with benighted public support , has moved in her direction , enacting universal health care piece by piece .
Hillary will extend health care benefits and introduce price controls on insurers .
She wants full and universal coverage for all Americans .
On paper everyone will have health care .
In reality , there will be rationing and price controls .
American health care will deteriorate even further .
Will Americans care ?
Will they fly to India or Thailand where they can get better , faster , and cleaner health care ?
Hardly likely .
Unlike Canadians suffering with their national health care system who have been coming here , where will Americans turn ?
They will wait , suffer , and die before their time .
The only bright side is that this will provide a background for those who see some advantage in running against the system and drastically changing it .
Nothing less will suffice at this point than completely dismantling the health care monstrosity .
Hillary on health care is a continuing disaster .
George Bush II played his role in this tragedy by introducing the prescription drug benefit and failing to reform the system in any way .
In another sign that she does not understand economics and / or wants to make political hay , Hillary wants women by law to be paid the same as men are .
This sounds good to untutored American ears , who think this is a matter of simple justice .
However , if women were systematically being underpaid for no good reasons , would n’t those same businessmen who are supposed to be so greedy rush in and hire them at $ 0.75 on the dollar ?
Shawn Ritenour explains some of those good reasons for men- women pay differentials here , and Thomas E. Woods , Jr. explains that " never - married women of comparable education and experience and who work full time have the same incomes as their male counterparts " here .
Raising women ’s pay above the market level that takes into account compensating differentials ( related to such factors as on - the - job training , length of tenure , job interruption , and time spent with family ) will put women out of work .
In an interesting pair of contradictory statements from the Hillary campaign site from which I draw her positions , we are told that " Hillary has stood firm as an advocate for a woman ’s right to choose . "
Hillary favors Roe v Wade .
She is in favor of abortion .
But a few sentences later we read this : " As president , Hillary will continue her lifelong fight to ensure that all Americans are treated with respect and dignity . "
Apparently , babies in the womb do not count as Americans .
Moreover , Hillary is known as a champion of children : " America is ready for a president who fights for our children . "
She has a long slate of legislation relating to children , including a new proposal to extend pre-kindergarten schools to all 4 - year - olds .
Why then does she not favor the babies who would be born ?
Maybe it ’s because they ca n’t vote .
Hillary on the American family is yet another continuing disaster .
In the Clinton II realm , the government will step up its invasion of the family .
The State long ago crossed the boundary into American family life in a largely unnoticed and unheralded stealth invasion .
Hillary will extend the State ’s victory over the American family and consolidate that control .
Like all presidents , Hillary can be counted on to push for a number of favorite hobby - horses .
Hers are many .
They include public schools in overseas countries , support of Israel , government reform , voting reform ( including same - day registration and an Election Day holiday ) , and working with the U.N .
Political government under Hillary will grow larger , just as it has under just about every president ever elected .
This process can go on for some time as there is a lot of ruin in a country .
When major American establishment figures start talking different games than the ones we ’ve been hearing for the last 100 years , then we ’ll know that some real change is in the air .
This has not happened yet .
In the meantime , the only consolation is that the State is running into diminishing returns .
We can see this in the projected deficits to fund the government ’s programs .
We can see it in the difficulties and cutbacks in countries overseas .
Economics is a constraint on how far the State can go .
Clinton II will be operating under constraints .
Unfortunately , they are not yet tight enough to prevent her from continuing the tragic policies of her predecessors and placing her own personal stamp upon them .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
Pastor Benny Hinn , in Toronto this weekend for two days of miracle cures and old - time gospel , makes no apologies for all the money his far - flung ministries take in each year .
" The gospels are free , but the means of delivering the gospels is really expensive , " Hinn , who got his start in Toronto 30 years ago , told the Star .
Tonight and tomorrow , Hinn brings his Texas - based Miracle Crusade to the Air Canada Centre , attracting up to 20,000 to each of his three shows .
The shows are free but , as at all his crusades , donations will be sought and many buckets will be passed as the audience sings rousing hymns along with a mass choir amid a light show worthy of a rock concert .
While Hinn acknowledges people come mainly to see and take part in the healing miracles , that is left to the feverish end – they will first hear him preach , pray and sing in his trademark white suit .
But Hinn arrives under a cloud after the CBC's The Fifth Estate this week challenged his claims of miracle cures and described a lavish lifestyle of fancy cars , a 7,000 - square - foot ocean - side mansion and luxury travel to five - star hotels on a private jet .
In the show , reporter Bob McKeown estimates Benny Hinn Ministries takes in as much as $ 250 million a year in donations and proceeds from sales of such items as autographed bibles .
Hinn , who keeps his finances private , doubts the show will hurt turnout at the ACC .
" They will never stop people from coming to meetings such as ours . "
Followers donate money , he says , to ensure his work , including curing the sick , continues .
" They believe that God heals and they want to see something like this go on .
They also understand it takes money to rent stadiums . "
Hinn 's sessions have gained a reputation for sudden miracle cures for cancer , blindness , diabetes and even AIDS over the past 30 years since his humble beginnings in a church hall at Bloor and Yonge .
People dramatically fall to the floor proclaiming their health after a touch from Hinn 's hand .
Hinn , however , professes to having nothing to do with making anybody healthy .
" The Lord has not called me to heal people , " he says .
" He heals the people . "
After the prayers , songs and preaching from the charismatic minister , Hinn tells the crowd he is getting a message from God that people in the audience are being cured , and he asks them to come to the stage .
The Fifth Estate used hidden cameras to show staff screening audience members coming forward , ensuring none with obvious physical ailment get near Hinn .
" It 's always somebody that has some kind of illness that can't be readily seen " that makes it to the stage , Justin Peters , a Baptist minister in Mississippi who studied Hinn , tells the CBC .
Hinn says the cures take place in the audience , not on stage , so no one still in a wheelchair is allowed on stage .
God , he says , has obviously not cured these people .
" I wo n't let them up , because they have n't been healed , " he says .
The CBC tracked down some of the people claimed to have been cured , only to find that they were either still sick , never had the condition they were supposedly cured of , or had died .
Speaking to the Star , Hinn says he is forced to rely on the word of those coming to his crusades to tell him they are cured .
" It 's not my job to claim that they are healed .
I have never done that , " he says .
" I 'm not a doctor . "
Hinn defends his use of luxury hotels and a private Gulfstream jet detailed by the CBC , saying they offer greater efficiency and security .
" People in my position will have threats , " he told the Star .
" If you ask for a secure ( hotel ) floor , you 're going to pay more money . "
Hinn also criticized the CBC for using hidden cameras and old footage he says depicts his wife just before she had a nervous breakdown .
Each year , John Brockman 's Edge asks a collection of deep thinkers a profound question , and gives them a couple of hundred words to answer : The World Question Center .
The question for 2005 was What Do You Believe Is True Even Though You Cannot Prove It ?
Plenty of entertaining answers , offered by people like Bruce Sterling , Ray Kurzweil , Lenny Susskind , Philip Anderson , Alison Gopnik , Paul Steinhardt , Maria Spiropulu , Simon Baron - Cohen , Alex Vilenkin , Martin Rees , Esther Dyson , Margaret Wertheim , Daniel Dennett , and a bunch more .
They 've even been collected into a book for your convenient perusal .
Happily , these questions are more or less timeless , so nobody should be upset that I 'm a couple of years late in offering my wisdom on this pressing issue .
Most of the participants were polite enough to play along and answer the question in the spirit in which it was asked , although their answers often came down to " I believe the thing I 'm working on right now will turn out to be correct and interesting . "
But to me , there was a perfectly obvious response that almost nobody gave , although Janna Levin and Seth Lloyd came pretty close .
Namely : there is n't anything that I believe that I can prove , aside from a limited set of ultimately sterile logical tautologies .
Not that there 's anything wrong with tautologies ; they include , for example , all of mathematics .
But they describe necessary truths ; given the axioms , the conclusions follow , and we can't imagine it being any other way .
The more interesting truths , it seems to me , are the contingent ones , the features of our world that did n't have to be that way .
And I can't prove any of them .
The very phrasing of the question , and the way most of the participants answered it , irks me a bit , as it seems to buy into a very wrong way of thinking about science and understanding : the idea that true and reliable knowledge derives from rigorous proof , and anything less than that is dangerously uncertain .
But the reality could n't be more different .
I can't prove that the Sun will rise tomorrow , that radioactive decays obey an exponential probability law , or that the Earth is more than 6,000 years old .
But I 'm as sure as I am about any empirical statement that these are true .
And , most importantly , there 's nothing incomplete or unsatisfying about that .
It 's the basic way in which we understand the world .
Here is a mathematical theorem :
There is no largest prime number .
And here is a proof :
Consider the list of all primes , pi , starting with p1 = 2 .
Suppose that there is a largest prime , p* .
Then there are only a finite number of primes .
Now consider the number X that we obtain by multiplying together all of the primes pi ( exactly once each ) from 2 to p* and adding 1 to the result .
Then X is clearly larger than any of the primes pi .
But it is not divisible by any of them , since dividing by any of them yields a remainder 1 .
Therefore X , since it has no prime factors , is prime .
We have thus constructed a prime larger than p* , which is a contradiction .
Therefore there is no largest prime .
Here is a scientific belief : General relativity accurately describes gravity within the solar system .
And here is the argument for it :
GR incorporates both the relativity of locally inertial frames and the principle of equivalence , both of which have been tested to many decimal places .
Einstein 's equation is the simplest possible non-trivial dynamical equation for the curvature of spacetime .
GR explained a pre-existing anomaly -- the precession of Mercury -- and made several new predictions , from the deflection of light to gravitational redshift and time delay , which have successfully been measured .
Higher - precision tests from satellites continue to constrain any possible deviations from GR .
Without taking GR effects into account , the Global Positioning System would rapidly go out of whack , and by including GR it works like a charm .
All of the known alternatives are more complicated than GR , or introduce new free parameters that must be finely - tuned to agree with experiment .
Furthermore , we can start from the idea of massless spin - two gravitons coupled to energy and momentum , and show that the nonlinear completion of such a theory leads to Einstein 's equation .
Although the theory is not successfully incorporated into a quantum - mechanical framework , quantum effects are expected to be unobservably small in present - day experiments .
In particular , higher - order corrections to Einstein 's equation should naturally be suppressed by powers of the Planck scale .
You see the difference , I hope .
The mathematical proof is airtight ; it 's just a matter of following the rules of logic .
It is impossible for us to conceive of a world in which we grant the underlying assumptions , and yet the conclusion does n't hold .
The argument in favor of believing general relativity -- a scientific one , not a mathematical one -- is of an utterly different character .
It 's all about hypothesis testing , and accumulating better and better pieces of evidence .
We throw an hypothesis out there -- gravity is the curvature of spacetime , governed by Einstein 's equation -- and then we try to test it or shoot it down , while simultaneously searching for alternative hypotheses .
If the tests get better and better , and the search for alternatives does n't turn up any reasonable competitors , we gradually come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is " right . "
There is no sharp bright line that we cross , at which the idea goes from being " just a theory " to being " proven correct . "
Rather , maintaining skepticism about the theory goes from being " prudent caution " to being " crackpottery . "
It is a intrinsic part of this process that the conclusion did n't have to turn out that way , in any a priori sense .
I could certainly imagine a world in which some more complicated theory like Brans - Dicke was the empirically correct theory of gravity , or perhaps even one in which Newtonian gravity was correct .
Deciding between the alternatives is not a matter of proving or disproving ; its a matter of accumulating evidence past the point where doubt is reasonable .
Furthermore , even when we do believe the conclusion beyond any reasonable doubt , we still understand that it's an approximation , likely ( or certain ) to break down somewhere .
There could very well be some very weakly - coupled field that we have n't yet detected , that acts to slightly alter the true behavior of gravity from what Einstein predicted .
And there is certainly something going on when we get down to quantum scales ; nobody believes that GR is really the final word on gravity .
But none of that changes the essential truth that GR is " right " in a certain well - defined regime .
When we do hit upon an even better understanding , the current one will be understood as a limiting case of the more comprehensive picture .
" Proof " has an interesting and useful meaning , in the context of logical demonstration .
But it only gives us access to an infinitesimal fraction of the things we can reasonably believe .
Philosophers have gone over this ground pretty thoroughly , and arrived at a sensible solution .
The young Wittgenstein would not admit to Bertrand Russell that there was not a rhinoceros in the room , because he could n't be absolutely sure ( in the sense of logical proof ) that his senses were n't tricking him .
But the later Wittgenstein understood that taking such a purist stance renders the notion of " to know " ( or " to believe " ) completely useless .
If logical proof were required , we would only believe logical truths -- and even then the proofs might contain errors .
But in the real world it makes perfect sense to believe much more than that .
So we take " I believe x " to mean , not " I can prove x is the case , " but " it would be unreasonable to doubt x . "
The search for certainty in empirical knowledge is a chimera .
I could always be a brain in a vat , or teased by an evil demon , or simply an AI program running on somebody else 's computer -- fed consistently misleading " sense data " that led me to incorrect conclusions about the true nature of reality .
Or , to put a more modern spin on things , I could be a one of Boltzmann ' sBrains -- a thermal fluctuation , born spontaneously out of a thermal bath with convincing ( but thoroughly incorrect ) memories of the past .
But -- here is the punchline -- it makes no sense to act as if any of those is the case .
By " makes no sense " we do n't mean " ca n't possibly be true , " because any one of those certainly could be true .
Instead , we mean that it 's a cognitive dead end .
Maybe you are a brain in a vat .
What are you going to do about it ?
You could try to live your life in a state of rigorous epistemological skepticism , but I guarantee that you will fail .
You have to believe something , and you have to act in some way , even if your belief is that we have no reliable empirical knowledge about the world and your action is to never climb out of bed .
On the other hand , putting aside the various solipsistic scenarios and deciding to take the evidence of our senses ( more or less ) at face value does lead somewhere ; we can make sense of the world , act within it and see it respond in accordance with our understanding .
That 's both the best we can hope for , and what the world does as a matter of fact grant us ; that 's why science works !
It can sound a little fuzzy , with this notion of " reasonable " having sneaked into our definition of belief , where we might prefer to stand on some rock - solid metaphysical foundations .
But the world is a fuzzy place .
Although I cannot prove that I am not a brain in a vat , it is unreasonable for me to take the possibility seriously -- I do n't gain anything by it , and it does n't help me make sense of the world .
Similarly , I can't prove that the early universe was in a hot , dense state billions of years ago , nor that human beings evolved from precursor species under the pressures of natural selection .
But it would be unreasonable for me to doubt it ; those beliefs add significantly to my understanding of the universe , accord with massive piles of evidence , and contribute substantially to the coherence of my overall worldview .
At least , that 's what I believe , although I can't prove it .
Riyadh , Saudi Arabia — THE hem of my heavy Islamic cloak trailed over floors that glistened like ice .
I walked faster , my eyes fixed on a familiar , green icon .
I had n’t seen a Starbucks in months , but there it was , tucked into a corner of a fancy shopping mall in the Saudi capital .
After all those bitter little cups of sludgy Arabic coffee , here at last was an improbable snippet of home — caffeinated , comforting , American .
I wandered into the shop , filling my lungs with the rich wafts of coffee .
The man behind the counter gave me a bemused look ; his eyes flickered .
I asked for a latte .
He shrugged , the milk steamer whined , and he handed over the brimming paper cup .
I turned my back on his uneasy face .
Crossing the cafe , I felt the hard stares of Saudi men .
A few of them stopped talking as I walked by and watched me pass .
Them , too , I ignored .
Finally , coffee in hand , I sank into the sumptuous lap of an overstuffed armchair .
“ Excuse me , ” hissed the voice in my ear .
“ You ca n’t sit here . ”
The man from the counter had appeared at my elbow .
He was glaring .
“ Excuse me ? ” I blinked a few times .
“ Emmm , ” he drew his discomfort into a long syllable , his brows knitted .
“ You can not stay here . ”
“ What ?
Uh why ? ”
Then he said it : “ Men only . ”
He did n’t tell me what I would learn later : Starbucks had another , unmarked door around back that led to a smaller espresso bar , and a handful of tables smothered by curtains .
That was the “ family ” section .
As a woman , that ’s where I belonged .
I had no right to mix with male customers or sit in plain view of passing shoppers .
Like the segregated South of a bygone United States , today ’s Saudi Arabia shunts half the population into separate , inferior and usually invisible spaces .
At that moment , there was only one thing to do .
I stood up .
From the depths of armchairs , men in their white robes and red-checked kaffiyehs stared impassively over their mugs .
I felt blood rushing to my face .
I dropped my eyes , and immediately wished I had n’t .
Snatching up the skirts of my robe to keep from stumbling , I walked out of the store and into the clatter of the shopping mall .
--
THAT was nearly four years ago , a lesson learned on one of my first trips to the kingdom .
Until that day , I thought I knew what I was doing : I ’d heard about Saudi Arabia , that the sexes are wholly segregated .
From museums to university campuses to restaurants , the genders live corralled existences .
One young , hip , U.S. - educated Saudi friend told me that he arranges to meet his female friends in other Arab cities .
It ’s easier to fly to Damascus or Dubai , he shrugged , than to chill out coeducationally at home .
I was ready to cope , or so I thought .
I arrived with a protective smirk in tow , planning to thicken the walls around myself .
I ’d report a few stories , and go home .
I had no inkling that Saudi Arabia , the experience of being a woman there , would stick to me , follow me home on the plane and shadow me through my days , tainting the way I perceived men and women everywhere .
I ’m leaving the Middle East now , closing up years spent covering the fighting and fallout that have swept the region since Sept. 11 .
Of all the strange , scary and joyful experiences of the past years , my time covering Saudi Arabia remains among the most jarring .
I spent my days in Saudi Arabia struggling unhappily between a lifetime of being taught to respect foreign cultures and the realization that this culture judged me a lesser being .
I tried to draw parallels :
If I went to South Africa during apartheid , would I feel compelled to be polite ?
I would find that I still saw scraps of Saudi Arabia everywhere I went .
Back home in Cairo , the usual cacophony of whistles and lewd coos on the streets sent me into blind rage .
I slammed doors in the faces of deliverymen ; cursed at Egyptian soldiers in a language they did n’t speak ; kept a resentful mental tally of the Western men , especially fellow reporters , who seemed to condone , even relish , the relegation of women in the Arab world .
In the West , there ’s a tendency to treat Saudi Arabia as a remote land , utterly removed from our lives .
But it ’s not very far from us , nor are we as different as we might like to think .
Saudi Arabia is a center of ideas and commerce , an important ally to the United States , the heartland of a major world religion .
It is a highly industrialized , ultramodern home to expatriates from all over the world , including Americans who live in lush gated compounds with swimming pools , drink illegal glasses of bathtub gin and speak glowingly of the glorious desert and the famous hospitality of Saudis .
The rules are different here .
The same U.S. government that heightened public outrage against the Taliban by decrying the mistreatment of Afghan women prizes the oil - slicked Saudi friendship and even offers wan praise for Saudi elections in which women are banned from voting .
All U.S. fast - food franchises operating here , not just Starbucks , make women stand in separate lines .
U.S. - owned hotels do n’t let women check in without a letter from a company vouching for her ability to pay ; women checking into hotels alone have long been regarded as prostitutes .
As I roamed in and out of Saudi Arabia , the abaya , or Islamic robe , eventually became the symbol of those shifting rules .
I always delayed until the last minute .
When I felt the plane dip low over Riyadh , I ’d reach furtively into my computer bag to fish out the black robe and scarf crumpled inside .
I ’d slip my arms into the sleeves without standing up .
If I caught the eyes of any male passengers as my fingers fumbled with the snaps , I ’d glare .
Was I imagining the smug looks on their faces ?
The sleeves , the length of it , always felt foreign , at first .
But it never took long to work its alchemy , to plant the insecurity .
After a day or two , the notion of appearing without the robe felt shocking .
Stripped of the layers of curve - smothering cloth , my ordinary clothes suddenly felt revealing , even garish .
To me , the abaya implied that a woman ’s body is a distraction and an interruption , a thing that must be hidden from view lest it haul the society into vice and disarray .
The simple act of wearing the robe implanted that self - consciousness by osmosis .
In the depths of the robe , my posture suffered .
I ’d draw myself in and bumble along like those adolescent girls who seem to think they can roll their breasts back into their bodies if they curve their spines far enough .
That was why , it hit me one day , I always seemed to come back from Saudi Arabia with a backache .
The kingdom made me slouch .
--
SAUDI men often raised the question of women with me ; they seemed to hope that I would tell them , either out of courtesy or conviction , that I endorsed their way of life .
Some blamed all manner of Western ills , from gun violence to alcoholism , on women ’s liberation .
“ Do you think you could ever live here ? ” many of them asked .
It sounded absurd every time , and every time I would repeat the obvious : No .
Early in 2005 , I covered the kingdom ’s much - touted municipal elections , which excluded women not only from running for office , but also from voting .
True to their tribal roots , candidates pitched tents in vacant lots and played host to voters for long nights of coffee , bull sessions and poetry recitations .
I accepted an invitation to visit one of the tents , but the sight of a woman in their midst so badly ruffled the would - be voters that the campaign manager hustled over and asked me , with lavish apologies , to make myself scarce before I cost his man the election .
A few days later , a female U.S. official , visiting from Washington , gave a press appearance in a hotel lobby in Riyadh .
Sporting pearls , a business suit and a bare , blond head , she praised the Saudi elections .
The election “ is a departure from their culture and their history , ” she said .
“ It offers to the citizens of Saudi Arabia hope .
It ’s modest , but it ’s dramatic . ”
The American ambassador , a bespectacled Texan named James C. Oberwetter , also praised the voting from his nearby seat .
“ When I got here a year ago , there were no political tents , ” he said .
“ It ’s like a backyard political barbecue in the U.S. ”
One afternoon , a candidate invited me to meet his daughter .
She spoke fluent English and was not much younger than me .
I cannot remember whether she was wearing hijab , the Islamic head scarf , inside her home , but I have a memory of pink .
I asked her about the elections .
“ Very good , ” she said .
So you really think so , I said gently , even though you ca n’t vote ?
“ Of course , ” she said .
“ Why do I need to vote ? ”
Her father chimed in .
He urged her , speaking English for my benefit , to speak candidly .
But she insisted :
What good was voting ?
She looked at me as if she felt sorry for me , a woman cast adrift on the rough seas of the world , no male protector in sight .
“ Maybe you do n’t want to vote , ” I said .
“ But would n’t you like to make that choice yourself ? ”
“ I do n’t need to , ” she said calmly , blinking slowly and deliberately .
“ If I have a father or a husband , why do I need to vote ?
Why should I need to work ?
They will take care of everything . ”
Through the years I have met many Saudi women .
Some are rebels ; some are proudly defensive of Saudi ways , convinced that any discussion of women ’s rights is a disguised attack on Islam from a hostile Westerner .
There was the young dental student who came home from the university and sat up half the night , writing a groundbreaking novel exploring the internal lives and romances of young Saudi women .
The oil expert who scolded me for asking about female drivers , pointing out the pitfalls of divorce and custody laws and snapping : “ Driving is the least of our problems . ”
I have met women who work as doctors and business consultants .
Many of them seem content .
Whatever their thoughts on the matter , they have been assigned a central , symbolic role in what seems to be one of the greatest existential questions in contemporary Saudi Arabia :
Can the country opt to develop in some ways and stay frozen in others ?
Can the kingdom evolve economically and technologically in a global society without relinquishing its particular culture of extreme religious piety and ancient tribal code ?
The men are stuck , too .
Over coffee one afternoon , an economist told me wistfully of the days when he and his wife had studied overseas , how she ’d hopped behind the wheel and did her own thing .
She ’s an independent , outspoken woman , he said .
Coming back home to Riyadh had depressed both of them .
“ Here , I got another dependent : my wife , ” he said .
He found himself driving her around , chaperoning her as if she were a child .
“ When they see a woman walking alone here , it ’s like a wolf watching a sheep .
‘ Let me take what ’s unattended . ’ ” He told me that both he and his wife hoped , desperately , that social and political reform would finally dawn in the kingdom .
He thought foreign academics were too easy on Saudi Arabia , that they urged only minor changes instead of all - out democracy because they secretly regarded Saudis as “ savages ” incapable of handling too much freedom .
“ I call them propaganda papers , ” he said of the foreign analysis .
“ They come up with all these lame excuses . ”
He and his wife had already lost hope for themselves , he said .
“ For ourselves , the train has left the station .
We are trapped , ” he said .
“ I think about my kids .
At least when I look at myself in the mirror I ’ll say : ‘ At least I said this .
At least I wrote this .’ ”
--
WHEN Saudi officials chat with an American reporter , they go to great lengths to depict a moderate , misunderstood kingdom .
They complain about stereotypes in the Western press : Women banned from driving ?
Well , they do n’t want to drive anyway .
They all have drivers , and why would a lady want to mess with parking ?
The religious police who stalk the streets and shopping centers , forcing “ Islamic values ” onto the populace ?
Oh , Saudi officials say , they really are n’t important , or strict , or powerful .
You hear stories to the contrary ?
Mere exaggerations , perpetuated by people who do n’t understand Saudi Arabia .
I had an interview one afternoon with a relatively high - ranking Saudi official .
Since I ca n’t drive anywhere or meet a man in a cafe , I usually end up inviting sources for coffee in the lobby of my hotel , where the staff turns a blind eye to whether those in the “ family section ” are really family .
As the elevator touched down and the shiny doors swung open onto the lobby , the official rushed toward me .
“ Do you think we could talk in your room ? ” he blurted out .
I stepped back .
What was this , some crazy come-on ?
“ No , why ? ” I stammered , stepping wide around him .
“ We can sit right over here . ” I wanted to get to the coffee shop — no dice .
He swung himself around , blocking my path and my view .
“ It ’s not a good idea , ” he said .
“ Let ’s just go to your room . ”
“ I really do n’t think I mean , ” I said , stuttering in embarrassment .
Then , peering over his shoulder , I saw them : two beefy men in robes .
Great bushes of beards sprang from their chins , they swung canes in their hands and scanned the hotel lobby through squinted eyes .
“ Is that the religious police ? ” I said .
“ It is ! ” I was a little mesmerized .
I ’d always wanted to see them in action .
The ministry official seemed to shrink a little , his shoulders slumped in defeat .
“ They ’re not supposed to be here , ” he muttered despondently .
“ What are they doing here ? ”
“ Well , why do n’t we go to the mall next door ? ” I said , eyes fixed on the menacing men .
“ There ’s a coffee shop there , we could try that . ”
“ No , they will go there next . ”
While he wrung his hands nervously , I stepped back a little and considered the irony of our predicament .
To avoid running afoul of what may be the world ’s most stringent public moral code , I was being asked to entertain a strange , older man in my hotel room , something I would never agree to back home .
I had to do something .
He was about to walk away and cancel the meeting , and I could n’t afford to lose it .
Then I remembered a couple of armchairs near the elevator , up on my floor .
We rode up and ordered room - service coffee .
We talked as the elevators chimed up and down the spine of the skyscraper and the roar of vacuum cleaners echoed in the hallway .
--
ONE glaring spring day , when the hot winds raced in off the plains and the sun blotted everything to white , I stood outside a Riyadh bank , sweating in my black cloak while I waited for a friend .
The sidewalk was simmering , but I had nowhere else to go .
As a woman , I was forbidden to enter the men ’s half of the bank to fetch him .
Traffic screamed past on a nearby highway .
The winds tugged at the layers of black polyester .
My sunglasses began to slip down my glistening nose .
The door clattered open , and I looked up hopefully .
But no , it was a security guard .
And he was stomping straight at me , yelling in Arabic .
I knew enough vocabulary to glean his message :
He did n’t want me standing there .
I took off my shades , fixed my blue eyes on him blankly and finally turned away as if puzzled .
I think of this as playing possum .
He disappeared again , only to reemerge with another security guard .
This man was of indistinct South Asian origin and had an English vocabulary .
He looked like a pit bull — short , stocky and teeth flashing as he barked : “ Go ! Go !
You ca n’t stand here !
The men can SEE !
The men can SEE ! ”
I looked down at him and sighed .
I was tired .
“ Where do you want me to go ?
I have to wait for my friend .
He ’s inside . ”
But he was still snarling and flashing those teeth , arms akimbo .
He was n’t interested in discussions .
“ Not here .
NOT HERE !
The men can SEE you ! ”
He flailed one arm toward the bank .
I lost my temper .
“ I ’m just standing here ! ” I snapped .
“ Leave me alone ! ” This was a slip .
I had already learned that if you ’re a woman in a sexist country , yelling at a man only makes a crisis worse .
The pit bull advanced toward me , making little shooing motions with his hands , lips curled back .
Involuntarily , I stepped back a few paces and found myself in the shrubbery .
I guess that , from the bushes , I was hidden from the view of the window , thereby protecting the virtue of all those innocent male bankers .
At any rate , it satisfied the pit bull , who climbed back onto the sidewalk and stood guard over me .
I glared at him .
He showed his teeth .
The minutes passed .
Finally , my friend reemerged .
A liberal , U.S. - educated professor at King Saud University , he was sure to share my outrage , I thought .
Maybe he ’d even call up the bank — his friend was the manager — and get the pit bull in trouble .
I told him my story , words hot as the pavement .
He hardly blinked .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ Oh . ” He put the car in reverse , and off we drove .
--
DRIVING to the airport , I felt the kingdom slipping off behind me , the flat emptiness of its deserts , the buildings that rear toward the sky , encased in mirrored glass , blank under a blaring sun .
All the hints of a private life I have never seen .
Saudis are bred from the desert ; they find life in what looks empty to me .
Even if I were Saudi , would I understand it ?
I remember the government spokesman , Mansour Turki , who said to me : “ Being a Saudi does n’t mean you see every face of Saudi society .
Saudi men do n’t understand how Saudi women think .
They have no idea , actually .
Even my own family , my own mother or sister , she wo n’t talk to me honestly . ”
I slipped my iPod headphones into my ears .
I wanted to hear something thumping and American .
It began the way it always does : an itch , an impatience , like a wrinkle in the sock , something that is felt , but not yet registered .
The discomfort always starts when I leave .
By the time I boarded the plane , I was in a temper .
I yanked at the clasps , shrugged off the abaya like a rejected embrace .
I crumpled it up and tossed it childishly into the airplane seat .
Then I was just standing there , feeling stripped in my jeans and blouse .
My limbs felt light , and modesty flashed through me .
I was aware of the skin of my wrists and forearms , the triangle of naked neck .
I scanned the eyes behind me , looking for a challenge .
But none came .
The Saudi passengers had watched my tantrum impassively .
I sat down , leaned back and breathed .
This moment , it seems , is always the same .
I take the abaya off , expecting to feel liberated .
But somehow , it always feels like defeat .

Stack reported in Saudi Arabia repeatedly during her tenure as The Times ’ Cairo Bureau chief from September 2003 until last month .
Hanna and Barbera won seven Academy Awards for Tom and Jerry
He died of natural causes at home with his wife , Sheila , at his side .
With William Hanna , Barbera founded Hanna - Barbera in the 1950s , after the pair had earlier worked on the Tom and Jerry cartoons at MGM studios .
" Joe will live on through his work , " said Warner Brothers chairman and chief executive Barry Meyer .
" The characters he created with his late partner , William Hanna , are not only animated superstars but also a very beloved part of American pop culture , " Mr Meyer said .
Cat and mouse collaboration
Barbera grew up in Brooklyn , New York and started to pursue a career in banking .
But his amateur sketches soon became the raw material for cartoons which were published in Collier 's magazine , a breakthrough which then took him into animation .
HAVE YOUR SAY Rest in peace Joseph

Send us your comments
He met Hanna at the Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer film studio , where they collaborated on a 1937 cartoon called Puss Gets the Boot , which led to the creation of cat - and - mouse duo Tom and Jerry .
Their 17 - year partnership on the Tom and Jerry series resulted in seven Academy Awards and 14 nominations in total .
Extended format
The pair left MGM and formed Hanna - Barbera Studios in 1957 , where they created numerous classic characters , including The Jetsons and The Flintstones .
Hanna - Barbera extended cartoons beyond the traditional six - minute slots .
Scooby - Doo became famous for his love of snacks
The Flintstones , featuring two modern - minded couples living in the stone age , was the first animated series to be broadcast on prime - time television .
In the decades that followed , Hanna - Barbera produced 300 cartoon series , with more than 3,000 half - hour shows .
Scooby - Doo , a Great Dane who leads a group of teenagers in ghost - hunting adventures , made his debut in 1969 and the series ran for 17 years , a record for a TV animated series .
" They were able to bring top quality cartoon shows to television , " said actor Casey Kasem , the voice of Shaggy , Scooby - Doo 's unkempt sidekick .
" When they came along and they did it , they made it profitable for people who were big investors , " he told the BBC .
" It 's a legacy that he has that has touched people around the world with what I call magic , they just kept producing one great show after another . "
Following Hanna 's death in 2001 , Joseph Barbera remained active as an executive producer for Warner Brothers Animation on TV series such as What 's New , Scooby - Doo ? and Tom and Jerry Tales .
I had an unfortunate accident on my bike Monday night : I was talking my Labrodor out for his evening run and it was fairly dark , no moon that I could see .
I 've done this most every night for about 4 years .
Normally I take my wife 's cruiser , but this night I was on my commuter bike .
I never put on a helmet as there are no cars out and we live in quiet tucked away neighborhood .
The neighborhood I live in has just recently been repaved .
In my neighborhood we have open ditches that carry irrigation water to our properties .
Well , my Lab was lagging behind and I looked back over my left shoulder to see why .
I " guess " I drifted to the right .
Next thing I know I am being slammed face first into the ground and my riding glasses were ripped off my face and my feet were touching the ground in front of my head .
My body snapped back like a sausage and I concentrated on not passing out .
I wiggled my fingers : good , not a quadrapeligic , I wiggled my toes .
Whew no broken back .
I crawled across some poor fellow 's lawn and banged on his door and yelled for help .
I had to convince him to open the door by telling him I was laying on the ground as he could not see me through his peep hole .
When he opened the door he screamed and wanted to call 911 .
I asked him to call my wife instead .
He threw me a towel and dialed my wife who had me in the Emergency Room about 8 minutes later .
6 hours and 90 stitches later they let me go :
The laceration on my forehead is in the shape of an " M " and is 33 cm in length .
Yesterday I went back to look at where I crashed .
The ditch goes into a culvert under the street and the shoulder between the road and the ditch is less than 4 " wide .
I 've riden past ditch hundreds of times ..... Oh well always wear your helmet .
“ We left everything to be safe , and we came here to start a new life , ” said Miriam , an Assyrian Christian who did not want her full name used because her husband and two of her three sons had not yet managed to leave Iraq .
“ In Iraq , we were deprived of even the simple right to go to church , and we want to hold on to our religion . ”
Sweden grants asylum to all Iraqis except those from the relatively stable Kurdish areas , and the immigration authorities do not even register their religious affiliation .
But Sodertalje has been a magnet for Christian refugees since the late 1960s , when Assyrian immigrants from Lebanon , Syria and Turkey established a thriving community here .
After the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and now , as extremists in Iraq step up their persecution of non-Muslims , more and more are trying to get here .
“ They come here to survive , ” said Jalal Hammo , the chairman of St. John ’s , a Chaldean Catholic church , who arrived from Iraq in 1994 .
“ The terrorists do all they can to make all Christians leave Iraq . ”
Culture shock for newly arrived Iraqis is felt far less here than it would be practically anywhere else in Sweden — or the West , for that matter .
Here , they can speak their native Arabic almost everywhere , and have their choice of churches for the Christian denominations common in Iraq : Chaldean Catholic , Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic .
In addition , they can see the games of two successful Assyrian soccer teams at the local stadium , as well as Suroyo TV , an Assyrian satellite TV station .
But even though Sodertalje is the choice for many Iraqi Christians , it is becoming increasingly clear that their new lives present many challenges — partly as a consequence of Sodertalje ’s status as a haven of choice .
Three in 10 Call SCOTUS ' Too Conservative ' With Roberts , Alito on court , figure is considerably higher than two years ago .
July 29 , 2007  --
Three in 10 Americans say the Supreme Court is " too conservative , " up sharply from two years ago and now substantially more than call it " too liberal . "
Just under half say the court is about balanced ideologically in its decisions .
Thirty - one - percent call the court too conservative , compared with 19 percent in July 2005 -- a period in which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito have joined the court , replacing William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor .
Considerably fewer , 18 percent , call the court too liberal .
Forty - seven percent say it 's balanced , down from 55 percent in 2005 .
Naturally there are sharp ideological differences in these views .
Fifty - one percent of liberals see the court as " too conservative , " compared with 36 percent of moderates and 10 percent of conservatives .
Indeed a third of conservatives call it too liberal .
Compared with two years ago , views of the court as too conservative are up 16 points among moderates , 10 points among liberals and six points ( albeit to a still very small number ) among conservatives themselves .
Such attitudes are not unprecedented ; about as many as now called the court too conservative in 1991 , when Clarence Thomas was nominated to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall .
On two specific recent rulings , the public splits : by 56 - 40 percent , most disapprove of a ruling restricting how school boards can use race to assign children to schools ; but by 55 - 43 percent , most approve of the Supreme Court 's decision upholding restrictions on so - called partial - birth abortion .

NEWARK --
Atheism might be the last political taboo , but it does n't seem to have hurt Rep. Pete Stark in his East Bay district .
In town hall meetings in Newark and San Leandro today , the 35 - year congressional veteran received only cheers and applause when a speaker brought up a survey this week that named Stark as the highest - ranking politician in America who was willing to admit he does n't believe in God .
Stark waved away any suggestion that he was being courageous when he described himself to the Secular Coalition for America , an association of atheist and humanist groups , as " a Unitarian who does not believe in a Supreme Being . "
" It 's not courageous to make a simple statement about personal beliefs , " he told about 70 people at the San Leandro City Hall .
" What is courageous is to stand up in Congress and say , ' Let 's tax the rich and give the money to poor kids . '
Now that 's courageous . "
Since the survey results were released , Stark has been bombarded by letters , phone calls and e-mails , and almost all thanked him for making his position public .
The response astounded the 75 - year - old Stark , a dyed - in - the - wool liberal who 's received plenty of nasty mail over the years .
" The attention is amazing , " he said .
" I do n't know what the guys who put out the press release did , but I 'd like to hire their PR person to run my next campaign .
I have been inundated ( with responses ) from literally all over the world . "
Of the 500 or so responses Stark has received , all but about 25 them have been supportive .
Even those were n't the type of harsh screeds that might be expected on a hot - button topic like religion .
" The negative responses were the most reasoned and reasonable I 've ever received , " he said .
" In this instance , the people who have disagreed with me have been polite and reasonable .
All in all , this has been a pleasurable experience . "
But Stark 's casual admission of disbelief was an important moment for local atheists .
Chuck Cannon of Concord compared Stark to civil rights heroine Rosa Parks for his willingness to go against the long - accepted political wisdom and put himself on the side of American atheists .
" Over the last several years , many of us have felt threatened by organized religion 's attempt to force a particular view , though legislation , on all of us , which means we lose our family values , " he said .
" I just wanted to commend you for your courageous , yet commonsense , stance that sets you above the religious pandering that goes on in Washington . "
Stark was quick to admit that in many other issues , his district 's liberal leanings make it possible for him to take public positions that could have serious political costs for other Democrats .
When explaining , for example , why trying to impeach President Bush or immediately pulling out of Iraq is something even a Congress controlled by Democrats is unwilling to do , he pointed out his party 's diversity , racially , geographically and ideologically .
" What I would do tomorrow would get a lot of my colleagues defeated , " he said , mentioning his willingness to raise taxes to pay for universal health care .
Still , Stark was struck by the fact that not one of his 534 colleagues in the House or Senate was willing to say he or she was an atheist .
" They were looking for the highest - ranking politician who would state his or her ( lack of ) belief in a Supreme Being , " Stark said .
" Well , I was the first and the second was a former member of the Berkeley school board .
That 's a pretty big gap . "
That 's not surprising , said Mark Thomas , assistant state director of American Atheists and the man who nominated Stark for the recognition -- and won a $ 1,000 prize for it .
" With the current political climate , many think it would be difficult to come out and say they do n't believe in God , " he said after speaking with the congressman outside Newark City Hall .
" But Pete Stark has n't paid a political price . "
Thomas was even happier to see that most of the people at the town hall meetings were n't interested in talking about Stark 's position on God.
Instead , Iraq , health care , global warming , immigration and other national issues that drove the hour - long sessions .
" It 's great that ( atheism ) did n't come up , " he said .
" There are far more important things to be concerned about than what Congressman Stark believes . "
This article attempts to give an overview of category theory , in so far as it applies to Haskell .
To this end , Haskell code will be given alongside the mathematical definitions .
Absolute rigour is not followed ; in its place , we seek to give the reader an intuitive feel for what the concepts of category theory are and how they relate to Haskell .
Introduction to categories [ edit ]
A , B and C , three identity morphisms id A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A}} id B {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{B}} id C {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{C}} f : C → B {\displaystyle f:C\to B} g : A → B {\displaystyle g:A\to
B} A simple category , with three objectsand , three identity morphismsand , and two other morphismsand .
The third element ( the specification of how to compose the morphisms ) is not shown .
A category is , in essence , a simple collection .
It has three components :
A collection of objects .
.
A collection of morphisms , each of which ties two objects ( a source object and a target object ) together .
( These are sometimes called arrows , but we avoid that term here as it has other connotations in Haskell . )
If f is a morphism with source object C and target object B , we write f : C → B {\displaystyle f:C\to B}
, each of which ties two objects ( a and a ) together .
( These are sometimes called , but we avoid that term here as it has other connotations in Haskell . )
If is a morphism with source object and target object , we write A notion of composition of these morphisms .
If g : A → B {\displaystyle g:A\to B} f : B → C {\displaystyle f:B\to C} f ∘ g : A → C {\displaystyle f\circ g:A\to C}
Lots of things form categories .
For example , Set is the category of all sets with morphisms as standard functions and composition being standard function composition .
( Category names are often typeset in bold face . )
Grp is the category of all groups with morphisms as functions that preserve group operations ( the group homomorphisms ) , i.e. for any two groups , G with operation * and H with operation · , a function k : G → H {\displaystyle k:G\to
H} is a morphism in Grp if :
k ( u ∗ v ) = k ( u ) ⋅ k ( v ) {\displaystyle k( u*v) =k(u ) \cdot k( v ) }
It may seem that morphisms are always functions , but this need n't be the case .
For example , any partial order ( P , ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } ) defines a category where the objects are the elements of P , and there is a morphism between any two objects A and B iff A ≤ B {\displaystyle A\leq B} .
Moreover , there are allowed to be multiple morphisms with the same source and target objects ; using the Set example , sin {\displaystyle \sin } and cos {\displaystyle \cos } are both functions with source object R {\displaystyle \mathbb { R} } ( the set of real numbers ) and target object [ − 1 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [ - 1,1 ]} , but they ’re most certainly not the same morphism !
Category laws [ edit ]
There are three laws that categories need to follow .
Firstly , and most simply , the composition of morphisms needs to be associative .
Symbolically ,
f ∘ ( g ∘ h ) = ( f ∘ g ) ∘ h {\displaystyle f\circ ( g\circ h ) =( f\circ g ) \circ h}
Morphisms are applied right to left in Haskell and most commonly in mathematics , so with f ∘ g {\displaystyle f\circ g} first g is applied , then f .
Secondly , the category needs to be closed under the composition operation .
So if f : B → C {\displaystyle f:B\to C} and g : A → B {\displaystyle g:A\to B} , then there must be some morphism h : A → C {\displaystyle h: A\to
C} in the category such that h = f ∘ g {\displaystyle h=f\circ g} .
We can see how this works using the following category :
f and g are both morphisms so we must be able to compose them and get another morphism in the category .
So which is the morphism f ∘ g {\displaystyle f\circ g} ?
The only option is id A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A}} .
Similarly , we see that g ∘ f = id B {\displaystyle g\circ f=\operatorname {id} _{ B}} .
Lastly , given a category C there needs to be for every object A an identity morphism , id A : A → A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A} : A\to
A} that is an identity of composition with other morphisms .
Put precisely , for every morphism g : A → B {\displaystyle g:A\to B} :
g ∘ id A = id B ∘ g = g {\displaystyle g\circ \operatorname {id} _{A}=\operatorname {id} _{B}\circ g=g}
Hask , the Haskell category [ edit ]
The main category we 'll be concerning ourselves with in this article is Hask , which treats Haskell types as objects and Haskell functions as morphisms and uses (. ) for composition : a function f :: A -> B for types A and B is a morphism in Hask .
We can check the first and second law easily : we know (. ) is an associative function , and clearly , for any f and g , f . g is another function .
In Hask , the identity morphism is id , and we have trivially :
id . f = f . id = f
[ 1 ]
This is n't an exact translation of the law above , though ; we 're missing subscripts .
The function id in Haskell is polymorphic — it can take many different types for its domain and range , or , in category - speak , can have many different source and target objects .
But morphisms in category theory are by definition monomorphic — each morphism has one specific source object and one specific target object ( note : monomorphic here is not being used in the category theoretic sense ) .
A polymorphic Haskell function can be made monomorphic by specifying its type ( instantiating with a monomorphic type ) , so it would be more precise if we said that the identity morphism from Hask on a type A is ( id :: A -> A ) .
With this in mind , the above law would be rewritten as :
( id :: B -> B ) . f = f . ( id :: A -> A ) = f
However , for simplicity , we will ignore this distinction when the meaning is clear .
Exercises
As was mentioned , any partial order ( P , ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } P and a morphism between elements a and b iff a ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } ≤ {\displaystyle \leq }
, and a morphism between elements and iff a ( Harder . )
If we add another morphism to the above example , as illustrated below , it fails to be a category .
Why ?
Hint : think about associativity of the composition operation .
Functors [ edit ]
C {\displaystyle \mathbf { C} } D {\displaystyle \mathbf { D} } A and B both get mapped to the same object in D {\displaystyle \mathbf { D} } g becomes a morphism with the same source and target object ( but is n't necessarily an identity ) , and id A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A}} id B {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{ B}} A functor between two categories , and .
Of note is that the objectsandboth get mapped to the same object in , and that thereforebecomes a morphism with the same source and target object ( but is n't necessarily an identity ) , andandbecome the same morphism .
The arrows showing the mapping of objects are shown in a dotted , pale olive .
The arrows showing the mapping of morphisms are shown in a dotted , pale blue .
So we have some categories which have objects and morphisms that relate our objects together .
The next Big Topic in category theory is the functor , which relates categories together .
A functor is essentially a transformation between categories , so given categories C and D , a functor F : C → D {\displaystyle F: C\to D} :
Maps any object A in C to F ( A ) {\displaystyle F( A ) } D .
in to .
Maps morphisms f : A → B {\displaystyle f:A\to B} C to F ( f ) : F ( A ) → F ( B ) {\displaystyle F( f ) : F( A ) \to F ( B ) } D .
One of the canonical examples of a functor is the forgetful functor G r p → S e t {\displaystyle \mathbf { Grp} \to \mathbf { Set} } which maps groups to their underlying sets and group morphisms to the functions which behave the same but are defined on sets instead of groups .
Another example is the power set functor S e t → S e t {\displaystyle \mathbf { Set} \to \mathbf { Set} } which maps sets to their power sets and maps functions f : X → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to
Y} to functions P ( X ) → P ( Y ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal { P}} ( X ) \to {\mathcal { P}} ( Y ) } which take inputs U ⊆ X {\displaystyle U\subseteq X} and return f ( U ) {\displaystyle f( U ) } , the image of U under f , defined by f ( U ) = { f ( u ) : u ∈ U } {\displaystyle f( U ) =\{\ , f( u ) : u\in U\ , \}} .
For any category C , we can define a functor known as the identity functor on C , or 1 C : C → C {\displaystyle 1_{C} : C\to C} , that just maps objects to themselves and morphisms to themselves .
This will turn out to be useful in the monad laws section later on .
Once again there are a few axioms that functors have to obey .
Firstly , given an identity morphism id A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A}} on an object A , F ( id A ) {\displaystyle F ( \operatorname {id} _{ A} ) } must be the identity morphism on F ( A ) {\displaystyle F( A ) } , i.e. :
F ( id A ) = id F ( A ) {\displaystyle F ( \operatorname {id} _{A} ) =\operatorname {id} _{F( A)}}
Secondly functors must distribute over morphism composition , i.e .
F ( f ∘ g ) = F ( f ) ∘ F ( g ) {\displaystyle F ( f\circ g ) =F( f ) \circ F( g ) }
Exercises
For the diagram given on the right , check these functor laws .
Functors on Hask [ edit ]
The Functor typeclass you have probably seen in Haskell does in fact tie in with the categorical notion of a functor .
Remember that a functor has two parts : it maps objects in one category to objects in another and morphisms in the first category to morphisms in the second .
Functors in Haskell are from Hask to func , where func is the subcategory of Hask defined on just that functor 's types .
E.g. the list functor goes from Hask to Lst , where Lst is the category containing only list types , that is , [ T ] for any type T .
The morphisms in Lst are functions defined on list types , that is , functions [ T ] -> [ U ] for types T , U .
How does this tie into the Haskell typeclass Functor ?
Recall its definition :
class Functor ( f :: * -> *) where fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
Let 's have a sample instance , too :
instance Functor Maybe where fmap f ( Just x ) = Just ( f x ) fmap _ Nothing = Nothing
Here 's the key part : the type constructor Maybe takes any type T to a new type , Maybe T .
Also , fmap restricted to Maybe types takes a function a -> b to a function Maybe a -> Maybe b .
But that 's it !
We 've defined two parts , something that takes objects in Hask to objects in another category ( that of Maybe types and functions defined on Maybe types ) , and something that takes morphisms in Hask to morphisms in this category .
So Maybe is a functor .
A useful intuition regarding Haskell functors is that they represent types that can be mapped over .
This could be a list or a Maybe , but also more complicated structures like trees .
A function that does some mapping could be written using fmap , then any functor structure could be passed into this function .
E.g. you could write a generic function that covers all of Data .
List.map , Data.Map.map , Data .
Array .IArray.amap , and so on .
What about the functor axioms ?
The polymorphic function id takes the place of id A {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{A}} for any A , so the first law states :
fmap id = id
With our above intuition in mind , this states that mapping over a structure doing nothing to each element is equivalent to doing nothing overall .
Secondly , morphism composition is just (. ) , so
fmap ( f . g ) = fmap f . fmap g
This second law is very useful in practice .
Picturing the functor as a list or similar container , the right - hand side is a two - pass algorithm : we map over the structure , performing g , then map over it again , performing f .
The functor axioms guarantee we can transform this into a single - pass algorithm that performs f . g .
This is a process known as fusion .
Exercises Check the laws for the Maybe and list functors .
Translating categorical concepts into Haskell [ edit ]
Functors provide a good example of how category theory gets translated into Haskell .
The key points to remember are that :
We work in the category Hask and its subcategories .
and its subcategories .
Objects are types .
Morphisms are functions .
Things that take a type and return another type are type constructors .
Things that take a function and return another function are higher - order functions .
Typeclasses , along with the polymorphism they provide , make a nice way of capturing the fact that in category theory things are often defined over a number of objects at once .
Monads [ edit ]
unit and join , the two morphisms that must exist for every object for a given monad .
Monads are obviously an extremely important concept in Haskell , and in fact they originally came from category theory .
A monad is a special type of functor , from a category to that same category , that supports some additional structure .
So , down to definitions .
A monad is a functor M : C → C {\displaystyle M: C\to C} , along with two morphisms [ 2 ] for every object X in C :
unit X M : X → M ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {unit} _{X}^{ M}:X\to M( X ) }
join X M : M ( M ( X ) ) → M ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {join} _{X} ^ { M}: M( M( X ) ) \to M( X ) }
When the monad under discussion is obvious , we ’ll leave out the M superscript for these functions and just talk about unit X {\displaystyle \operatorname {unit} _{X}} and join X {\displaystyle \operatorname {join} _{X}} for some X .
Let ’s see how this translates to the Haskell typeclass Monad , then .
class Functor m =>
Monad m where return :: a -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
The class constraint of Functor m ensures that we already have the functor structure : a mapping of objects and of morphisms .
return is the ( polymorphic ) analogue to unit X {\displaystyle \operatorname {unit} _{X}} for any X .
But we have a problem .
Although return ’s type looks quite similar to that of unit ; the other function , ( >>= ) , often called bind , bears no resemblance to join .
There is however another monad function , join :: Monad m => m ( m a ) -> m a , that looks quite similar .
Indeed , we can recover join and ( >>= ) from each other :
join :: Monad m => m ( m a ) -> m a join x = x >>= id ( >>= ) :: Monad m => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b x >>= f = join ( fmap f x )
So specifying a monad ’s return , fmap , and join is equivalent to specifying its return and ( >>= ) .
It just turns out that the normal way of defining a monad in category theory is to give unit and join , whereas Haskell programmers like to give return and ( >>= ) . [ 3 ]
Often , the categorical way makes more sense .
Any time you have some kind of structure M {\displaystyle M} and a natural way of taking any object X {\displaystyle X} into M ( X ) {\displaystyle M ( X ) } , as well as a way of taking M ( M ( X ) ) {\displaystyle M ( M ( X ) ) } into M ( X ) {\displaystyle M ( X ) } , you probably have a monad .
We can see this in the following example section .
Example : the powerset functor is also a monad [ edit ]
The power set functor P : S e t → S e t {\displaystyle P:\mathbf { Set} \to \mathbf { Set} } described above forms a monad .
For any set S you have a unit S ⁡ ( x ) = { x } {\displaystyle \operatorname {unit} _{ S} ( x ) =\{x\}} , mapping elements to their singleton set .
Note that each of these singleton sets are trivially a subset of S , so unit S {\displaystyle \operatorname {unit} _{S}} returns elements of the powerset of S , as is required .
Also , you can define a function join S {\displaystyle \operatorname {join} _{S}} as follows : we receive an input L ∈ P ( P ( S ) ) {\displaystyle L\in {\mathcal { P}} ( {\mathcal { P}} ( S ) ) } .
This is :
A member of the powerset of the powerset of S .
.
So a member of the set of all subsets of the set of all subsets of S .
.
So a set of subsets of S
We then return the union of these subsets , giving another subset of S. Symbolically ,
join S ⁡ ( L ) = ⋃ L {\displaystyle \operatorname {join} _{S}( L ) =\bigcup L}
Hence P is a monad [ 4 ] .
In fact , P is almost equivalent to the list monad ; with the exception that we 're talking lists instead of sets , they 're almost the same .
Compare :

The monad laws and their importance [ edit ]
Just as functors had to obey certain axioms in order to be called functors , monads have a few of their own .
We 'll first list them , then translate to Haskell , then see why they ’re important .
Given a monad M : C → C {\displaystyle M: C\to C} and a morphism f : A → B {\displaystyle f:A\to
B} for A , B ∈ C {\displaystyle A , B\in C} ,
j o i n ∘ M ( j o i n ) = j o i n ∘ j o i n {\displaystyle \mathrm { join} \circ M ( \mathrm {join} ) =\mathrm {join} \circ \mathrm { join} } j o i n ∘ M ( u n i t ) = j o i n ∘ u n i t = i d {\displaystyle \mathrm { join} \circ M( \mathrm {unit} ) =\mathrm {join} \circ \mathrm {unit} =\mathrm {id} } u n i t ∘ f = M ( f ) ∘ u n i t {\displaystyle \mathrm {unit} \circ f=M( f ) \circ \mathrm {unit} } j o i n ∘ M ( M ( f ) ) = M ( f ) ∘ j o i n {\displaystyle \mathrm { join} \circ M ( M ( f ) ) = M( f ) \circ \mathrm {join} }
By now , the Haskell translations should be hopefully self - explanatory :
join .
fmap join = join .
join join .
fmap return = join .
return = id return .
f = fmap f . return join .
fmap ( fmap f ) = fmap f . join
( Remember that fmap is the part of a functor that acts on morphisms . )
These laws seem a bit impenetrable at first , though .
What on earth do these laws mean , and why should they be true for monads ?
Let ’s explore the laws .
The first law [ edit ]
join .
fmap join = join .
join
A demonstration of the first law for lists .
Remember that join is concat and fmap is map in the list monad .
In order to understand this law , we 'll first use the example of lists .
The first law mentions two functions , join .
fmap join ( the left - hand side ) and join .
join ( the right - hand side ) .
What will the types of these functions be ?
Remembering that join ’s type is [ [ a ] ] -> [ a ] ( we ’re talking just about lists for now ) , the types are both [ [ [ a ] ] ] -> [ a ] ( the fact that they ’re the same is handy ; after all , we ’re trying to show they ’re completely the same function ! ) .
So we have a list of lists of lists .
The left - hand side , then , performs fmap join on this 3 - layered list , then uses join on the result .
fmap is just the familiar map for lists , so we first map across each of the list of lists inside the top - level list , concatenating them down into a list each .
So afterward , we have a list of lists , which we then run through join .
In summary , we ' enter ' the top level , collapse the second and third levels down , then collapse this new level with the top level .
What about the right - hand side ?
We first run join on our list of list of lists .
Although this is three layers , and you normally apply a two - layered list to join , this will still work , because a [ [ [ a ] ] ] is just [ [ b ] ] , where b = [ a ] , so in a sense , a three - layered list is just a two layered list , but rather than the last layer being ' flat ' , it is composed of another list .
So if we apply our list of lists ( of lists ) to join , it will flatten those outer two layers into one .
As the second layer was n't flat but instead contained a third layer , we will still end up with a list of lists , which the other join flattens .
Summing up , the left - hand side will flatten the inner two layers into a new layer , then flatten this with the outermost layer .
The right - hand side will flatten the outer two layers , then flatten this with the innermost layer .
These two operations should be equivalent .
It ’s sort of like a law of associativity for join .
Maybe is also a monad , with
return :: a ->
Maybe a return x = Just x join :: Maybe ( Maybe a ) ->
Maybe a join Nothing = Nothing join ( Just Nothing ) =
Nothing join ( Just ( Just x ) ) = Just x
So if we had a three - layered Maybe ( i.e. , it could be Nothing , Just Nothing , Just ( Just Nothing ) or Just ( Just ( Just x ) ) ) , the first law says that collapsing the inner two layers first , then that with the outer layer is exactly the same as collapsing the outer layers first , then that with the innermost layer .
Exercises Verify that the list and Maybe monads do in fact obey this law with some examples to see precisely how the layer flattening works .
The second law [ edit ]
join .
fmap return = join .
return = id
What about the second law , then ?
Again , we 'll start with the example of lists .
Both functions mentioned in the second law are functions [ a ] -> [ a ] .
The left - hand side expresses a function that maps over the list , turning each element x into its singleton list [ x ] , so that at the end we ’re left with a list of singleton lists .
This two - layered list is flattened down into a single - layer list again using the join .
The right hand side , however , takes the entire list [ x , y , z , ... ] , turns it into the singleton list of lists [ [ x , y , z , ... ] ] , then flattens the two layers down into one again .
This law is less obvious to state quickly , but it essentially says that applying return to a monadic value , then join ing the result should have the same effect whether you perform the return from inside the top layer or from outside it .
Exercises Prove this second law for the Maybe monad .
The third and fourth laws [ edit ]
return .
f = fmap f . return
join .
fmap ( fmap f ) = fmap f . join
The last two laws express more self - evident facts about how we expect monads to behave .
The easiest way to see how they are true is to expand them to use the expanded form :
\x -> return ( f x ) = \x -> fmap f ( return x ) \x -> join ( fmap ( fmap f ) x ) = \x -> fmap f ( join x )
Exercises Convince yourself that these laws should hold true for any monad by exploring what they mean , in a similar style to how we explained the first and second laws .
Application to do - blocks [ edit ]
Well , we have intuitive statements about the laws that a monad must support , but why is that important ?
The answer becomes obvious when we consider do - blocks .
Recall that a do - block is just syntactic sugar for a combination of statements involving ( >>= ) as witnessed by the usual translation :
do { x } --> x do { let { y = v } ; x } --> let y = v in do { x } do { v <- y ; x } --> y >>= \v -> do { x } do { y ; x } --> y >>= \_ -> do { x }
Also notice that we can prove what are normally quoted as the monad laws using return and ( >>= ) from our above laws ( the proofs are a little heavy in some cases , feel free to skip them if you want to ) :
return x >>= f = f x .
Proof : return x >>= f = join ( fmap f ( return x ) ) --
By the definition of ( >>= ) = join ( return ( f x ) ) --
By law 3 = ( join . return ) ( f x ) = id ( f x ) --
By law 2 = f x m >>= return = m .
Proof : m >>= return = join ( fmap return m ) --
By the definition of ( >>= ) = ( join . fmap return ) m = id m --
By law 2 = m ( m >>= f ) >>= g = m >>= ( \x -> f x >>= g ) .
Proof ( recall that fmap f . fmap g = fmap ( f . g ) ) : ( m >>= f ) >>= g = ( join ( fmap f m ) ) >>= g --
By the definition of ( >>= ) = join ( fmap g ( join ( fmap f m ) ) ) --
By the definition of ( >>= ) = ( join . fmap g ) ( join ( fmap f m ) ) = ( join . fmap g . join ) ( fmap f m ) = ( join . join . fmap ( fmap g ) ) ( fmap f m ) --
By law 4 = ( join . join .
fmap ( fmap g ) . fmap f ) m = ( join .
join . fmap ( fmap g . f ) ) m --
By the distributive law of functors = ( join . join . fmap ( \x -> fmap g ( f x ) ) ) m = ( join . fmap join .
fmap ( \x -> fmap g ( f x ) ) ) m --
By law 1 = ( join . fmap ( join . ( \x -> fmap g ( f x ) ) ) ) m --
By the distributive law of functors = ( join . fmap ( \x -> join ( fmap g ( f x ) ) ) ) m = ( join . fmap ( \x -> f x >>= g ) ) m --
By the definition of ( >>= ) = join ( fmap ( \x -> f x >>= g ) m ) = m >>= ( \x -> f x >>= g ) --
By the definition of ( >>= )
These new monad laws , using return and ( >>= ) , can be translated into do - block notation .
Points - free style Do-block style return x >>= f = f x do { v <- return x ; f v } = do { f x } m >>= return = m do { v <- m ; return v } = do { m } ( m >>= f ) >>= g = m >>= ( \x -> f x >>= g ) do { y <- do { x <- m ; f x } ; g y } = do { x <- m ; y <- f x ; g y }
The monad laws are now common - sense statements about how do - blocks should function .
If one of these laws were invalidated , users would become confused , as you could n't be able to manipulate things within the do - blocks as would be expected .
The monad laws are , in essence , usability guidelines .
Exercises
In fact , the two versions of the laws we gave : -- Categorical : join .
fmap join = join .
join join .
fmap return = join .
return = id return .
f = fmap f . return join .
fmap ( fmap f ) = fmap f . join -- Functional : m >>= return = m return m >>= f = f m ( m >>= f ) >>= g = m >>= ( \x -> f x >>= g ) are entirely equivalent .
We showed that we can recover the functional laws from the categorical ones .
Go the other way ; show that starting from the functional laws , the categorical laws hold .
It may be useful to remember the following definitions : join m = m >>= id fmap f m = m >>= return . f

Summary [ edit ]
We 've come a long way in this chapter .
We 've looked at what categories are and how they apply to Haskell .
We 've introduced the basic concepts of category theory including functors , as well as some more advanced topics like monads , and seen how they 're crucial to idiomatic Haskell .
We have n't covered some of the basic category theory that was n't needed for our aims , like natural transformations , but have instead provided an intuitive feel for the categorical grounding behind Haskell 's structures .
Notes
New efforts are being made to expose British companies that profited from the African slave trade in a bid to claim reparations .
The Global Afrikan Congress , representing people of African descent , has started detailed investigations in the Caribbean to establish which firms were active there and what became of them .
British banking , insurance and shipping companies may face legal battles as campaigners take encouragement from a decision made in the US courts last December , when a senior judge gave leave to Deadria Farmer - Paellmann , a descendant of slaves in the States and a legal expert , to sue some of the biggest names on Wall Street .
Farmer - Paellmann is suing JP Morgan Chase , AIG and other US giants under consumer fraud law .
The action centres on the idea that black people bought policies and took out accounts from companies that knowingly hid their involvement in the slave trade .
Farmer - Paellman is now helping the Global Afrikan Congress .
Any reparations will be paid into a trust to fund education , health and housing programmes for black people worldwide .
It was Farmer - Paellman 's campaign that resulted in a new US law that requires businesses applying for government work to detail their involvement in the slave trade .
This law prompted JP Morgan Chase to confess that it owned thousands of slaves and loaned substantial sums to slave traders .
JP Morgan Chase subsequently paid $ 5 m into an education charity .
Earlier this year Barclays Bank conceded that companies it bought over the years may have been involved in the slave trade .
' The slavery system was one of the most abominable crimes in history , ' stated Anthony Gifford , who practices as a barrister in England and as an attorney in Jamaica specialising in human rights .
' No amends have ever been made ...
A movement has begun for reparations to be paid to Africans for the crime . '
JP Morgan admitted that two ' predecessor ' banks ' accepted approximately 13,000 enslaved individuals as collateral on loans and took possession of approximately 1,250 enslaved individuals ' .
JP Morgan
Chase went on to apologise for its role in the slave trade .
Previous attempts to win slavery reparations were made against the United States itself and foundered on sovereign immunity grounds .
Farmer - Paellmann 's breakthrough was focusing on the businesses that profited directly from the trade .
Many of these firms are still in existence , having been bought by household names .

This is what we have come to : Supreme Court justices citing Hollywood for constitutional principles :
Senior judges from North America and Europe were in the midst of a panel discussion about torture and terrorism law , when a Canadian judge 's passing remark - " Thankfully , security agencies in all our countries do not subscribe to the mantra ' What would Jack Bauer do ? ' " - got the legal bulldog in Judge Scalia barking .
The conservative jurist stuck up for Agent Bauer , arguing that fictional or not , federal agents require latitude in times of great crisis .
" Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles .
...
He saved hundreds of thousands of lives , " Judge Scalia said .
Then , recalling Season 2 , where the agent 's rough interrogation tactics saved California from a terrorist nuke , the Supreme Court judge etched a line in the sand .
" Are you going to convict Jack Bauer ? " Judge Scalia challenged his fellow judges .
" Say that criminal law is against him ?
' You have the right to a jury trial ? '
Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer ?
I do n't think so .
" So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes .
And ought we believe in these absolutes . "
From navigating the Web in entirely new ways to seeing where in the world twitters are coming from , data visualization tools are changing the way we view content .
We found the following 16 apps both visually stunning and delightfully useful .
Visualize Your Network with Fidg’t Fidg’t is a desktop application that aims to let you visualize your network and its predisposition for different types of things like music and photos .

In a few weeks the US Congress is likely to vote to phase out the standard incandescent lightbulb within a decade .
The frantic race to see who can best appease the global warming alarmists will claim another victim , the friendly glow of the direct descendant of Thomas Edison 's filament - based light bulb .
Why would the humble lightbulb , a staple commodity that has raised the standard of living throughout the world , be in the bullseye ?
It was the incandescent electric light bulb that abolished the tyranny of the night .
Our 19th and 20th century ancestors believed it one of the greatest gifts of civilization because they had directly experienced life before electric lighting changed everything .
In 2002 , former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld briefly reminded us of this blessing when he commented on the satellite imagery revealing the nighttime darkness in North Korea , but other than this brief moment , we seem to have forgotten what we owe to Edison 's first invention .
Ironically , the lowly lightbulb became one of the icons of the New Deal , forever connected with the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 .
The REA and the TVA enabled cheap electric power to be available everywhere , even on the remotest farms and ranches .
And a substantial part of the American people fell in love with big government because it brought this fruit of civilization , the rollback of the night , to all Americans .
But today , more than anything else , the humble lightbulb is altogether another sort of convenient symbol for big government - a technology dinosaur , perpetrator of evil crimes against the planet .
Stopping the wasteful use of kilowatts by American households in the war on greenhouse gases is the new battle cry of the lovers of governmental control over our lives .
There are about 4 billion conventional screw - in light bulb sockets all across America ; the vast majority are in homes and apartments .
Incandescent light bulbs are in most of these sockets , with some 2 billion or more replaced every year .
It is estimated at least $ 15 billion of electricity is consumed by these inefficient anachronisms , and that by replacing them with more energy efficient types of lightbulbs - primarily post - modern compact fluorescents -- that $ 15 billion could be cut in half .
We are told that as kilowatts could be reduced , we would need fewer nasty coal - fired power generating plants , while winning a major battle against global warming with little pain and even less effort .
Everybody wins !
Well , not exactly .
Once again , a nice - sounding theory overlooks significant details of the practical outcomes .
Energy conservation lobbyists conveniently overlook the obvious fact that household lightbulbs are primarily used at night - exactly opposite the time of day in which utilities experience peak load demands for daytime heating , air conditioning and commercial lighting .
Peak load shedding is what is most necessary for taking coal fired power plants out of commission .
Reducing nighttime lightbulb consumption of kwhs will do almost nothing to shave peak demand .
Moreover , with non-peak kwhs reduced at night , utilities will now have fewer revenues on which to earn a return on their invested capital .
Utilities must build up their physical plant to meet the peaks , and the capital to finance that equipment has to be paid for 24 hours a day .
Thus , utilities will have to raise rates on the remainder of the kwhs we use for everything else , from washing machines to hair dryers to computers .
Household power used by lightbulbs is actually dwarfed these days by major appliances and high tech consumer electronics - such as wide screen TVs , computers and video games along with internet servers , the biggest energy hogs besides cars and trucks .
And since the new CFLs produce inferior light compared to incandescents , we 'll need more of them to read , shave , comb our hair and brush our teeth .
Assuming literacy and personal hygiene are still hallmarks of civilized life after the global warming alarmists are done with their crusade to rid us of the blessings of the evil civilization that rapes Mother Gaia .
By banning the incandescent lightbulb Congress will forcibly remove a staple commodity from the marketplace , replacing it with products that are far more expensive , less reliable and more hazardous , notably the much ballyhooed compact fluorescent lightbulb ( CFL ) .
CFL lightbulbs have been around for well over a decade .
Only recently have they come in enough varieties and flavors to capture about 10 % of the available sockets .
But they are still at least 5 times more expensive than regular incandescents , which if replaced in their entirety would cost consumers an extra $ 4 to 5 billion at the cash register .
No doubt millions of Americans will enthusiastically embrace this new technology and be willing to pay extra to get it .
But millions more will not fare so well .
This ban will be a tax on poor people and the silent majority - retirees on fixed incomes , single working parents , low wage earners working double shifts or two jobs along with the average Joes and Marys who live each week paycheck - to - paycheck .
They do n't have cable TV to watch the Home and Garden channel , and can't afford to replace their functional if drab table lamp fixtures , much less employ a green ideology - toting residential lighting designer .
For these Americans , burdens come in large packages .
Relief arrives less often , and then in small envelopes , such as reduced inflationary pressures on staple commodities like lightbulbs and all the necessities of life purchased at low prices from Wal - Mart .
Of course Wal - Mart is yet another enemy of the trendy affluent class that wants to dictate how the rest of us lead our lives .
And guess where the extra purchase prices for these CFLs will wind up ?
In the pockets of Chinese manufacturers , because not a single CFL is produced in the US .
And it gets worse .
As Chinese manufacturers add enough manufacturing capacity to produce ten times as many CFLs , they will need several new coal - fired power plants to run the new factories .
This comes on top of the already breathtaking pace today of construction in coal fired electric power plants in China - at a clip of one new plant every week .
Do n't even think about asking about what kind of pollution control will be operating on those Chinese plants .
A tax on poor people in the US so the Chinese can add more coal fired power plants .
Now there 's a bright idea .
There 's even more to this story : one more dirty little secret that the greens wo n't tell you about .
CFLs contain mercury .
You did n't know that ?
Just a drop you say ?
How about up to 5 milligrams per lightbulb .
If all 4 billion incandescent sockets were filled with CFLs we'd have 20 billion milligrams of mercury spread around every single US household .
By the way , 20 billion milligrams is nearly 50,000 pounds .
That 50,000 pounds of mercury amongst 300 million people , if indiscriminately thrown away , will eventually find its way to your favorite landfill and public drinking water supply .
Knock over a table lamp and shatter a CFL in your house , and you have a toxic waste situation on your hands right in the living room , bedroom or dining room .
On the other hand , at least half of all mercury emissions from coal fired power plants currently is captured by scrubbers , and clean coal technologies promise to eliminate 2 /3rds of what remains .
Not so for CFLs -- which can't operate without mercury .
So there you have it .
Congress will soon enact legislation to impose a tax on poor people that will directly pass to Chinese companies , contribute to lower literacy and less personal hygiene while making industrial policy that will increase greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and spread a hazardous heavy metal into the environment .
Ban the bulb is a no- brainer , only this time the empty - headed variety .

In December over one thousand Israelis had purchased land on the moon .
The price of each plot of land with an area of half a dunam ( about 0.123 acres ) is NIS 250 ( about USD 60 ) as reported by the official moon property 's website on Wednesday .
During the 1970's , the American Dennis Hope registered the moon and all the planets in the solar system except for the planet earth under his name .
According to the land registry 's laws , any citizen is allowed register any property under their name , as long as it is not registered under anyone else 's name already , and no one objects to the registration .
Hope took advantage of this loophole and registered the moon under his name .
Daniel Yaron , CEO of Crazyshop , the company which markets moon property in Israel , explained to Ynet why Israelis are interested in purchasing land on the moon : " People decide to buy land on the moon for two reasons :
One is the gimmick of giving a gift – a piece of land on the moon . "
" The other reason , " he continued , " is that now , we see that this is becoming more realistic after NASA 's decision to construct a manned base on the moon by the year 2020 .
Some people think that in a few years from now this property may be more valuable . "
Yaron agrees that " at the moment there is nothing to be done with the plot , " but said that " in the future it may be possible to do something with it , to realize the purchase one way or another .
After all , it is a matter of foresight , 70 years ago if someone had said ' buy land in Israel ' people would have asked " why should we ? " "
Upon purchase , the buyer gets an ownership certificate and a photographed map of the purchased area .
So far some 55.5 million acres of land on the moon have been sold to people all over the world .
For those who are interesting in making a purchase , at the moment the property inventory has been sold out .
The World Bank failed to follow through on its pledges to spend up to $ 500 million to combat malaria , let its staff working on the disease shrink to zero , used false statistical data to claim success and wasted money on ineffective medicines , according to a group of public health experts writing in the British medical journal The Lancet .
The experts , in an article to be published online today , argue that the bank should relinquish the money it has to fight malaria , which kills an African child every 30 seconds , and instead let the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria distribute the bank 's malaria funds .
The World Bank conceded in a written reply to the article that its malaria programs were understaffed and underfinanced , but denied using false statistics or paying for obsolete medicines .
It said that in the past year it had revitalized its malaria program .
Bank officials said in an interview on Monday that the number of staff members working on malaria had grown from none to more than 40 in the past year , while $ 62 million in new spending had recently been approved , an amount expected to rise to $ 190 million by June .
The Global Fund does not have staff on the ground in Africa to monitor how the money is spent , while the World Bank does , bank officials said in their written reply .

George W Bush is not the only leader to inspire global distrust
Anti-Americanism remains extensive , according to the global survey by the Pew Research Center in Washington .
At the same time , the image of China has slipped and confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin has declined sharply , the 47 - nation study indicates .
Though he is popular within Russia , Mr Putin inspires worldwide concern almost on a par with the US leader , it says .
" Global distrust of American leadership is reflected in increasing disapproval of the cornerstones of US foreign policy , " the annual Pew Global Attitudes Survey states .
' Abysmal image '
It says there is worldwide support for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq , as well as " considerable opposition to US and Nato operations in Afghanistan " .
However , it adds , the image of the US has declined in most parts of the world .
This image " remains abysmal " in most Muslim countries , including some US allies , according to the authors .
They say favourable views of the US have sunk to 9 % in Turkey and 15 % in Pakistan .
At the same time , the report contends , " China 's expanding economic and military power is triggering considerable anxiety " .
Favourable views of China have dropped sharply in Spain , Germany and France - to 39 % , 34 % , and 47 % respectively - the survey says .
China 's image is said to be generally positive in Asia , but to have grown more negative in India .
OPPOSITION TO US OPERATIONS IN IRAQ US : 56 % Mexico : 73 % UK : 50 % France : 78 % Poland : 54 % Egypt : 84 % Palestinian territories : 94 % Pakistan : 76 % Indonesia : 84 %
In Japan , unfavourable opinions about China outnumber positive ones by more than two - to - one ( 67 - 29 % ) , the survey suggests .
It also points to negative opinions about Russia and President Putin in many countries .
" Criticism of that nation and its leader are sharpest in Western Europe where many citizens worry about overdependence on the Russian energy supply , " the report states .
" For instance , despite sharp declines in favourable views of the US and Germany since 2002 , Russia 's image in those countries is no better . "
Green worries
Confidence in Mr Putin 's leadership , however , is strong in Russia itself ( 84 % ) .
The survey also finds a general increase in concern about environmental problems .
It says worries have risen sharply in Latin America , Europe , Japan and India .
" Many blame the United States - and to a lesser extent China - for these problems and look to Washington to do something about them , " the report states .
The survey was conducted among more than 45,000 people in 46 countries , plus the Palestinian territories .
The margin of sampling error ranged from two percentage points to four percentage points , depending on the sample size .
How to Make a Schadenfreude Pie
My word , what is this dark and vaguely sinister - looking pie you see before you ?
Well , I ’ll tell you .
It ’s the world ’s first Schadenfreude Pie , the pie to enjoy while you are reveling in the horrible misfortunes of others .
Why is there a Schadenfreude Pie ?
Because after I wrote the headline for this entry , I wondered to myself , “ what would Schadenfreude Pie taste like ? ”
My guess : Dark .
Rich .
And oh so bittersweet .
And you know what ?
That ’s exactly what it tastes like .
Also — and this is really just a perfect but unintentional extension of the whole schadenfreude metaphor — you really only want a small slice ; too much of this pie and it ’ll sit in the pit of your stomach like a rock of judgment , pulling you down .
Small slice ?
Excellent .
Big slice ?
You ’ll regret it .
Just like schadenfreude itself .
Want a slice ?
Sure you do .
Here ’s how you make it .
Let ’s face it , schadenfreude is a dark emotion .
It deserves a dark pie .
Here are your ingredients .
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup dark corn syrup
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup ( 1 stick ) butter
1/2 cup semi- sweet chocolate chips or chunks
3 large eggs ( I used brown eggs in keeping with the spirit of things , but white eggs are fine )
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 splash Kahlua or other coffee liqueur
1 graham cracker pie crust ( 9 or 10 inches ) .
Choose regular or chocolate graham cracker crust according to taste .
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees ( Fahrenheit ) .
Melt butter in largish mixing bowl ; add in corn syrup , molasses , brown sugar and cinnamon .
Mix well .
Melt chocolate ; fold into existing mixture .
Add eggs and Kahlua ; mix vigorously until mix has an even consistency .
Pour into pie crust ( depending on size of crust you may have a little filling mix left over ) .
Shove into oven , center of middle rack , and bake for about 45 minutes .
At 45 minutes , poke pie with butter knife .
If butter knife comes out clean , your pie is done ; otherwise give it about another five minutes .
Once you take the pie out of the oven , let it set at least 20 minutes before you dig in .
It ’s really good when still warm , however .
Serving recommendations : small slices ( this is an awesomely rich pie ) and an ice cold glass of milk to go with it .
Got it ?
Groovy .
And now , pictures of the production of the very first Schadenfreude Pie ever :
Athena mixes the pie filling ingredients while plotting the downfall of all those who oppose her .
Appearing as if the baleful eye of retribution , the pie awaits its cookination !
The darkest of all dark pies , fully cooked .
“ From Hell ’s heart I stab at thee , Schadenfredue Pie ! ”
The unspeakable malevolence of the pie , in single - serving size .
Sure , it ’s a pie freighted down by the petty weaknesses of men , but how does it taste ?
Excellent !
And now , let us have a maniacal laugh of victory , if you please :
Joy at the misfortune of others — and pie !
Truly , the best of all possible worlds .
COLORADO CITY , Arizona ( Reuters ) -
In a dusty neighborhood under sheer sandstone cliffs studded with juniper on the Arizona - Utah border , a rare genetic disorder is spreading through polygamous families on a wave of inbreeding .
A sign marks the town of Hildale , Utah , home to the nation 's largest polygamist community -- the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) , a polygamist sect that broke from the mainstream Mormon church 72 years ago , in this photo taken May 31 , 2007 .

The twin border communities of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona , have the world ’s highest known prevalence of fumarase deficiency , an enzyme irregularity that causes severe mental retardation brought on by cousin marriage , doctors say .
“ Arizona has about half the world ’s population of known fumarase deficiency patients , ” said Dr. Theodore Tarby , a pediatric neurologist who has treated many of the children at Arizona clinics under contracts with the state .
“ It exists in a certain percentage of the broader population but once you get a tendency to inbreed you ’re inbreeding people who have the gene there , so you markedly increase the risk of developing the condition , ” he said .
The community of about 10,000 people , who shun outsiders and are taught to avoid newspapers , television and the Internet , is home to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) , a sect that broke from the mainstream Mormon church 72 years ago over polygamy .
The group , who wear conservative 19th - century clothing , is led by Warren Jeffs , who was arrested in August and charged as an accomplice to rape for using his authority to order a 14 - year - old girl against her wishes to marry and have sex with her 19 - year - old cousin .
Doctors in the area declined requests for interviews and families refuse to talk to reporters .
But former FLDS members , independent doctors and authorities say the disorder appears to have struck at least 20 children in the past 15 years .
“ The disease itself is very rare in the rest of the world , ” said Dr. Vinodh Narayanan of Arizona ’s St. Joseph ’s Hospital & Medical Center and Barrow Neurological Institute .
Doctors worldwide had only studied about 10 cases just a decade ago .
“ Once you get people within in the same community marrying , then the chances grow of having two people carrying the exact same mutation . ”
‘ CLOSED DOOR ’
Local historian Benjamin Bistline said 75 to 80 percent of people in the area are blood relatives of two men -- John Y. Barlow and Joseph Smith Jessop -- who founded the sect on the remote desert plateau in the early 1930s .
“ There are n’t any new people coming in .
It ’s a closed door and that gene just keeps getting passed around , ” said Bruce Wisan , a court - appointed accountant overseeing a trust of the sect ’s assets .
Dr. Leslie Biesecker , chief of the Genetic Disease Research Branch at the National Institutes of Health , said the bad gene could have been introduced after the original founding families settled there .
“ Any person who joined that community could have brought that mutation with them , ” he said .
Tarby , who has recently retired , said he first observed the problem when an FLDS couple came to a Phoenix clinic about 15 years ago with a 10 - year - old boy suffering from a degenerative condition .
He sent a urine sample to a lab in Colorado for analysis and was stunned by the diagnosis .
Since then , increasing numbers of children in the community have been stricken with the disease , which causes unusual facial features , frequent epileptic seizures , episodes of coma and possibly early death .
In the disorder , brain cells fail to receive enough fuel to grow , multiply and function properly because of a missing enzyme needed to generate energy from food , causing severe mental retardation and muscle control problems .
Tarby met with about 150 FLDS members in November , explaining that the disorder was not caused by tainted drinking water as rumored but by cousin marriage .
But even with that knowledge , it is still hard for people to leave the sect , said Brenda Jensen , 55 , who fled the FLDS several years ago and now works for the Utah - based HOPE Organization , which helps women leave .
“ If they are willing to marry their cousin , or unwilling but do it anyway , or even in a relationship that is closer than that , it can be very hard for them , ” Jensen said .
And local habits , are deeply ingrained , authorities say .
“ They will tell you if that ’s what God wants for you than that ’s what you will get , ” said Gary Engels , an investigator assigned to Colorado City by the Mohave County attorney ’s office .
“ They do n’t think too much about marrying cousins and things like that . ”

1,000 PEOPLE SPELL OUT " IMPEACH ! " IN PELOSI 'S DISTRICT by beachimpeach ( reposted )
Sunday Jan 7th , 2007 10:50 AM

Over 1000 people gathered in Nancy Pelosi 's district , on Ocean Beach in San Francisco , to spell out the message " IMPEACH ! "
" America is a great country , " said event organizer Brad Newsham , a local cab driver and author .
" But President Bush has betrayed our faith .
He mislead us into a disastrous war , and is trampling on our Constitution .
He has to go .
Now .
I hope Nancy Pelosi is listening today . "
Keybinding 101 in DrScheme
Ever since I can remember during my days with DrScheme , it has always annoyed me that I could n't comment out a block of code with an easy to use keyboard shortcut .
The default short cut for the comment - out command is either ` ESC ; c:semicolon ' or `m:c:semicolon ' .
Now see here we go , I have to immediately explain this little language for expressing keystrokes , or you wo n't get a thing out of what I 'm trying to convey .
The truth is that I only last week finally put all the pieces together to assign a set of easily accessible keys combinations to both the comment - out and the uncomment commands , which in scheme simply prepends a semicolon at the very first character of a line , and removes it respectively .
These are great tools when you are hacking up a program and you run into a bug , but your not quite sure what section of code is responsible for the bug .
You just comment out pieces of your source in a logical progression until you 've isolated the little pest .
Let me say first how appreciative I am of the help I received on this topic , both from various posts on this topic at plt-scheme@list.cs.brown.edu , and specifically a grand gentlemen who is perpetually involved with helping people who submit posts or bug reports to PLT .
His name is Robby Findler , and you 'll never find a more helpful man to deal with on matters relating to PLT .
And he is kind of heart , not known to me to punish you for posting a bug report that turns out to be your own typographical mistake .
I can vouch for this personally .
Actually , I could say the same things about nearly the entire PLT crew , but it was Robby who specifically helped me out with todays topic .
The first thing you should realize about assigning a new key binding to actuate a certain command is that there are several ways to go about it .
But to make the task much simpler for typical kinds of keymapping , which is what the process is called in DrScheme , the PLT bunch have provided a way directly off the ` Edit ' menu , under the menu item ` Keybindings ' a sub- menu - item entitled ` Add User - defined Keybindings ...'.
Sounds simple enough , and indeed a file open dialog box appears straight away ready to accept your User - defined Keybinding file .
The catch is , it does n't take you to a directory filled with example keybinding files that you could use as a template in making your own file .
The truth is the description of the structure of this file is only been recently better documented in the manuals , and in my opinion , the documentation still leaves the uninitiated pretty much clueless on what sort of file they should be handing to DrScheme as a valid keybindings file .
I intend to show you how that file should be written , and document where you can read more about the topic .
First off you 'll want to read section 3.3.7 Defining Custom Shortcuts , in the PLT : DrScheme Programming Environment Manual .
I 've reproduce it here with permission , for your convenience , since it 's such a short piece .
3.3.7 Defining Custom Shortcuts
The Add User - defined Keybindings ... menu item in the Keybindings sub-menu of Edit selects a file containing Scheme definitions of keybindings .
The file must contain a single module that uses a special keybindings language , ( lib " keybinding -lang.ss " " framework " ) .
For example , a file named mykeys.ss for keybindings might contain the following code :
(
module
mykeys
(
lib
" keybinding -lang.ss "
" framework "
)
...
)
The keybindings language includes all of MzScheme , ( lib " mred.ss " " mred " ) , ( lib " class.ss " ) , and one addition , a keybinding form :
(
keybinding
keybinding - string - expr keybinding - proc-expr
)
The keybinding - string - expr must produce a suitable first argument for map - function in keymap % , and the keybinding - proc - expr must produce a suitable second argument for add - function in keymap % .
Also the require statement
(
require
(
lib
" tool - lib.ss " " drscheme "
) )
adds all of the names defined in the tools manual to your keybindings module , in order to help define drscheme - specific keybindings .
Putting it all together it means our keybinding file should come out looking something like this , for a single instance of key remapping :
(
module
mykeys
(
lib
" keybinding -lang.ss "
" framework "
)
(
require
(
lib
" tool - lib.ss " " drscheme "
) )
(
keybinding
keybinding - string - expr keybinding - proc-expr
)
)
Now all we have to do is come up with two expressions , the keybinding - string - expr and the keybinding - proc - expr .
They 've even provided hot links to the functions whose arguments these two expression become to help us out .
These hot links are live in this post as well , so feel free to check out the documentation available for both functions .
In the case of the first keybinding - string - expr the documentation has become quite thorough .
It describes how you build the string that defines the keystroke sequence that you wish to use to activate your function .
I 'll review this with you in just a moment .
In the case of the second keybinding - proc - expr it is not clear at all what you should be using for a valid function name , nor where one would find them .
As it was explained to me by Robby Findler , the scope of the available functions includes simply everything PLT has to offer , including functions that can be found in PlaneT , and even my own libraries .
That 's good to know , but I remain fuzzy on the precise protocol for calling functions from different sources .
What I intend to do in this post is make available to you a method of determining the vast majority of editor functions available in standard DrScheme .
If you have a desire to make a hot key for your favorite PlaneT package function I would refer you to the good people on the PLT mailing list , who should be able to come up with an answer for a specific question on mapping a specific function .
Now to get back to how you go about defining the keystrokes for your new keybinding - string - expr .
The first thing to know is the terminating character , of a possibly chorded key combination , can have more than one keybinding .
The rules for precedence over which keybinding actually gets invoked are pretty simple , but very specific .
Generally speaking , the more modifier keys used in a key combination , the higher its precedence .
In the event that two key combinations enumerate the same number of modifiers , the string that prohibits the use of the most modifier keys while typing the other required keys in the sequence , has the higher precedence .
I 'll have more to say about this later when we get to some specific examples .
The actual string that makes up the keybinding - string - expr is formated as a semicolon delimited sequence of state strings .
Each of these state strings indicates the presence of a either a modifier key being pressed or not pressed , or a the state of a mouse button , a double or triple click , function keys , numeric keypad keys or a regular character key .
Certain characters are special .
The colon indicates that the previous character in the string is to be interpreted as a modifier key .
And the semicolon delimits sequences of states , such that you can represent first one key being pressed and then subsequently another key being pressed .
Since they are special , and since states like the status of a mouse button do not have standard character representations , PLT has come up with a long list of special names that you can use to represent these states .
For a complete list see the documentation for the map - function .
I 'll just give you enough to get you started .
The colon key is represented as the string " colon " and the semicolon character is represented by the string " semicolon " , not surprisingly .
Another special character is tilde ` ~ ' key .
When it is prefixed to a modifier key , it reverses the meaning , such that it only matches states in which the modifier key is not pressed .
Since the modifier keys are so commonly used , I 've reproduced their representative strings below for you convenience .
`` s : '' --
All platforms : Shift
'' --
All platforms : Shift `` c : '' --
All platforms : Control
'' --
All platforms : Control `` a : '' -- Mac OS X : Option
'' -- Mac OS X : Option `` m : '' -- Windows : Alt ; X : Meta
'' -- Windows : Alt ; X : Meta `` d : '' -- Mac OS X : Command
'' -- Mac OS X : Command `` ? : '' --
All platforms : allow match to character produced by opposite use of Shift and / or AltGr / Option , when available ; see get - other - shift - key - code in key - event %
The modifier identifiers are :
By the way , that last modifier matching string " ? : " , produces two other precedence classes of state strings , both of which rank below everything else .
The higher of the two precedence classes takes effect when you simply use the " ? : " match sequence on either the Shift or the AltGr( Windows ) / Option ( Mac ) keys , and the lowest takes effect when you use it on both .
But remember , you 'll likely be trying to achieve the highest precedence you can so that you 'll be certain to override any other keybinding that may be in effect for your chosen hot key , so it 's not likely that you 'll be worrying about these types of match sequences very often .
I think about now is a good time to review some examples taken shamelessly from the manual .
Examples :
" space " -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed , regardless of the state of modifiers keys .
-- matches whenever the space bar is pressed , regardless of the state of modifiers keys .
" ~ c:space " -- matches whenever the space bar is pressed and the Control key is not pressed .
-- matches whenever the space bar is pressed and the Control key is not pressed .
" a " -- matches whenever ``a ' ' is typed , regardless of the state of modifiers keys ( other than Shift ) .
-- matches whenever ``a ' ' is typed , regardless of the state of modifiers keys ( other than Shift ) . " : a " -- matches only when ``a ' ' is typed with no modifier keys pressed .
-- matches only when ``a ' ' is typed with no modifier keys pressed .
" ~c:a " -- matches whenever ``a ' ' is typed and neither the Shift key nor the Control key is pressed .
-- matches whenever ``a ' ' is typed and neither the Shift key nor the Control key is pressed .
" : esc ; :c:c " -- matches an Escape key press ( no modifiers ) followed by a Control - C press ( no modifiers other than Control ) .
-- matches an Escape key press ( no modifiers ) followed by a Control - C press ( no modifiers other than Control ) . " ?:d :+ " -- matches when Command is pressed with the key that produces `` +'' , even if producing `` +'' normally requires pressing Shift .
There are two examples here that I think are worthy of mention beyond what is explained in the manual .
The first is the " : a " sequence .
You 'll notice it has a leading colon , but no preceding character for the colon to interpret as a modifier key .
This has a very desirable effect , in that is it matches only if no modifier keys are pressed .
You 'll remember that the precedence goes up with the number of modifiers that cannot be pressed for a state string to match , all else being equal .
Well this is the best way to insure that your hot key to whatever key you 've chosen ; lets make it a bit more realistic and map it to a function key like this " : f11 " , will have the highest precedence possible for an un-chorded press of F11 .
The state string " : f11 " matches only if no modifier keys are pressed and the f11 function key is pressed by itself , and since it is preceded by a colon , it trumps any other keybinding to f11 without a modifier key , except for any other keybindings that are identical , in which case , unfortunately , the winner is selected arbitrarily .
The other example worthy of further mention is the " :esc ; : c : c " sequence .
Note it to starts off with a colon as well , so the Esc key must be pressed by itself .
Then there is that semicolon .
This translates to , and now you release the previous state string , and press the sequence corresponding to the following state string .
In this case the following sequence again starts off with a colon ( you can tell somebody was after the highest possible precedence they could get ) , so the following `c : ' represents the control key , which must be typed in the absence of any other modifiers due to the previous colon .
Finally , we get to the actual character key , which is the letter `c ' .
To match this sequence you have to type the Esc key by itself , release it , and then type control - c , with no other modifier keys pressed .
Not the most convenient shortcut , but it shows off the versatility of what you can do with the proper encoding .
I encourage you to read the entire section on the map - function .
It is very well written , and it supplies you with the names for any possible key and / or mouse combination you could possibly want .
With all that we 've learned now , you can finally decode those annoying hot keys for commenting out code that I was complaining about at the outset of this post .
They are ` ESC ; c:semicolon ' and `m:c:semicolon ' respectively .
Well that first one sure looks familiar .
It requires that you press the Esc key , with any set of modifiers you 'd like to throw in , then release the Esc key , and finally press control - semicolon .
Not what I 'd call exactly convenient .
Then it gets worse with the next sequence .
At the time I first started using DrScheme I did n't own a * nix box , or a Mac .
And the first of the two required modifier keys in this sequence is the meta key , which has no equivalent on an XP box .
So even had I wanted to learn these unwieldy chorded keystrokes , I was n't going to be able to use that hot key sequence at all .
I know now that I could have used the Alt key for the meta key , but at the time I was clueless .
Now I own a Mac Pro and DrScheme gives you the option of using your option key as the meta key .
However , the option key is my gateway into quick access to a variety of special characters , that I would other wise have to pull up the special - character tool to insert into a document .
No , what I wanted was a very quick key combination , so that I 'd actually get some use out of these shortcuts .
The official document within the Help Desk where you can find the default global keybindings for an editor is keymap : setup - global in frameworks functions .
However , this does n't nearly cover all the keybindings you 'll see when you look at your Active Keybindings .
To get the entire list , minus the menu shortcuts , you have to employ the use of several functions , each of which adds its own particular set of bindings to the keymap .
As far as I know , this information is not provided in any one location within a particular manual .
So , here you get the product of my research into reconstructing the better part of the Active Keybindings in a default DrScheme system .
( let ( [ keymap ( new keymap : aug - keymap % ) ] [ drscheme : keymap ( drscheme:rep:get- drs-bindings-keymap ) ] ) ( scheme : setup - keymap keymap ) ( keymap : setup - global keymap ) ( keymap : setup - search keymap ) ( keymap : setup - file keymap ) ( keymap : set - chained - keymaps keymap ( list drscheme : keymap ) ) ( let* ( [ table ( send keymap get - map - function - table ) ] [ bindings ( hash - table - map table list ) ] [ sym - first - list ( sort bindings ( lambda ( x y ) ( string < =? ( cadr x ) ( cadr y ) ) ) ) ] )
There are in fact commands available for all the menu functions , but to get the correct function name to call to actuate them takes some direct help from someone in the PLT group to help you , or a lot of searching through source code .
As far as I know , there is no place in the manuals that gives any more information than what I 've provided you .
And as you can see , it 's scattered about in different function calls that simply take a lot of time to research .
Now many of these functions are displayed in the Active Keybindings dialog box , however , there is no way to copy them off the dialog box , so that you can make your own list and design a strategy for your custom keymapping .
Hopefully , the tables below will fill this gap , and you 'll be able to get to the majority of the generic editor functions provided by a basic DrScheme editor frame in Scheme mode .
One very hospitable thing the PLT crew have done with the global keybindings is make it quite simple for you to override them .
If you go down the list , there is only one state string that begins with a colon , and that is for the mouse - popup - menu , bound to " :rightbuttonseq " .
That means , if you would rather use a keybinding for something else , or swap a couple around , you can easily do this by simply placing a colon at the beginning of your own custom keybinding , which will automatically give it higher precedence , as we discussed above .

The following tables are meant to help you in making decisions about what shortcuts you might want to create .
I 've arranged them first by platform specificity and followed up with tables of easy sequences to type and then the akward sequences , either because they take your hand off the home row , or they involve more than one modifier key and finally those that involve a sequence of keystrokes .
You 'll find that some sequences will inevitably be in more than one table , as they qualify under several catagories .
If your like me you 'll find it ineresting what choices were made to accomadate such a diverse audience as are the consumers of PLT software .
Unicode Character - Control - Unit Separator :
its control effect is to make following text underlined .
" \u001f " undo

Mac Specific Shortcuts :
using the `option ' key modifier -
from my experience on a Mac Pro running OS X Server v10.4.9 , thankfully the a : c , a : v , a:x and a:z shortcuts are n't active , and the option key 's function to provide an extended character set to your keyboard takes precedence .
It is interesting to note the sequences involving both the meta and option key ; as far as I know these are impossible combinations on any keyboard of which I 'm familiar .
Also , there seems to be an effort to capture all possible bindings of the return key , perhaps to prevent anyone from binding any modifier enhanced sequence to the return key .

You should be aware that these tables were built from the output as produced on a Mac Pro ; it is entirely possible that they would give somewhat different output depending on the platform you have DrScheme installed on .
Use these tables as a guide , and when you want to make a binding change , double check your own Active Keybinding dialog to make certain that the keys your are binding to are either free or the ones you had decided to override .
Finally , the Active Keybinding dialog will show many bindings to menu shortcuts , but the name that is used to describe it is clearly not a valid Scheme identifier , rather it is a description of the menu item 's function .
If you really want to bind to one of these functions , you 'll need the assistance of someone from the PLT team .
I had hoped to be able to programatically provide a list of these functions for you , but the code that manipulates these bindings is inside a private function within the code that defines one of the frameworks most basic interface , and there was no clear way for me to access it without hacking into DrScheme .
Now to wrap it all up , I 've put an abridged version of my own keybinding module below .
However , the two different forms in which you will likely be calling your target functions .
The first form is when you simply write your own lambda function of two arguments , an editor < %> object and an event <%> object .
You 'll likely have little use for the event <%> object , as you know what triggered the call to your function , however , if you had need of the exact time that the event had taken place , you can query the event to get that information .
The editor <%> object , on the other hand , is your only link to DrScheme .
You can call any public method on the editor you so desire .
I 've given some simple examples of inserting a string - snip < %> object .
But , truely , your imagination is the only limit on what you can do with your custom keybinding and a live editor at your command .
The second form is the method you need to use to execute any of the named functions from the editor 's keymap .
You send the editor 's keymap the call - function method with the name of the function as a string argument .
These are the functions listed in the tables .
I encourage you to read the documentation regarding the editor < %> class .
You 're bound to come up with some inovative ways of doing things you never dreamed of before .
As always , it 's been a pleasure bringing you this article .
I hope you have learned something new .
Either way , please leave a comment about your impression of the topic , how it was covered , how it could be improved or anything else you have on your mind .

Recently I became immortal .
It started a few months ago when I was doing some research on the Internet .
And by research , I mean I clicked on a link that led me to another , then another , until I was reading something written by a stranger with no credibility .
That ’s how I learn .
Anyway , the stranger with no credibility was writing about some research done by another stranger with no credibility who was giving some chemicals to mice and dogs who themselves have no credibility .
The chemical was resveratrol , an ingredient found in red wine .
Apparently you do n’t get enough of it by being a wino .
You have to get it in concentrated form .
I forget the details , but I think the first mouse that got the concentrated resveratrol lived 30 % longer and started having an affair with Maria Shriver .
One of the dogs with resveratrol got a bone and dug a hole so far into the earth he now lives with a family in Sumatra .
And he ’s so strong he can lick any balls he wants .
No one dares stop him .
The reporter with no credibility asked the researcher who has no credibility if humans should take resveratrol .
He said no .
He was n’t worried that it would cause harm , but there are no studies showing it would work in humans , and there was some doubt about delivering the chemical in pill form before it broke down and became ineffective .
Then the reporter with no credibility asked the researcher with no credibility if he takes it himself .
He said yes .
About thirty seconds later I found a web site that sells that shit and bought several pallets of it .
I bought a brand called Longevinex because some other sources with no credibility said they might have solved the problem of keeping it from breaking down in pill form .
I ’ve been taking the resveratrol for a few months .
I do n’t know if it ’s working , but I got rid of my car .
Now I go places by taking huge hops .
And when people ask me questions I can’t answer , I kill them by squeezing their heads .
Most important , I ’ll add about thirty years to my life .
Thirty years should bring me to the point where medical science can cure just about anything .
If my arm falls off , I ’ll inject some stem cells into the stump and grow a new one before dinner .
By then , there will be a lot of old people like me who refuse to die .
They will also refuse to work .
The immortal slackers will want to collect their pensions and Social Security until the sun turns into a cold dark thing about the size of a penny .
No one foresaw immortality .
Pension funds and Social Security are calculated on the hope that you will live an unhealthy lifestyle and take a dirt nap at 76 .
There simply wo n’t be enough money for all of the immortals .
So whose job will it be to kill all the senior citizens ?
Someone has to do it .
You can bet that the people with jobs wo n’t want to hand over their paychecks to the lazy - ass immortals that do nothing but hop around town and talk about the squirrels on their lawn .
That ’s why you should buy stock in life insurance companies .
Those bastards will save a ton of money by never paying a claim .
You can bet they ’ll work some exclusion language into the policy that says something like “ Does not include immortals that hop around town talking about squirrels until some guy working in a cubicle decides to take matters into his own hands . ”
By the way , I remind you not to get your medical or financial advice from cartoonists .

Sure , you remember their stories .
You might even be able to remember their names .
But here 's the real question : it 's 7 am , do you know where these kids are right now ?
That Kid : Who Got Stuck Down a Well
The Story : Back in 1987 , an 18 - month old " Baby Jessica "  McClure captured the nation 's attention when she tumbled into an old well in her aunt 's backyard .
Emergency workers piped fresh air and heat into the well , and expert miners spent 58 straight hours digging a parallel shaft 22 feet into the ground to rescue her .
While healthy at the moment , The Today Show reported that Jessica has undergone 15 surgeries and 9 blood transfusions since reemerging .
The Post - Puberty Report : Adult Jessica seems to be , pardon the phrase , well - adjusted .
Now 21 , she 's married , has a child , and according to all reports , remains thoroughly down - to - earth .
In fact , she 's refused to get plastic surgery to cover up her scars because it reminds her to be thankful for her life .
Of course , she 'll probably be even more thankful for her life in 4 years .
That 's when a trust fund , set up in her name with public donations , should kick a few million dollars her way .
That Kid : Who Was Too Old to Play Little League
The Story : Back in 2001 , Danny Almonte did n't just pitch his Bronx , NY team to a third - place finish in the Little League World Series ; the 12 - year old phenom also pitched a perfect game along the way .
Of course , there was just one problem : turns out little Danny was n't so little .
After a rival Staten Island team hired a private investigator to look into the case , Sports Illustrated followed - up with their own investigation .
Unbeknownst to Danny , his father had falsified his birth certificate by two years to hand his son an arm up on the competition .
The Post - Puberty Report : Well , to be accurate , the story actually started post - puberty .
That said , while the team was stripped of their Little League title , all the players including Danny Almonte were cleared of any wrong - doing ( since he did n't know his own age at the time ) .
As for where Danny is today : after helping his high school team win 2 public school athletic league championships ( and garnering MVP honors ) , ESPN is reporting that he's now pitching professionally , throwing " 90s plus fast - balls "  for the Southern Illinois Miners .
PLUS : We catch up with rock ' n ' roll 's favorite baby , a 13 - year old cover model and the kid who outspelled Dan Quayle after the break .
That Kid : from Nirvana 's Nevermind album
The Story : According to CommonGate , when Nirvana initially brainstormed on CD artwork , they started by looking at stock photography of babies swimming .
But when the costs proved too stiff for their slim wallets , the band hired a photographer who in turn paid a friend 's couple $ 200 to use their 4 - month old baby in the shoot .
Supposedly Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love were so pleased with the pic , they vowed to take the kid out to dinner when he grew up as thanks for his contribution to the album .
As for the hook and dollar also featured in the pic ?
Those were actually Photoshopped into the scene later .
The Post - Puberty Report : Now 16 , Spencer Elden has been featured in various Nirvana documentaries and magazine features .
He claims to be a big fan of the band , and proud of his child labor for the album .
And while there 's no word on whether Courtney Love has followed up on her promise to feed the kid , Nirvana 's is n't the only album on which he 's been featured .
Elden also appears on the cover of Skinny Puppy founder cEvin Key 's 2003 album The Dragon Experience .
That Kid : Who Spelled Potato Right ( until the VP corrected him )
The Story : In 1992 , Vice President Dan Quayle made a pit stop in Trenton , NJ , where he acted as judge in a 6th grade spelling bee .
Unfortunately for Quayle , the cards he'd been handed had n't been spell - checked .
So when William Figueroa , who'd been bused in for the event , spelled out his word correctly , Quayle told him " You 're close , but you left a little something off .
The e on the end . " 
The press immediately picked up the story , Figueroa appeared on Letterman and Quayle 's reputation as a mental midget was solidified in the public 's mind .
The Post - Puberty Report : Not good , from what we 've read .
In 2004 , a New York Times reporter met up with Figueroa , who 'd since dropped out of high school , had his first child by 16 , two more by age 24 , and was reportedly working a low paying job .
That Kid : from the National Geographic
The Story : While visiting a Pashtun refugee camp in Pakistan , photographer Steve McCurry snapped a pic of a 13 - year old orphan with hauntingly beautiful eyes .
The image made the cover of a 1984 National Geographic , and the girl became an international celebrity .
Well , sort of .
Despite securing a great shot , McCurry never took down the girl 's name , and despite taking more than 10 trips back to the region to locate her , it would be another 17 years before she was tracked down .
The Post - Puberty Report : Now a wife and mother of three , Sharbat Gula lives in a remote village in Afghanistan .
She lives in purdah , and while only female reporters were allowed to visit and photograph her for National Geographic 's long awaited follow - up , supposedly she 's now " being looked after "  by the magazine .
Of course , as the BBC reports , the most amazing part is that she hates the iconic photo .
She never liked the red scarf she was photographed in , she does n't like media attention , and has since moved to avoid future interviews .
Plus , a few more tykes you might 've forgotten about :
Louise Brown , the world 's first test tube baby , has had her own baby .
Elian Gonzales is now a Cuban celeb , has a lot of pets , gets front row seats to Castro speeches , and apparently helped land his father a plush gig in Cuba 's national assembly .
And Heather DeLoach , who tapped danced her way into MTV viewers ' hearts as a tap - dancing bee in Blind Melon 's " No Rain "  video , has since landed several acting jobs , including 2 episodes of ER .
Special thanks to Kara Kovalchik for all her research work on this piece .
The Many Uses of Testosterone
You are probably quite familiar with the term " testosterone " .
This male hormone is responsible for everything that is masculine , including the growth of facial and body hair , pubescent development , and even reproduction .
However , in some cases , the body benefits from more testosterone than it can produce .
In this case , people buy various forms of testosterone for sale to help them achieve specific results .
How Synthetic Testosterone Came to Be
Synthetic versions of testosterone have a long and interesting history .
After more than 100 years of research and development , including numerous experiments with animals and a few failed human transplantations , two companies – Schering and Ciba – made synthetic testosterone available for human use .
Even today , these products play an important role in the lives of many men , from reversing the symptoms of conditions like low - T , to improving athletic performance , and even enhancing fertility .
You can still buy testosterone for all of these reasons .
Four Versions
There are four different primary versions of synthetic testosterone for sale today .
These are :
Testosterone propionate –
This version has a short half - life so users enjoy the benefits immediately .
It is the most popular among athletes for performance enhancement .

Testosterone cypionate – Testosterone cypionate offers a longer half - life and milder effects , so it is popular among those who use synthetic hormones as hormone replacement therapy .
Athletes also use it for muscle growth without harsh side effects .

Testosterone undecanoate – Testosterone undecanoate is an oral form of the synthetic hormone .
It is most common in hormone replacement therapy , and it is the least popular form among athletes .
Testosterone undecanoate is an oral form of the synthetic hormone .
It is most common in hormone replacement therapy , and it is the least popular form among athletes .
Testosterone enanthate – Testosterone enanthate has a long half - life and is almost identical to testosterone propionate .
Hormone Replacement Therapy for Low - T
Medical professionals and researchers estimate that some 70 % of men over the age of 40 deal with low - T , or low testosterone , a condition in which a lack of natural testosterone causes a variety of symptoms .
These include fatigue , testicular atrophy , bloating , weight gain , loss of libido , erectile dysfunction , and reproductive or fertility issues .
Fortunately , synthetic testosterone provides the missing hormones and helps men overcome these symptoms .
Their doctors prescribe testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate at a high starting dose , then taper it down to a daily maintenance dose .
Maintaining Testosterone Levels in Athletes
Athletes who choose anabolic steroids as performance enhancers also have lower - than - average testosterone levels .
This is because anabolic steroids bind to the same protein receptors as testosterone , thereby causing the body to stop production of the hormone .
However , those anabolic steroids do not have the same physical benefits .
Athletes buy testosterone to use during their cycles with anabolic steroids to prevent all of the symptoms of low - T described above , including fatigue , loss of libido , and testicular atrophy .
Boosting Energy , Stamina , and Muscle Growth
Finally , many athletes choose to buy testosterone and use it at the core of their steroid cycles .
With safe , responsible use along with a balanced diet and workout program , these compounds can help athletes pack on muscle mass .
Two proteins , globulin and albumin , bind with the testosterone in the bloodstream and carry it directly to the muscle fibers that tear during workouts .
Since testosterone is an important building block in muscles , it binds to those fibers to repair them , making them bigger and stronger at the same time .
That makes testosterone for sale an important part of performance enhancement for many athletes .
Although too much of a good thing can quickly become a bad thing , using testosterone responsibly can provide outstanding benefits whether you have a medical need , you want to maintain your natural testosterone levels , or you want to improve the rate of muscle growth .
You can find testosterone for sale in various forms with different half - lives and benefits , too .
What are steroids is a question that is sure to come across many people minds when they hear about it in the news .
Generally , people know steroids as a substance that can just make you have big muscles and give you lots of acne .
It is not so simple .
First of all , it does not automatically give you massive muscle if you just take it once a day .
Secondly , the side effects do not just stop at the acne level , it has so much more side effects and some are so dangerous that it can even kill .
Steroids , which are also known as a performance enhancing drugs , are hormones .
They are made from testosterone and they are synthetically made in labs .
Steroids are stimulates the production of testosterone .
With higher levels of testosterone in the body , the higher the nitrogen retention will be .
Nitrogen retention is very important in promoting muscle growth .
Anabolic steroids stimulate the biological process of creating new protein in the cells ; this will lead to muscle growth and strength .
There are a couple of methods in using steroids .
They are available in oral and inject able form .
Many people think that it is safer to take oral steroids but it is not .
This is because the liver will have to filter the toxin if taken orally .
The best method to use steroids is to use inject able form where it gets straight into your blood stream .
Steroids are usually taken in cycles .
You ca n’t just take steroids everyday and expect great results all the time .
The cycles usually last from 8 to 12 weeks .
The first few weeks you will be taking the juice then the remaining weeks is lay off time .
This will prevent the body from getting used to the substance .
Positive Effects
Basically , when a person undergoes a cycle of the juice , they will experience fast muscle growth , fast gain in strength , fast recovery from intense workouts , relieve in joint pains , decrease in body fat in a very fast rate and also increase in stamina .
These effects of course depend on the type of steroids being used .
Negative Side Effects
Taking steroids can have many side effects including toxicities of the liver , high cholesterol levels , development of breast in males , acne , increase in aggressiveness and high blood pressure to name a few .

What Kind of Testosterone Side Effects Should You Expect ?
Testosterone occurs naturally in the male and female bodies .
Whether due to low levels of the natural hormone or for performance enhancement , people often utilize synthetic testosterone for the numerous benefits it provides .
Like most other supplements , there are some testosterone side effects to watch for .
As long as you use it responsibly and at the right dose , you can reap the benefits without worrying about serious side effects .
The Unavoidable Process of Aromatization
Although you can avoid many of the Testosterone side effects by using it responsibly , aromatization occurs if you do not prevent it .
The term " aromatization " describes the natural process by which the body converts testosterone into estrogen .
Estrogen , commonly known as the female hormone , occurs naturally in the male body in very small amounts .
Too much estrogen results in side effects like hair loss , fatigue , irritability , acne , and gynecomastia .
The good news is that you can prevent aromatization completely with a class of medicines known as aromatase inhibitors .
Arimidex and Clomid are two of the most popular , and they can completely block estrogen conversion .
Mild Side Effects
Many people do experience some of the milder testosterone side effects , but the good news is that they are usually mild and disappear on their own over time .
Some of them include things like :
High HDL and low LDL cholesterol ( which may revert to normal over time )
High blood pressure
Anxiety
Mood changes
Water retention and bloating
If these side effects become bothersome or if they concern you , you can adjust your testosterone dosage as needed until the benefits outweigh the side effects .
Otherwise , if you have significant concerns , please ask your doctor .
Allergic Reaction and Anaphylaxis
Although it is very rare since testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone , there is a possibility that some people can be allergic to the ingredients in synthetic testosterone .
Signs of a mild allergy include a rash or redness at the injection site , itching , hives , and gastrointestinal discomfort .
Very few people may experience anaphylaxis , which is a very acute and sometimes fatal allergic reaction .
Symptoms include a sudden drop in blood pressure , difficulty breathing , and swelling of the lips , throat , and / or tongue .
Seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop .
Reducing the Risks
Up to this point , it may seem like many of the testosterone side effects are quite serious and frightening .
The good news is that you can mitigate almost all of them by using it responsibly .
First , be certain that you know which type of the product you purchase , as different formulations have much different dosages .
Make sure to use aromatase inhibitors , and never take more than recommended or extend your cycles beyond 16 weeks at a time with equal breaks in between .
Testosterone side effects range from mild to moderate to serious .
Fortunately , as long as you use it as directed and keep a close eye on your body 's cues , it is possible to reap the hormone - balancing , muscle - building benefits without worrying about your health .

Actors Edward Norton and Juliette Lewis and ex-Beach Boy Brian Wilson also took part in the poll , marking the magazine 's 100th issue .
Uncut editor Allan Jones said : " This list has been a massive undertaking and considering which films have had a greater cultural impact than Bowie , for example , has fuelled many discussions .
" What we have been left with is Dylan as the most seminal artistic statement of the last five decades - but I 'm sure others will disagree . "
“ YOU and everyone you know probably despise Hillary Clinton .
There 's almost nothing about her that appeals to you .
You think she stayed in her marriage because she was hungry for unelected power , and that disgusts you . ”
And so on .
The quote is from “ Can She Be Stopped ? ” , a polemic by John Podhoretz , a conservative columnist .
It says something about the polarisation of American life that an author can assume not only that his readers hate Hillary ( a fair bet , given the book 's title and scary cover photo ) but also that they do n't know anyone who does n't .
Mrs Clinton would doubtless dismiss Mr Podhoretz as part of the Vast Right - Wing Conspiracy .
But he is not alone in disliking her .
Polls suggest that between 40 % and 50 % of Americans have an unfavourable view of the junior senator from New York .
They are a vast obstacle to Mrs Clinton 's presidential ambitions .
Why do people detest her ?
Let Lexington count the ways .
First , and most obviously , conservatives cannot stand her .
They see her , as Bay Buchanan ( Pat 's sister ) put it in another recent Hillary - bashing book , as an “ ardent feminist , anti-war activist and student radical ” who “ did not leave her passion for all things liberal behind on the campuses of Wellesley and Yale ” .
The Hillary of conservative demonology is practically a socialist .
( Well , she did try to put the government in charge of health care . )
She is anti-family .
( She once wrote an essay about children 's rights which few have read but many believe argues that children should be allowed to sue their parents .
It does not . )
She is a standard - bearer for the counter - culture of the 1960s .
( As a student , she gave a speech endorsing “ freedom from the burden of an inauthentic reality ” and “ more immediate , ecstatic and penetrating modes of living ” . )
And she thinks abortion should be legal .
Second , and more surprisingly , many on the left loathe her too .
The anti-war crowd resents her for voting to allow the use of force in Iraq .
Plenty of other Democrats voted the same way .
But Barack Obama did not and John Edwards , who did , has apologised .
Mrs Clinton refuses to .
This infuriates the likes of Code Pink , an anti-war group whose members pursue her with chants of “ It takes one bomb to raze a village ” and “ You were first lady and now you 're least /
Get the US out of the Middle East . ”
Many ardent feminists also abhor Mrs Clinton .
In These Times , a left - wing magazine , published an essay in April entitled “ Why Women Hate Hillary ” , arguing that in her determination to appear as ruthless and macho as her male rivals , she has betrayed the women 's movement .
The Nation , another lefty periodical , recently ran a cover story arguing that while many women approve of Mrs Clinton , a lot of feminists think she is “ a ventriloquist for the patriarchy ” , in the words of Jane Fonda , an actress .
The anti-Hillary jibes of left and right can not all be true .
For all her talents , Mrs Clinton cannot be a warmonger and a peacenik , or a radical feminist and a shill for the patriarchy .
Perhaps if extremists of both left and right detest her , she must in fact be a nice , reasonable moderate .
There is something to this .
Since the debacle of Hillarycare , and especially since she joined the Senate in 2001 , she has eschewed radicalism in favour of cautious , incremental steps to improve health care , the environment and national security .
But it is not only her policies that people dislike , nor is it only extremists who dislike her .
For many , it is Mrs Clinton 's personality that grates .
Her supporters say that many men cannot abide an ambitious woman , and that is doubtless true .
But there are also plenty of unbigoted Americans who believe that Mrs Clinton will say or do anything to win power .
She put up with her husband 's constant philandering and branded as liars women she knew were telling the truth about him .
She supports causes many doubt she really cares about ( such as banning flag - burning ) and publicly opposes some she may privately believe in ( such as gay marriage ) .
She can be abrasive : she threatened to “ demonise ” Democratic congressmen who quibbled about her health - care plan .
She can be extraordinarily self - righteous .
Dick Morris , an adviser - turned - foe , claims he once advised her to admit to a personal flaw to make herself seem more human .
He says she could not think of one .
And she has what Carl Bernstein , a somewhat sympathetic biographer , describes as “ a difficult relationship with the truth ” .
Disliked , but still most likely
Yet none of this means her presidential bid is doomed .
Far from it .
Mrs Clinton may not be the most likeable of candidates , but she has enormous strengths .
She has learned from past mistakes , even if she has not admitted them .
She has a prodigious memory , a bottomless capacity for hard work and a quarter - century of experience of national politics .
In debates , her grasp of policy makes her Democratic rivals look callow or shallow .
Her campaign organisation is second to none .
She can borrow credit for the peace and prosperity of the first Clinton era .
And whatever Ms Fonda would prefer , she gets a huge boost from women who want to see one of their own in the White House .
In part because there are more female Democrats than black ones , she leads Mr Obama by double digits in polls of likely primary voters .
Winning the general election will be harder , though .
Americans tell pollsters they would rather elect a Democrat than a Republican , but when asked to choose between Mrs Clinton and the Republican front - runner , Rudy Giuliani , they usually prefer him .
Whereas Mrs Clinton 's Democratic rivals are reluctant to attack her personally — Mr Obama apologised this week for a mild slur from an aide — Republicans will take their gloves off .
But as the publication this month of two exhaustive new biographies showed , there is little fresh dirt to dig up on Mrs Clinton .
And since Americans have already heard the worst , her negative ratings may already have hit a ceiling , which is probably not true of any other candidate .

It has become part of the accepted wisdom to say that the twentieth century was the century of physics and the twenty - first century will be the century of biology .
Two facts about the coming century are agreed on by almost everyone .
Biology is now bigger than physics , as measured by the size of budgets , by the size of the workforce , or by the output of major discoveries ; and biology is likely to remain the biggest part of science through the twenty - first century .
Biology is also more important than physics , as measured by its economic consequences , by its ethical implications , or by its effects on human welfare .
These facts raise an interesting question .
Will the domestication of high technology , which we have seen marching from triumph to triumph with the advent of personal computers and GPS receivers and digital cameras , soon be extended from physical technology to biotechnology ?
I believe that the answer to this question is yes .
Here I am bold enough to make a definite prediction .
I predict that the domestication of biotechnology will dominate our lives during the next fifty years at least as much as the domestication of computers has dominated our lives during the previous fifty years .
I see a close analogy between John von Neumann ’s blinkered vision of computers as large centralized facilities and the public perception of genetic engineering today as an activity of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness corporations such as Monsanto .
The public distrusts Monsanto because Monsanto likes to put genes for poisonous pesticides into food crops , just as we distrusted von Neumann because he liked to use his computer for designing hydrogen bombs secretly at midnight .
It is likely that genetic engineering will remain unpopular and controversial so long as it remains a centralized activity in the hands of large corporations .
I see a bright future for the biotechnology industry when it follows the path of the computer industry , the path that von Neumann failed to foresee , becoming small and domesticated rather than big and centralized .
The first step in this direction was already taken recently , when genetically modified tropical fish with new and brilliant colors appeared in pet stores .
For biotechnology to become domesticated , the next step is to become user - friendly .
I recently spent a happy day at the Philadelphia Flower Show , the biggest indoor flower show in the world , where flower breeders from all over the world show off the results of their efforts .
I have also visited the Reptile Show in San Diego , an equally impressive show displaying the work of another set of breeders .
Philadelphia excels in orchids and roses , San Diego excels in lizards and snakes .
The main problem for a grandparent visiting the reptile show with a grandchild is to get the grandchild out of the building without actually buying a snake .
Every orchid or rose or lizard or snake is the work of a dedicated and skilled breeder .
There are thousands of people , amateurs and professionals , who devote their lives to this business .…

Xming installers make it child 's play to quickly install project components , interactively , with a few mouse clicks .
They also install uninstall , silently , using command line parameters .
Installers are for Windows 10/8/7/Vista (+ Server 2012/2008 ) .
Safety note : make sure you put an installer in an empty directory ( or in one containing only other Project Xming installer files ) before running it to avoid the possibility of a rogue file ' hijack ' .
It is also wise to check the MD5 signatures of installers ( I list a range of better checksums , than md5sum , for the installers in the download directory ) .
Optional extras are the Plink for Xming SSH client Tools and clients and GLX test clients .
At least 20.7 MB of free disk space is required .
The x64 version is specific for 64 - bit Windows x64 .
Note : use 32 - bit Xming on Itanium / ia64 .
Do n't install anywhere other than the default directory unless youknow what you are doing and install using right - click ' Run as administrator ' if necessary .
OpenGL support is now provided by all Xming installers ( Xming used to have separate builds and installers ; with and without Mesa ) .
If you intend to use PuTTY : make sure you pick the correct Plink SSH client for use with Xming - portablePuTTY or original PuTTY i.e. there are two different Plink (s ) in an Xming installer .
The Xming executable has an absolute minimum of fonts ; the so - called built -ins .
X clients usually need extra fonts to supplement these ... This additional installer provides standard core X fonts ( which are usually required ) and optional extended Bitstream Vera replacement fonts from DejaVue .
At least 19.8 MB of free disk space is required ( for the default selection of fonts ) .
Note : one Xming - fonts installer is common for both 32 - bit and 64 - bit Xming .
You should install Xming - fonts in the same directory you installed Xming .
For an x64 ( native 64 - bit ) installation on 64 - bit Windows ( x64 ) this defaults to ... and for a native 32 - bit WoW64 installation on 64 - bit Windows ( x64 or ia 64 ) defaults to ... If you have installed both 32 and 64 - bit Xming , on 64 - bit Windows , you will need Xming - fonts in both the directories above i.e. sub-directory ' fonts ' and contents .
I separated these fonts from Xming installers , above , since they have a high installed footprint , do n't change very often and modern X applications use client - side fonts instead via fontconfig ..
Since these standard X Window fonts tend to be ugly , you could Instead of installing Xming - fonts , to provide core X fonts , you could use an X font server on your network .
This optional installer provides a fully portable replacement for PuTTY .
At least 5.5 MB of free disk space is required .
You shouldinstall portablePuTTY in the same directory you installed Xming : it is completely autonomous .

This does n't contain any X server commands .
You can view all the applicable X server commands for Xming with - help or run this XLaunch file .
These online X. Org Manual pages also give more detail on generic X server and X client options .
Note : not all general options are logical for Windows or honoured by Xming .
Manuals are also available for XLaunch , Xmingrc , portablePuTTY , PuTTY , Xmon , the Run utility and command line use of Xming 's install and uninstall programs .
All Tools and clients also have Xming manuals .
I also have a Recipe for setting up a headless Raspberry Pi and remote controlling it with PuTTY and Xming .
This is an elegant way to use an xserver but XDMCP mode is not very secure .
It is safer to work via X - Forwarding and the SSH protocol , e.g. using PuTTY , on shared networks .
Getting started with PuTTY X - Forwarding is described below and in more detail here
A good tip : get PuTTY working first with Pageant , and use Saved Sessions , before using Xming / Xmingrc / XLaunch .
Those Saved Sessions should only use the SSH - 2 protocol , ' Enable X11 forwarding ' and for the following example set ' X display location ' to ' localhost:0 ' .
To simply start Xming in - multiwindow mode from Command Prompt ( the Windows cmd console )
>" C: \Program Files\Xming \Xming.exe " - multiwindow -clipboard
If you now need a Command Prompt : run it from Xming 's notification area icon menu .
Many useful variables will then be inherited e.g. %CD % and %DISPLAY %
You can not run two X servers with the same display - number ; use the : display - number option if you want multiple instances .
option if you want multiple instances .
On recent Windows versions : in order to easily use Xming 's notification area icon(s ) you should set ' Show icon and notifications ' , for the Xming X server icon .
just type ' firefox ' on a PuTTY terminal connected to a remote machine
or from a Command Prompt use PuTTY 's Plink tool one of two ways ... > plink - ssh - 2 - X < user@remote - host > firefox either , with user@remote - host > plink - load < session - name > firefox or , with a PuTTY Saved Session name .
This gives you a multiwindow / multimonitors X server on display - number 0 ( the default ) , with an integrated Windows window manager .
Note ... You could now run , for example , firefox on a remote machine like this ( Xming will ' serve ' control and display locally ) ... XLaunch makes using Xming with PuTTY 's Plink and generic Windows ssh clients easy ... XLaunch is a wizard for simplifying the startup of an Xming X server .
Its re-usable XML configuration files also act as mini-session managers .

You can configure the X toolbar icon menu ( i.e. the right - click menu on Xming 's notification area icon ) , Windows icons , styles and system menus ( i.e. the right - click menu on a Window 's title bar ) using an Xmingrc file .
Additionally , on the icon menu , a Host Finder is provided for listing , choosing and then accessing any responding XDMCP hosts on your network , as well as a log file viewer .
It is also possible to not hide the root window ( Note : you may lose control of your desktop it you do n't ' Hide Root Window ' ) and disable the ' X11 PRIMARY Selection ' ( the highlighted text copying mechanism with X clients ) .
I use this Xmingrc file to open X Window clients ( singly or combined in session files ) , PuTTY and Command Prompt terminals , and to control access to the X server .
Remote Linux / Unix ( and local Windows ) programs can be run from Xmingrc menu items .
Use of Plink is recommended when starting remote programs .
Xmingrc is a structured text file , so to avoid errors , study the installed default Xmingrc file ( plus my Xmingrc file : see screenshots below ) .
Many X. Org tools and clients have been ported to Microsoft Windows console ( Windows CUI ) applications and built modular using MinGW - w64 ... Use the links in the table above to view Xming manuals for each entry .
Note : xkbcomp is built without a Windows console ( Windows GUI ) , and always installed , as it is used by Xming during X server startup .

Examples , from Command PromptAn example of the interactive X protocol monitor , Xmon , being used on Windows 7 Using PuTTY with Xming is highly recommended as it provides SSH for Windows ( typically used to log into remote Linux / Unix machines and execute commands ) and Plink is especially useful ...
Plink is a command line connection tool , similar to Linux / Unix ssh , that is used for automating secure remote operations from XLaunch and Xmingrc
The Xming Plink SSH client is made with MinGW - w64 from patched PuTTY code .
These modifications substitute Windows prompts for many console ones because XLaunch and Xming are built console free ( GUI ) and so stdout / stderr messages are hidden when Plink is spawned from them .
Use as a replacement for Plink in ' standard ' PuTTY ( i.e. installers or binaries downloaded from Simon Tatham 's website ) .
Note : Xming - portablePuTTY's
Plink incorporates the same changes but is not compatible with ' standard ' PuTTY ( there is a choice of two different Plink (s ) in an Xming installer ) .

When Laurence Olivier stayed in Hollywood at the start of the Second World War , he was accused of lacking patriotism .
Many said the actor should have joined up .
But in reality he was working as a secret agent to persuade influential Americans to support Britain .
A biography reveals that in 1940 he was enlisted into the Special Operations Executive by film producer Alexander Korda .
Michael Munn , author of Lord Larry : A Personal Portrait Of Laurence Olivier , said : " Churchill recruited Alexander Korda to set up offices in America which were a front for the Special Operations Executive and MI5 .
Korda then recruited Olivier . "
He said Noel Coward told him : " It was down to Alexander Korda to tell Larry that Winston Churchill was not asking but telling him that his country expected him to do his duty . "
David Niven told Munn : " If German agents realised , they would have gone after him . "
Olivier returned to Britain in 1941 and joined the Fleet Air Arm , completing 456 flying hours .
AUSTIN , Texas --
Obese girls are half as likely to attend college as non-obese girls , according to a new study from The University of Texas at Austin .
The study also shows obese girls are even less likely to enter college if they attend a high school where obesity is relatively uncommon .
The findings appear in the July issue of the journal Sociology of Education .
The study tracked nearly 11,000 American adolescents , using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health .
" Obesity has been identified as a serious public health issue , but these results indicate the harmful effects extend far beyond physical health , " said Robert Crosnoe , author of the study and a sociologist at the university .
Crosnoe suggests a number of mental health and behavioral issues seem to play a significant role in keeping obese girls from enrolling in college .
The study found obese girls were more likely to consider committing suicide , use alcohol and marijuana and have negative self - images .
The disconnect between obesity and college enrollment was more pronounced among non-whites and among girls whose parents did not graduate from college .
Obese boys did not differ from their non -obese peers in college enrollment .
" That girls are far more vulnerable to the non-health risks of obesity reinforces the notion that body image is more important to girls ' self - concept and that social norms have greater effects on the education of girls than boys , " Crosnoe noted .

Here is an interesting cognitive bias : people feeling in power tend to not consider the perspectives of other people – quite literally .
In Adam D. Galinsky , Joe C. Magee , M. Ena Inesi , and Deborah H Gruenfeld , Power and Perspectives Not Taken , Psychological Science , 17:12 , 1068 - 1074 2006 researchers primed a group of test subjects by asking them to write down a memory where they held power over other people , while another group were asked to write about a time when others had power over them .
Then the subjects were asked to quickly write the letter ‘ E ’ on their forehead .
High - power subjects were about three times as likely as low - power subjects to draw the letter oriented so it would be readable by themselves rather than readable by others .
In follow - up experiments it was found that high - power subjects also tended to assume other people had the same information that they had ( the " telepathic boss " problem – the boss assumes that everybody knows what he knows and want ) .
They were also less accurate than low - power subjects at judging emotional expressions .
There were also anticorrelations between reports of general feelings of being in power in one ’s life and tendency to take other ’s perspective .
Overall high - power people seem to anchor too heavily on their own vantage point and this impairs their ability to consider what others see , think and feel .
People with less power likely have to consider other people ’s intentions and views more strongly , so perhaps the power bias is actually the real baseline and powerless people concentrate more on mind reading .
But given the increase in errors in emotion reading the power mode people had compared to people primed neither with being powerful or powerless , this seems unlikely .
What are the implications of a power bias ?
In general power bias would make the empowered people tend to think they have more support from others in their views than they have .
Altruists in power would be even less concerned with individual variations in goals and values – i.e. they would tend to become more egalitarian and paternalist .
Egoists in power would become more concerned about the ambitions of others , i.e. paranoid .
Is this bias rational ?
When leading other people the cognitive load of taking their perspective might be cumbersome , and the increase in stereotyping that seem to occur in people in the " power mode " might also be a form of attention management .
Imposing one ’s own goals onto others might also make them obey more effectively .
For leading people to perform particular goals this mode might work better .
The downside is that if the task is heavily reliant on individual achievements meshing together or more based on voluntary action a lack of perspective risks missing early signs of trouble and will produce rebellion .
The researchers suggest that power and perspective taking might not have to exclude each other and that responsible leadership might be possible by learning to take both into account .
But they do not cite any actual experiments showing that it works .
Maybe we should just promote people with Asperger syndrome to management in favour of people with intact theory of mind .
That way we will not reduce the total human ability to see things from other perspectives .

As told by James Ross Gardner
My eighteen - year - old daughter , Jenna , was a few yards ahead of me on a trail in Glacier National Park in Montana .
She disappeared around a little hairpin turn in the path and a second later came back murmuring , " Oh , no " and darted past me .
I stepped forward and I saw this animal running at me , mouth wide open .
I remember thinking , Wow , that 's so weird , it 's like a really big badger .
Then its teeth were in my left thigh .
I thought ,
How strange , I 'm actually being bitten by something .
The grizzly 's fangs sank to my femur , and it jerked me all over the trail .
I could n't tuck into a fetal position , so my front side was exposed , and I thought , Man , it 's going to rip my intestines out .
So I dove off the trail , about twenty feet down .
Dense alder bushes broke my fall , and it looked like the bear might ease off .
I yelled , " Jenna , come down here ! "
At the sound of my voice , the grizzly came charging down at me fast -- like you can't imagine how fast , like out - of - this - world fast .
I curled into the fetal position .
The bear 's jaws clamped on my backpack and lifted me up and down .
I tried to scramble out from under it but instead forced us into another tumble thirty feet down the mountain .
The fall really pissed off the grizzly .
It gnawed on my head , and I could feel flesh tearing away .
I grabbed the animal by the throat ; its fur felt like a dirty wet dog , only thicker .
I hit it with a rock , but the rock crumbled , so I wiggled back into the fetal position .
Its teeth cut deep into the bottom of my skull ; I actually heard bone cracking .
I ripped myself loose and plunged another twenty feet down and into a crevice .
The grizzly could n't reach me .
The terrain was too steep .
It turned away , and a few seconds later I heard Jenna scream .
And then I heard absolutely nothing .
I touched the top of my head and felt only bone .
What was left of my scalp hung in front of my face , and I could n't open my right eye .
I called out to Jenna , and she called back from fifty yards away .
Her injuries were n't nearly as severe .
The grizzly had bitten her shoulders and head , split the side of her mouth open , clawed her back , and fled .
She said she 'd seen two cubs with the bear and that it was likely trying to protect its young .
I tried to crawl toward my daughter , but it hurt to move .
Doctors later discovered a total of twenty - eight wounds , including a claw puncture to my right eye .
One of my top vertebrae was broken in five pieces , and I would undergo multiple surgeries , including a skin graft from my back onto my scalped head .
For now , I pushed my eyelid open with a bloody finger , saw Grinnell Lake shining blue in the valley below , and waited for help to arrive .

Contact your Senators and urge them to support a Renewables Portfolio Standard ( RPS )
This week the Senate will consider energy and transportation legislation that offers a historic opportunity to establish national energy policies that boost renewable energy production , increase energy efficiency , improve vehicle fuel economy standards , and curb global warming pollution .
But given that some of the current energy proposals on the table fall short of ensuring consumer and environmental benefits , the Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) and myself are encouraging senators to strengthen the current proposals and fend off attempts to undermine the positive elements in the proposed legislation .
This is our chance to really change the future of America ’s energy usage .
We must not allow big carbon , and car companies to set the energy policy of this country .
National Renewables Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) legislation might come to the floor of the Senate today or tomorrow .
Contact Your Senator Today !
Below is a quick overview of the major issues in play :
FUEL ECONOMY
The Senate is considering a bill that calls for increasing the corporate average fuel economy ( CAFE ) standards for vehicles to 35 miles per gallon ( mpg ) by 2020 .
Analysis shows that reaching a fleetwide 35 mpg fuel economy standard in 2020 is easily achievable with conventional technology and would have multiple benefits for U.S. energy , economic and environmental security .
( For more on the issue , click here . )
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) is expected to offer an amendment that would undermine efforts to improve fuel economy .
If his amendment is based on a recently circulated draft proposal , it would set feeble targets over an extended timeline .
In addition , in lieu of requiring the auto industry to boost fuel economy , it would merely require automakers to make promises to produce a range of vehicle types including flex - fuel vehicles .
Legislators also may try to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating vehicle global warming pollution or granting a waiver to states who have adopted the California vehicle global warming pollution standards .
( For more on Sen . Levin ’s expected amendment , go here . )
The Senate should reject any efforts to :
Â· undermine fuel economy improvements ;
Â· introduce new loopholes allowing automakers to avoid fuel economy requirements ; and
Â· remove regulatory authority to curb vehicle global warming .
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY STANDARD
Sen. Jeff Bingaman ’s ( D - N.M. ) renewable electricity standard bill , which would require utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 , has broad bipartisan support .
The Senate has passed three similar bills over the last five years .
Sen. Pete Domenici ( R - N.M. ) plans to introduce an amendment that would include nuclear energy and technologically advanced coal plants as “ renewable ” sources , undercutting demand for the country ’s untapped and genuinely clean renewable wind , solar , biomass and geothermal energy resources .
We expect that other senators will attempt to lower the standard from 15 percent , despite growing support across the country for state renewable standards .
Twenty - three states and the District of Columbia now have renewable energy standards , and Michigan , North Carolina , Virginia and Missouri are considering establishing their own .
( For more on state renewable standards , go here . )
A national renewable electricity standard should be a base for bolstering the clean energy industry , not an additional subsidy for coal or nuclear power .
Senators should accept the original intent of the program without substantial alteration .
SMART BIOFUELS
While fuel economy is the most effective step the United States can take to reduce national dependence on oil , low and zero - carbon fuel sources for vehicles will be needed over the long term to meet our energy security and global warming pollution reduction goals .
The Senate energy bill contains a provision that would increase the amount of biofuels in the country ’s transportation fuel mix .
The bill contains a minimum standard that ensures that biofuels maintain current level of carbon emissions benefits , however it lacks additional guarantees to ensure new biofuels technologies meet their carbon reduction potential .
Without sufficient safeguards , the bill would leave room for unsustainable production practices that could undermine any environmental benefits from biofuels .
Another possible amendment would allow liquid coal fuel to qualify under the renewable fuel standard , even though liquid coal could produce nearly twice the global warming pollution as diesel or gasoline .
Experts point to California ’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard as an exemplary model for a system that tracks global warming emissions from alternative fuels .
( For more on California ’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard , go here . )
Congress should keep liquid coal out of any biofuels initiative .
Biofuel policy should focus on developing crop and production choices that would produce the largest fuel yield with the smallest impact on the environment .
Senators should support amendments to the biofuels package that would cut global warming emissions and promote sustainable land management practices .
Please contact your Senators and ask them to support a the Bingaman / Reid RPS amendment when the energy bill comes to the Senate floor and to oppose amendments that would weaken the program ’s requirements for clean renewable energy .
National Renewables Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) legislation might come to the floor of the Senate today or tomorrow .

NASA hasbold and visionary plans to send humans to the Moon by 2020 where humans willlearn to live and work on another planetary body in our Solar System .
Sendingpeople to the Moon is n't easy , though , and there is a lot that we still do n' tknow about our closest celestial neighbor .
That makes it tough to plan a humanmission to the Moon because unlike during the Apollo program of the 1960s , thistime we are going to the Moon to stay for a longer period of time .
The goal isto learn to live and work on the Moon and then take all of the " lessonslearned " from this experience so we can then send humans to Mars by 2030 .
Marsis an incredibly fascinating planet but is much further away from the Earthcompared with the Moon , so NASA plans to use the Moon as a " stepping stone " toMars .
Before wecan build a lunar base , though , there are a few important decisions regarding the mission architecture that need to be made .
One of those decisions involvesresource utilization .
Should we use the natural resources that are on the Moonto " live off the land " ?
If so , what are the resources that might be availableon the Moon ?
One idea is that there may be water ice in the permanentlyshadowed regions near the poles of the Moon .
It is VERYcold in these places and ice may be stable there for billions of years .
Thereis tantalizing and somewhat contradictory data regarding the presence of lunarice from the Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions to the Moon as well asdata from the Arecibo radio telescope and numerical modeling efforts .
Watercould potentially be used by the astronauts for drinking and bathing but canalso be broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen which can be used for rocketfuel .
NASA really needs to know if there is lunar water that we might be ableto use - and to help answer that question , NASA is going to slam a rocket intothe Moon !
The LunarCrater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) will purposely impact the Moon near the pole to kick up a huge plume of material .
This will be analyzedfor the presence of water and other water - bearing compounds .
The LCROSSmission will use the spent Earth departure upper stage ( EDUS ) of the launchvehicle and a small shepherding satellite to guide the EDUS to the Moon .
LCROSSwill blast the permanently dark floor of one of the Moon 's polar craters withthe EDUS early in 2009 to test the theory that ancient ice lies buried there .
The EDUS isessentially the size of a large sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) and will impact the Moon at over 5,600 miles per hour !
This event will excavate a new crater onthe Moon the size of 1/3 of a football field and 16 feet deep .
The impact willcause an explosion of material from the crater 's surface to create a plumeabove the lunar surface ( reaching to altitudes of over 30 miles ) with enoughmaterial to fill the space shuttle cargo bay 10 times !
Specializedinstruments aboard the shepherding spacecraft will analyze this plume for thepresence of water ( ice and vapor ) , hydrocarbons and hydrated materials and willrelay this data back to Earth .
Then the shepherding spacecraft will alsoimpact the Moon to create a second plume .
Telescopes all around the world andin space will also be pointed at the LCROSS impacts , each with specialinstruments to monitor the gigantic lunar plumes of material that are ejectedabove the lunar surface .
The impacts will be so big that you will be able toobserve them with reasonable grade amateur telescopes .
Thisexciting mission is being run out of NASA 's Ames Research Center in Californiain cooperation with its spacecraft and integration partner , Northrup - Grumman .
LCROSS represents one of NASA 's first missions in the return to the Moon andwill provide valuable precursor information as we plan to return humans to thelunar surface .
Moreinformation about the LCROSS mission can be found at http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov.

Do you feel like you ’re wasting time learning the ins and outs of all of the browsers and working around their issues ?
Well Chris did , too .
Doing this back then secured his career and ensured that he had a great job .
But we should n’t have to go through this trial by fire any longer .
I ’ve been writing JavaScript code for much longer than I care to remember .
I am very excited about the language ’s recent success ; it ’s good to be a part of that success story .
I ’ve written dozens of articles , book chapters and one full book on the matter , and yet I keep finding new things .
Here are some of the “ aha ! ” moments I ’ve had in the past , which you can try out rather than waiting for them to come to you by chance .
Shortcut Notations
One of the things I love most about JavaScript now is shortcut notations to generate objects and arrays .
So , in the past when we wanted to create an object , we wrote :
var car = new Object ( ) ; car.colour = ' red ' ; car .
wheels = 4 ; car.hubcaps = ' spinning ' ; car.age = 4 ;
The same can be achieved with :
var car = { colour : ' red ' , wheels : 4 , hubcaps : ' spinning ' , age : 4 }
Much shorter , and you do n’t need to repeat the name of the object .
Right now , car is fine , but what happens when you use invalidUserInSession ?
The main gotcha in this notation is IE .
Never ever leave a trailing comma before the closing curly brace or you ’ll be in trouble .
The other handy shortcut notation is for arrays .
The old school way of defining arrays was this :
var moviesThatNeedBetterWriters = new Array ( ' Transformers ' , 'Transformers2 ' , ' Avatar ' , 'Indiana Jones 4 ' ) ;
The shorter version of this is :
var moviesThatNeedBetterWriters = [ ' Transformers ' , 'Transformers2 ' , ' Avatar ' , 'Indiana Jones 4 ' ] ;
The other thing about arrays is that there is no such thing as an associative array .
You will find a lot of code examples that define the above car example like so :
var car = new Array ( ) ; car [ ' colour ' ] = ' red ' ; car [ ' wheels ' ] = 4 ; car [ ' hubcaps ' ] = ' spinning ' ; car [ ' age ' ] = 4 ;
This is not Sparta ; this is madness — do n’t bother with this .
“ Associative arrays ” is a confusing name for objects .
Another very cool shortcut notation is the ternary notation for conditions .
So , instead of the following …
var direction ; if (x < 200 ) { direction = 1 ; } else { direction = - 1 ; }
… You could write a shorter version using the ternary notation :
var direction = x < 200 ? 1 : - 1 ;
The true case of the condition is after the question mark , and the other case follows the colon .
JSON As A Data Format
Before I discovered JSON to store data , I did all kinds of crazy things to put content in a JavaScript - ready format : arrays , strings with control characters to split , and other abominations .
The creation of JSON by Douglas Crockford changed all that .
Using JSON , you can store complex data in a format that is native to JavaScript and does n’t need any extra conversion to be used immediately .
JSON is short for “ JavaScript Object Notation ” and uses both of the shortcuts we covered earlier .
So , if I wanted to describe a band , for example , I could do the following :
var band = { " name " : " The Red Hot Chili Peppers " , " members " : [ { " name " : " Anthony Kiedis " , " role " : " lead vocals " } , { " name " : " Michael ' Flea ' Balzary " , " role " : " bass guitar , trumpet , backing vocals " } , { " name " : " Chad Smith " , " role " : " drums , percussion " } , { " name " : " John Frusciante " , " role " : " Lead Guitar " } ] , " year " : " 2009 " }
You can use JSON directly in JavaScript and , when wrapped in a function call , even as a return format of APIs .
This is called JSON - P and is supported by a lot of APIs out there .
You can use a data endpoint , returning JSON - P directly in a script node :
< div id =" delicious " ></ div >< script > function delicious ( o ) { var out = ' < ul > ' ; for ( var i=0 ; i< o.length ;i++ ) { out += ' < li > < a href= " ' + o[ i ].u + ' " >' + o[ i ].d + '</a></li>' ; } out += '</ul >' ; document.getElementById(' delicious ') .innerHTML
= out ; } </script > < script src= "
http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/json/codepo8/javascript?count=15&callback=delicious "></script>
This calls the Delicious Web service to get my latest JavaScript bookmarks in JSON format and then displays them as an unordered list .
In essence , JSON is probably the most lightweight way of describing complex data — and it runs in a browser .
You can even use it in PHP using the json_decode ( ) function .
Native JavaScript Functions ( Math , Array And String )
One thing that amazed me is how much easier my life got once I read up thoroughly on the math and string functions of JavaScript .
You can use these to avoid a lot of looping and conditions .
For example , when I had the task of finding the largest number in an array of numbers , I used to write a loop , like so :
var numbers = [ 3,342,23,22,124 ] ; var max = 0 ; for ( var i=0 ;i< numbers.length ;i++ ) { if ( numbers [ i ] > max ) { max = numbers [ i ] ; } } alert ( max ) ;
This can be achieved without a loop :
var numbers = [ 3,342,23,22,124 ] ; numbers.sort( function ( a , b) {return b - a} ) ; alert ( numbers [ 0 ] ) ;
Notice that you cannot use sort ( ) on a number array because it sorts lexically .
There ’s a good tutorial on sort ( ) here in case you need to know more .
Another interesting method is Math.max ( ) .
This one returns the largest number from a list of parameters :
Math.max
( 12,123,3,2,433,4 ) ; // returns 433
Because this tests for numbers and returns the largest one , you can use it to test for browser support of certain properties :
var scrollTop= Math.max ( doc.documentElement.scrollTop , doc.body.scrollTop ) ;
This works around an Internet Explorer problem .
You can read out the scrollTop of the current document , but depending on the DOCTYPE of the document , one or the other property is assigned the value .
When you use Math.max ( ) you get the right number because only one of the properties returns one ; the other will be undefined .
You can read more about shortening JavaScript with math functions here .
Other very powerful functions to manipulate strings are split ( ) and join ( ) .
Probably the most powerful example of this is writing a function to attach CSS classes to elements .
The thing is , when you add a class to a DOM element , you want to add it either as the first class or to already existing classes with a space in front of it .
When you remove classes , you also need to remove the spaces ( which was much more important in the past when some browsers failed to apply classes with trailing spaces ) .
So , the original function would be something like :
function addclass ( elm , newclass ) { var c = elm.className ; elm.className = ( c === ’) ?
newclass : c+' '+ newclass ; }
You can automate this using the split ( ) and join ( ) methods :
function addclass ( elm , newclass ) { var classes = elm.className.split(' ') ; classes.push( newclass ) ; elm.className = classes.join ( ' ') ; }
This automatically ensures that classes are space - separated and that yours gets tacked on at the end .
Event Delegation
Events make Web apps work .
I love events , especially custom events , which make your products extensible without your needing to touch the core code .
The main problem ( and actually one of its strengths ) is that events are removed from the HTML — you apply an event listener to a certain element and then it becomes active .
Nothing in the HTML indicates that this is the case though .
Take this abstraction issue ( which is hard for beginners to wrap their heads around ) and the fact that “ browsers ” such as IE6 have all kind of memory problems and too many events applied to them , and you ’ll see that not using too many event handlers in a document is wise .
This is where event delegation comes in .
When an event happens on a certain element and on all the elements above it in the DOM hierarchy , you can simplify your event handling by using a single handler on a parent element , rather than using a lot of handlers .
What do I mean by that ?
Say you want a list of links , and you want to call a function rather than load the links .
The HTML would be :
< h2 > Great Web resources </ h2 > < ul id =" resources " > < li >< a href= " http://opera.com/wsc ">Opera Web Standards Curriculum </a></li > < li >< a href = " http://sitepoint.com "
>
Sitepoint</a></li> < li >< a href = " http://alistapart.com " >A List Apart</a></li> < li >< a href= " http://yuiblog.com " >
YUI Blog</a></li > < li >< a href = " http://blameitonthevoices.com "
>
Blame it on the voices </a></li> < li >< a href = " http://oddlyspecific.com " >
Oddly specific</a></li> </ul >
The normal way to apply event handlers here would be to loop through the links :
// Classic event handling example ( function ( ) { var resources = document.getElementById('resources ' ) ; var links = resources.getElementsByTagName ( 'a' ) ; var all = links .
length ; for ( var i=0 ; i < all ;i++ ) { //
Attach a listener to each link links [ i].addEventListener ( ' click ' , handler , false ) ; } ; function handler(e ) { var x = e.target ; //
Get the link that was clicked alert ( x ) ; e.preventDefault ( ) ; } ; } ) ( ) ;
This could also be done with a single event handler :
( function ( ) { var resources = document.getElementById('resources ' ) ; resources.addEventListener(' click ' , handler , false ) ; function handler(e ) { var x = e.target ; // get the link tha if ( x.nodeName.toLowerCase ( ) === ' a ' ) { alert ( ' Event delegation : ' + x ) ; e.preventDefault ( ) ; } } ; } ) ( ) ;
Because the click happens on all the elements in the list , all you need to do is compare the nodeName to the right element that you want to react to the event .
Disclaimer : while both of the event examples above work in browsers , they fail in IE6 .
For IE6 , you need to apply an event model other than the W3C one , and this is why we use libraries for these tricks .
The benefits of this approach are more than just being able to use a single event handler .
Say , for example , you want to add more links dynamically to this list .
With event delegation , there is no need to change anything ; with simple event handling , you would have to reassign handlers and re-loop the list .
Anonymous Functions And The Module Pattern
One of the most annoying things about JavaScript is that it has no scope for variables .
Any variable , function , array or object you define that is not inside another function is global , which means that other scripts on the same page can access — and will usually override — them .
The workaround is to encapsulate your variables in an anonymous function and call that function immediately after you define it .
For example , the following definition would result in three global variables and two global functions :
var name = ' Chris ' ; var age = ' 34 ' ; var status = ' single ' ; function createMember ( ) { // [...] } function getMemberDetails ( ) { // [...] }
Any other script on the page that has a variable named status could cause trouble .
If we wrap all of this in a name such as myApplication , then we work around that issue :
var myApplication = function ( ) { var name = ' Chris ' ; var age = ' 34 ' ; var status = ' single ' ; function createMember ( ) { // [...] } function getMemberDetails ( ) { // [...] } }( ) ;
This , however , does n’t do anything outside of that function .
If this is what you need , then great .
You may as well discard the name then :
( function ( ) { var name = ' Chris ' ; var age = ' 34 ' ; var status = ' single ' ; function createMember ( ) { // [...] } function getMemberDetails ( ) { // [...] } } ) ( ) ;
If you need to make some of the things reachable to the outside , then you need to change this .
In order to reach createMember ( ) or getMemberDetails ( ) , you need to return them to the outside world to make them properties of myApplication :
var myApplication = function ( ) { var name = ' Chris ' ; var age = ' 34 ' ; var status = ' single ' ; return{ createMember: function ( ) {
// [...] } , getMemberDetails : function ( ) { // [...] } } }( ) ; // myApplication.createMember ( ) and // myApplication.getMemberDetails ( ) now works .
This is called a module pattern or singleton .
It was mentioned a lot by Douglas Crockford and is used very much in the Yahoo User Interface Library YUI .
What ails me about this is that I need to switch syntaxes to make functions or variables available to the outside world .
Furthermore , if I want to call one method from another , I have to call it preceded by the myApplication name .
So instead , I prefer simply to return pointers to the elements that I want to make public .
This even allows me to shorten the names for outside use :
var myApplication = function ( ) { var name = ' Chris ' ; var age = ' 34 ' ; var status = ' single ' ; function createMember ( ) { // [...] } function getMemberDetails ( ) { // [...] } return { create: createMember , get:getMemberDetails } }( ) ; //myApplication.get ( ) and myApplication.create ( ) now work .
I ’ve called this “ revealing module pattern . ”
Allowing For Configuration
Whenever I ’ve written JavaScript and given it to the world , people have changed it , usually when they wanted it to do things that it could n’t do out of the box — but also often because I made it too hard for people to change things .
The workaround is to add configuration objects to your scripts .
I ’ve written about JavaScript configuration objects in detail , but here ’s the gist :
Have an object as part of your whole script called configuration .
.
In it , store all of the things that people will likely change when they use your script : CSS ID and class names ; Strings ( such as labels ) for generated buttons ; Values such as “ number of images being displayed , ” “ dimensions of map ” ; Location , locale and language settings .
Return the object as a public property so that people can override it .
Most of the time you can do this as a last step in the coding process .
I ’ve put together an example in “ Five things to do to a script before handing it over to the next developer . ”
In essence , you want to make it easy for people to use your code and alter it to their needs .
If you do that , you are much less likely to get confusing emails from people who complain about your scripts and refer to changes that someone else actually did .
Interacting With The Back End
One of the main things I learned from all my years with JavaScript is that it is a great language with which to make interactive interfaces , but when it comes to crunching numbers and accessing data sources , it can be daunting .
Originally , I learned JavaScript to replace
Perl because I was sick of copying things to a cgi-bin folder in order to make it work .
Later on , I learned that making a back - end language do the main data churning for me , instead of trying to do all in JavaScript , makes more sense with regard to security and language .
If I access a Web service , I could get JSON - P as the returned format and do a lot of data conversion on the client , but why should I when I have a server that has a richer way of converting data and that can return the data as JSON or HTML … and cache it for me to boot ?
So , if you want to use AJAX , learn about HTTP and about writing your own caching and conversion proxy .
You will save a lot of time and nerves in the long run .
Browser - Specific Code Is A Waste Of Time .
Use Libraries !
When I started Web development , the battle between using document . all and using document .
layers as the main way to access the document was still raging .
I chose document . layers because I liked the idea of any layer being its own document ( and I had written more than enough document .
write solutions to last a lifetime ) .
The layer model failed , but so did document .
all .
When Netscape 6 went all out supporting only the W3C DOM model , I loved it , but end users did n’t care .
End users just saw that this browser did n’t show the majority of the Internets correctly ( although it did ) — the code we produced was what was wrong .
We built short - sighted code that supported a state - of - the - art environment , and the funny thing about the state of the art is that it is constantly changing .
I ’ve wasted quite some time learning the ins and outs of all of the browsers and working around their issues .
Doing this back then secured my career and ensured that I had a great job .
But we should n’t have to go through this trial by fire any longer .
Libraries such as YUI , jQuery and Dojo are here to help us with this .
They take on the problems of browsers by abstracting the pains of poor implementation , inconsistencies and flat - out bugs , and relieve us of the chore .
Unless you want to beta test a certain browser because you ’re a big fan , do n’t fix browser issues in your JavaScript solutions , because you are unlikely to ever update the code to remove this fix .
All you would be doing is adding to the already massive pile of outdated code on the Web .
That said , relying solely on libraries for your core skill is short - sighted .
Read up on JavaScript , watch some good videos and tutorials on it , and understand the language .
( Tip : closures are God ’s gift to the JavaScript developer . )
Libraries will help you build things quickly , but if you assign a lot of events and effects and need to add a class to every HTML element in the document , then you are doing it wrong .

Help others by sharing your knowledge From : MTBF ( Mean Time Between Flareups , er , Failures )
There is a short FAQ - like document available from IBM at http://www.storage.ibm.com/storage/oem/tech/mtbf.htm.
No math for the statistically inclined , but explains in clear prose what IBM at least means when they say MTBF .
I will also note that , for a complex but reparable system such as an autochanger , each subsystem may have a separate MTBF and a different lifetime , which may be combined to give one figure for the unit as a whole .
Here is a reasonably understandable , but somewhat long , description of MTBF .
Thanks to Kevin Daly ( president of Odetics , kdaly@odetics.com ) wrote in 10/95 for this FAQ .
After some waffling , I 've included the whole thing , despite its length .
===============================================================
M T B F In order to understand MTBF ( Mean Time Between Failures ) it is best to start with something else -- something for which it is easier to develop an intuitive feel .
This other concept is failure rate which is , not surprisingly , the average ( mean ) rate at which things fail .
A " thing " could be a component , an assembly , or a whole system .
Some things -- rocks , for example -- are accepted to have very low failure rates while others -- British sports cars , for example -- are ( or should be ) expected to have relatively high failure rates .
It is generally accepted among reliability specialists ( and you , therefore , must not question it ) that a thing 's failure rate is n't constant , but generally goes through three phases over a thing 's lifetime .
In the first phase the failure rate is relatively high , but decreases over time -- this is called the " infant mortality " phase ( sensitive guys these reliability specialists ) .
In the second phase the failure rate is low and essentially constant -- this is ( imaginatively ) called the " constant failure rate " phase .
In the third phase the failure rate begins increasing again , often quite rapidly , -- this is called the " wearout " phase .
The reliability specialists noticed that when plotted as a function of time the failure rate resembled a familiar bathroom appliance -- but they called it a " bathtub " curve anyway .
The units of failure rate are failures per unit of " thing - time " ; e.g. failures per machine - hour or failures per system - year .
What , you may ask , does all this have to do with MTBF ?
MTBF is the inverse of the failure rate in the constant failure rate phase .
Nothing more and nothing less .
The units of MTBF are ( or , should be ) units of " thing - time " pre failure ; e.g. machine - hours per failure or system - years per failure but the " thing " part and the " per failure " part are almost always omitted to enhance the mystique and confusion and to make MTBF appear to have the units of " time " which it does n't .
We will bow to the convention of speaking of MTBF in hours or years -- but we all know what we really mean .
What does MTBF have to do with lifetime ?
Nothing at all !
It is not at all unusual for things to have MTBF's which significantly exceed their lifetime as defined by wearout -- in fact , you know many such things .
A " thirty - something " American ( well within his constant failure rate phase ) has a failure ( death ) rate of about 1.1 deaths per 1000 person - years and , therefore , has an MTBF of 900 years ( of course its really 900 person - years per death ) .
Even the best ones , however , wear out long before that .
This example points out one other important characteristic of MTBF -- it is an ensemble characteristic which applies to populations ( i.e. " lots " ) of things ; not a sample characteristic which applies to one specific thing .
In the good old days when failure rates were relatively high ( and , therefore , MTBF relatively low ) this characteristic of MTBF was a curiosity which created lively (? ) debate at conventions of reliability specialists ( them ) but otherwise did n't unduly bother right - thinking people ( us ) .
Things , however , have changed .
For many systems of interest today the required failure rates are so low that the MTBF substantially exceeds the lifetime ( obviously nature had this right a long time ago ) .
In these cases MTBF's are not only " not necessarily " sample characteristics , but are " necessarily not " sample characteristics .
In the terms of the reliability cognoscenti , failure processes are not ergodic ( i.e. you ca n't blithely trade population statistics for time statistics ) .
The key implication of this essential characteristic of MTBF is that it can only be determined from populations and it should only be applied to populations .
MTBF is , therefore an excellent characteristic for determining how many spare hard drives are needed to support 1000 PC's , but a poor characteristic for guiding you on when you should change your hard drive to avoid a crash .
MTBF 's are best determined from large populations .
How large ?
From every point of view ( theoretical , practical , statistical ) but cost , the answer is " the larger , the better " .
There are , however , well established techniques for planning and conducting test programs to develop specified levels of confidence in a thing 's MTBF .
Establishing an MTBF at the 80 % confidence level , for example , is clearly better , but much more difficult and expensive , than doing it at a 60 % confidence level .
As an example , a test designed to demonstrate a thing 's MTBF at the 80 % confidence level , requires a total thing - time of 160 % of the MTBF if it can be conducted with no failures .
You do n't want to know how much thing - time is required to achieve reasonable confidence levels if any failures occur during the test .
What , by the way , is " thing - time " ?
An important subtlety is that " thing - time " is n't " clock time " ( unless , of course , your thing is a clock ) .
The question of how to compute " thing - time " is a critical one in reliability engineering .
For some things ( e.g. living thing ) time always counts but for others the passage of " thing - time " may be highly dependent upon the state of the thing .
Various ad hoc time corrections ( such as " power on hours " ( POH ) ) have been used , primarily in the electronics area .
There is significant evidence that , in the mechanical area " thing - time " is much more related to activity rate than it is to clock time .
Measures such as " Mean Cycles Between Failures ( MCBF ) " are becoming accepted as more accurate ways to assess the " duty cycle effect " .
Well - founded , if heuristic , techniques have been developed for combining MCBF and MTBF effects for systems in which the average activity rate is known .
MTBF need not , then be " Mysterious Time Between Failures " or " Misleading Time Between Failures " , but an important system characteristic which can help to quantify the suitability of a system for a potential application .
While rising demands on system integrity may make this characteristic seem " unnatural " , remember you live in a country of 250 million 9 - million - hour MTBF people !

With imports of agricultural products rising sharply and sporadic scares about their safety , Americans surely have a right to know what country their food has come from .
Unfortunately , they have little chance of finding out , due to the intransigence of meat importers and grocery retailers .
Lobbyists for both groups have blocked implementation of a 2002 law that requires country - of - origin labels on fresh fruits and vegetables , red meats , seafood and peanuts .
Only the seafood part of the law has been put into effect , largely because Alaskan fishermen liked some of its provisions and had a powerful champion in the Senate .
With the recent questions about Chinese seafood , those labels mean that consumers can make informed choices at the seafood counter — something they should be able to do with all of their food purchases .
As Andrew Martin reported in The Times on Monday , the Bush administration ’s Agriculture Department was hostile to the labeling from the start .
That comes as no surprise given that many of its top officials had worked for a trade association representing meatpackers and ranchers that opposes labeling .
The Republican - controlled Congress , with key members beholden to campaign contributions from agribusiness , twice delayed the starting date for mandatory labeling , ultimately pushing it back to September 2008 .
To the surprise of some , Mitt Romney was the overwhelming winner of the straw poll conducted at this weekend ’s CPAC conference in Washington .
What is really interesting , though , is what the former Massachusettes Governor had to say about the piece of legislation most closely associated with one of his opponents :
Romney criticized McCain by calling for the repeal of McCain - Feingold and pledging to fight to repeal the law if elected .
I honestly do n’t know much about Romney but anyone who calls for the repeal of McCain - Feingold is good in my books .
As Myspace has grown to be a 800 pound internet gorilla the web business world has been trying to figure out why it ’s successful and perhaps more importantly how to take advantage of it and market to it ’s user gigantic user base .
I ’ve seen many people talk about using Myspace to market their business , but I ’ve seen very few examples of it being done successfully besides the music industry .
I was made aware of RollerWarehouse and the success they ’ve had by creating a news ticker of their rollerskating - focused blog posts for people to put on their Myspace profile pages .
Here ’s an example profile with it going , and here ’s the ticker in action :
Roller Warehouse : Aggressive Rollerblade Skates
The kicker is that by running this on your Myspace page ( or any other web page for that matter ) , you can get 5 % off any order you place with RollerWarehouse .
So , if you ’re into rollerskating , you can put news on your Myspace page to make it cooler , and you can get 5 % off your orders .
Not bad .
So how has this worked out for RollerWarehouse ?
In it ’s first two weeks of action RollerWarehouse.com went from a Google Pagerank of 0 to a 6 , sales for March were up about 10 % over 2005 ’s sales which was their first increase in 4 years .
The program has a viral effect as other Myspacers see it on pages and add it to their ’s , so the link benefit is just growing , as well as the number of customers taking advantage of the 5 % off .
They currently estimate that 50 - 75 new news tickers are being placed today for a total somewhere between 750 - 1000 total tickers running on people ’s pages .
Why is that Google Pagerank important ?
Well , now everytime they highlight a product on their blog , they get great natural search results in Google for that search term .
For example , they went from nowhere to being ranked # 1 in Google results for “ aggressive skates ” , and are currently sitting at # 2 .
That is one of the top search terms for their industry .
How much work was this for RollerWarehouse ?
Not much , simply creating the news ticker and getting it adopted by the first few users .
What a simple and great way to market their ecommerce business and blog .

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were asked in a recent presidential debate whether they would meet with such controversial foreign leaders as Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and Cuba 's Fidel Castro .
Despite the sparring between the two over the timing and pre-conditions for such a meeting , they both essentially said they would engage international reprobates – something this administration has repeatedly balked at doing .
Remember , Vice President Dick Cheney said , " We do n't negotiate with evil .
We destroy it . "
A tougher question is whether the next president would threaten to use nuclear weapons against a foreign enemy .
Four Republican candidates – Mitt Romney , Duncan Hunter , Jim Gilmore , and Rudy Giuliani – have already expressed their willingness to use " tactical " nuclear weapons against Iran to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons .
Again , this tracks with the vice president who is reportedly urging an attack on Iran 's nuclear infrastructure by next year at the latest .
Mr. Obama recently told the Associated Press that he would not use nuclear weapons " in any circumstance " involving civilians .
Mrs. Clinton once again criticized his foreign policy position saying that she did n't believe that " any president should make any blanket statements . "
If the Democrat candidates want to distinguish themselves from their opponents , and if the Republicans want to recover from the disastrous foreign policy of this administration , the candidates should commit to delegitimizing – not stressing – nuclear weapons .
Every time the United States threatens a potential adversary with nuclear weapons it tells the world that these weapons are acceptable instruments of modern warfare and that there are no political or moral constraints on US behavior .
It is overwhelmingly in the US national interest to preserve the " taboo " on nuclear weapons use and to seek to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons in US security policy .
To achieve this , the candidates should address four issues :
First , announce that they reject nuclear intimidation and the current policy of preventive war .
In the future , and under their leadership , the United States will retain its nuclear arsenal for deterrence only and will not employ nuclear weapons except in retaliation for a nuclear attack .
Second , commit to the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons .
Even President Reagan sought a nuclear - free world and a number of senior US statesmen , from the late Paul Nitze ( Democrat ) to George Schultz and Henry Kissinger ( both Republicans ) , agree that the US would be much safer in a world without nuclear weapons .
Third , declare that they plan to withdraw all US nuclear weapons from Europe during their term in office .
These weapons are relics of the cold war :
There is no strategic requirement for them , and no military mission that cannot be carried out by conventional weapons .
Finally , make it clear that the United States will not resume nuclear testing .
A reaffirmation of the decade - old moratorium on nuclear tests ( or ratification by the next Congress of the treaty banning such tests ) would strengthen US efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons to other nations .
In the run-up to the presidential election , the candidates of both parties have a chance to indicate to the world that the next administration will forgo the policy of nuclear intimidation and actively strive to delegitimize nuclear weapons .
This nation cannot become more secure by reserving for itself the right to use nuclear weapons while preaching nuclear abstinence for the rest of world .

Actress Shilpa Shetty won Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year
Producers Endemol said remarks directed at actress Shilpa Shetty were never " an appropriate matter " for police .
The row attracted 45,000 complaints , as well as criticism from watchdog Ofcom .
The Hertfordshire Police Authority , which issued the £ 15,000 bill , said it would raise the issue when discussing security for the show 's next series .
We do not believe that Endemol or Channel 4 should bear responsibility for costs incurred by this investigation
Endemol statement
A statement issued by Endemol claimed that the decision to investigate Celebrity Big Brother " was made solely by Hertfordshire Police and no charges were ever brought " .
" Endemol and Channel 4 made it clear from the outset they did not believe this was an appropriate matter for police investigation , a view later confirmed by the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) .
" As such we do not believe that Endemol or Channel 4 should bear responsibility for costs incurred by this investigation . "
We 're obviously negotiating the contract for providing police services for the next series of Big Brother so we will be discussing that then
Hertfordshire Police Authority spokeswoman
A spokeswoman for the Authority , which monitors the spending of the Hertfordshire Police force , conceded that it had " no legal standing " to recover the money .
" But we 're obviously negotiating the contract for providing police services for the next series of Big Brother , so we will be discussing that then . "
And she added that the CPS did not advise on whether the police should investigate a matter .
" Once the police have completed their investigation and have a case ready to go to court , it goes to the CPS , who decide whether it is prosecuted , " she said .
Goody was among those who recited an offensive limerick about Shetty
In May , Ofcom found that Channel 4 had made " serious editorial misjudgements " in its handling of the race row , and ordered the broadcaster to make a high - profile on - air apology at the start of the present series .
The channel apologised and said it accepted Ofcom 's ruling , as did Endemol , which said it " sincerely regretted the level of offence caused " .
In three days , Ron Paul ’s Presidential campaign will face a crucial test at the Ames , Iowa Straw Poll .
Admittedly , the straw poll will not be an accurate measure of candidate support in Iowa since at least two of the top three candidates — Giuliani and McCain — have chosen not to actively contest the Ames Straw Poll , putting the result itself in doubt .
Nonetheless , if Congressman Paul manages to get considerable support on Saturday or even , by some chance , win the straw poll , his campaign will be transformed to an entirely different level .
Over at The Crossed Pond , though , blogger Rojas is raising legitimate concerns over how some of Congressman Paul ’s supporters might react if Saturday does n’t go as they might have hoped :
One thing is certain , though : win or lose , some Paul supporters are probably going to allege vote fraud .
That ’s just the way the game is played these days
And , as Rojas states in a follow - up post , Congressman Paul has had the unfortunate luck of attracting some less than appealing supporters :
The problem Dr. Paul faces , of course , is that whether or not he ’s done anything at all to associate him with dingbats of this sort , their active presence in his movement causes him to become their associate in the public ’s eye .
We ’ve seen that already when the right - wing blogosphere went crazy about Paul ’s association with “ 9/11 truthers ” –when all Paul had done was speak with them politely .
I ’ll be honest ; I have n’t the foggiest idea of how the campaign should deal with this sort of thing .
Ron Paul attracts outsiders ; he draws people of strong convictions and unconventional views into politics .
That ’s the core of his appeal .
By DEFINITION a huge portion of his support is going to be unappealing to core Republicans–hell , as a libertarian , I myself am probably too “ out there ” for the majority of the American public .
And publicly disavowing the Jim Condits only draws media attention to them .
While I ’m not sure I entirely agree with the idea that Congressman Paul ’s libertarian ideas would n’t appeal to the Republican base , I do agree with the authors idea that the campaign has been hurt in the eyes of mainstream libertarian - oriented Republicans with it ’s association with 9/11 truthers , JOhn Birchers , conspiracy nutcases , and their ilk .
Apparently , the Paul campaign recognizes the problem and has issued this statement :
Everyone who is calling the Iowa GOP over these diebold machines is doing a tremendous disservice to the Ron Paul campaign .
Stop it .
You are destroying relationships and turning the Iowa GOP against Ron Paul .
The campaign is taking every reasonable precaution we can to ensure a fair vote , and we ask that you leave it up to the campaign to speak with the Iowa GOP .
They know Ron Paul supporters are not satisfied with the voting process , and any further phone calls only causes more problems for the campaign .
Focus your attention on turning out to vote for Ron Paul in Ames on Saturday as we are trying to do .
Stop creating more problems than necessary .
Please spread this message far and wide within the Ron Paul community .
Thanks , Jeff Frazee National Youth Coordinator – Ron Paul 2008
And if Ron happens to come in third , or fourth , on Saturday , do n’t attribute it to a conspiracy .
Just accept it , and figure out what to do next .
That is what politics is all about .
For almost as long as I can remember , the experts have been saying that the US , with 5 % of the world 's population , consumes a third or more of the Earth 's resources .
That is no longer true .
China has now overtaken America as the world 's leading resource consumer .
Among the basic commodities - grain and meat in the food sector , oil and coal in the energy sector , and steel in the industrial sector - China now consumes more of each of these than the US except for oil .
It consumes nearly twice as much meat - 67 m tonnes compared with 39 m tonnes in the US ; and more than twice as much steel - 258 m tonnes to 104m .
The important questions now are : what if China 's consumption per person of these resources reaches the current US level , and how long will it take for China 's income per person to reach the US level ?
If China 's economy expands at 8 % a year in the decades ahead , its income per person will reach the current US level in 2031 .
If at that point China 's resource consumption per person were the same as that in the US today , its 1.45 billion people would consume the equivalent of two - thirds of the current world grain harvest .
China 's paper consumption would be double the world 's current production .
Say goodbye to the world 's forests .
If China were to have three cars for every four people - as in the US - it would have 1.1 bn cars .
Worldwide today there are 800 m cars .
To provide the roads and parking spaces to accommodate such a vast fleet , China would have to pave an area comparable to the land it now plants in rice - 29 m hectares ( 72 m acres ) .
It would use 99 m barrels of oil a day ; the world currently produces only 84 m barrels daily , and may never produce much more .
The western economic model - the fossil fuel - based , car - centred , throwaway economy - is not going to work for China .
If it does not work for China , it will not work for India , which by 2031 is projected to have a population even larger than China's .
Nor will it work for the 3 billion other people in developing countries who are also dreaming the " American dream " .
In an increasingly integrated global economy , where all countries are competing for the same oil , grain and iron ore , the existing economic model will no longer work for industrial countries either .
Time for Plan B
Sustaining our early 21st - century global civilisation now depends on shifting to a renewable energy powered , re-use / recycle economy with a diversified transport system .
Business as usual - Plan A - cannot take us where we want to go .
It is time for Plan B , time to build a new economy .
Glimpses of the new economy can already be seen in the wind farms of western Europe , the solar rooftops of Japan , the fast - growing hybrid car fleet of the US , the reforested mountains of South Korea , and the bicycle - friendly streets of Amsterdam .
Virtually everything we need to do to build an economy that will sustain economic progress is already being done in one or more countries .
In this economic restructuring , the biggest challenges will come in the energy economy as the world strives simultaneously to reduce carbon emissions and dependence on oil .
Over the past five years , production of energy from oil and coal expanded by 2 % and 3 % a year , respectively , while wind and solar energy grew by some 30 % a year .
The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is under way , but , unfortunately , it is not moving nearly fast enough to stabilise the climate or slow the depletion of oil reserves .
Among the new sources of energy - wind , solar cells , solar thermal , geothermal , small - scale hydro and biomass - wind is developing fastest , hinting at what the new energy economy will look like .
In Europe , which is leading the world into the wind era , wind - electric generation is sufficient to meet the residential needs of some 40 million people .
The European Wind Energy Association has projected that by 2020 some 195 million Europeans - half of the region 's population - could get their residential electricity from wind .
Wind energy is growing fast for the following reasons : it is abundant , cheap , inexhaustible , widely distributed , clean and climate benign .
No other energy source has this combination of attributes .
The US has enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricity needs several times over .
Wind electric generation in America , which expanded by 35 % last year , is on the verge of exploding as rising natural gas prices spur investment in this cheaper source of electricity .
China could easily double its current electricity generation from wind alone .
For the US vehicle fuel sector , which is widely seen as one of the most challenging segments of the world energy economy to restructure , the key to quickly reducing oil use and carbon emissions is petrol - electric hybrid cars .
Fuel efficiency ratings from the US Environmental Protection Agency show that the average new car sold in the US last year travelled 22 miles to the gallon , compared with 55 miles a gallon for the Toyota Prius , a mid-sized petrol - electric hybrid .
If , for oil security and climate stabilisation reasons , America over the next 10 years replaced its entire fleet of passenger vehicles with super - efficient petrol - electric hybrids , petrol use could easily be cut in half .
A change in the number of cars or miles driven would not be necessary .
Beyond this , a petrol - electric hybrid with an additional storage battery and a plug - in capacity would allow motorists to use electricity exclusively for short - distance driving , such as the daily commute and grocery shopping .
This could cut US petrol use by an additional 20 % , for a total reduction of 70 % .
Investment in thousands of wind farms across the US to feed cheap electricity into the grid would mean Americans could do most short - distance driving with wind energy , dramatically reducing carbon emissions and the pressure on world oil supplies .
Using timers to recharge batteries during the low - demand hours late at night , with electricity coming from wind farms , costs the equivalent of , or less than , 60 cents a gallon of petrol .
The US has not only an inexhaustible alternative to oil but also an incredibly cheap one .
Taxing negative activities
The key to restructuring the global economy is restructuring national tax systems .
In effect , lowering taxes on income and increasing those on environmentally destructive activities .
This has progressed fastest in Europe , where countries are taxing negative activities , such as carbon emissions , the generation of rubbish ( landfill taxes ) , and cars driven in cities .
A four - year plan adopted in Germany in 1999 systematically shifted taxes from labour to energy .
By 2001 , this plan had lowered fuel use by 5 % .
It had also accelerated growth in the renewable energy sector , creating some 45,400 jobs by 2003 in the wind industry alone - a number that is projected to rise to 103,000 by 2010 .
In 2001 , Sweden launched a bold new 10 - year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30bn kroner ( £ 2.2bn ) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities .
Much of this shift - £ 624 per household - is levied on road transport , including substantial hikes in vehicle and fuel taxes .
Cities that are being suffocated by cars are using stiff entrance taxes to reduce congestion .
The revenue from London 's congestion charge for cars entering the inner city is being invested in improving the bus network , which carries 2 million passengers daily .
The goal is a restructuring of the London transport system to reduce congestion , air pollution and carbon emissions , and to increase mobility .
Ecologists have long been convinced of the need to restructure the global economy in order to protect natural support systems and to stabilise the climate .
China 's growth is also convincing economists of the need for restructuring .
Our civilisation is not the first to move onto an environmentally unsustainable economic path .
Some earlier civilisations in a similar situation were able to make the required adjustments in the time available .
Others were not .
We study the archaeological sites of the latter .
Of all the resources needed to build an economy that will sustain economic progress , none is more scarce than time .
With climate change , we may be approaching the point of no return .
The temptation is to reset the clock .
But we cannot .
Nature is the timekeeper .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Police arrested a teenager suspected of posting his own translation of the latest Harry Potter novel on the Internet weeks before the official French release , the book ’s publishers said on Wednesday .
A Harry Potter fan looks at a window display of J.K. Rowling 's " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows " while awaiting its release at a bookstore in Manila July 21 , 2007 .
Police have arrested a high school student suspected of posting his own translation of the latest Harry Potter book on the Internet weeks ahead of the official French release date , a newspaper reported on Wednesday .

The 16 - year - old schoolboy , from the Aix - en - Provence region in southern France , was taken into custody by a police anti-counterfeiting unit and later released , said a spokeswoman for the Gallimard publishing house , which handles the French editions of the novels .
“ Concerned that such acts of counterfeiting are threats to basic authors ’ and creators ’ rights , ( author J.K. Rowling and Gallimard ) immediately agreed to support the investigation as it was launched , ” spokeswoman Marie Leroy - Lena said in a statement .
“ It is not a young person or a fan we are talking about here -- these are organized networks that use young people , ” she told Reuters by telephone .
“ For the moment there is an ongoing investigation , and neither Gallimard nor Ms. Rowling has filed an independent lawsuit . ”
The newspaper Le Parisien reported earlier that the book ’s first three chapters appeared on the Web just days after the English - language edition of “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ” went on sale in late July .
The paper said boy was arrested on Monday .
Police were not available for comment .
The official French language version of the book is scheduled for publication on Oct 26 .
The seventh volume of the Harry Potter saga is the fastest selling book in history , publishers say , with about 11 million English - language copies sold in the first 24 hours .
Many French stores are selling the English - language version .
Residents of Beijing are being encouraged to form orderly queues
Venues for next year 's Beijing Olympic Games may be nearing completion but , it appears , work still needs to be done on improving people 's manners .
Chinese Olympic officials fear bad habits , such as spitting , queue jumping , littering and bad language could harm China 's image at next year 's event .
To deal with this apparent problem , a number of campaigns have been launched to " civilise " the city .
But more than one official admits these are not always successful .
" The Olympic Games is not simply a matter of competitive sports - it is also a question of raising the quality of the people , " said Zhang Faqiang , vice - chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee .
" We are still a way off from meeting the demands for a real civilised Olympic Games , so we will continue to do important work on this , " he told China Youth Daily .
Such important work includes banning male taxi drivers from shaving their heads and clearing beggars from the capital 's main thoroughfares .
Beijing has also initiated " queuing day " on the 11th of each month to encourage people to wait in orderly lines .
And officials are so worried about " Beijing swearing " at football matches that one local club hired university students to teach fans how to chant politely .
' Spit bags '
But perhaps the most potent symbol of an " uncivilised " society in Beijing is spitting , an act as commonplace as eating Beijing Duck in the dry , dusty capital .
Olympic officials appear obsessed with preventing the city 's residents noisily drawing up phlegm to deposit on the capital 's streets .
Promotional events are being held to encourage good manners
Beijing Civilisation
Office recently revealed that it had spent 1,700 hours observing the spitting habits of 230,000 residents in 320 public places .
It concluded the incidence of spitting had dropped from 8.4 % in 2005 to 4.9 % this year .
No explanation was given on how the figures were calculated .
In order to make sure residents do not leave phlegm all over the city 's streets , volunteers have even been handing out special " spit bags " .
Persistent offenders have been fined 250 RMB ( $ 33 , £ 16 ) .
To ram home the message of these various campaigns , Olympic banners urging good behaviour appear across the city .
" Take part , contribute and enjoy yourself by welcoming the Olympics , being civilised and behaving better , " reads one slogan .
Keeping face
Most ordinary people seem to welcome these efforts .
Improving the moral quality of its citizens is not , however , a new concept in China .
Professor Stefan Landsberger , a China expert at Amsterdam University , says the idea of moral education derives from the teachings of Chinese philosopher Confucius .
China has long tried to stop spitting , such as this 2003 drive
" This is very much engrained in Chinese political thinking .
The state provides examples of how to behave that ordinary people then have to abide by , " he said .
Modern China is also littered with examples of zealous government officials trying to curtail " immoral " behaviour .
In the early 1980s , after China opened up to the outside world , the government launched a campaign against " spiritual pollution " .
Western liberal ideas were blamed for social problems such as crime , corruption and pornography .
Even people with long hair were ridiculed .
It is not even the first time China has tried to eradicate spitting .
China 's Communist Party has had several campaigns since it took power in 1949 .
And even the Nationalist Party 's leader Chiang Kai-shek , who ruled China before the Communists , made a stab at stopping people spitting in a 1934 campaign .
At heart , China does not want to " lose face " next year when tens of thousands of foreign visitors arrive in Beijing for the Olympics .
As the Chinese Communist Party 's Spiritual Civilisation Steering Committee revealed , some types of behaviour are simply " not compatible with the nation 's economic strength and its growing international status " .
Expect more campaigns before the games begin .
Two more GOP senators break from Bush on Iraq Ron Brynaert
Published : Saturday July 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
Two more Republican senators have gone public with their dissatisfaction with President Bush 's Iraq war strategy , but the White House still does n't view the internecine feuding during wartime as a " hemorrhaging of support , " since hardly any GOP lawmakers have aligned with Democrats to call for an immediate troop withdrawal .
" Wearied by the lack of progress in Iraq and by the steady stream of military funerals back home , a growing number of Republican lawmakers who had stood loyally with President Bush are insisting his strategy has failed and are calling on him to bring the war to an end , " Noam N. Levey writes for Saturday 's LA Times .
" In the last two weeks , three GOP senators  including one of the party 's leading voices on foreign affairs and one of Bush 's strongest allies  have urged the president to change course now so U.S. troops can start to withdraw . "
On Friday , Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee told the paper , " It should be clear to the president that there needs to be a new strategy .
Our policy in Iraq is drifting ; " and " Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , who helped lead the charge earlier this year against Democratic efforts to oppose Bush 's troop buildup , said : ' We do n't seem to be making a lot of progress . ' "
Gregg added that it was important that there be " a clear blueprint for how we were going to draw down . "
" None of these GOP lawmakers has embraced Democratic legislation to compel a troop withdrawal , " the paper notes .
" But nearly five years after congressional Republicans overwhelmingly answered Bush 's call for military action against Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , some are doing what was once unthinkable : challenging a wartime president from their own party . "
The article continues , " The tide of Republican dissent began to grow two weeks ago when Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , former chairman of the foreign relations committee , delivered an earnest plea for change from the floor of the Senate .
Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio expressed similar doubts in a letter he sent to the president the next day , and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia , the former chairman of the armed services committee , openly praised Lugar for speaking out . "
New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici , a senator for more than three decades , up for reelection in 2008 , was the third Republican elder statesman to publicly turn against the president 's troop ' surge ' policy within 10 days .
" I am unwilling to continue our current strategy , " Domenici said at a news conference in Albuquerque , New Mexico , blaming the Iraqi government for not making sufficient progress to merit the sacrifices of US troops .
The Times notes that " another House Republican , conservative Rep. John T. Doolittle from Roseville , Calif. , labeled the Iraq war ' a quagmire ' and called for a reduced U.S. military presence , according to the Sacramento Bee . "
During a White House press gaggle on Friday , spokesman Tony Fratto took exception when a reporter asked " what is the President going to do to stop the hemorrhaging of support from his own -- his fellow Republicans before the progress report even comes forth . "
" I do n't buy that characterization of what we 're hearing from these leaders in Congress , " Fratto responded .
" I think what we are hearing is some thoughtful discussion of how we go forward .
And what we 're going to do , and what the President is going to do is going to continue to talk to them and continue to work together on ways forward as we work through this .
So I do n't buy that characterization of it . "
Another reporter asked , " Is there no concern that these leading , influential Republicans -- Domenici , Voinovich , Lugar -- are basically parting with the President on many aspects of his policy ?
And I think that 's undeniable .
They 're calling for timetables ; the President does n't want that .
They 're calling for withdrawal plans ; the President does n't want to provide that . "
" If a withdrawal plan is tied to -- is tied to a specific date , I think that 's not a wise way to go and that 's not something that we would support and that 's a conversation that we would have with them , " Fratto responded .
" We think that is -- that 's fraught with danger .
But that 's part of the conversation that we would have with them . "
Fratto added , " But I hope they do recognize -- and I think they do -- that we do want to get to the same place , and we share that goal .
So that is a huge amount of common ground that we share , and again , distinctly different from where Democrat leaders are talking about -- where they are talking about pulling out troops in 120 days , which is n't even really possible , forgetting that it 's not advisable .
So what we 're going to continue to do is work with them on where we go in a post - surge environment . " ( with wire reports )
What happens when a mother of three and small town municipal judge decides to take on the online Jidhad ?
Shannen Rossmiller tells the story of how she helped unmask a number of malefactors , including some who were seeking to acquire Stinger missiles and finally track down a renegade in the US National Guard .
Viewed from one perspective , it is a fascinating case study of the private citizen warrior , embarked on what Rossmiller called her own " counterJihad " .
Before 9 - 11 , I had no experience with the Middle East or the Arabic language .
I was a mother of three and a municipal judge in a small town in Montana .
But the terrorist attacks affected me deeply .
... I began to read vociferously [ voraciously ] about Islam , terrorism , extremist groups , and Islamist ideology .
...
This housewife found she could fight her private war from a computer keyboard .
Her first step was visit and learn all she could about Jihadi websites .
In November 2001 , I saw a news report about how terrorists and their sympathizers communicated on websites and Internet message boards and how limited government agencies were in their ability to monitor these web communications .
This news report showed me how extensively Al - Qaeda used the Internet to orchestrate 9 - 11 and how out of touch our intelligence agencies were regarding this Internet activity .
Apparently , there were not procedures in place for tracking communications and activity on the Al - Qaeda websites and Internet forums at the time .
So she invented her own procedures .
But as she ghosted through the websites and forums , she realized that any further progress required a knowledge of Arabic .
Nothing daunted , Rosssmiller set out to learn Arabic .
And she did .
Over the Internet , from a Cairo language academy .
Early in January 2002 , I began taking an Arabic language course online for eight weeks from the Cairo - based Arab Academy , which , that autumn , I supplemented with an intensive Arabic course at the State University of New York at Buffalo .
As I learned more Arabic , the jihadi websites opened for me .
Certain individuals stood out for either their radicalism or the information that they sent .
I followed and tracked these individuals and kept notebooks detailing each website and person of interest .
Soon Rossmiller grew skilled enough to pick out the signature style of individuals and successfully impersonate a Jihadi .
If on the Internet nobody knew if you were a dog , it might be equally possible for a mom of three to convince her quarry she was a terrorist looking to hook up .
I created my first terrorist cover identity on the Internet on March 13 , 2002 , to communicate and interact with these targets .
In my first chat room sting , I convinced a Pakistani man that I was an Islamist arms dealer .
When he offered to sell me stolen U.S. Stinger missiles to help the jihadists fighting the U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan , I used the Persian Gulf dialect of Arabic to ask him to provide me with information that I could use to confirm his claims , such as stock numbers .
Within a couple of weeks , the missile identification numbers were in my computer inbox .
Stock numbers and the e-mail correspondence in hand , I intended to drive to the closest field office for the FBI here in Montana but was afraid that the FBI would not take me seriously .
What were the chances of a Montana mom showing up at their door with information about an individual in Pakistan who was trying to sell Stinger missiles ?
Instead , I submitted the information to the FBI 's online tips site .
A few days later , I received a telephone call from an FBI agent from New Jersey who proceeded to question me .
It felt like an interrogation .
Several days later , the same agent called to thank me and say that the stock number information for the Stingers did match some of the information that the government had about the missiles .
Encouraged by this success , I continued to communicate with these jihadis online and proceeded to gather more information .
Using various Muslim personalities and theatrics for cover , I began monitoring the jihadist chat rooms into the early hours of the morning while my family slept .
Plunging in , I started making headway into the world of counterterrorism .
Rossmiller went on to detect early warnings of a bombing attack against expatriates in Saudi Arabia and was even asked -- in 2003 -- to courier some money for Saddam 's fedayeen in Jordan .
But not all the homes burning the midnight oil in America belonged to individuals fighting for their country .
Some of the nocturnal denizens haunting the Internet were bent on selling out their country for gain or out of hatred .
At some point Rossmiller 's path and theirs were bound to cross .
It was soon afterwards that I learned that I was not the only American surfing the chat rooms .
In October 2004 , while monitoring Arabic Islamist websites for threat - related information and activity , I saw a message posted in English by a man calling himself Amir Abdul Rashid .
He said he was a Muslim convert who " was in a position to take things to the next level in the fight against our enemy ( the U.S. government ) . "
He further requested that someone from the mujahideen contact him for details .
I was suspicious because Rashid posted his message in English on an Arabic website and was openly seeking contact from the mujahideen .
I traced his IP address back to an area outside of Seattle , Washington .
Over time , it also became apparent to me that he was a member of the U.S. military .
With the Montana mom aware of him the net slowly closed .
Rashid turned out to be Spec. Ryan G. Anderson , whose National Guard unit was scheduled to deploy to Iraq .
Anderson was hawking the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the M1 - AI and M1 - A2 Abrams tanks as well as U.S. troop locations in Iraq .
The price for this success was the end Rossmiller 's anonymity .
Called to testify at Anderson 's trial , Rossmiller 's modus operandi and identity were revealed in court records .
Her cloak stripped away , the hunter soon became the hunted .
After the media picked up my identity at Anderson 's Article 32 hearing in May 2004 , I received numerous threats and , on December 5 , 2004 , someone stole my car out of my family 's garage .
It was later found wrecked two counties away from my home , riddled with bullet holes .
As a result , I now have permanent security .
There 's more .
And if you want to know of her other exploits you should as they say , read the whole thing .
Ironically if Rossmiller had been engaged in important sleuthing such as uncovering whether Scooter Libby had talked about Valerie Plame before or after Richard Armitage instead of the trivial pursuit of hunting down terrorists intent on mass murder or traitors selling their country 's secrets , her story might already be the subject of a blockbuster movie instead of the obscure pages of Middle East Forum .
Rossmiller would be on the Good Morning America and Oprah shows , pulling in money instead of shelling it out for personal security .
Yet her saga is more than a cultural commentary on our times .
It also illustrates the largely unrecorded exploits of individuals who are fighting the Jihad on their own time and dime .
Wearing a wire for the FBI .
Tracking down Jihadi training camps in rural America .
Translating documents .
Jamming terrorist sites .
Raising the alarm .
Baking cookies for the troops .
It 's a story of the gaps in the official warfighting apparatus and the enterprise that quietly fills them in .
It is a perfectly 21st century story ; a tale of networked counterinsurgency .
But it is also a story from the past : of the 18th century idea of a nation in arms , not literally perhaps -- the keyboard is probably a more common weapon -- but of people 's war , something that shocked the Continent when the French revolution brought it into European existence .
This perhaps , is Osama Bin Laden 's saddest contribution to history .
Not that he should make war upon the nations , but that he has raised the nations , right down to their living rooms and front porches , to make war upon him and his .

An eight - foot aluminium box is being touted as the solution to the housing shortage .
But what 's it like to sleep , eat , wash and entertain in one ?
BBC News 's Rajesh Mirchandani did just that .
I 've brought a cat , to see if I can swing it .
I can .
It 's stuffed - the cat , that is - so do n't worry .
Even Paris
Hilton 's prison cell is bigger than this , although I doubt it had as many mod cons .
Just old lags .
It 's on show at Birmingham 's Extreme Buildings Festival
The front door leads straight into a combined shower / toilet cubicle which poses a few interesting logistical questions , but ultimately can save time ( although I end up brushing my teeth in the kitchen sink , unwilling to perform this ablution in such close proximity to the privy ) .
Three steps takes me from the front door to the back of the house , where the kitchen is compact and very usable .
Just do n't try and fit too many items into the tiny fridge .
No weekly shop for this fridge
There 's a nifty dining table which pulls out from under some drawers : very clever but I 'm not sure I 'd want to manoeuvre it in and out every day .
The bed pulls down from the wall into a comfortable sleeping area that 's not at all cramped .
I do n't feel claustrophobic at any time - even with 12 guests round for a party .
Not a world record attempt , just a test to see if you really can lead a normal life here .
Twelve , I realise , is perhaps four too many for such a small space .
Which is , ahem , the first time I 've found myself too popular .
Pied-a- terre
Once the guests leave , it 's a real pleasure to potter around ( admittedly with everything within arm 's reach ) , under the soothing glow of the low energy lights , in my well - insulated cocoon .
The architect Stephen Cherry ( right ) at the party
Two of my party guests , students both , thought it was cool for parties but that they had too much " stuff " to be able to live here .
Would a key worker , at whom these pods are aimed , not be in the same position ?
At £ 50,000 ( fully installed and functioning ) , it could be a starter home for someone struggling with today 's house prices , but a better option might be a crash - pad for someone who works five days a week in one location and goes home at the weekend .
Affordable housing is again a key issue of our times .
As the architect told me , living in an eight - foot cube is n't for everyone , but it may be for some .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
It sounds so cute - like a Wendy House for grownups .
And as a key worker , I guess I qualify .
But where would I put my 400 books , and 200 DVDs and masses of other stuff ?
Along with my little Wendy House , I 'd have to have a rather large storage unit to store my belongings - which would negate the whole space / money saving aspect of the idea .
MB , London
Do n't they already have these in Germany outside some universities ?
I do n't think I would ever use one unless it were as say a hotel room for a couple of nights stay max .
But as for a solution to the housing situation I do n't think it should be allowed to gather any pace .
I would rather live in shared accommodation than live by myself in a 3D puzzle .
Matt , Yorkshire
Some people seem to be missing the point .
This is clearly designed for places such as London where land is very expensive .
And in London there is no place to leave a caravan , or a boat , cheaply for long periods of time .
As long as this unit has a long life ( and ideally can be moved and replanted if necessary ) then it 's value will increase not decrease .
And as for David of Northampton 's idea of camping out at work , yeah , I 'm sure that we could fit a few hundred beds in the back of our office .
I , and a lot of people , live two hours or more away from work .
A relatively cheap crash pad in town would be great .
Joe Grey , Folkestone
My caravan offers more space , comfort , facilities , gismos and gadgets for a quarter of the price .
Roger Davis , Beith , Ayrshire
Why would people want to buy a property like this when it would seem that the value would only decrease , like a caravan ?
Buying property is a form of investment , and people like key workers and students who these properties are aimed at surely have n't got £ 50,000 to throw away ?
Elizabeth Simpson , Essex
Surely the concept of having an extra home to use as a crash pad is one of the contributing factors to the housing shortage in the first place ?
If you can't comfortably commute from your home to your job , then you should think about relocating one or the other .
Anthony Hughes , Cardiff
Definitely not a solution to the housing shortage , but I can see them being rented out like hotel rooms to contract workers and the like .
C Bailey , Derby , UK
I think its really good that people are thinking of new ideas to make cheap homes but I cant imagine living there with my 6ft 5 boyfriend .
Would people that tall even be able to fold their legs under the table ?
Dawn , Bristol
My kids are at the age now where they need to start thinking about getting their own places .
They earn less than £ 20 K , They are not going to indulge this , they might as well buy a boat and live on that .
Planners , Developers , Politicians ... get real .
PadiRaki , Gosport
Why pay 50 grand for something so basic ?
You could buy a 26x6 ft canal barge for no more , or a far more versatile caravan or camper van for far less .
David Ford , London
It 's very well designed but I think that space is too important to people to live like this all the time .
Katie , Bournemouth
It 's not a home - we should be building houses for people to live in , not try to induce people to waste their money on things like this .
As for the comment that you could have one of these as a crash pad and then go home at weekends defies logic .
Better to sleep on a bed in the back of the office if you need to spend that much time there .
David , Northampton
If this is a solution to starter homes or crash - pad then lets just watch depression soar .

Dear Jeff , You made $ 11 million last year , you just fired 10,000 employees , and you got a 36 % raise this year .
And that 's the problem .
You ca n't cut back and fire ten thousand hardworking people , and tell them about the new management style you 're bringing to the company , and then accept a 36 % raise in base pay .
That makes you lose credibility .
( And I 'm not even taking into account how you fell flat on your face , trying to hype torcetrapib . )
Your predecessor was shipped out of Pfizer dressed in tar and feathers , holding his $ 200 million grab bag , to the sound of employees and shareholders chanting " Give it back , Hank . "
The WSJ even wrote an article with the headline " Off with their heads , " based on Pfizer 's executive pay for non-performance .
If you read what your employees are saying , such as this , you will realize you just lost their respect ; they 've stopped calling you Kindler and replaced that with Swindler
And without those employees and their support , you are just one man , putting his legs into his pants , one at a time , like the rest of us .
Without the support of your employees , you will fail , just like your predecessor .
Jeff , please act like a leader :
Do n't accept the raise .
You already made $ 11.4 million in 2006 .
You can afford to do the right thing .
Best regards , Peter Rost

I am an ardent follower of world news .
Be it politics , science , business , or pop culture , I am keen to hear and understand the situation regardless of the scale or my distance from the incident .
I could be reading the tactics of the Recording Industry Association of America , the hostility of environmental groups towards nuclear power stations , or the Chinese threats to liquidate their US currency holdings , I have noticed certain human elements at play in every locale .
To name a few , ( 1 ) greed , ( 2 ) ignorance , ( 3 ) inflexibility , and ( 4 ) irrationality are commonly at play in the prime issues of local and global conflicts .
As residents of a civilized society that is at most a single crisis away from savagery and barbarism , we have constructed innumerable social systems to keep all of us functional and urbane .
As we have a justice system in place to ensure murder and theft is discouraged , we have banking systems to regulate the institutions that promote growth by enabling mass savings and investments , namely banks .
Then we have school systems that dictate what a student of age nine should read and which math problems the student should be able to solve by age twelve .
Add to that the laws on aviation , the rules of alpine skiing , the regulations on equipment sterilization for medical purposes , the age of consent laws that are different in every geographic region , and the code of ethics for international journalists in war zones , and we come to a very complex world to legally function in .
While all of us break a few rules , most of us follow most of the rules .
We stick to the rules quite well indeed .
After all , who wants to be hauled away to prison , get fired from the job , be disqualified from the race , or be banned from the Saturday morning gardening club ?
That 's the stuff news is made out of .
News is but a glorified portrayal of the leaks in the system .
From stories about school shootings in suburban communities to suicide bombings in the Middle East , from stock market crashes in Europe to polar bear habitat loss in the Arctic , the purpose of news is to highlight the cracks in the long - standing systems we have in place , thereby making all of us think " somebody needs to fix this ! "
Your local station will cover the story of the bottling plant near your house that is dumping industrial waste into your scenic lake .
Similarly , the national news networks will break the story of accidents happening across the country as long as a hole in the system can be pinpointed .
Story of a bridge collapse is about the breakdown of construction regulation , infrastructure budgeting , and political earmarks .
News of a molested child is to decry the deviation from moral conduct , social decency , and parental expectations .
Watching the news is like watching a beautiful painting being ripped to shreds , one knife - slash at a time .
The keen observers of news notice that when the news is n't broadcasting the leaks in the system , that in itself is a sign of the larger leak in the system , whereby the fourth estate is found to be in bed with the governing bodies .
It does n't take long before the traditionally free , uncensored media becomes an extension of the ruling party and helps dictate the edicts of the rulers by publicizing propaganda as facts .
Regardless of when the common man realizes the system is breaking down , every system we have designed thus far will eventually break down ; an overbearing side - effect of the human element at play .
Without getting into personal characteristics of specific individuals , we know that humans are morally sound and unsound , sharing and selfish , considerate and rude , amicable and violent .
Depending on the situation , these characteristics could be found in the same individual or entire organizations and even countries .
We also know that most people would do whatever is necessary to benefit themselves and their groups .
However , doing so often inconveniences other groups and breaks the rules of the system .
Keep in mind , the system could be foreign exchange markets or the restaurant tip jar where some people are bound to twist the rules to help themselves while others are compelled to help others by giving up some of their own share .
The study of Game theory discusses possible outcomes of conflicts that occur between different agents .
" In strategic games , agents choose strategies which will maximize their return , given the strategies the other agents choose . "
While each situation needs a specific application of game theory to work well and give appropriate results , there are more underlying assumptions in real - life than the simple " maximize personal return " hypothesis that traditional game theory considers .
If our goal is to design a leak - proof system , we have to know the foundation on which it will be built .
Considering that a leak - proof solution to a specific system involving humans could be reduced to any other system involving humans and thus have the ability to eliminate world hunger , poverty , environmental disasters , territorial wars , road rage , and long lines at the grocery store , I presume that the desire to come up with such a solution is global and intimately human .
Once we have a list of the human flaws , our eventual goal should be to recreate everything such that the most amount of good comes out , despite everything bad that will certainly happen .
In other words , we wish to devise a solution to every problem in the guaranteed presence of Murphy 's Law .
The strongest of human characteristics is greed or the desire to maximize personal benefit .
We all want good things to happen to us .
Be it money , praise , passion , or enlightenment , we want more of what we feel is good .
Some of us , very rarely all of us , will break the rules to help ourselves at the expense of others .
The harm caused to others , be it publicly visible or remain anonymous , some percentage of the population will abuse the trust put upon their shoulders .
A system that expects every person to be completely faithful and trustworthy will thus certainly fail .
This is why billions of dollars in monetary aid go missing as soon as they hit African governments ' bank accounts .
Our entire concept of charity expects the kind , altruistic people to trust strangers in power to help strangers in need .
The amount of charity that reaches the ones in need is thus inversely proportional to the amount of human greed .
We cannot easily reduce the amount of greed so what we should do , is minimize our reliance on honesty for a system to work .
How would one change a system to reduce dishonesty ?
Take the example of construction contract bids , i.e. tenders .
If a local government wants a bridge built and wants to maximize public benefit , it can appear to do so by asking for anonymous bids from construction companies and selecting the bid with the lowest cost .
However , that will not maximize public benefit as a construction company can drastically undercut their asking price by using inferior material that can cause the entire bridge to fail in years .
So a better solution is to stipulate that the contract will be awarded to the second lowest bid .
Now the company cannot quote a price so low that they will assuredly win , thus encouraging all the bidders to give more realistic cost estimates .
There is certainly a loophole in this system too , as a company can simply put in a very low bid as before and have another sister company bid even lower .
Thus they can ensure the lowest bid and the second lowest bid .
The real - life solution to this has been mired in volumes of government regulations preventing this exact scenario , along with millions of possible underhanded tricks .
Nevertheless , this entire system is built upon the citizens entrusting the local government to trust a construction company , and thus is subject to every single bit of greed faced by the aforementioned charity donations by altruistic individuals to African nations .
The true solution is to minimize the reliance on greed .
For the local government , it might be in the best public interest , even though more expensive , to award the contract to the median bidder as that value is much more difficult to game .
To help the developing nations , developed nations can make larger contributions in the form of education , access to better healthcare , enabling free trade , and building infrastructure instead of simply wiring billions to unmonitored bank accounts .
This brings us to another powerful human lacking , inadequate knowledge .
Call it ignorance , lack of education , or just plain stupidity , a system will succumb to idiocy without relent .
Thus any system that expects all parties to be educated and fully understand the consequences of their actions , will be prone to failure .
Information Economics deals with information asymmetry where one party has more information than the other and tries to devise " fair " solutions to such problems .
However , there are numerous problems where having more information is not always as large of a benefit as one might assume .
Take driving on the highways for instance .
If people would just stop driving like idiots , there would be far fewer fatalities .
In spite of the many experienced drivers , the few poor drivers can ruin it for every single driver on the road in a matter of seconds .
To minimize fatalities , we have numerous laws in place to minimize idiocy - from limits on alcohol content within the blood stream to minimum age rules for various driving privileges .
Note that while all attempts are made to discourage bad drivers from driving , the system still relies on people being good drivers and hence prone to accidents .
A futuristic solution to this problem could be automated driving where you would punch in your destination and the car would drive itself .
What amazes me is that such a system , which can cost a lot initially but completely eliminate accidents by inebriated or inexperienced drivers , is possible to put into place in the near future yet very few care about it .
Though the automated driving software itself would never be perfect , it would improve with time , as most automated systems do .
Put in a backup system with fail - safe mechanism and personal transportation can be a thousand - fold safer .
So why is it not in place yet ?
That 's the third deep - seated human defect , aversion to change or inflexibility .
Most working systems are designed with the foresight that they are not immune to abuse and hence expect timely changes to be incorporated to ensure consistent functioning .
A good example is the US Constitution that was adopted over two hundred years ago and has had twenty - seven amendments to date .
Even though constitutional amendments seek to maximize public benefit and limit abuse of power , nearly every amendment was met with vehement opposition , be it the 13th amendment that abolished slavery or the 19th amendment that gave equal voting rights to women - people just do n't want things to change , even if it is for the greater good .
While such an important set of rules supported by a strong central government can indeed work , it is nevertheless difficult to bring about changes because various segments of population have vested interests in maintaining the status quo .
The ones in power strive to remain in power .
Any system that requires new rules to be created in order to prevent abuse will fail when the new rules have to be approved and enforced by the same bodies that are abusing the system or benefiting from the underlying asymmetries .
The US Constitution thus defined three branches , Legislative , Executive , and Judicial , each of which had specific and limited powers .
The system would work as long as all the branches worked independently of each other and maintained a system of checks and balances to ensure no single branch abused its powers .
The entire system will be prone to failure if the executive branch manages to incapacitate the judicial branch by planting personnel in key positions who refuse to prosecute members of the executive branch under any circumstances , especially if at least half the legislative branch is under the influence of executive branch .
Alas , I can offer no instantaneous solution to such a dilemma , primarily because of the tremendously powerful vested interests that are averse to any changes away from the status quo .
In addition to greed , lack of information , and aversion to change , in almost all clashes , there are ingrained human emotions at play , often irrational at face - value and based more on belief and less on logic .
How do you create a better healthcare system if religious beliefs dictate surgery is immoral and therefore to be avoided ?
While this may seem like a minor , inconsequential blemish in the human psyche , a system that requires everyone to make rational decisions will indeed fail when a considerable percentage of the population does not make the rational decision .
The fundamental basis of microeconomics , political science , as well as sociology is rational choice theory , which assumes that " individuals choose the best action according to stable preference functions and constraints facing them , " that is , people will weigh the different options and pick the ones that they can afford to derive the most benefit from .
While " proponents of rational choice models do not claim that a model 's assumptions are a full description of reality , " when trying to construct and deploy actual systems in real life , we need the assumption to be true , otherwise the system that relies on rational choices , will fail .
In theory , rational choice is easier to describe .
If I get a less strenuous job with more pay and higher level of job satisfaction , it would be a rational choice for me to switch , unless I had other reasons to stay in my current position , like better scope of advancement in the future .
Irrationality can also be rationalized in this sense by noting that if the new job was in Colorado and I love all states that begin with the letter C and end with the letter O , I can derive a higher level of satisfaction by moving there .
Realistically speaking , that 's a pretty irrational reason to move , but it can still be supported by a loose application of rational choice theory .
In practice though , the very definition of rational is subject to debate .
What is rational and obvious to one set of people may seem irrational and delirious to another .
Who are we to legislate whether someone 's belief in surgery being immoral is rational or not , they certainly think it 's rational .
Think of any problem in your life , family , company , community , society , country , or even the entire world .
Our solution to solve problems has always been to put carefully crafted systems in place .
Remember that all systems will be met with ( 1 ) human greed , ( 2 ) ignorance , ( 3 ) inflexibility , and ( 4 ) irrationality .
Now try to solve your problem WITHOUT requiring any of these four human conditions to be solved first .
The perfect solution would be one that bypasses these limitations i.e. does not rely on solving any of them first .
The scale of the problem is inconsequential for I believe that if you can solve the problem of neighbors with loud , booming speakers without giving them anything in exchange , without educating them on the virtues of silence , without providing them with headphones , or without making them truly understand how their careless behavior is affecting your emotional well - being , I can expand your solution to bring about world peace .
Calling the cops on them wo n't be a good solution as they are already aware of their loudness and ignore it , thereby proving they are selfish and ignorant of others ' concerns .
It is possible to bring about world peace by enriching the needy , educating the masses , encouraging development growth and change , and eliminating aspects of fundamentalism and irrationality from the human personality .
We can reduce and minimize pollution the same way , by discouraging corporate greed that favors cheaper dumping methods instead of costlier waste - management , explaining the long - term ill - effects of pollution , replacing fossil - fuels by renewable sources of energy , and minimizing the spread of extravagantly polluting devices like oversized vehicles for personal use .
The bright side to this dismal discourse is that not every problem requires all four aspects of human condition to be solved .
Bringing about gender and racial equality required changes to social norms and eradication of irrational intolerance but barely had anything to do with human greed .
Consequently , even if we can't eliminate human greed or educate every person , we can still solve a lot of problems .
Education in itself is a problem , and the education system can be improved by social changes that promote intellectualism instead of wealth or power .
Problems in education cannot be fixed by trying to provide more rigorous education or making promises of monetary or political grandeur .
If you see a problem , identify which of the four human deficiencies you are up against and try to tackle each of them individually , instead of calling for a patchwork of remedies that is akin to putting a bandage on an organ failure .
If you ever feel ambitious and philosophical enough , go ahead and try to come up with a leak - proof system for resolving human struggles that does not rely on any of the four human shortcomings to be solved first .
A Nobel peace prize would be the least you would deserve .

The photos you see here show you what will happen if we nuke Iran .
We will maim and murder countless Asians from Iran to Japan .
We will poison the soil , the crops , the cattle , the people , for generations to come .
The reason the catastrophe will be so immense is because our nuclear missiles will be vaporizing nuclear sites .
When these sites are vaporized , all the enriched uranium and plutonium stockpiled there will be shot into the atmosphere as " weaponized " particles , along with the radioactive particles from the warheads themselves .
These radioactive particles will then be carried eastward by the jet stream and the trade winds across Afghanistan , Pakistan , and the other " stans , " to India , China , and Japan — producing what Truman long ago described as " a rain of ruin from the air " the like of which the world has never seen .
For these deadly , life - deforming particles can be absorbed through the skin and inhaled through the lungs .
They can also poison all forms of food and water , mother 's milk , and men 's semen .
They can even poison people 's tears .
Imagine such a thing .
On that terrible day when our missiles strike , pictures from the past like the one above and this one will be etched again in human flesh .
And those of us in America who manage to see these horrific images will finally come to understand that the neocons have conned the good American people into committing the most monstrous of crimes — all for sake of keeping nuclear weapons from falling into the " wrong " hands , they say — when we are the only nation to have used such weapons !
Experts debate what the " blowback " of our nuking Iran will be .
I say we shall reap the whirlwind .
As the death clouds created by our missiles move remorselessly across the face of Asia , cities will riot .
Whole nations will erupt .
Puppet governments from Morocco to Malaysia will fall in a hail of bricks and bullets .
American businesses will be burnt to the ground .
American tourists will be lynched in the streets .
And with Pakistan 's nuclear missiles now in the hands of radiation - poisoned men with dead and dying parents , wives , and children , who knows where the next mushroom clouds will be ?
What is certain is that China and Japan will instantly dump all of their dollars on what remains of the world money market before an evil American cloud brings death , destruction , and deformity raining down on their own populations .
And that dumping of trillions of dollars of American debt will mean the end of the American economy as we know it .
In the flash of a nuclear blast , we will be like Germany at the end of World War I .
And then , God save us … and forgive us … all .
I am a senior psychologist .
I am a tough - minded scientist .
And this is what the facts of psychology and science tell me will happen if we let Our Fearless Leader nuke Iran .
If I am wrong , let the neocons prove me wrong .
Let them prove to you and me and all the world that nuking nuclear sites will not create the kind of death clouds I have described .
The burden of proof rests with them , not me .
And it is a burden measured in millions of innocent lives .
Watch Dr. Helen Caldicott 's excellent video lecture on the subject at GlobalResearch.ca and see if you agree .
If the evidence she presents there convinces you , then join me in urging voices of reason like Ron Paul of the need to mount a media campaign to show the American people what Orwellian words like " collateral damage " and the " nuclear option " really mean in flesh - and - blood terms .
What they mean to me is the murder and mutilation of millions — like the victims shown here .
In the words of Ronald Reagan , this is a " wall " we must we “ tear down . ”
It is a wall of deadly , deadening , fascist , racist , Orwellian words , designed to disguise and dehumanize the enormity of the atrocities now being actively , openly planned by the Pentagon .
Unless " we the people " come together and say together in compassionate rage , " Not in our name ! " — the images we see on this page today will be those we wake to tomorrow .

The Best of William Wedin
In the time - honoured Register tradition of offering terrorists top tips * on how to bring down airliners , we 'd like this afternoon to draw al - Qaeda 's attention to two possible ways of getting binary liquid explosives through security : gel - filled bras and KY Jelly .
Both , according to the US 's Transport Security Administration list , are permitted items .
Here 's the full run-down :
Small amounts of baby formula and breast milk if a baby or small child is travelling
Liquid prescription medicine with a name that matches the passenger 's ticket
Up to 5 oz . ( 148 ml ) of liquid or gel low blood sugar treatment
Up to 4 oz . of essential non-prescription liquid medications including saline solution , eye care products and KY Jelly
Gel - filled bras and similar prostethics
Gel - filled wheelchair cushions
Life support and life sustaining liquids such as bone marrow , blood products , and transplant organs carried for medical reasons
Inclusion of gel - filled bras has a pretty simple explanation .
They 're commonly used as prosthetics for mastectomy patients , so there 's a personal dignity issue here .
Try this account of the indignity suffered by a 57 - year - old cancer survivor en route to Majorca who was told that her " gel - filled breast would need to be checked in with baggage " .
As for KY Jelly , well , we reckon it 's pretty essential for those passengers wishing to enjoy a " mile - high lube job " , but we think US officials should be aware that Jihadists could pack a standard tube with enough ricin to kill around four million guinea pigs .
To put it in perspective , that 's the equivalent of a six - foot - deep layer of dead guinea pigs covering an area the size of three football pitches .
It 's a chilling thought .
Closer inspection of the list raises further issues .
It 's to be applauded that mums are allowed to take a " small amount " of breast milk aboard , but we can only assume that if a heavily - lactating woman turned up at security , a specially - trained operative would be obliged to remove most of the milk from its containers .
If any reader knows where we can apply for that job , please let us know .
And as for " bone marrow and blood products " , try this :
Security operative : Good morning , sir .
Are you carrying any bone marrow and blood products ?
Passenger :
Yes , quite a large amount of yellow and red bone marrow and around 10 pints of blood .
Security operative : Can you confirm that they 're both for medical reasons ?
Passenger : Yes , I 'd be dead without them .
Security operative : Thank you , sir .
You can keep the KY jelly , by the way , but I 'm going to have to ask you to surrender the peanut butter and whipped cream .
Have a nice day .
In summary , then : passengers should be on the lookout for shifty - looking foreign blokes , especially if they speak some funny Arab - sounding lingo , are wearing gel - filled bras and nervously fingering tubes of KY Jelly .
The future of western civilisation may depend on your vigilance . ®

Japanese national newspapers warn people that watching a new Hollywood drama can make its viewers feel sick .
The warnings are published on request of Gaga Communications , the movie 's Japanese distributor .
Babel , a Golden Globe and Academy Award winning 2006 multi-narrative drama , was released in Japan on April 28 .
Since then the movie 's distributors have received complaints from at least 15 people who felt ill while watching the drama , starring Brad Pitt , Cate Blancett and Rinko Kikuchi .
Babel caused a media sensation in Japan long before its release .
Rinko Kikuchi , Japanese actress , was nominated for an Oscar for her brilliant performance in the movie .
Rinko played a deaf - mute teenager schoolgirl .
Besides the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , she was also nominated for several other prestigious awards , including the Gotham Award and the National Board of Review Award .
Rinko Kikuchi has become the first Japanese actress to be nominated for an academy award in the period of 49 years .
No wonder the Babel movie attracted great interest of many Japanese people .
But one scene in the drama has made some Japanese viewers queasy .
It shows Kikuchi 's character visiting a night - club with strobe lights flashing for about a minute .
The movie distributors had to publish special warnings at their website and in newspapers , as well as on posters of about 300 movie - theaters .
The Babel movie has already been released in about 40 countries but there have been no reports about the similar cases .
The symptoms described by some of the movie 's viewers remind the situation in 1997 when an episode in the Japanese cartoon Pokemon with a scene featuring flashing lights made hundreds of people complain they suffered dizziness , nausea and even convulsions .

The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum , where the writer lived and worked for 10 years , has been locked in a dispute over its feline residents with the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , which says the cats should be caged .
The federal government claims the museum is an " exhibitor " of cats and needs a special licence to keep them ( find out more about the cats here ) .
However , the Key West city commission backed the Hemingway Home 's claim that the cats are not exhibits and exempted it from a city law prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household .
The exemption , granted last week , states : " The cats reside on the property just as [ they ] did in the time of Hemingway himself .
" They are not on exhibition in the manner of circus animals .
The city commission finds that the family of polydactyl Hemingway cats are indeed animals of historic , social and tourism significance ... an integral part of the history and ambiance of the Hemingway House " .
The UDSA was not available to comment on the city commission 's ruling .
The museum is home to around 50 cats descended from a six - toed cat called Snowball , given to the Nobel prize - winning author by a ship 's captain in the 30s .
The legal dispute began in 2003 after the Florida Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raised concerns about the cats ' welfare with the federal government , the Miami Herald reported .
The 1966 Animal Welfare
Act requires a licence for zoos , circuses and magicians or anyone who used animals in their acts or advertisements .
The six - toed cats feature prominently on the museum 's website , but do not perform .
In January , the museum took the USDA to court in a bid to end the dispute , but the judge ruled that the two sides should reach an agreement .
The department and the museum are due in court again once a cat behaviour expert has assessed the felines later this month , the Miami Herald said .
All the animals carry the gene for six toes , but not all display the trait .
Normal cats have five front toes and four back toes .
Around half the cats at the Hemingway house are polydactyl , meaning they have extra toes .
They sometimes appear to be wearing mittens because they seem to have a thumb on their paw , according to the museum .
Hemingway worked on the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls and short stories including The Snows of Kilimanjaro while he lived at the house , at 907 Whitehead Street in the heart of Old Town Key West .
I ’m at the point of changing jobs , which usually gets me thinking deep ( ish ) thoughts about what I want out of my next job .
I ’m sure most people ask themselves the question , from time to time , “ What am I doing with my life ? ”
Why am I stuck in this dead end job ?
Do n’t I deserve better ?
Why are n’t I writing that great novel ?
I should be trekking the Himalayas .
I ’ve never been to Paris in the springtime .
I work in IT and in the IT world we seem to be constantly asking ourselves “ Why are n’t I working on the next killer app that will change the world ? ”
Most of the literature I ’ve read on this subject seems to contain the implicit message “ It ’s because you suck . ”
True , I have n’t found anyone honest enough to actually phrase it that way .
But the consistent message I ’ve seen is you are n’t achieving greatness because you are n’t trying hard enough .
To an extent , that ’s true but if you really look at it as a logical proposition , in many cases it simply does n’t hold up .
Greatness is a comparative term – high achievers look good because their accomplishments are so far above everybody else ’s .
If everyone moves closer to greatness , the measure of what is great moves further away by definition .
Even if everyone continually improves , only a small percentage will ever be regarded as truly great because they ’re great in comparison to everyone else .
This does n’t excuse willfully mediocre ( or worse ) behaviour but I am calling into question the attitude that “ I will not be happy unless I am the greatest in my chosen field . ”
It ’s good to aspire to improve but is there really any value in continually obsessing about being the best ?
The unavoidable outcome of this type of thinking is 98 % of us are going to end up disappointed .
I ’m sure this attitude exists in every field of endeavour but it seems more prevalent in the IT industry than others .
I remember a quote from the late 90 ’s dotcom boom that the speaker doubtless thought was insightful and inspirational : “ I do n’t want my obituary to say :
He improved the company ’s e-commerce efficiency by 5 % ”
That sort of fatuousness really pisses me off .
The only thing that pisses me off more is someone in a black turtle - neck and trendy glasses telling me the reason I think their concept sucks is because “ I do n’t get it . ”
When you look at it objectively , at least 8 out of 10 of IT jobs are limited to this sort of “ 5 % improvement ” achievement .
IT development is n’t a never - ending series of epiphanies and flashes of brilliance .
For most people , most of the time , it ’s a long , slow grind .
If more and more people achieve what they thought would be “ life changing ” moments then these achievements would actually lose value .
Less and less things will seem like they actually are life changing .
At some point , this perpetual urging towards greatness crosses over from being inspirational / aspirational to being downright cruel .
I think everyone should always be looking for ways to improve and even the crappiest job can give a sense of satisfaction if done well .
But face it – we are n’t all going down in history and that fact alone should n’t make us feel like failures .
I like reading articles that show a “ best of the best ” approach being deployed in the real world to impressive effect .
I ’m not a complete cynic – I actually enjoy being inspired .
At the smaller end of town , I ’ve long been a fan of Joel Spolsky ’s website .
His posts on hiring processes at his company show a very well thought out way to get what he sees as the best people working for him .
A post from Steve Yegge shows this quest for excellence being deployed on a huge scale at Google .
It starts off by slagging off Agile development ( which is really funny if you ’re a nerd like me ) but the meat of it is a description of working practices at Google .
While Yegge ’s piece is among my favourite pieces of writing on software development , it ’s also a little depressing .
Just coming to terms with how far my work environment is from Google is tough .
I ’m not motivated enough to get a job at Google ( arguably I ’m not talented enough but I prefer to live in denial ) and very few other workplaces will ever be run in a similar manner to Google .
When I read of the “ perks ” etc at Google it really seemed that these were fundamental to their success .
Google is n’t successful in spite of their programmers being spoiled ( by most corporate standards ) , Google is successful because their programmers are spoiled ( some say they are babied and become dependent on Google – a smart HR practice if you ask me ) .
This sort of treatment is never going to be widespread , not because it is n’t economically viable ( Yegge paints a convincing portrait of this as Google ’s very reason for economic success ) but because most workplaces suck .
Most bosses simply could n’t stand treating IT staff that well and no amount of cost / benefit analysis will convince them otherwise .
The majority of IT workers will have experienced resentment from both management and non-IT staff .
Sometimes it ’s implicit , sometimes it ’s overt : “ why are you complaining ?
You already earn more than everybody else . ”
This is despite the fact that basic economics shows that a worker is unlikely to be paid well if they do n’t provide commensurate economic benefit to the company ( I ’m talking workers , not management ) .
Google looks like the decadence of ancient Rome to tight - fisted employers .
In the end , not only are most of us not going to be as spoiled as Google workers , we wo n’t change the world either .
A far more sensible approach would be to have realistic workplace goals and maybe even look for fulfillment outside of work ( god forbid ! )
I recommend starting a snarky blog where you lash out at everything that makes you angry .
Not enough people are blogging </ sarcasm >
I know many people would argue that we should always aim for lofty goals no matter how unrealistic they are .
After all , is n’t it better to try and fail than to never make the attempt ?
I ’ll repeat my earlier point ; I ’m not actively encouraging people to be deliberately mediocre .
But is n’t someone who sets realistic goals and maybe even helps improve the life of one or two people going to be more fulfilled than someone who spends their whole life following a series of doomed , quixotic quests to save the world ?
If you have it in you to be one of the very top performers in your chosen field then it ’s a waste to not aim for the very pinnacle .
I ’m a big believer in setting goals that are outside your comfort zone – you ’re never going to reach your potential without setting a few goals that scare you .
But who exactly is served if we set ourselves goals that are so far beyond what is realistically achievable we spend our lives feeling like miserable failures ?
Either we find a way to make a “ mediocre ” career with average achievements a great career or the vast majority of us are doomed to a life of disappointment .
U.S. courts are weighing in with opinions :
The 10th Circuit ’s recent 2 - 1 decision in U.S. v. Andrus , No. 06-3094 ( April 25 , 2007 ) , recognized for the first time that a password - protected computer is like a locked suitcase or a padlocked footlocker in a bedroom .
The digital locks raise the expectation of privacy by the owner .
The majority nonetheless refused to suppress the evidence .
The case was a first for the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , and only two other circuits have touched on the issue , the 4th and 6th circuits .
The 10th Circuit held that although password - protected computers command a high level of privacy , the legitimacy of a search turns on an officer ’s belief that the third party had authority to consent .
Excellent commentary from Jennifer Granick :
The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits warrantless searches of an individual ’s home or possessions .
There is an exception to the warrant requirement when someone consents to the search .
Consent can be given by the person under investigation , or by a third party with control over or mutual access to the property being searched .
Because the Fourth Amendment only prohibits “ unreasonable searches and seizures , ” permission given by a third party who lacks the authority to consent will nevertheless legitimize a warrantless search if the consenter has “ apparent authority , ” meaning that the police reasonably believed that the person had actual authority to control or use the property .
Under existing case law , only people with a key to a locked closet have apparent authority to consent to a search of that closet .
Similarly , only people with the password to a locked computer have apparent authority to consent to a search of that device .
In Andrus , the father did not have the password ( or know how to use the computer ) but the police say they did not have any reason to suspect this because they did not ask and did not turn the computer on .
Then , they used forensic software that automatically bypassed any installed password .
The majority held that the police officers not only were n’t obliged to ask whether the father used the computer , they had no obligation to check for a password before performing their forensic search .
In dissent , Judge Monroe G. McKay criticized the agents ’ intentional blindness to the existence of password protection , when physical or digital locks are such a fundamental part of ascertaining whether a consenting person has actual or apparent authority to permit a police search .
“ ( T ) he unconstrained ability of law enforcement to use forensic software such at the EnCase program to bypass password protection without first determining whether such passwords have been enabled … dangerously sidestep (s ) the Fourth Amendment . ”
[…]
If courts are going to treat computers as containers , and if owners must lock containers in order to keep them private from warrantless searches , then police should be required to look for those locks .
Password protected computers and locked containers are an inexact analogy , but if that is how courts are going to do it , then its inappropriate to diminish protections for computers simply because law enforcement chooses to use software that turns a blind eye to owners ’ passwords .
Exposure to particles of depleted uranium ( DU ) , the source of growing international concern as a potential health hazard , may increase the risk of genetic damage and lung cancer , scientists in Maine conclude in a report scheduled for the May 21 issue of ACS ' Chemical Research in Toxicology , a monthly journal .
DU is the material remaining after removal or depletion of the U - 238 isotope of uranium .
With a density about twice that of lead , DU is ideal for use in military armor and munitions , John Pierce Wise , Sr. , and colleagues point out in the new study .
DU dust produced in combat creates potentially frequent and widespread exposure for soldiers and non-combatants , who may inhale DU dust particles , the researchers note .
However , there have been few studies on the health effects of lung exposure to DU , they add .
In the new study , researchers tested the effects of DU on cultures of human lung cells .
" This is the first article on the cytotoxicity and clastogenicity [ chromosome damaging potential ] of particulate and soluble DU in human bronchial cells , " the study states .
" These data suggest that exposure to particulate DU may pose a significant genotoxic risk and could possibly result in lung cancer . "
My good friends Claudio Russo and Andrew Kennedy have been kind enough to send me a draft paper about Generalized Algebraic Data Types ( GADTs ) and Object - Oriented Programming .
GADTs generalize the datatypes of ML and Haskell by permitting constructors to produce different type - instantiations of the same datatype .
One of Andrew and Claudio ’s examples is a slightly modified version of Peter Sestoft ’s example of representing abstract syntax trees for typed expressions in Generic C# .
To get a better feeling of the difference between the generics in C# / Java and the generics in C++
I have rewritten the the example in C ++.
To recap the example : we want to represent abstract syntax trees for a tiny language of simple expressions .
Futhermore , we want representation to be type safe .
That is , we do not want to be able to represent the nonsense expression “ true + 42 “ .
We shall represent the abstract syntax trees the standard OO way with an abstract base class Exp for the general type of expressions and the concreate subclasses for each node type .
To enforce the type safety of our embedded language we use generics .
That is , a value with type Exp < R > is an abstract syntax tree for an expression that evaluates to a value of type R .
First the base class .
Peter ’s Generic C# version :
abstract class Exp < R > { // R = result type abstract public R eval ( ) ; }
C++ version :
template < typename R > // R = result type class Exp { public : virtual R eval ( ) const = 0 ; virtual ~ Exp ( ) {} } ;
Note that in C++ we need to remember to define a virtual destructor because we plan to inherit from Exp and we also want to be able to dynamically allocate subclasses of Exp .
Next up is the class for literals .
Peter ’s Generic C# version :
class Lit< R> : Exp < R> { private readonly R v ; public Lit( R v) { this .v = v ; } public override R eval ( ) { return v ; } }
C++ version :
template < typename R > class Lit : public Exp < R> { public : virtual R eval ( ) const { return val ; } explicit Lit( R val_ ) : val ( val_ ) {} private : R const val ; } ;
No surprises here .
But for binary expressions like plus , for instances , it starts to get a bit more tricky .
Here I ’ll use a simpler version of the class for representing plus nodes than the version Peter uses .
Generic C# version :
class Plus : Exp<int > { private readonly Exp<int > lhs , rhs ; public Plus ( Exp < int > lhs , Exp< int > rhs ) { this .lhs = lhs ; this .rhs = rhs ; } public override int eval ( ) { return lhs.eval ( ) + rhs.eval ( ) ; } }
First cut at a C++ version :
class Plus : public Exp<int > { public : virtual int eval ( ) const { return lhs.eval ( ) + rhs.eval ( ) ; } explicit Plus ( Exp < int > const lhs_ , Exp<int > const rhs_ ) : lhs ( lhs_ ) , rhs ( rhs_ ) {} private : Exp<int > lhs , rhs ; } ;
Alas , this is not valid C++ because we are not allowed to declare fields and parameters of type Exp< int > because this class has an abstract virtual function , namely eval ( and besides if we could , for example by modifying the class Exp , the code would not do what we expects ) .
These problems has nothing to do with the generics in C++ , they are just the usual C++ OO quirks .
And the solution is straightforward : we must use a pointer to values of type Exp .
But then we have to make decisions about ownership : should we make a deep copy of subexpressions ?
should we share subexpressions ?
and if so who should take take of freeing resources ?
should we use ref counting ?
or what ?
Here we shall just use one of the the wonderful smart pointers from Boost : shared_ptr which will take care of the refcounting and deletion of expressions .
Thus , first we make a couple of convenient typedefs for integer expressions and shared pointers to integer expressions ( and similar for boolean expressions ) :
typedef Exp < int > IntExp ; typedef boost :: shared_ptr< IntExp > IntExpPtr ;
Then the class for plus nodes looks like this :
class Plus : public IntExp { public : virtual int eval ( ) const { return lhs -> eval ( ) + rhs ->eval ( ) ; } explicit Plus( IntExpPtr const & lhs_ , IntExpPtr const & rhs_ ) : lhs ( lhs_ ) , rhs ( rhs_ ) {} private : IntExpPtr lhs , rhs ; } ;
and a wrapper for constructing shared pointers for new plus expressions :
IntExpPtr plus( IntExpPtr const & lhs , IntExpPtr const & rhs ) { return IntExpPtr ( new Plus ( lhs , rhs ) ) ; }
Similar to the Plus class we can define a class for representing condtional expressions :
Generic C# version :
class Cond< R> : Exp < R> { private readonly E< bool > cond ; private readonly E < R > truth , falsehood ; public Cond ( E< bool > cond , E < R > truth , E < R> falsehood ) { this .
cond = cond ; this .
truth = truth ; this .
falsehood = falsehood ; } public override R eval ( ) { return cond.eval ( ) ? truth.eval ( ) : falsehood.eval ( ) ; } }
C++ version :
template < typename R > class Cond : public Exp < R> { public : typedef boost :: shared_ptr< Exp < R> > SubExpPtr ; virtual R eval ( ) const { return cond->eval ( ) ? truth ->eval ( ) : falsehood -> eval ( ) ; } explicit Cond( BoolExpPtr const & cond_ , SubExpPtr const & truth_ , SubExpPtr const & falsehood_ ) : cond( cond_ ) , truth ( truth_ ) , falsehood ( falsehood_ ) {} private : BoolExpPtr cond ; SubExpPtr truth , falsehood ; } ;
The interesting things to note about this class are that Cond contains subexpressions of different types , that Cond is polymorphic in the result type , that Cond enforces that the two branches of a condtional expression must have the same type , and the only one of the branchs is evaluated based on the evaluation of the condition .
Using these classes we can define a function that builds an expression for calculating the n‘th fibonacci number :
IntExpPtr fib( int n ) { IntExpPtr fib0 ( lit( 0 ) ) , fib1 ( lit ( 1 ) ) ; switch ( n ) { case 0 : return fib0 ; case 1 : return fib1 ; default : for ( int i = 1 ; i != n ; ++i ) { IntExpPtr tmp( fib1 ) ; fib1 = plus ( fib0 , fib1 ) ; fib0 = tmp ; } return fib1 ; } }
This function builds an expression that takes linear , O ( n ) , space , but it will use exponential time , O ( 2n ) , to be evaluated .
Conclusion
Non-surprising this GADT example can be translated more or less straight forward from generinc C# to C ++.
The things that are a bit tedious are just the normal C++ oddities and has nothing to do with generics .
In fact , we would have had the exact same problems without generics .
You know how most people put a tie around their knob or a " Do Not Disturb " sign to ensure privacy ?
Well designer Arnaud Lapierre decided that was n't enough , so he put together the Doorknob Condition , which is a doorknob that uses a pulley system to retract the entire doorknob , preventing anybody from getting in without breaking down the door .
Although I still prefer my method of keeping people out : building the door out of a giant angry bear .

" It 's time we stopped just saying he should apologise .
It is time the Islamic community did more then say they were horrified .
I think it is time he left . "
Treasurer Peter Costello said comparing women to uncovered meat invites people to treat them in a degrading and dehumanising way .
" This is totally unacceptable .
This is comparing women to uncovered meat , '' Mr Costello told the Seven Network .
" We really need political leaders to speak out against it .
" But I hope that the moderate Muslim leaders will speak out today and condemn these comments .
" Make it clear to Muslims that this is not the view of Islam and that they will really take some kind of action to disassociate themselves from the comments which Sheik Alhilali has made .
Health Minister Tony Abbott echoed the Treasurer 's comments .
" Certainly I think if a religious leader in the Catholic Church or the Anglican Church or in Judaism was to make these sorts of statements , they would be getting a very severe rap over the knuckles , at the very least , '' he told the Nine Network this morning .
" He 's wrong .
He should be reprimanded and it's up to ordinary , decent Australians to make it clear that he is wrong .
Sheik Alhilali's comments were delivered in a Ramadan sermon to 500 worshippers in Sydney last month , a News Ltd newspaper reported .
" If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside on the street , or in the the garden or in the park , or in the backyard without a cover , and the cats come and eat it ... whose fault is it , the cats ' or the uncovered meat , " he said in the sermon .
" The uncovered meat is the problem .
" If she was in her room , in her home , in her hajib ( Islamic headdress ) , no problem would have occurred . "
Ms Goward said this was an ugly comparison and that was vile enough .
She said the real issue was that he was excusing Muslim men for crimes against women on the grounds that women asked for it .
Ms Goward said Australia had moved on from that thinking a long time ago .
" I repeat , I think it was time he was asked to go and I would encourage the authorities to consider whether a man who incites young Muslim men to crime , because that is essentially what he has done , should be allowed to stay , " she said .
" This is encouraging young men to a violent crime on the basis that it is okay because it is there , it is the women 's fault .
This is against Australian law . "
Ms Goward said she was unaware of the conditions under which the sheik was in Australia .
" We have got past the stage of everybody rushing around being upset and saying he should apologise and the Islamic community understandably and rightly being annoyed and embarrassed , " she said .
" If we are really serious about Islamic and Islamic Australia being part of Australia , then I think there has got to be a bit more leadership shown and he has got to leave .
" The next step is for the authorities to consider whether somebody who incites from a position of very important leadership in that community ... ought to go .
I do n't know his visa arrangements , I do n't know the status of his citizenship and that might be more difficult . "
Sheik Alhihali told the Australian that he only meant to refer to prostitutes as meat , and not any scantily clad woman without a hijab .

Weir even tried to upgrade , but had a compatibility issue :
One of the great paradoxes of physics is that while gravity was the first force in nature to be described physically and mathematically — Isaac Newton worked out its basic laws more than 300 years ago — it may be the last to be understood .
Generations of physicists have remained stumped by the utter strangeness of gravity :
Not only is it the weakest of the four natural forces , but it is also the only one that appears to be directly related to the nature of space and time .
Still , theorists steadfastly continue to wrestle with the problem , dreaming up extra dimensions or , as in Mordehai Milgrom 's case , proposing new versions of Newton 's classic equations .
Much of today 's confusion about gravity is the fault of that brilliant troublemaker Albert Einstein .
In his greatest work , the 1915 general theory of relativity , he demonstrated that , unlike the other three forces , gravity is intimately coupled to the fabric of space .
The remaining ones — electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces — merely describe how objects move through space .
Gravity relates to the properties and dynamics of space itself , which can respond to the presence of matter by curving , expanding , and contracting .
What we observe as a gravitational pull between objects is actually , according to Einstein , the result of an underlying curvature in three - dimensional space .
This curvature becomes apparent only when the objects are very massive , so it is not surprising that it went undetected until 1919 , when Sir Arthur Eddington and his team announced they had verified Einstein 's prediction that the sun 's gravitational field would bend light .
The uniquely geometric nature of gravity has made it frustratingly difficult to contain within the same framework as the laws governing subatomic phenomena , namely quantum mechanics .
This problem has prompted physicists to consider extreme solutions , including the possibility that our three - dimensional universe is but the tip of a vast cosmic iceberg .
In this interpretation , the three dimensions we experience are merely an illusory front for a universe that may have between 6 and 22 additional hidden dimensions .
As far back as the 1920s , some physicists proposed that if gravity is related to a curvature in our three - dimensional universe , other forces in nature might result from curvature in as yet unseen dimensions .
Alternatively , in response to various astrophysical puzzles , other physicists , including Milgrom and his collaborator , Jacob Bekenstein , have argued that Newton 's laws , which describe motion in our solar system wonderfully well , break down on the scale of galaxies .
The other major conundrum that drives physicists to distraction is why gravity is so much weaker than all the other forces .
Physicist Richard Feynman illustrated the disparity with the following description :
If a man jumps out of a tall building , it may take gravity 200 feet to pull him down to the ground , but electromagnetism halts him in a fraction of an inch .
The electric repulsion between electrons surrounding separate atoms in his body and the concrete is so intense that it stops the falling body without so much as denting the concrete .
A great deal of current research in theoretical physics is motivated by a yearning to understand why gravity is so feeble .
Yet it is precisely this weakness that makes investigating new theories of gravity so difficult .
Producing detectable gravitational effects requires a great deal of matter or energy .
For instance , just as accelerating charges produce electromagnetic waves ( like visible light ) , accelerating masses should create gravitational waves — ripples in space .
Studying such waves would tell us a lot about how gravity works .
But because gravity is weak , only the most colossal cosmic events are likely to make waves that we can detect .
LIGO , the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory , is a pair of three - mile - long gravitational - wave detectors in Washington and Louisiana that cost $ 365 million and took 11 years to build , and yet they may just barely be able to pick up signals from the ultraviolent collisions that give birth to massive black holes .
Perhaps only when we study huge agglomerations of matter , in galaxies or clusters of galaxies , will we spot the elusive phenomena that can take us beyond Einstein and Newton .
This is why so much current research on gravity focuses on astrophysics and cosmology , the domains in which gravity is king .
As always , nature is mystifying .
Astronomical evidence gathered over the last 30 years suggests that most of the mass in our galaxy — indeed , in all galaxies — is invisible to telescopes and may comprise new forms of elementary particles .
In the past decade , we learned something even more astounding : that the overriding gravitational influence in the universe comes not from matter but from a mysterious form of energy that suffuses the emptiness of space .
This dark energy , as it is known , exerts an antigravitational impulse that appears to be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate .
We have no idea why it exists or why it has the value it does .
Each time we open a new window on the universe , we find surprises .
When we turn on the world 's largest particle accelerator — the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva — next year , will we open a portal into other dimensions ?
When we measure the forces between distant galaxies more accurately , will we find deviations from Newton 's laws , as Milgrom suggests ?
I would n't bet on either of these possibilities , but there is one bet that is easy to make :
Whatever surprises nature has in store for us , they are likely to involve gravity .
The four men are due to be sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court
Muktar Ibrahim , 29 , Yassin Omar , 26 , Ramzi Mohammed , 25 , and Hussain Osman , 28 , were found guilty on Monday .
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke said the four were " dedicated terrorists " who tried to repeat 7/7 .
The jury failed to reach a verdict on Adel Yahya , 24 , and Manfo Kwaku Asiedu , 34 , and they will discover on Wednesday if they face a retrial .
Woolwich Crown Court heard how the four men found guilty of conspiracy to murder had brought chaos to London following their attempt to bomb London Underground trains and a bus on 21 July 2005 - a fortnight on from the attack which claimed 52 lives .
Despite the carnage of 7 July , on 21 July the public responded courageously
DAC Peter Clarke
Mr Clarke , head of the Metropolitan Police 's Counter - Terrorism Command and National Co-ordinator of Terrorist Investigations , said the four had told " ridiculous lies " to escape justice .
He added : " These men obviously set out to replicate the horrors that had been inflicted on Londoners on 7 July 2005 .
" But no one will forget the impact or the consequences of what they did - coming just two weeks after 52 innocent people had been murdered by other terrorists .
" Despite the carnage of 7 July , on 21 July the public responded courageously , and without thought for their own safety .
He singled out off - duty firefighter Angus Campbell , 43 , who confronted Mohammed when his bomb failed to go off on board a crowded London Underground train , for his " incredible courage " .
Mr Yahya ( left ) and Mr Asiedu may face a retrial
Mr Justice Fulford , the trial judge , said he would sentence the guilty men after hearing mitigation from their lawyers .
He said the two remaining defendants would remain in custody for the time being .
A decision as to whether Asiedu and Yahya will face a retrial is expected to be made on Wednesday .
Mr Asiedu , of no fixed address , was accused of being the " fifth " bomber who dumped his device near Little Wormwood Scrubs on July 21 after losing his nerve .
He insisted the bombs were real , but that he was duped .
The prosecution claimed Mr Yahya of High Road , Tottenham , north London , was part of the " inner circle " of bombers .
But Mr Yahya denied all knowledge of the conspiracy .
Following the four guilty verdicts , questions were raised about the role of anti-terror police and the security services in the case .
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , said systemic failings allowed Muktar Ibrahim to attend a jihadi training camp in Pakistan while on bail in the UK .

I ’ve been a “ professional ” user - interface programmer for 20 years .
In that time I ’ve written a grand total of three little apps just for the fun of it .
Two of them I snuck in as hidden buttons in the Mathematica About Box , because it was just too difficult to start a new application from scratch .
All of them can be replicated in a few minutes using Version 6 .
In my experience , writing GUI ( graphical user interface ) applications in C or Java or Visual Basic — or whatever — is fine if you plan to spend weeks or months on a program , but prohibitively horrible if you really only have a few minutes to dedicate to the task .
You have to allocate windows , store pointers to them , then allocate controls or read them from some kind of resource file , store pointers to them , blah , blah , blah .
It might be two or three pages of code before you can even start thinking about what this program is actually supposed to do .
Cocoa and other such frameworks make it marginally easier .
I enjoyed programming in NeXTSTEP ( which is what Cocoa was called before Apple took over NeXT ) .
It ’s the environment in which I wrote RealTimeAlgebra in 1989 , the one just - for - fun app I wrote not as an About Box button .
( RealTimeAlgebra was basically what we now call Manipulate . )
But it is still a pain .
Instead of starting by writing pages of code to deal with windows , you start by using an annoying graphical tool to lay out controls and define who is connected to whom .
Then you get to write pages of code defining the actions of all these controls before you can start working on the actual content .
When I ’m working on a fun little app , I ’m like most other people who are not professional user - interface programmers .
I want to think about the subject matter , the content of my program , first .
I do n’t have hours to spend worrying about window pointers or event handlers .
If I want an interactive graphical tree to play with , I want to worry about the algorithm for defining the tree , not about how I ’m going to read mouse coordinates .
That is the great beauty of Mathematica : you get to start on the content right now .
Here ’s a little bit of Mathematica code that draws a pretty tree :
Graphics [ Map [ Line , NestList [ Flatten [ Map [ { { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + .7 RotationMatrix [.3 ] . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) } , { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + .7 RotationMatrix [-.3 ] . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) }} & , # ] , 1 ] & , {{{0 , - 1} , { 0 , 0}}} , 7 ] ] ]
I first wrote a version of this code in 1989 .
That version still works , but this is shorter because I ’ve gotten smarter in the meantime .
( The old version was pretty short too , by the way . )
Back in 1989 I had an idea that this would make a neat museum display .
Imagine a metal post with two arms forming a Y shape , like the trunk and first two branches of this tree .
Imagine that you can grab handles on the ends of the two branches and move them up and down , in and out , with some kind of telescoping mechanism .
Now imagine a huge video screen behind the stand with a tree like this waving back and forth based on the position you move the arms to ( recursively replicated in each successive generation of branches ) .
Kids would love it .
I really , really wanted to make an interactive version of this tree–one where you could drag the first branch point around and have all the other branches recursively follow .
This ended up as a secret button in the Mac version of Mathematica ’s About Box , involving hundreds of lines of C code .
Here is the same code for the tree made interactive using the Manipulate function .
In Mathematica or the free Mathematica Player , you can use those two Locator objects to manipulate the tree .
Notice that it ’s only a few lines longer than the non-interactive version :
Manipulate [ Module [{m1 = { Reverse[ pt1 ] , { - 1 , 1} pt1} , m2 = { Reverse [ pt2 ] , { - 1 , 1} pt2}} , Graphics [ Map [ Line , NestList [ Flatten [ Map [ { { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + m 1 . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) } , { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + m 2 . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) }} & , # ] , 1 ] & , {{{0 , - 1} , { 0 , 0}}} , 8 ] ] , PlotRange -> {{ - 3 , 3} , { - 1 , 5}} ] ] , {{pt1 , {- 0.25 , 0.75}} , { - 3 , 0} , { 3 , 6} , Locator} , {{pt2 , { 0.25 , 0.75}} , { - 3 , 0} , { 3 , 6} , Locator} ]
Now in fairness , the C - code version I wrote supported three features this version does not : it had lines that got thinner the farther out they went , it had seasonal colors and it had wind .
Without those features the C code might have been only 300 lines ( plus a few hundred more if I had n’t borrowed the framework of Mathematica ’s About Box to put it in ) .
Adding them to the Mathematica version does n’t make it a whole lot longer .
For example , here ’s a version with thinning and a Slider for the number of recursions :
Manipulate [ Module [{m1 = { Reverse[ pt1 ] , { - 1 , 1} pt1} , m2 = { Reverse [ pt2 ] , { - 1 , 1} pt2}} , Graphics [ MapIndexed [ {Thickness [ 0.01 th^ #2 [ [ 1 ] ] ] , Line [ # ]} & , NestList [ Flatten [ Map [ { { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + m 1 . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) } , { # [ [ 2 ] ] , # [ [ 2 ] ] + m 2 . ( # [ [ 2 ] ] - # [ [ 1 ] ] ) }} & , # ] , 1 ] & , {{{0 , - 1} , { 0 , 0}}} , gen ] ] , PlotRange -> {{ - 3 , 3} , { - 1 , 5}} ] ] , {{gen , 7 , " generations "} , 3 , 10 , 1} , {{th , 0.7 , " thickness ratio"} , 0.01 , 1.2} , {{pt1 , {- 0.25 , 0.75}} , { - 3 , 0} , { 3 , 6} , Locator} , {{pt2 , { 0.25 , 0.75}} , { - 3 , 0} , { 3 , 6} , Locator} ]
Unfortunately these versions , and my C - code version , suffer from one big problem : the mouse has only two degrees of freedom , while this example has four .
In the museum installation I imagined you would be able to move all four degrees of freedom simultaneously .
But guess what ?
With the Mathematica version of this code , I can plug in a dual - joystick gamepad , select the output , and the two joysticks automatically grab onto the two control points and let me control all four degrees of freedom simultaneously .
Totally automatic — not a single line of new code needed .
I do n’t even want to think about how hard it would be to write in gamepad support in the C - code version of my tree toy .
Do n’t even want to go there .
( And I deny any rumors that we added gamepad support to Mathematica just so that I ’d finally be able to see what this example feels like when you can control it properly . )
Sadly , no museum has yet built this exhibit , but since Mathematica started to become able to create this sort of interactive content , I ’ve written dozens and dozens of similar live interactive interfaces .
I would have done that years ago , but there was no tool in existence that made it possible .
“ Possible ? ” you say .
“ Surely it ’s possible in C code , or Java , or Visual Basic , or Squeak , or something . ”
Well , no , it ’s not possible for me in C or any other such serious environment , because I ’m busy and these are just fun little things .
If it ’s going to take hours or days to do , it ’s not possible for me to do .
And it ’s not possible in any of the cute visual programming environments because they are just not flexible or powerful enough .
They ’re great for making the kind of thing , whatever it is , that they happen to be good at , but what if that ’s not what I want to make ?
The beauty of Mathematica is that it ’s a good language first and foremost : it ’s a language in which you can write just about anything that can be written .
And once you ’ve worked out a little program that does something interesting , it ’s a very slippery slope ( this being a good thing here ) to start adding interactive elements to it .
Two minutes — not two days — to go from a neat program to a neat program with sliders .
The anti-democratic agenda behind the US attorney firings
By Barry Grey
29 March 2007
It is becoming increasingly clear that the firing of eight US attorneys was part of an illegal conspiracy whose principle aim was to maintain Republican power by suppressing the votes of working class and minority voters and using trumped - up voter - fraud prosecutions to manipulate elections and reverse close ones that went to the Democrats .
The intention was to use the vast powers of the federal prosecutorial and judicial system to subvert democratic processes , while providing a legal gloss for the process .
Under conditions of growing popular opposition to the Iraq war and the policies of the Bush administration as a whole , the White House and its co-conspirators in the Justice Department were determined to purge any federal prosecutors who might stand in the way of their machinations .
Two of the fired federal prosecutors , David Iglesias in New Mexico and John McKay in Washington state , were targeted for refusing to pursue voter fraud prosecutions against Democrats which were sought by the White House and Republican congressmen in connection with closely contested electoral races .
Two others , Carol Lam of California and Paul Charlton of Arizona , were fired after conducting corruption cases against sitting Republican congressmen .
Others of the purged US attorneys resisted demands by Bush and Gonzales that they seek the death penalty in criminal cases .
US Attorney Bud Cummins of Arkansas was fired to make way for Tim Griffen , an aide to Bush ’s chief political adviser Karl Rove .
Griffen had previously served as the lead political investigator for the Republican National Committee , where his job was to dig up dirt against Democratic opponents .
He played a major role in the Republican effort during the 2004 election campaign to intimidate and disqualify working class and minority voters , under the pretext of fighting voter fraud .
The burgeoning scandal has already shattered the attempts of the White House and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to present the firings as a routine “ personnel matter , ” in which neither Bush nor Gonzales were intimately involved .
Previous statements by Gonzales and other top Justice Department officials to this effect , in both sworn congressional testimony and public remarks , have been exposed as lies by emails and other material contained in thousands of pages of documents released to congressional investigators ( see “ New documents expose White House , Justice Department lies in firing of US attorneys ” ) .
The evidence increasingly indicates that the conspiracy was centered in the White House , with Bush ’s chief political adviser , Karl Rove , playing the central role , and two fellow Bush loyalists going back to the president ’s term as governor of Texas , Gonzales and former White House counsel Harrier Miers , who left her White House post in January , overseeing the US attorney purge .
The scandal stands to spread with the testimony today of D. Kyle Sampson , Gonzales ’ former chief of staff , before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Sampson resigned March 12 after Gonzales and Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty attempted to make him the fall guy , claiming that their misleading testimony and statements occurred because Sampson , who coordinated the firings , failed to keep them properly informed .
Sampson has publicly refuted the claims of his superiors at the Justice Department .
The Washington Post reported March 27 : “ Sampson is expected to testify that ‘ the fact that the White House and Justice Department had been discussing this subject for several years was well known ” to many senior Justice officials , including [ senior Justice Department counsel and White House liaison Moncia ]
Goodling and others who had briefed department witnesses , according to a statement issued by his attorney March 16 . ”
Goodling had also been summoned to testify , but on Monday her lawyer informed the Judiciary Committee that she would refuse to answer questions on the grounds of her Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination .
The invocation by a top Justice Department official of the Fifth Amendment is itself an extraordinary development , and is all the more ominous , from the standpoint of the Bush administration , coming from the individual who played the central role in coordinating the actions of the White House and the Justice Department .
By taking the Fifth , Goodling is for the first time implicitly suggesting that the firing of the US attorneys may involve violations of the law .
In justifying the decision , her lawyer charged that the Democratic - led Judiciary Committee is biased against his client and is conducting a politically - motivated exercise .
He said that Goodling had ample reason to fear that her testimony would be used to charge her with perjury or obstruction of justice , and cited as precedents the convictions of Reagan aides John Poindexter and Oliver North in the Iran - Contra affair and the recent conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s former chief of staff I. Lewis Libby for lying to a grand jury investigating the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson .
Citing these precedents , however , suggests that were Goodling to testify , she would make false statements to the committee , raising the question :
Whom is she protecting ?
Another indication that the scandal is assuming the proportions of a full - scale crisis for the White House is the announcement Monday by the government reform committee of the House of Representatives directing “ the Republican National Committee [ RNC ] and the Bush - Cheney ’04 Campaign to preserve the emails of White House officials and to meet with committee staff to explain how the accounts are managed and what steps are being taken to protect the emails from destruction and tampering . ”
In issuing the order , Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( Democrat of California ) cited evidence that senior White House officials involved in the firing of the federal prosecutors used Republican National Committee and other political email accounts to avoid leaving a record of official communications .
The Democratic leadership began holding hearings into the firings last January , with the evident aim of using them to give the appearance of a struggle against the Bush administration while they prepared to authorize another $ 100 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Even now , they have been reluctant to bring the matter to a head , seeking to avoid a confrontation with the White House over their request for testimony from White House aides , including Rove and Miers .
Bush has flatly refused to allow his aides to testify publicly and under oath , citing executive privilege .
While both the House and Senate judiciary committees have voted to authorize the issuance of subpoenas for White House officials to testify , they have held off on executing the subpoenas .
Last Friday , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( Democratic of Vermont ) said “ I ’m in no hurry ” to issue the subpoenas .
Gonzales himself has not been called back to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee , and will appear there only on April 17 for a previously scheduled hearing .
Only a handful of Democrats , and several Republicans , have called for Gonzales to resign , and no prominent politicians of either party have demanded the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter .
But political scandals involving serious underlying issues have a logic of their own , and the US attorney affair could well escalate far beyond what the Democrats intend or desire .
Already , public demands for the appointment of a special prosecutor are mounting .
The origins of the present scandal go back to the stolen election of 2000 , when the Bush campaign and George W. Bush ’s brother Jeb , then governor of the pivotal state of Florida , used various illegal tactics to disenfranchise likely Democratic voters , particularly in working class and African - American districts , and then , through the intervention of a Republican majority on the US Supreme Court , blocked a recount of votes that had been ordered by the Florida Supreme Court .
The Democratic Party and its candidate Al Gore , who obtained more popular votes than Bush , conducted no serious campaign against the Republican hijacking of the election and meekly accepted the Supreme Court fiat .
Once in power , the Bush administration initiated a drive to institutionalize the manipulation and subversion of elections by suppressing voting in key Democratic areas and using federal “ voter fraud ” investigations and prosecutions to disrupt Democratic campaigns and even overturn Democratic victories .
As Jeanne Cummings explains in a March 27 article on the Internet site The Politico : “ Before the 2002 midterms , then - attorney general John Ashcroft announced a ‘ Voting Access and Integrity Initiative ’ that directed FBI agents and US attorneys ’ offices to investigate allegations of voter fraud .
In a letter to Ashcroft , civil rights leaders questioned the objectives of the program and warned that it could intimidate some voters .
“ Meanwhile , state party officials experimented with programs aimed at identifying and challenging voters they deemed questionable .
In Arkansas , some minority voters were photographed as they went to the polls .
In Pennsylvania , minority voters say big black Suburban trucks pulled up outside voting precincts while men with earpiece walkie - talkies demanded to see their identification ....
“ Two years later , the Republican anti-fraud operation was ready for the big time , a presidential campaign . ”
Cummings writes : “ Republican operatives tucked think folders of newspaper clippings and other fraud tips under their arms and pitched to reporters their claims that the Democrats ’ registration program would lead to rampant voter fraud ...
What was n’t mentioned in those conversations with reporters was a Republican National Committee strategy , already underway , to work with state parties to identify and challenge questionable voters at the polling precincts .
Among those working at the RNC was Tim Griffin , the former Karl Rove aide who recently replaced fired US attorney Bud Cummins .
Then , with the vast federal law enforcement community acting as the new sheriff , Republicans hoped ... for a string of high - profile investigations and convictions ....
“ At the Justice Department , Ashcroft instructed US attorneys to meet with top election officials and make themselves available for fraud investigations on Election Day , if necessary . ”
Within two months of Bush ’s reelection , the Bush White House was discussing with newly appointed Attorney General Gonzales whether to fire all or some of the US attorneys .
A major reason , it is clear , was to make sure that in future elections the operation would be even more successful .
Indeed , there is every reason to believe that the Bush administration had the 2006 midterm and 2008 presidential elections in mind when it inserted into the 2006 law reauthorizing the US Patriot
Act a provision allowing the attorney general to appoint US attorneys on an interim basis without obtaining Senate confirmation .
It was under this provision that the purge of federal prosecutors was carried out .
This is confirmed by a commentary published by the McClatchy Newspapers , which notes : “ Last April , while the Justice Department and the White House were planning the firings , Rove gave a speech in Washington to the Republican National Lawyers Association .
He ticked off 11 states that he said could be pivotal in the 2008 elections .
Bush has appointed new US attorneys in nine of them since 2005 ; Florida , Colorado , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , Arkansas , Michigan , Nevada and New Mexico .
US attorneys in the latter four were among these fired .
“ Rove thanked the audience for ‘ all that you are doing in those hot spots around the country to ensure that the integrity of the ballot is protected . ’
He added , ‘ A lot in American politics is up for grabs . ’ ”
Nor can it be an accident that Rove aide and Republican dirty trickster Tim Griffen was installed as US attorney in Arkansas , where the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton spent most of her adult life .
Philosophy A New Enlightenment ?
By Ryan McGreal
Published June 14 , 2007
So I was reading today about US President Bush explaining why his administration is not going to support a lawsuit by investors against companies that commit securities fraud ( as in the Enron scandal ) ; and it occurred to me , not for the first time , that it 's long past the point at which it becomes impossible to believe the United States government is doing anything simply because it 's the right thing to do , and not because it scores partisan or jingoistic or cronyist or cognitive - framing points .
That Rubicon lies in the past .
The US political culture seems to have shifted permanently from an Enlightenment - era belief in the power of rational discourse to solve problems into what we might call a Psychometrics - era belief in the power of full - spectrum manipulation to frame reality in one 's interests .
( The political situation in Canada is not much different , with a federal government that seems incapable of drawing a distinction between sound policy and cynical vote - buying . )
Of course , the Enlightenment demonstrated all kinds of unreason , from patronage to class divisions to attempts by sovereign heads of state to assume the absolute power implied in the phrase attributed to King Louis XIV : " L'etat , c'est moi . "
( Thomas Jefferson , who supported liberty and democracy but kept slaves and advocated wiping out the indigenous people of North America , may be the archetypal hypocrite in this case . )
In fact , the Enlightenment was explicitly a principled and practical response to such arbitrary and self - serving conditions .
It 's true that Enlightenment philosphers and demagogues were also subject to patronage , partisanship and so on , but the underlying goal of reason and openness was always present , and the frequent backlashes from people in power were backlashes against the adoption of reason as a principal method of governing oneself and one 's country .
Today , the concept of reason has been abandoned in public discourse .
It simply is no longer present , obliterated by the relentless psychological manipulation , demographic analysis , propaganda , jingoism , tribalism , and rank politicization that has overtaken discourse across the board .
( Of course it 's still possible to find countervailing examples of reasoned discourse , but to borrow a concept from Paul Graham , the people forming policy no longer have to think about them . )
It may yet be possible to reinvent reason for the age of psychometrics .
I certainly hope that 's the case , and some early signs suggest that it has already begun .
Take the popularity of a program like The Daily Show , which wraps a candy coating of cynical humour around their surprisingly astute analysis .
Against all expectations , and notwithstanding their own biases , they 've made it fashionable to think critically again .
Perhaps the future will offer a New Enlightenment , based not on a naive faith in mechanical rationalism as a sword to cut through heredity , mysticism and other irrational entanglements but on a mature system of thought that accounts for and addresses the many ways in which humans are susceptible to magical thinking , bias and dogma .
Alfred Korzybski thought he was doing this with his system of General Semantics , which sought among other things to bring the rigor of hard science to social studies , but his ideas never really took hold except among a few science fiction writers and media theorists .
There may be some promise in his methods yet , although as understanding of how the brain works progresses , our understanding of how to identify and work around our blind spots must progress as well .

A Cocktail Condom ?
Protection for Your Drink
The covers are designed to shield against date - rape drugs slipped into drinks .
June 21 , 2007  --
Safe - sipping martinis , pure lager pints and untouched tumblers of Scotch .
Consider it the cocktail 's condom equivalent .
In barrooms around the world , revelers can purchase condoms from bathroom dispensers to ward off sexually transmitted diseases that may follow a one - night fling .
Now , a city councilor from Boston wants the city 's licensing board , alcohol manufacturers and owners of nightclubs and bars to seriously consider cocktail covers , a creation that Massachusetts inventor Greg Barry says will deter would - be predators from slipping date - rape drugs into the drinks of unsuspecting victims .
" There are ways to try to educate people , " said Stephen Murphy , the head of the Boston City Council 's Public Safety Committee and the man pushing the issue into the spotlight .
" I can't make them change the regulations , but I can require the licensing board to come in . "
Murphy wants to gather the industry players to discuss the topic of laced alcoholic beverages at bars , a problem he says Boston is ripe for , given the large number of college and graduate school coeds that help drive the city 's nightclub scene .
More specifically , Murphy wants bars to consider offering customers the cocktail covers designed by Barry , who is currently trying to patent his prevention device .
The concept behind the cocktail cover is fairly simply .
About the size of a coaster , it can be used to cap a drink that goes unattended .
When a person returns to a beverage , there is a layer that can be pulled back , leaving a thin sheath protecting the cocktail .
That can be punctured with a straw or pulled off entirely — either way the drinker will know that the cocktail has not been tampered with .
" It gives patrons the impression that at least it's a problem , " said Barry .
" The bar owners do n't want to introduce it on their own , so someone suggested I talk to someone at the City Council and see if they can move it along . "
Barry said that companies could advertise on the cocktail covers , likely covering the cost of production .
Each cover , he said , costs less than 10 cents to make .
But Dan Pokaski , chairman of the Boston Licensing Board , laughed off Murphy 's interest in the cocktail cover .
" Why do n't we go to a sippy cup ? " Pokaski asked .
" I love Stephen Murphy and there 's obviously some merit to preventing someone from slipping something into a drink , but this is overkill . "
Pokaski also said that enforcing any kind of mandatory dispensing of cocktail covers , in addition to being unnecessary " micromanaging , " would be impossible to enforce at Boston bars — and inefficient .
" In Boston , we do n't have a major problem with date - rape drugs , " Pokaski said .
" Does it happen from time to time ?
Yes .
Is it a major problem ?
No .
This is like taking a sledgehammer to a flea . "
Date - rape drugs include Rohypnol , GHB and Ketamine .
Rohypnol , when combined with alcohol , produces a state called " anterograde amnesia , " in which a person forgets what happens while under the influence of the drug .
Murphy was not distracted by Pokaski 's criticism .
He also said he was ready for a backlash from bar and nightclub owners and suggested the city might be able to provide incentives to bars that offer the cocktail covers .
" It 's about protecting young women , " Murphy said .
“ After 10 years and $ 1.5 billion in public funds these failed abstinence - only - until - marriage programs will go down as an ideological boondoggle of historic proportions , ” said James Waggoner , President of Advocates for Youth .
So a burial at sea is appropriate , and by releasing the latest federal report on abstinence - only , Impacts for Title V. Section 510 , Abstinence Education Programs : Final Report , from Mathematica Policy Research , Inc. late on a Friday , that is exactly what the Bushies are doing .
The news for the Bush Adminstration 's abstinence - only policies just seems to be getting worse , some might liken it to a swiftly sinking boat or ship .

“ After 10 years and $ 1.5 billion in public funds these failed abstinence - only - until - marriage programs will go down as an ideological boondoggle of historic proportions , ” said James Wagoner , President of Advocates for Youth .
“ The tragedy is not simply the waste of taxpayer dollars , it is the damage done to the young people who have been on the receiving end of distorted , inaccurate information about condoms and birth control .
We have been promoting ignorance in the era of AIDS , and that ’s not just bad public health policy , its bad ethics ” .

“ This report should serve as the final verdict on the failure of the abstinence - only industry in this country , ” said William Smith , vice president for public policy of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the U.S. ( SIECUS ) .
“ It shows , once again , that these programs fail miserably in actually helping young people behave more responsibly when it comes to their sexuality , ” Smith continued .
In 1996 , the federal government attached a provision to the welfare reform law establishing a federal program for abstinence - only - until - marriage programs .
This program , Section 510 ( b ) of Title V of the Social Security Act , dedicated $ 50 million per year to be distributed among states that choose to participate .
States accepting the funds are required to match every four federal dollars with three state - raised dollars ( for a total of $ 87.5 million annually , and $ 787.5 million for the eight years from fiscal year 1998 through 2006 ) .
Programs that receive the Title V funding are prohibited from discussing methods of contraception , including condoms , except in the context of failure rates .
On a call yesterday organized by the Abstinence Clearinghouse , abstinence - only proponents were clearly rocked by the potentially ruinous news in the report .
High profile abstinence - only advocate , Robert Rector , led the preemptive damage - control planning .
He outlined several strategies the abstinence - only movement could use to rationalize the findings in the report saying , “ The other spin I think is very important is not [ program ] effectiveness , but rather the values that are being taught , ” Rector said .
Whether or not these programs work is a “ bogus issue , ” Rector continued .
Noting that the study was posted on a Government web - site with no press release or advisory , Wagoner said : “ The ‘ stealth release ’ of this study on an obscure government website on a Friday afternoon is clearly meant to bury its contents .
But policy makers must now know that funds for these programs must now be eliminated ” .
Citing the fact that the Institute of Medicine , the nation ’s leading health authority , had called for the elimination of these programs back in 2000 , Wagoner said : “ Congress must now move to de-fund these programs .
Anything short of eliminating these programs would be a dereliction of its duty to promote public health and protect young people in the era of AIDS ” .
Tune in next week for more coverage of this report .
Hank Azaria :
They sent me down to greet Mick Jagger [ when he arrived to record his part ] , and I said , “ Hey , Mick , we ’re all thrilled to have you here . ”
And he kind of blew right by me like I was the greeter , and went [ dismissively ] , “ Yeah , we ’ll get it , ” which I knew was going to be awkward , because I was about to walk upstairs and record with him .
And it also made me a little bit annoyed .
So before I even thought , I went , “ No , I do n’t think we ’ll get it — I ’m just glad you ’re here . ”
And he kind of turned around and looked back at me like , What the fuck did you just say to me ?
And I was just like , “ Hi. I ’m Hank , I ’ll be recording with you . ”
So that was slightly awkward .
Tim Long , co–executive producer , The Simpsons ( 1999 – present ) : Mr. T [ another guest ] was telling me the scenes that happened in Rocky III , where he lost .
The reason he lost was because his mother needed money for an operation , and so he was paid to take a dive .
And I said , “ Well , I do n’t remember that in the movie . ”
And he just looks at me right in the eye and says , “ Things you do n’t see ! ”
I said to him , “ I remember you put out a record called Mr. T’s Commandments . ”
And somehow he heard that as “ Mr. T , please sing ‘ Mr. T’s Commandments . ’ ”
So he sang me the whole song .
And I just thought ,
If I ’m killed by a sniper tonight , well , my life would have ended beautifully , because I have been sung to by Mr. T .
Ricky Gervais , guest writer and voice , The Simpsons ( 2006 ) , creator and star , BBC’s The Office :
We had a lunch with Matt and Al Jean and all the writers and producers and everything , and at the very end , I was doing the nerdy thing , asking Matt to draw me a Homer .
I was jealous of Moby ’s .
I saw a Cribs , and it was Moby and he said it was his prized possession — I think the first Cribs where you actually saw a bookshelf .
Matt said , “ Would you like to be a guest voice ? ”
And I said , “ What are the hours ? ”
And he said , “ The hours are really good . ”
I went , “ Of course I would . ”
One battle the network decided to fight was against the actors who provided the voices on the show .
According to a former producer , up until 1999 , the actors were paid only about $ 25,000 an episode , while the Seinfeld cast had been making $ 600,000 per episode each .
Negotiations that year for new contracts turned bitter .
Though show - runner Mike Scully refused to participate , Fox began auditioning replacements .
Colin Lewis :
There was a day , there was an actual moment when the actors , who are normally just friendly , sat down and started talking more in depth about contracts .
. . .
They asked us to give them some time alone , and it was like , “ Alone ?
You guys do n’t hang out alone . ”
They literally , like , closed the door .
Hank Azaria :
You know , the show has made so much money , in so many ways .
Eventually , we just wanted to get our piece of the pie .
And Fox is tough .
They ’re very tough negotiators .
Their business model is not to give money away .
So it got a little intense at times .
Larry Doyle :
The actors actually did n’t come to work for a while .
Their contract expired , and we were n’t recording them for I think a month .
Fox had started to audition people .
The actors got their deal because of a last - minute thing , some sort of bonus .
And it turned out that they were n’t going to get [ the bonus money ] until 2005 or something .
So it was a real , like , Fox - studio “ Fuck you , ” where the fine print means , “ We ’re going to deliver that , in pennies , after you ’re dead . ”
So Harry [ Shearer ] , for the longest time , came to every table read wearing a T - shirt that said , you ’ll get it in 2005 .
The suggestion being that he was n’t going to do anything but work to contract .
This lion was reared by the guys in the vid , he was then released into the wild in africa but a year later the guys returned to see if he was doing OK .
Check out the look on the lions face as he realises -" thats not food its my MATES !!" Whats mad is the wild lions hes friends with never met the humans but they are totally passive towards them .
I love this clip , and think its better than any amount of lion snuff vids that get posted about the place .
I can't believe I agreed to do this and I can't believe I lost .
I mean I 've been using a Blackberry ( RIMM ) for almost ten years !
Click to viewOne of the main selling points of Blockbuster online vs.
Netflix is the fact that you can take your online mailers into brick and mortar Blockbuster stores and exchange them for in - store movies .
In fact , that 's the reason we give when we recommend people choose Blockbuster over Netflix .
It 's too bad that they 're now totally cutting the plan off at the knees and limiting $ 17.99 plan to only FIVE free in - store exchanges a month , and charging $ 1.99 per exchange after that .
Advertisement
And this is only for the 3 DVDs , $ 17.99 plan .
If you have the 2 DVD plan , you 'll get 3 exchanges .
The 1 DVD plan only gets 2 exchanges .
The reason for this ?
Blockbuster 's saying this will be a $ 38 value when you factor in the exchanges :
Value Message : Based on a member renting and returning two sets of DVDs in one month on the 3 out plan ( with 5 in - store movie exchanges ) for a total of 6 online rentals .
Five ( 5 ) online rentals are then exchanged in - store for a free movie rental under BLOCKBUSTER Total Access , valued at the average in - store movie rental price of $ 4.00 each , totaling $ 20 in one month .
Adding that to the base membership fee of $ 17.99 for the 3 out plan gives you a total monthly value of $ 38 .

That does n't even count the fact that they throttle your online mailers if you rent too many movies too often , which means you 're getting less in - store exchanges anyway .
Our tipster says they 're taking down every sign that advertises the Total Access plan in store .
Thanks ,
Blockbuster , for making it that much easier to recommend Netflix .
Thanks Jake !
Update : Looks like Blockbuster sent out an email yesterday saying they were changing plans on the 26 ... which is yesterday .
Fortunately for me , I 'm what they call a " preferred customer " , and still get unlimited in - store rentals .
( I still get the 2 free games or movies a month as well ) .
So my plan does n't change .
Too bad for everyone else though .
But if I make any changes to my plan , it 'll move me to the new gimped rate plans and I 'll lose my preferred status .
What would you do if your home was just destroyed in a fire , its cold , and you need a place to spend the night ?
You might call up a relative , or go the YMCA or the local shelter , get a hotel room or spend the night at the hospital .
What would you do if your home and your entire village had just been leveled by an earthquake , its cold , and you need a place to stay ?
You might call on the UN or the Red Cross to send you a bunch of Hexayurts .
The Hexayurt is a refugee shelter system based on work done at the Rocky Mountain Institute .
It uses an approach based on " autonomous building " to provide not just a shelter , but a comprehensive family support unit .
The hexayurt is an amazing structure because of how simple it is .
Just because its simple does n’t mean it lacks human comforts .
It has solar water purification for drinking water , a composting toilet , a fuel - efficient wood gas stove , and solar electric lighting .
With the ability to add other systems as self contained modules .
So how easy it is to build ?
Check these videos out .
These amazing shelters could have saved many lives after the earth quake in Pakistan , and provided much needed shelter after the Asian tsunami .
But I could also see them being used for the urban and rural homeless population of the world .
The beats a tin shack any day .
The best part about this that each unit costs between $ 200 - $ 500 + with the infrastructure package coming in at $ 100 .
So you may be able to heat , provide water , light , and shelter for as little as $ 300 per person .
The units can be deployed in great density in a sea container and built on site as Vinay Gupta Describes in this video .
Check out this presentaion ( pdf ) for more info about the Hexayurt .
The P38 Lightning was buried under 300 ft of ice
The P38 Lightning was one of eight aircraft forced to land in Greenland after encountering bad weather while en route to the UK in July 1942 .
The planes became buried under 300 ft of ice but 15 years ago the remains of one , renamed Glacier Girl , were dug up .
The aircraft is due to take part in an air show at Duxford , near Cambridge .
The plane is expected to land within the next few days to prepare for the Imperial War Museum annual Flying Legends weekend on 7 and 8 July .
It has previously flown at air shows in the United States .
A dedicated recovery team spent months working to retrieve the single P38 when the lost aircraft were re-discovered , immediately christening it Glacier Girl .
Forced landing
An IWM spokeswoman said : " It 's a remarkable story which is set to reach an emotional conclusion .
" Sixty five years ago this July , six American P38 fighter planes and two B17 bombers took off from the east coast of the United States to make the long journey to Britain and so on to Germany .
" These aircraft made up one small part of Operation Bolero , the historically important build - up of allied aircraft in Britain championed by President Roosevelt .
" Already well into their journey , the eight aircraft encountered atrocious weather conditions over Greenland and , with fuel running low , the crews had no choice but to attempt a difficult landing directly on to the snow and ice of Greenland 's glaciers .
" Miraculously , all 25 crew members survived the landings and , after a few cold days awaiting rescue , were returned safely back to the States . "
The P38 Lightning is due to fly alongside more than 50 other vintage aircraft , including Spitfires and P51s .
One of America 's most seminal books is William James 's The Varieties of Religious Experience , in which he argues that the subjective experience of the divine can be understood only by the believer .
I have just been finding out how true this is .
You hear all the time that America is an intensely religious nation , but what you do n't hear is that there are almost as many religions as there are believers .
Moreover , many ostensible believers are quite unsure of what they actually believe .
And , to put it mildly , the different faiths do n't think that highly of one another .
The emerging picture is not at all monolithic .

People seem to be lying to the opinion polls , as well .
They claim to go to church in much larger numbers than they actually do ( there are n't enough churches in the country to hold the hordes who boast of attending ) , and they sometimes seem to believe more in Satan and in the Virgin Birth than in the theory of evolution .
But every single time that the teaching of " intelligent design " has actually been proposed in conservative districts , it has been defeated overwhelmingly by both courts and school boards .
A fascinating new book , 40 Days and 40 Nights , describes this happening in detail in the small town of Dover , Pennsylvania .
Its author , Matthew Chapman , is the great - great - grandson of Charles Darwin , which helps make Dover the modern version of the Scopes " Monkey Trial , " in Dayton , Tennessee , in 1925 , with the difference that this time the decision went the other way .
A Republican - appointed judge described the school board 's creationist effort as " breathtaking inanity . "
Could there be a change in the Zeitgeist coming on ?
I think it 's possible .
A 2001 study found that those without religious affiliation are the fastest - growing minority in the United States .
A generation ago the words " American atheist " conjured the image of the slightly cultish and loopy Madalyn Murray O'Hair .
But in the last two years there have been five atheist best - sellers , one each from Professors Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and two from the neuroscientist Sam Harris .
As the author of the fifth of these books , I asked my publishers to arrange my book tour as a series of challenges to the spokesmen of the faithful , and to send me as far as possible to the South .
The following is an account of some of the less expected moments of the trip .
April 22 , Little Rock , Arkansas : I leave the Vanity Fair party , given at my apartment after the White House Correspondents ' Dinner , at 4:30 a.m. to catch the red -eye from Washington to the Arkansas Book Fair .
My last memory of the D.C. bash is of Justice Antonin Scalia debating some of the sharper points of Catholic doctrine with California attorney general Jerry Brown .
I decide against wearing my black - tie evening attire for the day - trip .
On the road from the Little Rock airport is an enormous black - and - yellow billboard bearing the single word jesus : this is just how people like to imagine Dixie .
My book is n't even technically published , yet there 's an overflow Sunday crowd .
I start by mentioning the sign .
I know the name , I say , and I have used the expression .
But on its own the word " Jesus " seems to say both too much and ( somehow ) too little .
This gets more of a laugh than I might have predicted .
At the end of the event I discover something that I am going to keep on discovering : half the people attending had thought that they were the only atheists in town .

BBC News , Aral Sea , Kazakhstan
A satellite image comparison shows the extent of the task facing Kazakhstan
Enlarge Image
As the sun rises above the Aral Sea , Alek , a local fisherman , steers the boat , leans forward and pulls the net out of the glittering water .
It is full of carp , sturgeon and flounder - just two years ago he could not have even dreamt of this catch .
" All thanks to the dam , " Alek grins as he throws the fish into a growing pile on the bottom of his rowing boat .
The dam is part of a $ 68 m project , initiated by the Kazakh government and financed by loans from the World Bank .
It is an ambitious undertaking that aims to reverse one of the world 's worst man-made environmental disasters and bring back the sea which many predicted could never return .
" The Aral Sea did not die , the Aral Sea was murdered , " said Nazhbagin Musabaev , the governor of the Aralsk region .
' Die gracefully '
The two main Central Asian rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya , he said , would be diverted to irrigate the cotton plantations in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan .
" But what will happen to the Aral ? " someone from the audience shouted .
" The Aral , " the deputy minister responded , " will have to die off gracefully . "
Disaster
But the death of the Aral was far from graceful .
More fishermen are taking their boats to the north
Every year fishermen would have to travel further and further to get to the water , and every year there would be less and less fish left to catch .
Desertification and rising salt levels in the shrinking sea brought salt storms .
Diseases , like anaemia and cancer , swept through communities .
By the 1990s the world 's fourth largest inland body of water had shrunk to a quarter of its size .
Today , dropped in the middle of the grey desert is the village of Dzhambul , once home to a thriving fishing community .
Dotting the area , which was once the deepest point of the Aral , are skeletons of rusting ships .
Next to them , camels graze on the colourless dry grass that pokes out from the grey sand .
Future hopes
Jalkasbai , a fisherman from Dzhambul , remembers the days when life here was very different .
" All my childhood I was going fishing with my father and my brothers , but my sons grew up without the sea , " Jalkasbai said .
" But now , I hope my grandchildren will have a chance to become fishermen . "
It is a six - hour drive across the desert to get to the place that has given Jalkasbai , and thousands like him , hope for the future .
The recently constructed 13 km dam has split the Aral Sea in two parts .
The dam did not solve the entire problem .
On the Uzbek side the Southern Sea continues to shrink .
Rusting ships stand as monuments to the disaster
But he added , that was no longer Kazakhstan 's problem .
In Kazakhstan , the dam has allowed the river to feed the northern Aral and as a result the sea has been pushing back into the desert .
Kazakh officials say 40 % of the water has already returned .
The fishermen are back in their boats .
The clouds and the rain have returned .
A short drive away from the dam , a group of fishermen camp out in tents by the shore .
Jandos Kumanov spent his entire winter here .
The sea is still too far from his home village , but the increasing number of fish made the trip worthwhile .
" In the last two years life has become easier , " he said .
" You can see fishermen are now building houses , buying cars , and sending their children to schools outside the big cities "
And it may all get even better .
Using a new $ 126 m World Bank loan , the government now plans to build a second dam , which they hope will bring the water back to the port of Aralsk .
" The sea has left the harbour , but it has n't left our hearts , " reads a dilapidated sign in the dried - up Aralsk harbour .
The dam has helped the northern Aral Sea grow by 40 %
The Aral is still at least 40 km ( 25 miles ) away from the harbour , but the second stage of the project , the government says , could bring it back by 2010 .
This is what everyone in Aralsk seems to be waiting for .
As a group of school boys climb the abandoned ships in the Aralsk harbour , one of them , an 11 - year - old called Baurzhan , says he has heard about the Aral from his grandfather , but has never actually seen the sea .
" But it 's okay , " Baurzhan said .
" The sea will be back soon .
That 's what my grandfather says and I believe my grandfather . "

At nine , Bethany does n't ' feel right ' without fake tan .
11 - year - old Belle waxes her legs .
Karolina , 10 , wo n't leave home without scent .
Harmless fun ?
Or proof of the insidious sexualisation of our children ? :
Bethany Conheeny takes two hours to get ready each morning .
A detailed inspection of her morning routine
gives some indication why .
After washing her naturally wavy hair , she spritzes , sprays and straightens it with £ 120 designer
ceramic straighteners .
Scroll down for more ...
If there 's so much as a kink left , she starts again .
She 's rigorous in her cleansing , toning and
moisturing routine , and before leaving the house ,
applies a slick of lip - gloss .
At the weekends , it
takes longer .
Bethany — who has £ 70 worth of
beauty treatments each week , including a spray
tan , pedicure , manicure and eyebrow wax —
applies St Tropez blusher , pink eye shadow and
mascara .
She prefers to use a Chanel foundation over her
moisturiser , but as her 37 - year - old mother
Catherine , a qualified beautician , puts it , perhaps
somewhat mildly : " She 's a bit young for that . "
She has a point .
Bethany is nine years old .
Yet she 's far from the only pre-teen beauty addict
to seem more concerned about her make - up than
her exam marks .
Take 11 - year - old Belle Chapman .
Last week , Belle , a naturally pretty brunette ,
turned to her mother Cheryl and said : " I must get
my legs waxed again , they are getting so hairy . "
Cheryl , a PR executive from Reigate in Surrey ,
says :
" Her monthly waxing costs me about £ 30 , and
she regularly has her hair highlighted , which costs
£ 60 .
" I spend more on beauty treatments for her
than myself .
She loves having facials .
I put my foot
down about her using tanning beds , but she is
badgering me to have the latest spray - on tan .
She 's even had her arms waxed . "
Bethany is on the books of a Leeds
modelling agency .
Belle , meanwhile , has
already had modelling assignments for
children 's clothes catalogues .
Depressingly - but somewhat
predictably - Belle 's role models read
like a contents page for a cheap
celebrity magazine .
Like many of her
friends , she idolises Jordan , Victoria
Beckham and Girls Aloud .
And her mother says she can't see
anything wrong with that .
" Belle 's done a few modelling jobs , and
would love to get into showbusiness , "
Cheryl says .
" It started when she was
eight , and wanted highlights putting in
her hair and her ears pierced .
She said
all her friends were having it done and
so I let her .
She 's a determined girl , who
likes to be thought of as cool .
" In many ways she is n't a child at all
— her obsessions are clothes , hair and
make - up .
" She adores pink clothes and
goes out wearing tiny tops showing her
tummy , skinny jeans and her Ugg
boots .
When I was her age I wore jeans
and jumpers and enjoyed playing out .
She hangs around with friends at the
shops . "
Cheryl is divorced and also has a
14 - year - old son , Caspar .
Despite paying
for her little girl 's waxing treatments ,
she does admit to being disturbed by
the way her daughter dances .
" She does all this very sexy dancing ,
' shaking your booty ' I think it 's called .
But she has no idea how sexual the
moves are .
I wonder what 's going to be
left for her when she actually becomes a
teenager — where is it all headed ? "
Indeed .
Though it 's impossible not to
feel that Cheryl only has herself to
blame for encouraging Belle to dress
like an 18 - year - old .
Surely , she and
Bethany 's mother Catherine could stop
pandering to their daughters ' unhealthy
obsession with their looks and refuse to
pay for it ?
Catherine says : " If her nails need doing
or the tan needs topping up , Bethany
complains she does n't feel right - a
feeling lots of women can associate
with . "
Of course , the uncomfortable truth
is that , like Belle , Bethany is not a
woman , she 's a child , one of thousands
of young girls being bombarded
by society 's confused and
damaging messages as they grow up
— messages it appears are being
reinforced by their mothers .
At a recent family party ,
Catherine recalls how a
14 - year - old boy pursued her
nine - year - old daughter .
" He
would n't leave her alone all
night , which made me feel very
uncomfortable , " says Catherine , who
runs a furniture business with husband
David , 42 , in Huddersfield , West
Yorkshire .
" But thankfully she told him
she was nine and not interested in him .
" I felt a little guilty because of the part
I play in Bethany looking older than she
is , but all her friends are the same , and
when she works hard at school I 'm loath
to deny her the beauty treats she loves . "
Like the nymphets and faunlets in
Nabokov 's novel Lolita , British society ,
it seems , is fast breeding a generation of
young girls being sexualised before their
bodies have had time to develop .
It 's a phenomenon once largely
associated with America , where the
spotlight fell on the high - pressure world
of child pageants following the brutal ,
unsolved murder of six - year - old child
model JonBenet Ramsey in 1996 .
Now those same contests are being held up
and down this country and children's
charities are expressing concern .
Last week , it was reported that
paedophiles were having online
conversations about one British child
pageant regular — 11 - year - old Sasha
Bennington .
Sasha — with her bleach
blonde hair and blue eyes — was a
finalist in the Miss British Isles
contest last year .
A spokesman for the Online Sex
Offenders Community monitoring team
said : ' Sasha is now at serious risk .
We
feel that child pageants should be
banned altogether .'
Pause for thought for Elima Jackson
who spends £ 200 a month on beauty
treatments for her ten - year - old twin
daughters , Karolina and Daniela .
Both
girls , who have modelled children's
swimwear and dressing up costumes for
Toys R Us , have expensive highlighted
hair and go to a beauty salon near their
home in Westgate - on - Sea in Kent each
week to have manicures .
They may not be allowed to
wear make - up to school , but
they wo n't leave the house
without running straighteners
through their hair and spritzing
themselves with Barbie perfume .
Far from being horrified that her
ten - year - olds are obsessed with their
looks , Elima , 30 , encourages them .
She
says : " I 'm glad they like to look after
themselves from such a young age . "
She sees nothing wrong with the fact
that her daughters worship Lindsay
Lohan ( who has just been arrested for
drink - driving ) and Britney Spears
( who recently had a spell in rehab )
because they are seen as ' pretty ' and
' glamorous ' .
The girls ' obsession with beauty
began when they were five and Daniela
was chosen to model for the packaging
of a light - up child 's beauty box .
" It gave
her a taste for it and her sister wanted
to get in on the act too , " Elima says .
But it is the self - consciousness of
these girls at an age when they should
be carefree that is so alarming .
And
Cheryl is all too aware of the conflicts at
the heart of her daughter Belle 's world .
She says : " She is conscious of her body
image and is always saying things like : ' I
am far too fat , my stomach is too big . '
" She 's still got a little girl 's body , and
she thinks there is something wrong
with her because she does n't look like a
woman yet .
" One day last year she came
downstairs wearing a tiny mini skirt
with stockings , " she recalls .
" She looked like a mini prostitute , and
I had to tell her to get changed .
She
looks 14 .
It 's frightening , but I do n't
know what I can do to stop her acting
and dressing like a mini adult . "
Experts
in America have already warned that a
generation of young girls are being
psychologically damaged by the
relentless marketing of inappropriate
' sexy ' clothing and toys .
And it 's the
same on this side of the Atlantic .
Last year , Tesco was forced to
remove the Peekaboo pole - dancing
kit from the toys and games section of
its website , and a couple of years ago ,
Asda provoked a furore for selling
inappropriately adult lingerie for
children , including thongs and push - up
black lace bras .
The Daily Mail columnist Bel Mooney ,
who lectures on the role pornography
plays in society , says : " Go into town
centres and you see pre-teen girls
dressed as go - go dancers in mini skirts
or navel - showing jeans with skimpy
crop tops over their flat chests .
" Do parents have to hammer the nails
in the coffin of innocence themselves ? "
Set stories such as this together with
the release of a UN study in February
which said British children were the
unhappiest and unhealthiest in the
developed world , and a very worrying
picture of Britain 's young girls begins to
emerge .
And what is especially worrying of all
is the role of parents in all this and what
appears to be an increasing inability to
say ' no ' .
Belle 's mother Cheryl says : " I suppose
the obvious response is that I could
stop her , but the trouble is all her friends
are dressing and acting like this , and she
says it would make her too different . "
Elima , mother of Karolina and Daniela ,
adds : " My partner rolls his eyes at the
girls ' beauty regime and says they
should be concentrating on their studies .
" But I do n't see anything wrong with
what they are doing . "
Meanwhile Catherine says her
husband David is unhappy about
Bethany 's obsession with beauty .
" He's
always telling her : ' You 've got to be a
child and that means you should n't be
standing in front of the mirror putting
make - up on . '
" I would n't let her wear heels or
low - cut tops because that definitely sexualises
children , but I do n't worry about
Bethany wearing make - up . "
Gail Odell admits encouraging her
12 - year - old daughter , Sarah - Jane , to
be a model .
Last year she took part in
the Miss Britain junior beauty competition
and wore a sexy , low - cut black
wrap - over evening dress and make - up .
" She absolutely loved it , " says 42 - year - old
Gail , who runs an antique business
in Warwickshire with her husband , Tom
and is also mother to 18 - month - old
Chloe , Markus , five , Warren , 16 , Lee , 17
and Craig , 20 .
She says : " People might
have a problem with children dressing
up like this , but I think that modelling
will be a very good career for her .
She's
very photogenic and a very pretty little
girl .
" It was my idea for her to take part —
we got into it after her little sister Chloe
got some modelling work .
People had
told me that Chloe ought to model
because she was such a lovely baby .
" I then looked at Sarah - Jane and
realised she had potential , too .
I think
competitions like pre-teen pageants are
fun — what harm can they do ? "
Perhaps we should not be surprised
that in a world where Jordan writes a
novel and it shoots to the top of the
best - seller list , girls are growing up to
believe that looks hold the key to
everything worth striving for .
At home in Woolwich , South - East
London , seven - year - old Kayla Kirby -
Archer loves nothing better than to
have her hair styled and make - up
applied .
She loves the ballgown and
tiara she wore when she won the first
Little Miss British Isles beauty pageant
last October .
" I saw the competition advertised
on the internet , " says her 28 - year - old
mother Donna , a full - time married
mother of three .
" It did wonders for
her confidence and she walked
away with the title , a quad bike ,
£ 200 , a modelling portfolio and an
electric scooter .
" We 're saving the
money to take her shopping for
outfits when she goes to have
more photos taken for her portfolio
soon . "
According to Donna , Kayla's
fascination with make - up began
when she was six years old .
She is
already asking her mother if she
can have her legs waxed .
For many , such behaviour may
seem hard to fathom , but experts
from the American Psychological
Association point an accusing
finger at toys such as Bratz dolls ,
voted Girls
Toy of the Year in the
UK in 2002 , which come with eye
make - up , miniskirts , fishnet
stockings and feather boas , and
embrace the slogan ' passion for
fashion ' .
Is it surprising then that
young girls are receiving such
mixed messages ?
In reality however , it appears
it 's the parents who ultimately
believe that beauty , success and
financial security go hand in
hand .
" It 's their decision to model and
if they did n't want to then I
would n't force them , " says Elima
of her twins .
Catherine Conheeney says :
" Bethany will need to be slim to
be a model but I 'm working hard
to explain that she needs the
right balance of food to make
sure she 's healthy .
I 've just
entered her for a modelling
competition to find the next
Kate Moss . "
Of course , some parents might
feel that there is time enough to
worry about such things .
And for those that do , the only
way to fight back against
pressures is surely to allow
children to remain children so
they can enjoy the few precious
years of innocent freedom
granted to them before they
reach adulthood .
It 's that time again .
For a refresher course on keynote bingo , see the explanation accompanying the Macworld 2007 bingo card .
For WWDC 2007 , it 's the same deal : one card , no easy wins .
As usual , some unmarked squares from past cards have been carried over .
Hope springs eternal .
There are a few notable absences this time .
Most glaringly , there 's nothing about the iPod or iTunes .
I just could n't think of anything related to those two products that 's both exciting and remotely likely to be announced at WWDC .
HD content or something in the iTunes store , maybe , but that 's pretty boring .
And I just can't imagine the inevitable OS X - based iPods being announced until after the iPhone launches .
ZFS only gets its traditional " mention " square ( which has yet to be checked ) rather than the expected " ZFS replaces HFS + " or " Leopard boots from ZFS " squares .
If either of those things happens , you can check the " ZFS mentioned " square anyway , but I 'm hedging my bets on any sweeping ZFS integration .
Of course , as with the OS X iPods and Leopard booting ZFS , I 'll be happy to be proven wrong .
The official card is in PDF format , as usual :

Finally , a refresher on the rules .
If you 're going to the keynote in person , print out the bingo card and play along live .
The first person in the audience to win the game is expected to yell " BINGO ! " loud enough so that the rest of us can hear it when we watch the keynote webcast video later .
If we can't actually hear you , it 's also acceptable if Steve Jobs hears you on stage and indicates this in some way ... perhaps , by having you thrown out or " disappeared . "
Hey , no guts , no glory !

This past April , Vancouver resident Dr. Paul Tinari became the first Canadian man to have a heath - care - funded foreskin restoration .
When he was eight years old , doctors at his school performed an operation without his consent .
After years of painful erections , and frequent infections , Dr. Tinari -- with the support of his doctor and psychiatrist -- successfully sued , and as a result , the B.C. Ministry of Health paid for 90 per cent of the $ 12,000 operation .
Dr. Tinari says he hopes that it will set a precedent for legal action that will eventually end the practice of infant circumcision all together .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Dr. Tinari , an engineer , considers himself uniquely authorized to discuss the subject of circumcision .
" I was uncircumcised until I was eight , then circumcised until I was 48 , and am now again uncircumcised , so I really have seen all sides of this issue . "
Tinari , a Metis , describes being held down and circumcised as a young boy in what he says was " a routine form of punishment " for masturbation at residential schools .
He claims that thousands of young native and Metis boys were circumcised during their stays in the residential school system .
Dr. Tinari's case and his efforts to bring awareness to the issue are the most recent instalments in a movement against what the medical establishment calls routine , non-therapeutic male circumcision .
North America has the highest rates in the world for this procedure , but currently , no regional , national or international medical body in the western world advocates its practice .
In fact , many , like the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. , recommend against it .
Historically , many doctors performed circumcisions believing there were psychological and medical benefits , but anti-circumcision advocates say that since these medical benefits have now been disproved , the issue is one of cruelty .
Dr. Tinari says his intention is to rectify what he sees as " human rights abuse " and a " gross violation " of a small child 's body .
A brief history of the hoody
The history of circumcision in North America is tied to attitudes towards masturbation .
In the late 1800s , for example , Dr. John Harvey Kellogg ( who invented Kellogg 's Corn Flakes and believed that bland foods curb passions ) was considered the leading circumcision authority .
" A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision , " Kellogg wrote in his 1888 book , Treatment for Self Abuse and its Effects .
" The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind , especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment . "
Many doctors followed his advice , performing circumcisions without anesthetic on male and female babies .
At the time , doctors performed female circumcision by dripping carbolic acid on the genitalia .
Unlike male circumcision , this practice did not endure to the present day .
By the turn of the century , medical journals regularly directly listed male circumcision as a cure or prevention for many illnesses and even criminality .
In 1928 , the American Medical Association published a journal article in which renowned British doctor R.W. Cockshut wrote : " I suggest all male children be circumcised .
I am convinced that masturbation is much less common in the circumcised . "
From dirty to clean
The sexual revolution may have brought a greater acceptance of masturbation , but by 1970 , 90 per cent of all North American boys were being routinely circumcised .
Now , many parents who opt to have their sons circumcised say they do so for reasons of cleanliness .
Dennis Harrison , another Vancouver resident , is one of the main spokespeople for the Association for Genital Integrity , a Canadian group committed to raising public awareness of the issues surrounding infant male circumcision .
His group applied for funding to start a legal process to end what he describes as unjust genital mutilation .
The group was turned down and is now appealing the process .
" I think the whole thing hinges on the cultural perception of the foreskin as being just a problem waiting to happen .
The ' circumcision decision ' is then framed as ' Do we get rid of it at birth , or expose the kid to the risk of urinary tract infections , cancer and God knows what else ? '
On the surface , this seems like a rational approach but it 's analogous to ' Do we chop off the little finger at birth , or wait for it to get caught in the car door or develop cancer ? '
You could use this logical framework to justify cutting off practically anything , because what body part never causes problems ? " he says .
The medical profession has undergone a radical change of opinion regarding circumcision over the past few years .
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia published a paper in 2004 stating that due to insufficient proof of its benefits , " routine infant male circumcision , i.e. routine removal of normal tissue in a healthy infant , is not recommended . "
The snip in Saskatchewan
In February 2002 , the College of Physicians in Saskatchewan issued a much more strongly worded memo on the subject that states :
In spite of the fact that the Canadian Pediatric Society ( CPS ) has for two and a half decades explicitly cautioned against routine circumcision of newborn male infants , 27.6 per cent of newborn males were circumcised in the province in 2000 - 2001 .
Since August 1996 , infant circumcision has not been a publicly insured service in Saskatchewan .
The decision to de-insure the service was based partly on the lack of valid medical indications for the procedure .
Even though citizens must now personally pay for this service , the incidence of routine male circumcision has dropped only moderately over the past five years .
It is difficult to identify any other domain of medicine in which physicians would feel comfortable playing such a passive role in a decision pathway culminating in surgery .
It is also difficult to identify any other domain of medicine in which practice patterns stand in such stark contrast to research evidence .
At present , no regional , national or international public health authority in the western world advocates the routine circumcision of children , either male or female .
However , several studies have found some medical advantages for the practice .
One study found that " male circumcision is associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa , particularly those at high risk of HIV , " but the study does point out that circumcision does not prevent HIV infection .
Others found little or no difference in HIV rates for circumcised men .
Still , many non-medical people assume there is a sound medical basis for circumcising infant boys .
" I find the anatomical aspect very interesting , " continues Harrison .
" When medicalized circumcision first took off , 100 years ago or so , the foreskin could [ supposedly ] potentially cause everything from curvature of the spine to insanity .
Then for a while the foreskin became nothing -- a mere ' fold of skin . '
Now it 's something again , but it ' causes ' AIDS .
So the anatomy keeps changing , as required to support circumcision .
Suggestions that the foreskin has useful functions are ignored or downplayed . "
Useful tip
It was another Canadian , Dr. John Taylor , who first started doing research into just what those useful functions might be .
While the dense collection of nerve endings in female genitalia ( the so - called " g- spot " ) had been a focus of research and discussion for some decades already , it was n't until the mid-'90s that Dr. Taylor published his first study in what he has called the " ridged band . "
The ridged band is a ring of deeply corrugated or ridged mucous membrane lining the tip of the foreskin .
Initially , Dr. Taylor was interested in studying the tissue in order to help him make an informed decision about circumcising his own children .
What he found was that the foreskin is actually a highly specialized tissue that is comparable to an eyelid ; foreskins are actually used in eyelid replacement surgery .
Dr. Taylor says that when you remove the foreskin you are removing " half of the skin of the penis , " and large amounts of specialized mucosa , which has in it specialized nerve endings called genital nerve endings .
In simple language , according to Dr. Taylor 's research , it is the man 's foreskin that is analogous to the clitoris -- not the glans or head as is widely believed .
In an interview by Intact , an organization that seeks to end non-therapeutic male infant circumcision , Dr. Taylor was quoted as stating , " I think if you remove the vast bulk of the software from your penis , then you 're going to suffer .
If you lose all your specialized sensory nerve endings , and then the mechanism , the skin , and the rest of the penis that makes these nerve endings work , during sexual intercourse , or whatever , then you 'll suffer .
Obviously people who are circumcised do n't miss what they 've never had .
It 's like someone who was born blind , I guess .
Now whether that 's because they compensate , or do it in some different way , I do n't know .
No one knows . "
While most people think of the foreskin as a fairly small section of skin , Dr. Taylor 's research indicates that the proportion is relatively large for a baby .
In a female , the equivalent would be about the same as removing the clitoral hood and labia , a practice that most of the westernized world openly abhors .
What 's good for the goose
Several doctors and lawyers told The Tyee that Canadian doctors are increasingly being asked to circumcise girls .
By law , doctors cannot perform the surgery since even though male circumcision is still legal in North America , female circumcision has been banned through protective legislation in both Canada and the U.S.
But doctors are being asked to do the operation anyway in order to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of the families .
Anti-circumcision advocates say this begs the question : when there is no medical reason to perform the surgery for either sex , why do most Canadians consider the practice to be mutilation for women , and not for men ?
" While a doctor would never perform a vasectomy on a baby -- which is reversible , " Tinari states , " you can get a circumcision done , which is not .
Male circumcision is a feminist issue : as long as the door is open to male circumcision , then it is also open to female . "
' Conspiracy of silence '
Tinari argues that " there is a conspiracy of silence around circumcision .
First of all , the men who have been circumcised do n't want to admit that there might be anything wrong with them , and they certainly would n't want to face that they had made a bad decision for their sons . "
Tinari claims that " circumcision is also a multi-billion - dollar industry in Canada and the U.S. " and that one doctor in the Lower Mainland of B.C. claims to have performed 20,000 circumcisions over the past decade , charging around $ 250 per procedure .
" There is the resale value , " says Tinari .
He is referring to the fact that human foreskins are a highly valuable tissue that can be grown in a lab to the size of a football field .
The foreskin has more blood cells and nerve endings than almost any other skin on the body .
Most baby foreskins are used in insulin production , breathable bandages , and in the cosmetics industry .
People like Tinari wonder why the sale of all other human tissue is considered illegal , or is highly regulated , yet doctors are allowed to remove healthy tissue without the patient 's consent and against all medical recommendations , then sell it for profit in a for - profit industry .
Dr. Tinari estimates that between the surgery and the foreskin's resale value , each foreskin is worth approximately $ 100,000 .
His intention is to launch a legal battle , which he will call " The Head Tax " in which he aims to restore at least 10 per cent of that figure to the portion of the 10 million men in Canada who had the procedure non-consensually .
But while Tinari says the issue is a moral one , he aims to fight it on the financial front .
" When the cost of lawsuits exceeds the money that they are making from the surgery , that is when it 's going to end .
It wo n't end before that .
Some people will join the class action lawsuit for the money , and although I would hope they did for moral reasons ....
I do n't care why they join . "
As for his surgery ?
Tinari says he is very happy , " in every way , " with his new skin .

FOR decades business has been booming .
Over the years rival operators have found ways to lift production , they have devised inventive supply chains that reach across the globe and have expanded markets so that they supply loyal consumers in almost every country .
Estimates are hard to confirm , not least because enterprises have been reluctant to open their accounts to public scrutiny , but the industry was thought to claim global annual sales of some $ 320 billion in 2005 ( tax free ) .
And although some better - known trade bodies ( the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels , for example ) have been forced to close shop , largely as a result of tough state regulation , the industry as a whole remains in rude health .
But are the heady days coming to an end ?
A UN report released on Tuesday June 26th suggests that prospects for expansion in parts of the industry are dim .
Although 5 % of adults are thought to have taken illicit drugs of some sort over the past year , the use of softer brands such as cannabis and amphetamines has apparently reached a peak .
In America , for example , cannabis use was highest in 1979 when more than 16 % of the general population took it .
By 2005 that had declined to just 10.4 % of the population .
As troubling for the industry , many consumers in the extremely important American market are turning up their noses at cocaine .
By 2005 cocaine use in America was down to 2.3 % of the general population , more than 50 % lower than the rate two decades ago .
Compounding woes in that sector producers of coca ( the raw material for cocaine ) have seen cultivation decline in recent years .
At its peak in 2000 some 221,300 hectares were under coca cultivation in Latin America .
Last year that had dropped to just 159,600 hectares .
Stagnant growth in these sectors is troubling for the industry .
As great a concern , however , may be logistics .
The supply chain is coming under greater scrutiny from regulators who wield powers that are the envy of watchdogs in other industries .
Fiercer regulation by law - enforcement agencies and , increasingly , by armies and navies , is deterring some producers and sellers , for example those coca-growers in Latin America .
The UN report suggests that , globally , seizures of cocaine and heroin have leapt since 1999 .
In some quarters , programmes to persuade impoverished farmers to switch to legal crops have curbed supplies of raw materials .
One part of the industry , however , seems to be blossoming as never before .
The heroin sector is enjoying a consumer boom in many countries , coinciding with record production in Afghanistan .
In 2006 the global output of opium which is used to make heroin , the hardest of drugs , reached an all - time - high , with producers in Afghanistan dominating the market ( see chart ) .
In the 1980s the country produced just 30 % of the world 's opium supply , but it has since — despite years of war — boosted output significantly and now accounts for 92 % of world supply .
A single province , Helmand , is said to have 70,000 hectares of opium under cultivation .
In Afghanistan , at least , efforts to persuade farmers to turn to legal but less profitable crops have had no effect whatsoever .
But heroin producers and traders aside , enterprises within the illegal industry may now seek alternative ways to keep profits up .
If the drugs business is indeed slowing , then the gangs , such as the Mafia , may have to compete more fiercely , perhaps engaging in hostile takeovers .
Crime bosses battling for a bigger share of a slow - growing market is likely to mean much blood on the carpet .
An alternative approach could be to diversify , with enterprises using their talents and infrastructure to peddle other forms of contraband such as cigarettes , pharmaceutical drugs , endangered animals , or human slaves .
The UN report suggests such diversification is already underway .
The smartest entrepreneurs , however , may seek a way out of the illegal industry all together .
Despite those profits , it is a tough world in which to operate .
Asserting property rights is often a question of gaining and maintaining a reputation for the utmost brutality .
Secrecy restricts the pool from which bosses can draw the kind of talented and pitiless managers they need .
As for the consumers , quality control and service is in the hands of suppliers of dubious merit .
Now the opportunities for growth — heroin aside — seem limited in the industry .
To counter the problems , crime gangs now seem a lot more decentralised than in the past says to the report .
Perhaps this is the shift in management style that will help them to survive .

WHEN lasers were invented in the 1960s they were little more than an exotic curiosity — a solution looking for something to solve .
Now that lasers are found in everything from telephone cables to DVD players to the humble laser pointer , they have become almost prosaic .
Time , then , to rekindle a little glamour , by using lasers to bring about nuclear fusion , the great prize of energy research .
Next month researchers will try to persuade the European Commission to pay for the biggest laser - fusion project yet .
Nuclear fusion is a compelling idea .
The sun and stars are daily proof of the great energy released when light atomic nuclei join together .
Lots of power could be produced using very little fuel .
No greenhouse gases would be released .
The fuel is abundant , the process safe and the waste , though radioactive , is far less noxious than the stuff left over from fission .
Unfortunately , in spite of more than 50 years ' work and billions of dollars of backing , no one has yet managed to get an Earth - bound fusion reaction to produce useful energy .
The idea of using lasers to trigger fusion has a long history .
It is partly behind the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , due to be completed next year , and a slightly larger effort , called the Laser Mégajoule , in France that is a couple of years further off .
Most of the work done by Livermore 's 192 powerful lasers , focused on a spot just a millimetre or so across , will be nuclear - weapons research .
But some of the time they will blast a pellet of nuclear fuel .
The fuel will be made from two heavy forms of hydrogen , called deuterium and tritium .
Zap it from all sides simultaneously with the lasers and , scientists hope , the pellet will implode and the hydrogen nuclei will fuse .
They would form helium and a subatomic particle , called a neutron .
The neutron would carry energy that could be converted into heat .
In principle , this heat could be used , as in conventional power plants , to boil water and create steam that drives a turbine .
Taking aim
Laser fusion is the poor cousin of magnetic - confinement fusion .
That technique uses a magnetic field to hold large volumes of the same isotopes of hydrogen inside a doughnut - shaped vessel , called a tokamak .
The gas must be far hotter than the dense matter at the centre of the sun for fusion to happen .
At such temperatures atoms are stripped down to their electrically charged components , so the helium created by fusion remains within the magnetic bottle .
But the electrically neutral neutrons escape to the walls of the vessel where the energy they carry can be used to generate power .
Construction of the world 's main demonstration power plant that will use magnetic confinement is under way at Cadarache in France .
It is a joint project between America , most of the European Union , Japan , China , India , Russia and South Korea .
Called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) , it will cost some $ 5 billion to build , $ 5 billion to run for 20 years and a further $ 1 billion to decommission .
The builders should have moved out by 2016 .
Laser scientists want a slice of this action .
Their bid to the European Union is to build an international laboratory , called “ HiPER ” , to run in parallel with the ITER machine .
Bureaucrats in Brussels are interested .
Canada and Russia have become involved and talks are under way with America , China , Japan and South Korea .
The price tag is relatively cheap : a mere $ 1 billion .
HiPER would use a promising new “ fast ignition ” technique .
This laser - fusion technique was achieved in 2001 by Ryosuke Kodama and colleagues at Osaka University in Japan .
The standard approach , being pursued in America and France , works like a diesel engine by compressing the fuel until it ignites .
This calls for the lasers to be very finely tuned and the fuel pellet to be perfectly smooth , so that the implosion is symmetrical and fusion occurs .
The fast - ignition technique is more like a petrol engine : first the fuel is compressed and only then is it ignited by a second laser pulse — acting as a spark plug — that is fired through a hole in the pellet .
The upshot is that nuclear fusion can happen using rough - and - ready lasers and rough - and - ready fuel .
Fast ignition also takes less powerful lasers , because the reaction rides on the energy contained in the pellet after the first pulse .
So it is more efficient , too .
Japan 's laser - fusion programme is like the proposed European one , but is smaller in scale .
It does , however , have the advantage of already having started , so future upgrades will give a chance to compare results from the Japanese machine with the American and French results , which are expected in the next few years .
Lasers offer some obvious advantages over magnetic confinement .
Because laser beams can run for long distances , the fuel does not have to be right next to the lasers that generate them .
This means they can be easily shielded from the damaging neutrons .
Fuel pellets can also be placed in the target site using conventional mechanical systems and these should easily be able to cope with the five mini-explosions a second needed to generate power .
There is one problem with nuclear fusion that lasers cannot solve , however : the price .
HiPER may be budgeted to cost just one tenth as much as its magnetic cousin .
But $ 1 billion is a lot of money all the same .
Whether the benefits are worth such costs remains written in the stars .
Slime Attack on Scratch
a new programming language that makes it easy to create your own interactive stories , animations , games , music , and art -- and share your creations on the web .
[ etoys is ] a media - rich authoring environment with a simple , powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end - users that runs on many platforms .
a " media authoring tool " -- software that you can download to your computer and then use to create your own media or share and play with others .
Another week , and another piece of One Laptop Per Child software aiming to turn kids into programming maestros before the distractions of puberty .
After four years research , a subset of MIT 's seemingly limitless supply of boffin filled cubicles , the rather wonderfully named " Life Long Kindergarten " unleashed " Scratch " upon the world .
In a BBC news article that coincided with its official release , their reporter , Jonathan Fildes , closed his article with a reference to a version being developed for the OLPC XO .
According to the developers , Scratch is : Scratch is written in Squeak , an open source implementation of the smalltalk language , and if you 've been following the OLPC project for a while , you 'll probably have come across the name before , usually in conjunction with etoys .
The OLPC wiki says of , etoys
And what , might you ask , is Squeak ?
According to Squeakland , the home of all things related to Squeak and education , it is : So , are all these things the same ?
Well , not exactly .
The best explanation I 've uncovered came in an email last month to the Squeakland mailing list .
In response to a query bout the suitability of etoys for a group of school children with learning disabilities , Eric Eisaman , a physics teacher who has been using Squeak etoys for a few years , pointed out that different classes respond differently to Scratch and etoys and appears to suggest that Scratch is a good introduction to etoys , which is a good introduction to squeak :
[...]
" Scratch " is a gentler approach to programming than Etoys yet lacks some of the advanced functionality . [...]
The more advanced students have shown some success in creating with the latest Full Squeak image without using Etoys . [...]
I think it 's important for the students to see growing levels of sophistication built on the same basic virtual machine going from Scratch to Etoys to Squeak to Smalltalk .
Squeak on OLPC XO
This neatly mirrors the XO 's construtivist philosophy of children learning different tools that themselves can be broken down for further inspection and scrutiny .
Squeak is the underlying language beneath both etoys and Scratch .
Both Etoys and Squeak will be pre-loaded on XOs when they are released , but whether or not Scratch is included will no doubt depend on the ironing out of a few kinks , such as a current inability to run fully functional in Linux .
Although the response to these tools has been very positive , just have a look at the number of diggs the story received when it hit the front page on Tuesday , there are a couple of vaguely worried noises emerging .
Although the tools being developed - etoys and Scratch - are without doubt well thought out and expertly implemented , two questions emerge -
Why are these tools almost exclusively " game " orientated and are the developers focusing on the tools themselves as opposed to the ability to actually learn tools .
The first question is posed by _why , a ruby developer who has put together a package called HacketyHack which teaches kids to program useful applications with simple coding and the second mirrors a recent concern shown by Mark Shuttleworth of his Shuttleworth Foundation 's efforts to develop a meaningful curriculum for young learners .
Whether such concerns are justified with regards to this specific piece of software - _why recently commented that Scratch is a positive step for Squeak - they appear to remain for the wider OLPC project .

What is Microsoft Surface ?
Microsoft Surface™ , the first commercially available surface computer from Microsoft Corp. , turns an ordinary tabletop into a vibrant , interactive surface .
The product provides effortless interaction with digital content through natural gestures , touch and physical objects .
Surface is a 30 - inch display in a table - like form factor that 's easy for individuals or small groups to interact with in a way that feels familiar , just like in the real world .
In essence , it 's a surface that comes to life for exploring , learning , sharing , creating , buying and much more .
Soon to be available in restaurants , hotels , retail establishments and public entertainment venues , this experience will transform the way people shop , dine , entertain and live .
How does Surface work ?
At a high level , Surface uses cameras to sense objects , hand gestures and touch .
This user input is then processed and the result is displayed on the surface using rear projection .
What is surface computing ?
Surface computing is a new way of working with computers that moves beyond the traditional mouse - and - keyboard experience .
It is a natural user interface that allows people to interact with digital content the same way they have interacted with everyday items such as photos , paintbrushes and music their entire life : with their hands , with gestures and by putting real - world objects on the surface .
Surface computing opens up a whole new category of products for users to interact with .
What are the key attributes of surface computing ?
Surface computing has four key attributes :
• Direct interaction .
Users can actually " grab " digital information with their hands and interact with content by touch and gesture , without the use of a mouse or keyboard .
• Multi -touch contact .
Surface computing recognizes many points of contact simultaneously , not just from one finger , as with a typical touch screen , but up to dozens and dozens of items at once .
• Multi-user experience .
The horizontal form factor makes it easy for several people to gather around surface computers together , providing a collaborative , face - to - face computing experience .
• Object recognition .
Users can place physical objects on the surface to trigger different types of digital responses , including the transfer of digital content .
How does Surface benefit consumers ?
Surface breaks down the traditional barriers between people and technology , providing effortless interaction with digital content .
Similar to the way ATMs changed how people got money from the bank , Microsoft is changing the way people will interact with all kinds of everyday content , including photos , music , a virtual concierge and games .
Common , everyday tasks become entertaining , enjoyable and engaging , alone or face - to - face with family , friends or co-workers .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Apple and EMI will reveal a ground - breaking deal on Monday for Apple to sell the music label ’s songs free from copy protection limits , the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday .
Ringo holds a gold - plated drum as the other Beatles look on in a 1964 ceremony in Chicago .
Apple Inc. and EMI Group will reveal a ground - breaking deal on Monday for Apple to sell the music label 's songs free from copy protection limits , the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday .
REUTERS /PRNewsFoto
The report said music giant EMI plans to sell “ significant amounts ” of its catalogue without anti-piracy software , citing people familiar with the matter , and that the music label is considering not only Apple ’s iTunes stores but other outlets .
However , a separate source familiar with the situation told Reuters a Beatles deal was not the focus of Monday ’s event .
“ There is no Beatles ’ announcement , ” the source said .
EMI has acted as the distributor for the Beatles since the early 1960s , but the Fab Four ’s music holding company Apple Corps has been a high - profile hold - out from Internet music services like Apple ’s iTunes .
Spokesmen for Apple and EMI declined to comment on the newspaper report .
EMI said earlier on Sunday that the company will hold a news conference on Monday at its London headquarters , where EMI Chief Executive Eric Nicoli will be joined by Apple Chief Executive and co-founder Steve Jobs .
A live Webcast of the event , which will feature " a special live performance " , will be available at www.emigroup.com beginning at 1 p.m. local time in London .
Earlier this year , Jobs called on the world ’s four major record companies , including EMI , to start selling songs online without copy - protection software , known as DRM , for digital rights management .
DRM software is designed to thwart piracy but also makes using music cumbersome for many consumers .
Jobs argued that there appeared to be no benefit for the record companies in selling more than 90 percent of their music without DRM on compact discs , while selling the remaining small percentage of music online encumbered with DRM .
Executives at several rival record companies said they expected EMI to drop DRM but questioned whether EMI had done sufficient market research to justify the move .
“ It ’s problematic , ” said one executive .
“ EMI have n’t tested it enough so they do n’t know what the market reaction is going to be to open MP3s . ”
MP3s are an open audio format that allows digital music fans to share songs or albums with other listeners .
The music industry has shunned the standard in favour of formats that require some form of copy protection .
“ The issues are will MP3s help expand the market and how will it affect piracy ?
We just do n’t know , ” the executive said .
All the major record companies have experimented with digital music sales without anti-piracy with varying results .
EMI ’s biggest market test was with Norah Jones ’ single “ Thinking About You ” in January , while Sony BMG tested the market with Jessica Simpson ’s “ A Public Affair ” last summer .
In an e-mail to reporters , EMI said the two companies would announce “ an exciting new digital offering ” .
The e-mail sparked speculation among bloggers and news media that the announcement could involve putting the Beatles ’ music catalogue online .
In A Race to the Bottom : Privacy Ranking of Internet Service Companies , Privacy International spray - paints the façades of landmark companies that line today 's Main Street on the Web .
The painted colors are assessments of each company 's performance on privacy issues .
Though the rankings are colorful , what they say is n't pretty .

: Black : Google 
" Track history of ignoring privacy concerns .
Every corporate announcement involves some new practice involving surveillance .
Privacy officer tries to reach out but no indication that this has any effect on product and service design or delivery .
:
According to the report , " The analysis employs a methodology comprising around twenty core parameters .
We rank the major Internet players but we also discuss examples of best and worst privacy practice among smaller companies . "
The " initial assessments " describe performance in ten areas :
Company administrative details Corporate leadership Data collection and processing Data retention Openness and transparency Responsiveness Ethical compass Customer control Fair gateways Privacy enhancing or invading innovations
As for motivation , Privacy International says ,
We are increasingly concerned about the recent dynamics in the marketplace .
While a number of companies have demonstrated integrity in handling personal information ( and we have been surprised by the number of ' social networking ' sites which are taking some of these issues quite seriously ) , we are witnessing an increased ' race to the bottom ' in corporate surveillance of customers .
Some companies are leading the charge through abusive and invasive profiling of their customers ' data .
This trend is seen by even the most privacy friendly companies as creating competitive disadvantage to those who do not follow that trend , and in some cases to find new and more innovative ways to become even more surveillance - intensive .
We felt that consumers want to know about these surveillance practices so that they can make a better - informed decision about how , whether and with whom they should share their personal information .
We also believe that companies need to be more open about how they process information and why it is processed .
Most importantly , we wanted to indicate to the marketplace that their surveillance and tracking activities are being scrutinised .
So the idea here is n't just to expose shortcomings , but to put pressure on these services .
But one wonders ...
Why would all these companies suck so badly at respecting privacy ?
I believe there are two reasons : 1 ) Growth in adoption of advertising - based revenue model that Google pioneered , and now provides for millions of companies , and 2 ) Absence of privacy ( or any ) control on the user 's side other than refusal to cooperate .
As Privacy International puts it , privacy and advertising are strange bedfellows :
The current frenzy to " capture " ad space revenue through the exploitation of new technologies and tools will result in one of the greatest privacy challenges in recent decades .
The Internet appears to be shifting as a whole toward this aim ...
Although the Net itself is n't shifting anywhere ( it 's a quibble , but " the Internet " is not the same as the collection of websites and services that reside on it ) , there is a failure of imagination around business models other than retailing and advertising .
Especially advertising .
And there 's a pile of money in advertising .
Especially for Google , which is moving toward a de facto monopoly on the business , if it is n't there already .
In March ComScore published its latest numbers on share of online searches .
Google was a hair under 50 % , and going steadily up while everybody else was going down .
In " searches per user " nobody else came close to Google .
But Google 's business model is n't search .
It gets because effects off search .
Search is free .
But because of search , Google makes money with advertising .
That 's its business model .
Part of that business model is putting millions of individuals and companies into the same business .
You do n't need to sell a single ad to support your site or your blog with advertising .
Google AdSense does all the work .
It not only does that work for millions of businesses , but creates millions of businesses where before there were none .
The Internet Advertising Bureau and Price Waterhouse say online advertising was $ 4.9 billion in Q1 of 2007 .
Google advertising revenues in the same quarter were $ 3.627450 billion .
Do the math .
" Google Network Web Sites " reveneues were $ 1.345329 billion .
Those revenues were Google 's side of the advertising take .
The rest of the money went to the site owners .
To make advertising of this sort work best requires maximizing intelligence about users .
Does this also require privacy violations ?
The last quoted paragraph above seems to suggest as much .
So I have a question for both Google and Privacy International : Could Google and its partners do as good a job in the advertising business if they did everything it takes to get a green score ?
While we 're pondering that , let 's look at the second problem .
Online privacy as we know it today is almost entirely at the grace of the vendors we deal with .
The terms are theirs .
We accept them or we do n't .
Other than opting out , we do n't have much control on our side .
We can't , for example , make a global assertion of anonymity to the world , and then selectively reveal pieces of identity information to vendors , on a private and need - to - know basis that we determine .
For the most part we have those privileges when we shop at stores in the physical world .
But in the online world we are much more compromised by conditions that are beyond our control .
We can be tagged and tracked like animals and never know it .
These conditions will stay out of our control as long as we continue to believe that markets are about supply chasing down and " capturing " demand .
There has to be a better way  one that serves demand at least as well as it serves supply .
Whatever that better way is , advertising is part of the problem , not the solution .
Even as Google and others put millions more of us into business , it 's still the advertising business .
And that business is driven entirely by its supply side .
Follow the money .
Advertisers pay Google and its partners for click - throughs .
By making advertising accountable for performance , Google moved the whole category forward an enormous distance .
But it 's still advertising .
And advertising is still woefully inefficient .
For every click - through there are hundreds , thousands or millions of " impressions " or " exposures " that are actually neither .
They are noise .
Instead of wasting trees ( as print media do ) or time ( as broadcasting does ) , they waste server cycles , packets and pixels .
Those come cheap , but they 're still waste , still noise , still clutter .
They are distractions , and they get in the way .
We can't leave privacy solutions entirely up to large suppliers .
That can't work .
We can only solve privacy problems by equipping individuals with better ways to control and reveal private information while also finding what they want in the networked world .
Until we do that , Privacy International will still be ranking sites with colors other than green .
By the way , next week in San Francisco , leading up to Supernova 2007 , there will be an open space workshop at Wharton West .
While the Supernova theme is " The New Network " , the open space workshop can cover any topic we like .
Vendor Relationship Management ( which seeks to solve the " advertising problem " , among other things ) is on the list of proposed session topics ( we 'll choose those as a group at the start of the day ) .
So are some other excellent topics  including whatever you want to add to the wiki or tell the group about when the day starts .
The cost is $ 25 .
Includes lunch .
My own fantasy about this is that we get actual developers  folks who write code  to come and help the rest of us work this out .
If that 's you , please come .
There are some pretty big itches to scratch here .
Brazilian police on Monday admitted that a 13 - year - old boy was killed by a gunshot in the head while police were carrying out a mock anti-hijack operation .
The boy , Luis Henrique Dias Bulhoes , was killed on Saturday while sixteen police officers were carrying out a mock anti-hijack operation in the city of Rondonopolis , police said .
The cops pretended that they were getting shot at by fake criminals , made of cardboard , and fired back in self defense .
Their shotguns were loaded with real ammunition , and the bullets went through the cardboard targets and the bus glass window , hitting the audience .
Luis Henrique Dias Bulhoes was killed by a single shot from one of the 12 - gauge shotguns being used by three of the policemen .
Ten other people were also injured .
Police believe that bullets from more than one of the guns accidentally reached the audience .
Seven of the 16 policemen involved in the operation were temporarily dismissed from their positions , while investigations are underway , according to the police .

Dog owners have long maintained that their pooches have a lot more going on between their furry ears than scientists acknowledge .
Now , new research is adding to the growing evidence that man 's best friend thinks a lot more than many humans have believed .
The provocative new experiment indicated that dogs can do something that previously only humans , including infants , have been shown capable of doing : decide how to imitate a behavior based on the specific circumstances in which the action takes place .
" The fact that the dogs imitate selectively , depending on the situation — that has not been shown before , " said Friederike Range , of the University of Vienna , who led the study .
" That 's something completely new . "
' Breaking down the lines '
The findings come amid a flurry of research that is revealing surprisingly complex abilities among dogs , chimps , birds and many other animals long dismissed as having little intellectual or emotional life .
" Every day , we 're discovering surprises about animals and finding out animals are far more intelligent and far more emotional than we previously thought , " said Marc Bekoff , an animal behaviorist retired from the University of Colorado .
" We 're really breaking down the lines between the species . "
The study was inspired by research with human infants .
Fourteen - month - olds will imitate an adult turning on a light with her forehead only if they see her doing it with her hands free .
If the adult is clutching a blanket , infants will use their hands , presumably because they can reason that the adult resorted to using her forehead because she had no choice .
Testing the dogs
To determine whether an animal could respond similarly , Range and her colleagues trained Guinness , a female border collie , to push a wooden rod with her paw to get a treat .
A dog generally does not use its paws to do tasks , preferring to use its mouth whenever possible .
So the key question was whether dogs that watched Guinness would decide how to get the treat depending on the circumstances .
After making sure the owners could not influence their pets ' behavior , researchers tested three groups of dogs .
The first 14 , representing a variety of breeds , did not watch Guinness .
When taught how to use the rod , about 85 percent pushed it with their mouth , confirming that is how dogs naturally like to do things .
The second group of 21 dogs watched Guinness repeatedly push the rod with her paw while holding a ball in her mouth .
In that group , most of the dogs — about 80 percent — used their mouth , imitating the action but not the exact method .
That suggested the dogs — like the children — decided Guinness was only using her paw because she had no choice .
The third group of 19 dogs watched Guinness repeatedly use a paw on the rod with her mouth free .
Most of those dogs — 83 percent — imitated her behavior exactly , using their paws and not their mouth .
That suggested they concluded there must be some good reason to act against their instincts and do it like Guinness .
" The behavior was very similar to the children who were tested in the original experiment , " said Zsofia Viranyi , of Eotvos University in Budapest , who helped conduct the experiment , published in the journal Current Biology .
" Whether they imitate or not depends on the context .
It 's not automatic , insightless copying .
It 's more sophisticated .
There 's a kind of inferential process going on . "
Viranyi and her colleagues said more research is needed to confirm the results and to explore what the findings say about the canine brain .

Banaz Mahmod , 20 , was strangled with a bootlace and her body buried in a suitcase in a back garden last January because her Iraqi Kurdish family disapproved of her Iranian Kurdish boyfriend , the Old Bailey heard .
Mahmod Mahmod , 52 , and his brother , Ari Agha Mahmod , 51 , of Mitcham , south London , were found guilty after a three - month trial at the London court .
Darbaz Maref - Rasull , 24 , of Hounslow , west London , was cleared , with Ari Mahmod , of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
Pshtewan Hama , 26 , also of Hounslow , had already pleaded guilty on the same count .
The jury was told that Mohamad Hama , 30 , of West Norwood , south London , an associate of Ari Mahmod , had already pleaded guilty to the murder .
He killed Ms Mahmod at the instigation of her family , Victor Temple , prosecuting , said .
Ms Mahmod told police at least four times that she feared they wanted to kill her , even writing a letter naming those who she thought would do it - one of whom later admitted his part in the killing and two who fled the country .
On another occasion her fears were dismissed by a female police officer who thought she had made up the story to get the attention of her boyfriend , Rahmat Sulemani .
Police today admitted they needed to " take stock " of the lessons to be learned during the investigation .
During the proceedings , the jury watched a mobile phone recording of Ms Mahmod , made by Mr Sulemani after an earlier attempt on Ms Mahmod 's life .
In the recording she claimed her father forced her to drink brandy to make her sleepy .
" It was in a black plastic bag like in Kurdistan , " she said .
" He said , ' Open it up and drink it bit by bit ' . "
She became frightened after her father came back into the room wearing gloves .
The curtains were drawn and cartoons were playing on the television .
" I was really scared and got up to leave the room .
He said , ' sit down , sit down ' . "
When her father left again she escaped by a back door and tried to raise the alarm by smashing neighbours ' windows .
The video was filmed by Mr Suleimani on a hospital trolley , at St George 's in Tooting , on New Year 's Eve 2005 , and was played in court on video screens .
Ms Mahmod fled but later went back to her family and tried to carry on her relationship with Mr Sulemani in secret .
But when they were discovered and Mr Sulemani was threatened by Ari Mahmod 's associates , she contacted police again .
She was urged to stay at a safe house but told officers she believed she would be safe at home because her mother was there .
The following day , on January 24 2006 , she disappeared .
Her body was discovered in Handsworth , Birmingham , three months later .
A number of police officers face an internal disciplinary investigation over the handling of the case .
Commander Simon Bray , in overall charge of the murder inquiry , called Operation Braidland , admitted honour - based crime was difficult for police to " identify and investigate " .
" Following Banaz 's murder it is necessary for us to take stock on the progress we have made in tackling HBV [ honour - based violence ] and to continue to identify ways in which we can improve our response , " he said .
" Banaz contacted the MPS [ Metropolitan police service ] on a number of occasions and we did take action in all of those cases .
Whether those actions were appropriate will be a matter for the directorate of professional standards review . "
During the inquiry , 47 premises were searched , 22 people arrested , 16 vehicles seized , 779 statements taken and 1253 documents created , police said .
A total of 2254 exhibits were collected and 26 interviews conducted , amounting to 113 tapes .
Mr Sulemani said Ms Mahmod meant the world to him .
" I do n't think there are many couples who could say that their love is stronger than mine and Banaz 's , " he said .
" I know it is too late for me and Banaz .
If there 's anyone out there in the same situation , do something about it before it 's too late .
Once it 's too late , it 's too late - you will never get your life back . "
Ms Mahmod 's family came to Britain as asylum seekers when she was 10 .
She entered an arranged marriage at the age of 17 with her family 's encouragement .
But her husband beat her and the marriage failed , so she returned to live at home .
Scientists in New Zealand have discovered that some cows have genes that give them the ability to produce skimmed milk naturally .
They say they can use this information to breed herds of milkers producing only skimmed milk .
Even better , they said they can breed herds producing milk with the unique characteristics required to make a butter that is spreadable straight from the fridge .
They have already identified a cow , Marge , with the genes required to do this and say a commercial herd is likely by 2011 .
The milk is very low in saturated fats and so should be high in polyunsaturates and monounsaturated fats .
Experts say that the discovery of these rogue milkers could completely revolutionise the dairy industry .
Ed Komorowski , technical director at Dairy UK says that the New Zealand approach could be used to breed cows that still produce full - fat milk but with only the good fats , which could swing things back in favour of full - fat milk .
In the UK , for example , only 25 % of milk sold is full fat .
‘ In future if whole milk can be made to contain unsaturated fats – which are good for you – then it might mean that people change back to whole milk products .
The big thing about dairy products is taste , so this would be a way of giving the benefits of taste without the disadvantage of saturated fats , ’ according to Komorowski .
This may also overcome the problem of waste .
‘ If you can genetically produce milk without fat then that may turn out to be a very good solution to what might later be a big disposal issue , ’ says Komorowski .
Producing skimmed and semi- skimmed milk means there is a lot of fat left over .
Komorowski noted , however , that although the lower - fat milk may be healthier , it will be interesting to see how much milk the cows actually produce .
The rogue cows were discovered when biotech company ViaLactia screened the range of milk compositions across the entire herd of 4 m New Zealand cattle .
New Zealand dairy firm Fonterra has already made milk products from Marge ’s milk and they maintain the positive taste .

The committee ’s finding of guilt against Mr. Wolfowitz was tempered by a finding that the bank shared at least some blame for the failure of Mr. Wolfowitz to comply with its rules .
According to people familiar with the report , it said the advice from ethics officials at the bank to Mr. Wolfowitz was less than clear and evidently subject to misinterpretation .
Nevertheless , the report was clear in its conclusion that Mr. Wolfowitz breached his obligations .
Mr. Wolfowitz ’s lawyer , Robert S. Bennett , said the bank was giving Mr. Wolfowitz too little time to rebut its conclusions before a board vote later this week .
“ I do n’t feel it would be appropriate to share the report , but I am deeply troubled that they have only given us 48 hours to respond , ” he said in an interview .
“ This is not fair to Mr. Wolfowitz . ”
The report , as transmitted to Mr. Wolfowitz , did not recommend any punishment for him .
Bank officials , speaking anonymously because the proceedings are supposed to be confidential , said that the special committee was still working Monday on what to recommend .
It was not clear whether the committee , consisting of 7 of the bank ’s 24 board members , would recommend removing him from office or , more likely , express a loss of confidence in his leadership in a manner intended to force his resignation .
Bank officials say the majority of the bank board has determined that he should go .
The Bush administration has repeatedly backed Mr. Wolfowitz , but President Bush and Mr. Paulson have also called for the completion of the bank ’s internal review process .
Now that that is done , the administration is likely to face renewed pressure .
European and American officials say that Mr. Paulson has said that the bank process must be respected before the United States is pushed into a position on Mr. Wolfowitz .
Several European officials said they believed that Mr. Paulson was in favor of Mr. Wolfowitz leaving , but that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were insisting on standing up for him .

It ’s simply amazing :
The United States Patent and Trademark Office claims that file - sharing sites could be setting up children for copyright infringement lawsuits and compromising national security .
“ A decade ago , the idea that copyright infringement could become a threat to national security would have seemed implausible , ” Patent and Trademark Director Jon Dudas said in a report released this week .
“ Now , it ’s a sad reality . ”
The report , which the patent office recently forwarded to the U.S. Department of Justice , states that peer - to - peer networks could manipulate sites so children violate copyright laws more frequently than adults .
That could make children the target in most copyright lawsuits and , in turn , make those protecting their material appear antagonistic , according to the report .
File - sharing software also could be to blame for government workers who expose sensitive data and jeopardize national security after downloading free music on the job , the report states .

The newly - relaunched Technorati exposes a weakness in Google ’s armor .
I just tried a bunch of searches .
Technorati does “ Live ” search MUCH MUCH better than Microsoft and even better than Google ’s Blog Search .
I predict that , with this update , Technorati will become a quick takeover target .
If I were at Microsoft I ’d be spending a few corporate hours wining and dining Dave Sifry .
Technorati is so superior to all the other blog search engines now that it is n’t even funny .
Why can 45 people at Technorati beat Google yet Microsoft , with its billions of dollars , ca n’t get any traction ?
The answer ?
Technorati is a small idea .
It takes one tiny little niche away from Google .
It does n’t try to compete with the main Google engine .
On Monday I sat next to a developer on Microsoft ’s Popfly team .
He did n’t like that I called Popfly a “ small ” idea .
I told him that was a term of endearment , not of derision .
The most interesting things on the Internet are done by small teams .
Not “ boil the ocean and try to kill Google ” teams .
Microsoft should be cheered that Technorati , a small company of 45 people , can take on Google and can build a successful SEARCH brand and experience that beats Google .
Google , on the other hand , with its billions in revenue and thousands of PhD ’s should be ashamed that it is n’t as good as Technorati .
Oh , and did n’t Blinkx go public yesterday ?
Yeah , and their stock went up !
Amazing that two little companies are making businesses in Google ’s backyard .
If I were at Google I ’d worry about that and remember Google ’s history .
It was , what , eight years ago that Google was the little upstart and companies like Yahoo and AltaVista owned the search space .
Microsoft : why have n’t you changed your search strategy yet ?
Look at your search on Live.com .
Now compare to Technorati .
Which one is more “ live ? ” Technorati by a mile .
Maybe this is what we mean when we say Microsoft is “ dead . ”
I bet some people / companies are wishing they acquired Technorati last week .
I have a feeling that their valuation just went up about $ 500 million .
At least .
UPDATE : Another example of how Microsoft ’s Internet strategy is lacking ?
Check out the new Pageflakes , TechCrunch just wrote about that .
Now compare to anything Microsoft has put out there .
In fact , compare to Google ’s “ iGoogle ” page .
How does Pageflakes measure up ?
Smaller is better !
The OneGeology portal will come online in 2008
Known as the OneGeology project , it will pool existing knowledge about what lies under our feet , and present it through one web portal .
Led by the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) , the effort calls on scientists from more than 55 nations .
It hopes to be able to display searchable rock data for the entire Earth down to the scale of 1:1,000,000 .
" There is currently a problem of accessibility , " said Ian Jackson , the OneGeology Project Leader from BGS .
" We know the data exists ; but it 's not always clear where it is , and some of it is still in paper form .
We want to make more available the data that has already being surveyed , modelled and paid for . "
' Big ' issues
The project is expected to drive new science by showing up gaps in knowledge .
It should also become a key support tool for cross-national agencies and companies that want to investigate and understand the Earth 's exploitable resources , such as its mineral and water reserves .
Professor John Ludden , executive director of BGS , cited the example of carbon capture and storage , which is being proposed as a possible solution to global warming .
This would see carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , one of the main greenhouse gases , captured at power stations and buried deep underground .
" Some of this is what I call ' big science ' - science that no one country or geological survey can do on its own , " he said .
" Geological surveys across the world are involved in trying to work out how you put CO2 underground and keep it there , and these sorts of databases are going to be required . "
The project , which has the backing of Unesco and five other global umbrella bodies , will be a centrepiece of the International Year of Planet Earth in 2008 .
Scientists would expect have the first release of their portal up and running by then .
It will present the information with the use of a " virtual globe " , in much the same way as Google Earth now presents satellite images .
National differences
Although the 1:1,000,000 scale is the goal , the project realises that for some parts of the world this simply may not be possible .
" Some nations may take a view that 1:1,000,000 is too commercially sensitive to release , " concedes Ian Jackson .
" We hope not - but at least if they can make available 1:5,000,000 scale , we can put that up , and some details about where you could go for more details . "
It is also envisaged that some work will need to be done to marry up the maps at national boundaries where geologists of connecting countries have interpreted their surface rocks slightly differently .
The portal will work on a distributed model , with national surveys retaining their data but allowing it to be interrogated through the portal using a common computer mark up language such as GeoSciML .
Much of the content - although not all of it - will be free to browse .
The OneGeology 's inaugural event is a meeting in Brighton , UK , from 12 - 16 March .

A desktop is a workspace that one uses to organize the tools of one 's trade .
Graphical desktops provide rich visual interaction for performing day - to - day computing tasks ; the goal of the audio desktop is to enable similar efficiencies in an eyes - free environment .
Thus , the primary goal of an audio desktop is to use the expressiveness of auditory output ( both verbal and nonverbal ) to enable the end user to perform a full range of computing tasks :
Ready access to local documents on the client and global documents on the Web
The Emacspeak audio desktop was motivated by the following insight : to provide effective auditory renderings of information , one needs to start from the actual information being presented , rather than a visual presentation of that information .
This had earlier led me to develop AsTeR , Audio System For Technical Readings ( http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html).
The primary motivation then was to apply the lessons learned in the context of aural documents to user interfaces — after all , the document is the interface .
The primary goal was not to merely carry the visual interface over to the auditory modality , but rather to create an eyes - free user interface that is both pleasant and productive to use .
Contrast this with the traditional screen - reader approach where GUI widgets such as sliders and tree controls are directly translated to spoken output .
Though such direct translation can give the appearance of providing full eyes - free access , the resulting auditory user interface can be inefficient to use .
These prerequisites meant that the environment selected for the audio desktop needed :
Thus , designing a clean client / server abstraction , and relying on the power of Unix I/O , has made it trivial to later run Emacspeak on a remote machine and have it connect back to a speech server running on a local client .
This enables me to run Emacspeak inside screen on my work machine , and access this running session from anywhere in the world .
Upon connecting , I have the remote Emacspeak session connect to a speech server on my laptop , the audio equivalent of setting up X to use a remote display .
Notice that so far I have said nothing explicit about how this client / server connection was opened ; this late - binding proved beneficial later when it came to making Emacspeak network - aware .
Thus , the initial implementation worked by the Emacspeak client communicating to the speech server using stdio .
Later , making this client / server communication go over the network required the addition of a few lines of code that opened a server socket and connected stdin / stdout to the resulting connection .
The net result of this design was to create separate speech servers for each available engine , where each speech server was a simple script that invoked TCL 's default readeval - print loop after loading in the relevant definitions .
The client / server API therefore came down to the client ( Emacspeak ) launching the appropriate speech server , caching this connection , and invoking server commands by issuing appropriate procedure calls over this connection .
where _say calls the underlying C implementation provided by the DECTalk software .
The speech server for the software DECTalk implemented an equivalent , simplified tts_say version that looks like :
Emacspeak speech servers are implemented in the TCL language .
The speech server for the DECTalk Express communicated with the hardware synthesizer over a serial line .
As an example , the command to speak a string of text was a proc that took a string argument and wrote it to the serial device .
A simplified version of this looks like :
The most natural way to design the system to leverage both speech options was to first implement a speech server that abstracted away the distinction between the two output solutions .
The speech server abstraction has withstood the test of time well ; I was able to add support for the IBM ViaVoice engine later , in 1999 .
Moreover , the simplicity of the client / server API has enabled open source programmers to implement speech servers for other speech engines .
I started implementing Emacspeak in October 1994 .
The target environments were a Linux laptop and my office workstation .
To produce speech output , I used a DECTalk Express ( a hardware speech synthesizer ) on the laptop and a software version of the DECTalk on the office workstation .
31.2 . Speech - Enabling Emacs
The simplicity of the speech server abstraction described above meant that version 0 of the speech server was running within an hour after I started implementing the system .
This meant that I could then move on to the more interesting part of the project : producing good quality spoken output .
Version 0 of the speech server was by no means perfect ; it was improved as I built the Emacspeak speech client .
A Simple First - Cut Implementation
A friend of mine had pointed me at the marvels of Emacs Lisp advice a few weeks earlier .
So when I sat down to speech - enable Emacs , advice was the natural choice .
The first task was to have Emacs automatically speak the line under the cursor whenever the user pressed the up / down arrow keys .
In Emacs , all user actions invoke appropriate Emacs Lisp functions .
In standard editing modes , pressing the down arrow invokes function next - line , while pressing the up arrow invokes previous - line .
To speech - enable these commands , version 0 of Emacspeak implemented the following rather simple advice fragment : ( defadvice next - line ( after emacspeak ) " Speak line after moving . " ( when ( interactive - p ) ( emacspeak - speak - line ) ) )
The emacspeak - speak - line function implemented the necessary logic to grab the text of the line under the cursor and send it to the speech server .
With the previous definition in place , Emacspeak 0.0 was up and running ; it provided the scaffolding for building the actual system .
Iterating on the First - Cut Implementation
The next iteration returned to the speech server to enhance it with a well - defined eventing loop .
Rather than simply executing each speech command as it was received , the speech server queued client requests and provided a launch command that caused the server to execute queued requests .
The server used the select system call to check for newly arrived commands after sending each clause to the speech engine .
This enabled immediate silencing of speech ; with the somewhat naïve implementation described in version 0 of the speech server , the command to stop speech would not take immediate effect since the speech server would first process previously issued speak commands to completion .
With the speech queue in place , the client application could now queue up arbitrary amounts of text and still get a high degree of responsiveness when issuing higher - priority commands such as requests to stop speech .
Implementing an event queue inside the speech server also gave the client application finer control over how text was split into chunks before synthesis .
This turns out to be crucial for producing good intonation structure .
The rules by which text should be split up into clauses varies depending on the nature of the text being spoken .
As an example , newline characters in programming languages such as Python are statement delimiters and determine clause boundaries , but newlines do not constitute clause delimiters in English text .
As an example , a clause boundary is inserted after each line when speaking the following Python code : i=1 j=2 See the section " Augmenting Emacs to create aural display lists , " later in this chapter , for details on how Python code is distinguished and its semantics are transferred to the speech layer .
With the speech server now capable of smart text handling , the Emacspeak client could become more sophisticated with respect to its handling of text .
The emacspeak - speak - line function turned into a library of speech - generation functions that implemented the following steps :
Parse text to split it into a sequence of clauses .
Preprocess text — e.g. , handle repeated strings of punctuation marks .
Carry out a number of other functions that got added over time .
Queue each clause to the speech server , and issue the launch command .
From here on , the rest of Emacspeak was implemented using Emacspeak as the development environment .
This has been significant in how the code base has evolved .
New features are tested immediately because badly implemented features can render the entire system unusable .
Lisp 's incremental code development fits naturally with the former ; to cover the latter , the Emacspeak code base has evolved to be " bushy " — i.e. , most parts of the higher - level system are mutually independent and depend on a small core that is carefully maintained .
A Brief advice Tutorial Lisp advice is key to the Emacspeak implementation , and this chapter would not be complete without a brief overview .
The advice facility allows one to modify existing functions without changing the original implementation .
What 's more , once a function f has been modified by advice m , all calls to function f are affected by advice .
advice comes in three flavors : before
The advice body is run before the original function is invoked .
after
The advice body is run after the original function has completed .
around
The advice body is run instead of the original function .
The around advice can call the original function if desired .
All advice forms get access to the arguments of the adviced function ; in addition , around and after get access to the return value computed by the original function .
The Lisp implementation achieves this magic by : Caching the original implementation of the function Evaluating the advice form to generate a new function definition Storing this definition as the adviced function
Thus , when the advice fragment shown in the earlier section " A Simple First - Cut Implementation " is evaluated , Emacs ' original next - line function is replaced by a modified version that speaks the current line after the original next - line function has completed its work .
Generating Rich Auditory Output
At this point in its evolution , here is what the overall design looked like : Emacs ' interactive commands are speech - enabled or adviced to produce auditory output .
advice definitions are collected into modules , one each for every Emacs application being speech - enabled .
The advice forms forward text to core speech functions .
These functions extract the text to be spoken and forward it to the tts - speak function .
The tts - speak function produces auditory output by preprocessing its text argument and sending it to the speech server .
The speech server handles queued requests to produce perceptible output .
Text is preprocessed by placing the text in a special scratch buffer .
Buffers acquire specialized behavior via buffer - specific syntax tables that define the grammar of buffer contents and buffer - local variables that affect behavior .
When text is handed off to the Emacspeak core , all of these buffer - specific settings are propagated to the special scratch buffer where the text is preprocessed .
This automatically ensures that text is meaningfully parsed into clauses based on its underlying grammar .
Audio formatting using voice - lock Emacs uses font - lock to syntactically color text .
For creating the visual presentation , Emacs adds a text property called face to text strings ; the value of this face property specifies the font , color , and style to be used to display that text .
Text strings with face properties can be thought of as a conceptual visual display list .
Emacspeak augments these visual display lists with personality text properties whose values specify the auditory properties to use when rendering a given piece of text ; this is called voice - lock in Emacspeak .
The value of the personality property is an Aural CSS ( ACSS ) setting that encodes various voice properties — e.g. , the pitch of the speaking voice .
Notice that such ACSS settings are not specific to any given TTS engine .
Emacspeak implements ACSS - to - TTS mappings in engine - specific modules that take care of mapping high - level aural properties — e.g. , mapping pitch or pitch - range to engine - specific control codes .
The next few sections describe how Emacspeak augments Emacs to create aural display lists and to process these aural display lists to produce engine - specific output .
Augmenting Emacs to create aural display lists
Emacs modules that implement font - lock call the Emacs built - in function put - text - property to attach the relevant face property .
Emacspeak defines an advice fragment that advices the put - text - property function to add in the corresponding personality property when it is asked to add a face property .
Note that the value of both display properties ( face and personality ) can be lists ; values of these properties are thus designed to cascade to create the final ( visual or auditory ) presentation .
This also means that different parts of an application can progressively add display property values .
The put - text - property function has the following signature : ( put- text - property START END PROPERTY VALUE &optional OBJECT )
The advice implementation is : ( defadvice put - text - property ( after emacspeak - personality pre act ) " Used by emacspeak to augment font lock . " ( let ( ( start ( ad - get- arg 0 ) ) ;; Bind arguments ( end ( ad - get - arg 1 ) ) ( prop ( ad - get- arg 2 ) ) ;; name of property being added ( value ( ad - get- arg 3 ) ) ( object ( ad - get - arg 4 ) ) ( voice nil ) ) ;; voice it maps to ( when ( and ( eq prop ' face ) ;; avoid infinite recursion ( not ( = start end ) ) ;; non-nil text range emacspeak - personality - voiceify - faces ) ( condition - case nil ; ; safely look up face mapping ( progn ( cond ( ( symbolp value ) ( setq voice ( voice - setup - get - voice - for - face value ) ) ) ( ( ems- plain - cons - p value ) ) ;; pass on plain cons ( ( listp value ) ( setq voice ( delq nil ( mapcar #' voice - setup - get - voice - for - face value ) ) ) ) ( t ( message " Got %s " value ) ) ) ( when voice ; ; voice holds list of personalities ( funcall emacspeak - personality - voiceify - faces start end voice object ) ) ) ( error nil ) ) ) ) )
Here is a brief explanation of this advice definition : Bind arguments
First , the function uses the advice built - in ad - get-arg to locally bind a set of lexical variables to the arguments being passed to the adviced function .
Personality setter
The mapping of faces to personalities is controlled by user customizable variable emacspeak - personality - voiceify - faces .
If non-nil , this variable specifies a function with the following signature : ( emacspeak - personality - put START END PERSONALITY OBJECT )
Emacspeak provides different implementations of this function that either append or prepend the new personality value to any existing personality properties .
Guard Along with checking for a non-nil emacspeak - personality - voiceify - faces , the function performs additional checks to determine whether this advice definition should do anything .
The function continues to act if :
The text range is non-nil .
The property being added is a face .
The first of these checks is required to avoid edge cases where put - text - property is called with a zero - length text range .
The second ensures that we attempt to add the personality property only when the property being added is face .
Notice that failure to include this second test would cause infinite recursion because the eventual put - text - property call that adds the personality property also triggers the advice definition .
Get mapping Next , the function safely looks up the voice mapping of the face ( or faces ) being applied .
If applying a single face , the function looks up the corresponding personality mapping ; if applying a list of faces , it creates a corresponding list of personalities .
Apply personality
Finally , the function checks that it found a valid voice mapping and , if so , calls emacspeak - personality - voiceify - faces with the set of personalities saved in the voice variable .
Audio - formatted output from aural display lists
With the advice definitions from the previous section in place , text fragments that are visually styled acquire a corresponding personality property that holds an ACSS setting for audio formatting the content .
The result is to turn text in Emacs into rich aural display lists .
This section describes how the output layer of Emacspeak is enhanced to convert these aural display lists into perceptible spoken output .
The Emacspeak tts - speak module handles text preprocessing before finally sending it to the speech server .
As described earlier , this preprocessing comprises a number of steps , including : Applying pronunciation rules Processing repeated strings of punctuation characters Splitting text into appropriate clauses based on context Converting the personality property into audio formatting codes
This section describes the tts - format - text - and - speak function , which handles the conversion of aural display lists into audio - formatted output .
First , here is the code for the function tts - format - text - and - speak : ( defsubst tts - format - text - and - speak ( start end ) " Format and speak text between start and end . " ( when ( and emacspeak - use - auditory - icons ( get - text - property start ' auditory - icon ) ) ;; queue icon ( emacspeak - queue - auditory - icon ( get - text - property start ' auditory - icon ) ) ) ( tts- interp - queue ( format " %s
" tts-voice - reset - code ) ) ( cond ( voice - lock - mode ; ; audio format only if voice - lock - mode is on ( let ( ( last nil ) ;; initialize ( personality ( get - text - property start ' personality ) ) ) ( while ( and ( < start end ) ;; chunk at personality changes ( setq last ( next - single - property - change start ' personality ( current - buffer ) end ) ) ) ( if personality ; ; audio format chunk ( tts - speak - using - voice personality ( buffer - substring start last ) ) ( tts - interp - queue ( buffer - substring start last ) ) ) ( setq start last ;; prepare for next chunk personality ( get - text - property last ' personality ) ) ) ) ) ;; no voice - lock just send the text ( t ( tts - interp - queue ( buffer - substring start end ) ) ) ) )
The tts - format - text - and - speak function is called one clause at a time , with arguments start and end set to the start and end of the clause .
If voice - lock - mode is turned on , this function further splits the clause into chunks at each point in the text where there is a change in value of the personality property .
Once such a transition point has been determined , tts - format - text - and - speak calls the function tts - speak - using - voice , passing the personality to use and the text to be spoken .
This function , described next , looks up the appropriate device - specific codes before dispatching the audio - formatted output to the speech server : ( defsubst tts - speak - using - voice ( voice text ) " Use voice VOICE to speak text TEXT . " ( unless ( or ( eq ' inaudible voice ) ;; not spoken if voice inaudible ( and ( listp voice ) ( member ' inaudible voice ) ) ) ( tts-interp - queue ( format " %s%s %s
" ( cond ( ( symbolp voice ) ( tts - get - voice - command ( if ( boundp voice ) ( symbol - value voice ) voice ) ) ) ( ( listp voice ) ( mapconcat #'( lambda ( v ) ( tts - get - voice - command ( if ( boundp v ) ( symbol - value v ) v ) ) ) voice " " ) ) ( t " " ) ) text tts- voice - reset - code ) ) ) )
The tts - speak - using - voice function returns immediately if the specified voice is inaudible .
Here , inaudible is a special personality that Emacspeak uses to prevent pieces of text from being spoken .
The inaudible personality can be used to advantage when selectively hiding portions of text to produce more succinct output .
If the specified voice ( or list of voices ) is not inaudible , the function looks up the speech codes for the voice and queues the result of wrapping the text to be spoken between voice - code and tts - reset - code to the speech server .
Using Aural CSS ( ACSS ) for Styling Speech Output I first formalized audio formatting within AsTeR , where rendering rules were written in a specialized language called Audio Formatting Language ( AFL ) .
AFL structured the available parameters in auditory space — e.g. , the pitch of the speaking voice — into a multidimensional space , and encapsulated the state of the rendering engine as a point in this multidimensional space .
AFL provided a block - structured language that encapsulated the current rendering state by a lexically scoped variable , and provided operators to move within this structured space .
When these notions were later mapped to the declarative world of HTML and CSS , dimensions making up the AFL rendering state became Aural CSS parameters , provided as accessibility measures in CSS2 ( http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/CSS2-REC).
Though designed for styling HTML ( and , in general , XML ) markup trees , Aural CSS turned out to be a good abstraction for building Emacspeak 's audio formatting layer while keeping the implementation independent of any given TTS engine .
Here is the definition of the data structure that encapsulates ACSS settings : ( defstruct acss family gain left - volume right - volume average - pitch pitch - range stress richness punctuations )
Emacspeak provides a collection of predefined voice overlays for use within speech extensions .
Voice overlays are designed to cascade in the spirit of Aural CSS .
As an example , here is the ACSS setting that corresponds to voice - monotone : [ cl - struct - acss nil nil nil nil nil 0 0 nil all ]
Notice that most fields of this acss structure are nil — that is , unset .
The setting creates a voice overlay that :
Sets pitch to 0 to create a flat voice .
Sets pitch - range to 0 to create a monotone voice with no inflection .
This setting is used as the value of the personality property for audio formatting comments in all programming language modes .
Because its value is an overlay , it can interact effectively with other aural display properties .
As an example , if portions of a comment are displayed in a bold font , those portions can have the voice - bolden personality ( another predefined overlay ) added ; this results in setting the personality property to a list of two values : ( voice - bolden voice - monotone ) .
The final effect is for the text to get spoken with a distinctive voice that conveys both aspects of the text : namely , a sequence of words that are emphasized within a comment .
Sets punctuations to all so that all punctuation marks are spoken .
Adding Auditory Icons Rich visual user interfaces contain both text and icons .
Similarly , once Emacspeak had the ability to speak intelligently , the next step was to increase the bandwidth of aural communication by augmenting the output with auditory icons .
Auditory icons in Emacspeak are short sound snippets ( no more than two seconds in duration ) and are used to indicate frequently occurring events in the user interface .
As an example , every time the user saves a file , the system plays a confirmatory sound .
Similarly , opening or closing an object ( anything from a file to a web site ) produces a corresponding auditory icon .
The set of auditory icons were arrived at iteratively and cover common events such as objects being opened , closed , or deleted .
This section describes how these auditory icons are injected into Emacspeak 's output stream .
Auditory icons are produced by the following user interactions :
To cue explicit user actions
To add additional cues to spoken output Auditory icons that confirm user actions — e.g. , a file being saved successfully — are produced by adding an after advice to the various Emacs built -ins .
To provide a consistent sound and feel across the Emacspeak desktop , such extensions are attached to code that is called from many places in Emacs .
Here is an example of such an extension , implemented via an advice fragment : ( defadvice save - buffer ( after emacspeak pre act ) " Produce an auditory icon if possible . " ( when ( interactive - p ) ( emacspeak - auditory - icon ' save - object ) ( or emacspeak - last - message ( message " Wrote %s " ( buffer - file - name ) ) ) ) )
Extensions can also be implemented via an Emacs - provided hook .
As explained in the brief advice tutorial given earlier , advice allows the behavior of existing software to be extended or modified without having to modify the underlying source code .
Emacs is itself an extensible system , and well - written Lisp code has a tradition of providing appropriate extension hooks for common use cases .
As an example , Emacspeak attaches auditory feedback to Emacs ' default prompting mechanism ( the Emacs minibuffer ) by adding the function emacspeak - minibuffer - setup - hook to Emacs ' minibuffer - setup - hook : ( defun emacspeak-minibuffer-setup-hook () " Actions to take when entering the minibuffer . " ( let ( ( inhibit- field - text - motion t ) ) ( when emacspeak - minibuffer-enter- auditory - icon ( emacspeak - auditory - icon ' open - object ) ) ( tts- with - punctuations ' all ( emacspeak - speak - buffer ) ) ) ) ( add- hook ' minibuffer-setup-hook ' emacspeak-minibuffer-setup-hook )
This is a good example of using built - in extensibility where available .
However , Emac - speak uses advice in a lot of cases because the Emacspeak requirement of adding auditory feedback to all of Emacs was not originally envisioned when Emacs was implemented .
Thus , the Emacspeak implementation demonstrates a powerful technique for discovering extension points .
Lack of an advice - like feature in a programming language often makes experimentation difficult , especially when it comes to discovering useful extension points .
This is because software engineers are faced with the following trade - off : Make the system arbitrarily extensible ( and arbitrarily complex )
Guess at some reasonable extension points and hardcode these
Once extension points are implemented , experimenting with new ones requires rewriting existing code , and the resulting inertia often means that over time , such extension points remain mostly undiscovered .
Lisp advice , and its Java counterpart Aspects , offer software engineers the opportunity to experiment without worrying about adversely affecting an existing body of source code .
Producing Auditory Icons While Speaking Content
In addition to using auditory icons to cue the results of user interaction , Emacspeak uses auditory icons to augment what is being spoken .
Examples of such auditory icons include : A short icon at the beginning of paragraphs
The auditory icon mark - object when moving across source lines that have a breakpoint set on them Auditory icons are implemented by attaching the text property emacspeak - auditory - icon with a value equal to the name of the auditory icon to be played on the relevant text .
As an example , commands to set breakpoints in the Grand Unified Debugger Emacs package ( GUD ) are adviced to add the property emacspeak - auditory - icon to the line containing the breakpoint .
When the user moves across such a line , the function tts - format - text - and - speak queues the auditory icon at the right point in the output stream .
A method for making instant steam , without the need for electricity , promises to be useful for tackling antibiotic resistant ‘ superbugs ’ like MRSA and C. difficile , as well as removing chewing gum from pavements and powering environmentally friendly cars .
" The value of instant steam lies in creating truly portable steam that can be generated intermittently on demand , " says Dave Wardle , business development director at Oxford Catalysts .
The company is already in talks with UK specialist steam supplier OspreyDeepclean about possible applications for steam cleaning hospitals , Wardle adds .
An as - yet unpublished 2006 study at University College London Hospital , commissioned by OspreyDeepclean , showed that dry steam applied at temperatures ranging from 150 to 180 C could destroy bacteria , including MRSA and Clostridium difficile , in less than 2 seconds , without the use of chemicals .
The new technology , devised by scientists at UK firm Oxford Catalysts , employs a precious metal catalyst to generate the steam at temperatures up to 800 C in just 1 - 2 seconds , at room temperature and pressure .
Steam produced by the technology is so - called ‘ dry ’ steam , generated by the highly exothermic reaction between methanol and hydrogen peroxide .
While too expensive to replace the vast quantities of steam used routinely by industry , a reaction chamber the size of a sugar cube can pump steam at a rate of 7L / minute at temperatures up to 800 C .
The first application is likely to be a GumBuster backpack for removing chewing gum from pavements and other surfaces .
The patented GumBuster technology currently requires a minimum of 3 kW of electrical power to generate the steam used by each operator and relies on generators carried on trolleys or vans .
Use of the catalyst technology ‘ will make the system more portable and make it possible to place the steam when we need it , where we need it , ’ says Thomas Stuecken , chief commercial officer at Proventec , the parent company of OspreyDeepclean .
Other more speculative applications for the steam for powering rockets and cars , and to provide mobile and portable power generation , are currently being considered .

TOMOYO Linuxプロジェクトは、2007年6月27日からオタワで開催されたOttawa Linux Symposium（通称OLS）で、BoFセッションを持ちました。本ページでは、BoFの発表内容、反響等について記載します。できるだけイベントやBoFの雰囲気が伝わるようにと思って書いていたらこんなに長くなってしまいました（笑）。
TOMOYO Linux project , Ottawa Linux Symposium which from 2007 June 27th is held in Ottawa ( alias OLS ) with , had BoF session .
In this page , it states concerning the announcement contents and echo etc of BoF .
In order just it is possible , for atmosphere of event and BoF to be transmitted , thinking , when you had written , so it became long , ( laughing ) .
History or Why TOMOYO Linux had a BoF †
TOMOYO Linuxが、OLS2007でBoFセッションを持つことになった経緯については、ThinkIT連載で紹介していますので、ご興味ある方は是非ご覧ください。
If you are interested in the reason why TOMOYO Linux had a BoF at OLS follow 、 this link .
BoFでの発表が確定してから、BoFの発表の前にメインラインに提案をしておきたいと考えていました。メインラインへの提案とは、具体的にはLKMLへのパッチの投稿です。TOMOYO Linuxについては、これまでにも何度かLKMLでリリースのニュースなどを投稿したことがありましたが、ほとんど反応がなく、あっても「LSMに対応してからにしなさい」という感じでした。Russell
Coker氏来日の際の意見交換でも同様です（この時の議論の内容はtomoyo-users-mlの記事に残っています）。TOMOYO Linux的としては、YLUG で「 LSM の壁」として説明したような考えや理由があり、意図的に対応していないわけでしたが、LSMはLinuxの標準であり提案を行うには、その標準を無視はできません。そこで、独自に拡張してきた最新の1.4の内容の一部を新たにLSMに対応したものとして移植する作業をしていました。
After the announcement with BoF deciding , you thought that before the announcement of BoF we would like to propose in mainline .
Proposition to mainline concretely is contribution of the patch to LKML .
Concerning TOMOYO
Linux , even so far several degrees news and the like of release has been contributed with LKML , but there is no reaction almost , being , “ after corresponding to LSM it was the feeling that do ” .
The case of Russell Coker visiting Japan it is similar even with exchange of opinions , ( contents of argument of this time remain in the article of tomoyo - users - ml ) .
As TOMOYO Linux , there was thought and a kind of reason which it explains as “ the wall of LSM ” with YLUG ( Yokohama Linux Users Group ) , it was the case that it does not correspond intend , but LSM is the standard of Linux and to propose , that standard disregard is not possible .
Then , the work of transplanting the portion of the up - to - date 1.4 contents which are expanded individually as those which correspond to LSM anew was done .
LSM 版では、強制アクセス制御機能はファイルのみでネットワークや他の機能は含まれていません（1.X版と2.X版の違いはこちらにあります）。それは、作業時間が間に合わなかったという理由の他に、投稿するコードの量を小さくしてコメントを受けやすくするという意味もあります。また、現状のLSMの仕様ではTOMOYO 1.4の機能は移植しきれないということもありました。
In LSM edition , as for forced access control function with only the file is not included as for network and other function , ( as for the difference of 1.X edition and 2.X edition this ) .
As for that , other than the reason that , job time was not in time , making the quantity of the cord / code which is contributed small , there is also the meaning of making easy to receive comment .
In addition , in the specification of LSM of present condition as for the function of TOMOYO 1.4 there was also a thing which it cannot transplant .
こうして、2007年4月1日にリリースした1.4の拡張版としての1.4.1とLSMおよびauditに対応した2.0のリリースをなんとか事前に投稿することができました。それと並行して、LKMLでの議論にも加わるようにしました。これは、それまで全く発言していないでいきなり提案を行っても相手にされないのではないかと思ったからです。書き込みを行ったのは、AppArmor?のスレッドで、その一部についてSlashdot.jpで紹介したものがあります。下記のリンクの先にあるKyle氏の説明はSELinuxの（開発/提供元の）考え方を理解する上でとても参考になります。
In this way , as 1.4 extended editions which release are done on 2007 April 1st it could contribute 2.0 releases which correspond to 1.4.1 and LSM and audit somehow in advance .
In parallel with that , it tried to join to also the argument with LKML .
Because as for this , not speaking completely to that , doing proposition suddenly , that you thought whether it is not not to make the partner is .
Entry doing with the thread of AppArmor ? , are some which are introduced with Slashdot . jp concerning the part of that .
First explanation certain Kyle of the below - mentioned link SELinux ( when understanding ) the method of thinking the development / offer origin , very becomes reference .
LKMLへの投稿について、RFCとしたのは、CELFのOLS事前ミーティングに参加させていただいた際にいただいたアドバイスです。
Concerning the contribution to LKML , what it makes RFC , participating in the OLS advance meeting of CELF , is the advice which it receives the occasion where it receives .
Posting to the LKML †
パッチ自体の作成は半田さんと武田君にまかせていましたが、LKMLに投稿するメールは自分が考えました。投稿は勿論、一日でも早く行うほうが良いわけですが、「あの」LKMLに初めて書くメッセージです。えんえんと続くAppArmor?のスレッドもながめながら、どう説明しようかぎりぎりまで考え、悩み続けました。最終的に投稿したのが下記の内容です。投稿から一ヶ月を経た今振り返ると、もう少し違う言い方ができた部分はありますが、特に問題はなく、必要なことは含まれていると思います。
Compilation of the patch itself had entrusted the solder and to Takeda , but by his thought the mail which is contributed to LKML .
Contribution is the case that the one which of course is done quickly even in one day is good , but on it is the message which is written “ that ” LKML for the first time .
While it is to obtain it is to obtain with watching also the thread of AppArmor ?
which continues , you thought to very limit , continued to be troubled how you probably will explain .
The fact that you contribute finally is the below - mentioned contents .
When now when it passes one month from contribution you look back , there is a part which can do the expression which is already different a little , but there is no especially problem , as for necessary thing it thinks that it is included .
この投稿では、メッセージにパッチを添付していなかったのですが、そのことについてStephen Smalleyより、「もし本当にコメントをもらいたいのなら、パッチを添付したほうが良い」という助言をもらい、再度投稿したのが下記です。
With this contribution , it is not to attach the patch to message , but concerning from Stephen Smalley , “ we would like to receive comment truly , if is , the fact that you receive the advice that the method which attaches the patch is better ” , contribute for the second time is description below .
Message from NOKIA engineer †

The mail was exchanged with the engineer and its colleague of Nokia which sends the mail , in advance , the promise which meets before BoF at the locale was done .
Bad News †
会場に到着し、ソニーの上田さん、Timとお会いしたのですが、残念な連絡がありました。CELFでは、TOMOYOのBoFとちょうど同じ時間にWestinホテルでプライベートなBoFを行い、TOMOYOのBoFには参加できないというのです。
It is to arrive at the meeting place , SONY Ueda , Tim distantly to meet , but there was regrettable communication .
It means with CELF , in the same time as BoF of TOMOYO private doing BoF exactly at the Westin hotel , not being able to participate in BoF of TOMOYO .

従って、OLS2007ではCELF関連の方は一人もTOMOYOのBoFには参加いただけなかったと思います。また、TOMOYOのメンバーもCELFのプライベートBoFには参加できませんでした。TOMOYO BoFの説明資料は、celinuxのmlに送付しておきましたが、大変残念なことでした。
Meeting with NOKIA engineers †
BoFの直前だと落ち着かないので、その前に話をしたいと思い連絡をとりました。Nokiaからの参加者は2名で、こちらからはTOMOYO Linuxのデモを行い、その後でNokia側で作成した資料を説明してもらいました。一言でいうと、Nokiaのほうでは携帯電話向けでSELinuxを使えないと考えており、実際に利用できるセキュリティ強化手段として、AppArmor?とTOMOYO Linuxについて検討しているということでした。何故、SELinuxが使えないと考えているか質問したところ、「 too complex , too much （複雑すぎるし、こんなに機能は必要としていない）」という回答でした。
When it is immediately before BoF , because it does not settle , that we would like to do story before that , you thought and took communication .
The participant from Nokia 2 , did the demonstration of TOMOYO Linux from this , had explaining the data which after that was drawn up on Nokia side .
When you express in one word , that Nokia with SELinux cannot be used by for the portable telephone , we think , it meant that we examine as the security strengthening expedient which can really be utilized , concerning AppArmor ? and TOMOYO Linux .
Why , whether you think that you cannot use SELinux , when it asks , “ too complex and too much ( it is too complicated and , function has not needed so ) ” to question , it was detour answer .
Nokiaエンジニアからはその後、資料をメールしてもらいましたが、その中にNokiaとして考えているセキュリティの要件が含まれており、それらへの対応およびパフォーマンスへのインパクトについて宿題として報告することにしました。
After that , the mail it had doing the data from the Nokia engineer , but in that important matter of the security which you think as Nokia was included , had decided to report as the assignment concerning correspondences and performance to the impact to those .
Suggested Requirements †
打ち合わせ資料から抜粋して紹介します。
Excerpting from the previous arrangement data , it introduces .
Standard interfaces and zero-maintainability a must ( i.e. LSM hooking )
Network access control for applications should be taken to network interface level Big difference between GPRS , 3G , WLAN / WiFi , … Future proof design would leave an option for price based access control
Whole story of application development should be considered through Situation where owner ( e.g. operator ) of the device does not allow executing in the Disabled / Accept / Permissive - modes Developer certification / opening of devices in a controlled manner Turing ’s test needed : Risk of a malware getting the “ developer trust ” Application installer ’s role in a semi-closed environment needs special attention Binding the security to TCG kind of TPM chip
The execution history particularly attractive “ rwx ” could be easier than numbers 1 - 7 ?
主要なところとしては、やはり「 Linux標準（具体的にはLSM）の準拠は大前提ということです。TOMOYO Linuxの特徴であるプロセス起動履歴の追跡は「特に魅力的」と書かれています。ネットワークについては、GPRSのような用途では、ユーザが自覚しないうちに高額の通信費が発生すると困るので、それはネットワークレイヤーで防いで欲しいというコメントがありました。
As a principal place , after all “ Linux standard ( concretely LSM ) as for conformity it is major premise .
Pursuit of the process starting past record which is the feature of TOMOYO Linux is written “ especially attractive ” .
Concerning network , because with the use like GPRS , while the user is not conscious , when large amount communication expense occurs , it is troubled , as for that there was the comment that we are wanted preventing in the network layer .
BoF Materials †
BoFについては、これまで自分でBoFを主催したことがなく、参加についても実質的にELC2007のBoFに一度参加したくらいで、準備についてはあまりイメージが持てないでいました。また、RFCの投稿についても反響は予想ができませんでしたし、最後にLKML投稿に向けた作業に追われて、構想立案や準備の時間がほとんどとれない状況でした。
Concerning BoF , so far you have not sponsored BoF by your , concerning participation at the extent which one time participated substantially in BoF of ELC2007 , concerning preparation without being able to have image excessively , it was .
In addition , echo could not do expectation concerning the contribution of RFC and , being chased in the work of directing to LKML contribution lastly , it was the circumstance where time of conception plan and preparation almost does not come off .
準備が進まなくても勿論BoFのことを考えていないわけではなく、むしろ常に頭から離れない状態がずっと続いていました。「何を用意すれば良いのだろう」ということを考え続けている状態です。出国の1週間くらい前に、スケッチブックとペンを買ってきました。これは、議論を主導するテーマをスケッチブックに書いておき、それを進行に応じてページを開きながら、参加者と議論するという進行を想定して用意したものです。あるいは、画用紙にテーマを書いておいたものを部屋に貼りだしておいて、テーマ毎に関心のある人が集まり議論してはということも考えました。
Preparation did not advance and either the [ te ] of course was not the case that you do not think of the thing of BoF , on the other hand a state where always it does not leave from the head was continued directly .
It is in a state where it continues to think of that “ if what is prepared , probably will be good ” .
About 1 weeks of departure ago , the sketch book and the pen were bought .
While this writing the theme which directs argument on the sketch book , opening the page that according to advance , supposing the advance that you argue with the participant , it is something which you prepare .
Or , starting pasting those which write theme on the drawing paper in the room , the person who has interest in every theme got together and argued and thought also that you say .
いろいろなことを考えましたが、結局具体的な準備は着手できないまま白紙のスケッチブックとペンを持って現地に向かうことになりました。参考にしようと思い、OLSのBoFセッションにも参加しましたが、それはELC2007で経験したものとは全く異なり、資料に基づいたプレゼンテーション形式でした。TOMOYOの発表は3日目でしたが、あと2日後に自分のセッションを持っているのに、何も資料を準備していないことに気づき、急激に焦りました。資料を作ることにして、成田からシカゴまでの飛行機の中で、考えついた話題を書き留めておいたメモを見ながら、OLSの会場やホテルの部屋で資料の編集を行いました。
Of various things were thought , but it came to the point of facing to the locale without being able to start concrete preparation after all with the sketch book and the pen of the white paper .
You were trying to refer , participated in also the BoF session of OLS , but it was the presentation type where that differs from any which are experienced with ELC2007 completely , is based on the data .
The announcement of TOMOYO was 3rd day , but although after you have your own session 2 days later , you became aware in nothing having prepared the data , were hasty suddenly .
While in the airplane to Chicago , looking at the memo which notes the topic which is thought of from Narita to the thing which makes the data , it compiled the data at the meeting place of OLS and the room of the hotel .
資料は、2日目に一度他のメンバーに見せてコメントをもらい、発表の5分前まで編集をしていました。最終的に発表した資料は特に良くできたとも思いませんが、もしもっと時間があったとしても置かれた状況的に大きく改善できそうなところはなかった気がします。笑って欲しいと思って書いた部分では、皆さんちゃんと？笑ってくれて、話をしながら安心しました。
The data , showing to one time other member on 2nd day , received comment , compiled to 5 minutes ago of announcement .
Especially it could make the data which is announced finally good also you do not think , but assuming , if more there was a time , it was put , the air which is not does the place circumstance largely it may be able to improve .
Thinking , that we want laughing , in the part which you write , everyone properly ?
Laughing , while to do story , you felt at rest .
資料は、いつものよう にSourceForge?.jpの文書に保存しています。SourceForge?.jpではドキュメントについて、言語（日本語/英語）、カテゴリにより分類されていますので、ELC2007の資料とともに英語のseminar/symposiumのところに保存してあります。
The data , the usual way retains in the document of SourceForge ?. jp .
Because it is classified with SourceForge ?. jp concerning the document , language ( Japanese / English ) , by category , with the data of ELC2007 it is retained in the place of English seminar / symposium .
The Day of the TOMOYO Linux BoF †
日本でBoFの準備をしていた時に、DevCommの田中さんから2点のフライヤー画像をいただいていました。こちらからお願いしていたものではなく、TOMOYOのBoFを応援したいということでわざわざ作成下さったものです。せっかくのご厚意に応えたいと思い、A3に印刷したものを計4枚持参してきましたが、そのうち2枚について、OLSの受付のテーブルの下に貼らせていただきました。これらの画像はGalleryから参照できます。
また、残りの2枚については、TOMOYOのBoFの部屋で前のセッションが始まってから、入り口のテーブルの横に貼って、人集め？を図りました。実際、立ち止まってポスターを見て「クール」と言っている人がいました（ただ、彼がTOMOYOのBoFに参加してくれたかは確認していません（笑））。下の準備はフライヤーを貼る前の準備中の様子です。
TOMOYO Linux BoF Session Record †
このようにほとんど何も準備も事前の調整もせずBoF本番に臨んだわけですが、メインの説明と進行を原田が行い、デモの部分について半田さんに操作、説明してもらうことだけは日本にいた時から決めていました。
This way preparation or advance adjustment did not do most at all and it is the case that it faces to the BoF production , but main explained and advanced Harada , when in the solder operation , it makes explain just the thing being in Japan concerning the part of demonstration from , decided .
1枚目の写真は、話を始める少し前の部屋の様子です。2枚目は、半田さんがデモのパートの操作と説明をしているところです。プロジェクタ投影の関係で演台の近くに座り込み、かつプロジェクタに向かって身振りをつけながら話をしています（謎）。横で説明を聞きながらなんだか変だなと思っていましたが、こうして改めて写真を見てもやっぱり変ですね（笑）。ELC2007を含めて私（原田）が話しているところの写真がありません。それは写真を撮影しているのはもっぱら私というのが主な理由ですが、その他私があまり被写体になるのが好きではないということもあります（笑）。
The 1st photograph is circumstances of the room of a little before story is begun .
2nd as for , the solder operation of the part of demonstration is about you explain .
While in connection with projector projection staying down in the vicinity of the performing stand , acquiring gesture at the same time facing toward the projector , it does story , ( puzzle ) .
While inquiring about explanation with side , it is what , you thought as the strange shelf , but in this way , again , looking at the photograph being after all strange , the shank ( laughing ) .
Including ELC2007 , me ( Harada ) there is no photograph of the place where you speak .
As for that as for those where the photograph is photographed exclusively I am the main reason , but there are also times when in addition we do not like for I excessively to become subject , ( laughing ) .
吉岡さんはブログの中で、最初の言葉 を" Let 's get started " で始めることを決めていたと書かれていますが、私は最初も最後も全く何も考えていません。BoFらしく議論の場となることを目指す、TOMOYO Linuxについて何か知ってもらう、ということだけを考えて、資料に基づき進行しました。
That Yoshioka in [ burogu ] , had decided that first word is begun with " Let 's get started " , it is written , but I first or end completely do not think at all .
BoF to seem you aim toward the fact that it becomes the place of argument , thinking of just that something you make know concerning TOMOYO Linux , it advanced on the basis of the data .
BoFなので、対話的な議論をしたいと思い、説明の中ではAppArmor?とSELinuxとの議論についてとりあげ、pathname-baseの強制アクセス制御は本当にwaste of timeだろうか？と水をふったところ、SELinux関係者とおぼしき人物とAppArmor?の開発者の間で議論が始まりました。これは十分予想していた展開だったので、ある程度言いたいことを言わせてから、「その議論を始めたらこの短いBoFの時間では足りないだろう。また、今日のこのTOMOYO LinuxのBoFの資料をよく見て欲しいのだが、今回はTOMOYO Linuxの独自のコンセプトを理解してもらいたい。そのためにきている」として遮り、説明に戻りました。
Because it is BoF , that we would like to argue conversationally , you think , in explanation you pick up concerning the argument with AppArmor ? and SELinux , is access control forcing of pathname - base probably waste of time truly ?
With when the water was shaken , the SELinux authorized personnel Toshi argument started between the [ bo ] system person and the developer of AppArmor ?.
Because this was the development which was expected sufficiently , after it is making the fact that mean we would like to say , when “ the argument is begun , at the time of this short BoF it probably will not be enough .
In addition , we want looking at the data of BoF of present this TOMOYO Linux carefully , but is , this time we would like to have understanding the individual concept of TOMOYO Linux .
It has come because of that ” , that it blocked , returned to explanation .
TOMOYO Linuxは、一言でいうとやは りLinux上のMACの実装であり、ラベルではなくpath名を用いています。でも、そう言った瞬間に、SELinux関係者やそれ以外からは、「またpath名のMACか！」ということになってしまいますし、「AppArmor?と同じじゃないか」となります。LSM版についてはファイルアクセス制御のみしか備えていないので、特にそうです。AppArmor?はちょうど一年前のOLSのBoFセッションでLinux開発者にデビューしており、類似点の多いTOMOYO Linuxは、AppArmor?との本質的な違いを明確にした上で名乗りをあげるべきだったのですが、それが準備できていませんでした。そのことはメインライン化の作業にマイナスになっています。
TOMOYO
Linux , when you express in one word , is the mounting MAC on Linux after all , is not the label and path name is used .
So , so instantaneously was said , from the SELinux authorized personnel and other than that , “ and MAC of path name !
” With it comes to the point of saying and , “ the same as AppArmor ? it is n't ? ” , that it becomes .
Because only access control file has concerning LSM edition , especially so is .
AppArmor ? with the BoF session of OLS of one year ago has debutted exactly in the Linux developer , it means that TOMOYO Linux where the similar point is many after making the essential difference with AppArmor ?
clear , should increase the self - introduction , but being able to prepare that it was not .
The in job of mainline conversion has become 0 .
話をプレゼンテーションに引き戻し、スライドに沿って主要な内容を口頭で伝えた後で、デモにスイッチしました。デモが始まってしばらくすると、明らかに聞き手の様子が変わり、TOMOYO Linuxが何かを「体験」し、「驚きを感じている」ことが伝わってきました。これこそが、BoFとして目指していたことだったのです。
Pulling back story to the presentation , after being oral , conveying principal contents according to sliding , the switch you did in demonstration .
Demonstration starting , when it does for a while , circumstances of the listener changed clearly , TOMOYO Linux “ experienced ” what , what “ feels the surprise ” was transmitted .
Very this , is to be to have aimed as BoF .
Most those where attitude changes beginning , are the person who thinks as the SELinux authorized personnel who argued with the AppArmor ?
developer hotly .
As for him , as for opportunity of change of domain ?
As for memory how alocate having done ?
And so on continuing the contents regarding mounting , it asked .
He first seems that you think that every time of exec memory is consumed , but when you explain that is just when adding the new domain , it became placid from there .
As there not to be about to should attach the economization ( at that place ) , it was discovered .
一番態度が変わったのは、冒頭 、AppArmor?開発者と熱く議論していたSELinux関係者と思われる人物です。彼は、ドメインの切り替えの契機は？メモリーはどうアロケートしているのか？等実装に関する内容を続けて質問してきました。彼は最初はexecの都度メモリーを消費すると思っていたようですが、新規ドメインの追加のときだけであることを説明すると、そこからはおとなしくなりました。（その場で）けちをつけるべきところがなくなったように見受けられました。

一人の若い男性が、技術的な鋭い質問をしてきましたが、彼は実はSELinuxのキーマンの一人であるStehpehn Smalleyであることが判明しました。Stephenは何度も「TOMOYO Linux（の良さ）をproveする必要がある」ということを言っていました。Stephenの隣に座っていた男性は、「自分はpath名ベースのMACを2つ同時にメインラインに入れるとは思わない」と言っていました。彼は、LSMのメンテナーのChris Wrightでした。
The young man alone , did technical sharp question , but as for him to tell the truth being Stehpehn Smalley which is the one of the keymen of SELinux was ascertained .
As for Stephen many degrees meant that “ TOMOYO Linux ( good quality ) it is necessary prove to do ” .
As for the man who is sat down in the next door of Stephen , “ by your you insert path name based MAC in two mainlines with you do not think simultaneously ” , that you said .
He was Chris Wright of the men tenors of LSM .
大柄の男性が、「libcなどライブラリ関連の（必ずアクセスが必要となる）ものはどうするのか？（それらも定義しなければならないのか？）」と尋ねました。彼はAppArmor?のコア開発者の一人で、OLS2007でAppArmor?のBoF発表を行ったSeth Arnoldでした。この質問はいかにもパス名のMACを実装した関係者らしい疑問で、とても良い質問です。TOMOYO Linuxでは、必ず必要となるものについてはシステム全体でアクセスを許可する構文を持っていると回答しました。
Does the man of large pattern become , “ relation of the library such as libc ( access necessity ) as for the thing how be sure to doing ?
( You must define those ? ) ”
With you asked .
He being the one of the core developers of AppArmor ? , the BoF announcement of AppArmor ? was Seth Arnold which does with OLS2007 .
This question the authorized personnel who surely mounts MAC of path name with the doubt which seems , is very good question .
With TOMOYO
Linux , it replied that it has the sentence structure which permits access altogether system concerning those which by all means become necessary .
質疑では、EMCの奥山さんやNTTデータ先端技術のフェルナンドなどがTOMOYO Linuxを支援する発言をしてくれました。進行をしながらそのことを感じ感謝しました。また、会場には吉岡さんや他の日本からの参加メンバーもTOMOYOのBoFにきてくれました。日本を遠く離れたオタワでの同胞の支援は本当にうれしいものでした。
In question , Okuyama of EMC and the speech where fell NAND and the like of NTT data high technology support TOMOYO Linux was done .
While to advance , you felt and appreciated .
In addition , also the participation member of Yoshioka and from other Japan came to BoF of TOMOYO in the meeting place .
Japan because the compatriot in Ottawa which is far far it supported it is delightful truly the potato .
TOMOYO LinuxのBoFはこのように、Linuxのセキュリティに関わる主要人物を中心とした活発な議論の場となり、TOMOYO Linuxの動作を彼らにリアルタイムで見てもらうことにより、言葉では伝えきれないものを伝えることができました。以前来日したMontaVista?のHadi氏も会場にきており、こちらから指名してコメントをもらいました。一通り議論が収まり、腕時計を見ると、開始してから58分が経過していました。「最後に」と断って、TOMOYO Linuxの開発者である半田さんと武田君を紹介しました。そしてほぼ予定どおりの1時間が過ぎ、来訪に感謝する言葉でBoFセッションをクローズしました。時間は特に意識していませんでしたが、結果的にはぴったり時間通りです。発表が終わると、Hadiが「どうもありがとう」と言いながら握手を求めてきて、フェルナンドは「良かった。やった。TOMOYO LinuxかAppArmor?のどちらかをメインラインに入れる」と言っていた、と話しかけてきました。言われたときは「そうかな？」と思ったのですが、あとから振り返ると、ここは「TOMOYOとAppArmor?で、同じパス名ベースのものを2つもメインラインに入れるとは思わない」と繰り返して発言していたので、必ずしもどちらかをメインラインに入れることを保証したものではないと思っています。
BoF of TOMOYO
Linux this way , became the place of the active argument which centers the principal person who relates to the security of Linux in word it was possible the operation of TOMOYO
Linux you have them see by in real time , to convey those which it cannot convey .
In the past also Hadi of MontaVista ?
which visits Japan has come to the meeting place , designating from this , you received comment .
In a general way argument to be settled , when you look at the watch , after starting , 58 minutes had elapsed .
Cutting off “ lastly ” , it introduced the solder and Takeda who are the developer of TOMOYO Linux .
BoF session was closed in the word which and almost 1 hours of according to schedule pass , appreciate in visit .
Especially you had not been conscious time , but result exactly it is according to time .
When announcement ends , while Hadi saying with “ very much thank you ” , asking handshake , fell NAND “ was good .
You did .
TOMOYO which of Linux or AppArmor ? is inserted in mainline ” , that you said , that it spoke .
When being said , “ so kana ?
” With it is to think , but when you look back from after , because here spoke “ with TOMOYO and AppArmor ? , same path name based ones are not thought insert either two in mainline with ” , that over again , you think that it is not something which guarantees that always which is inserted in mainline .
今、BoFのセッションのことを思い出すと、プログラムの予定時刻ではありましたが、最終のセッションだったので、必ずしもそこでクローズせず、残れる人だけでも残ってもらって議論をすれば良かったかなという気がします。一度日本に戻ると会おうとしても会えないメンバーが揃っていたのに勿体なかったかもしれません。私はあまり写真に写るのが好きではないのですが、Stephenとだけはどうしても記念写真を撮りたいと思い撮影したのがそのときの写真です。まさか、StephenがTOMOYO LinuxのBoFに、自分の話を聞きにきてくれるとは思っていなかっただけに、本当に感激しました。
When now , thing of the session of BoF is remembered , was schedule time of the program , but because it was last session , it does not close always there and even just the person who can remain having remaining if it argues , the air , good kana does .
When it returns to one time Japan , trying probably to meet , although the member whom it cannot meet had been even perhaps it was wasted .
I am not to like excessively to be taken to the photograph , but that as for just Stephen we would like to take the souvenir picture by any means , those which you thought and photographed are the photograph of that time .
Never , because Stephen in BoF of TOMOYO
Linux , comes to hearing with did not think your own story , you were deeply impressed truly .
以上がTOMOYO Linux BoFのおおよその様子です。これまで他のBoFに参加したり、自分でBoFを持った経験がないので、なんともいえないのですが、置かれた状況を考えると、成功だったと言えると思います。日本に戻った今発表のことを振り返ってみても、より良い結果は想像ができません。
Or more is the approximately circumstances of TOMOYO Linux BoF .
So far , it participates in other BoF , because there is no experience which had BoF by your , it is not to be able to say at all , but when of the circumstance which is placed is thought , you think that you can say that it was success .
Trying looking back at the thing of the current announcement which returns to Japan the result which is better cannot do the imagination .
Other Questions and Small Talks †
（下記の内容は、BoFの中での質問とそれ以外が混在していますが、これからフォーマットも含めて整形します）
・パス名ベース のMAC はwaste of timeなのか？ → SELinuxは全ての場面で使えるものと考えている。（SELinuxの関係者か） → Fedoraのインストール時にSELinuxは無効にされることが多い。 無効にされるとセキュリティの向上はゼロになるので、
少なくともゼロよりはプラスにはなるTOMOYOがあってもよいのでは（EMC奥山さん）
・学習させた内容にライブラリの読み込みがないようだが？（Seth Arnold） →システム全体でファイルの読み込みを許可する構文が別途ある。 これはldconfigの出力をそのまま用いている。
・ポリシーはどこに保存されているのか。 プロセスの実行のたびにドメイン遷移するなら、
プロセスが膨大になるとDoSになるのでは？（SELinuxの関係者か） →カーネルスペースのメモリに保存している。
今回のデモでは学習モードにしているため自動でドメインが追加されているが、
強制モードでの運用では自動ではドメインは追加されない。 ドメイン遷移もMandatoryなため、こういったDoSは防げる。
・テンポラリファイルなどのパス名はどう表現するのか？（Chris
Wright ） →パス名にパターンを用いることができる。パターン化された状態で学習させることもできる。
→古いAppArmor?はPCRE（Perlの正規表現）を用いていたが、
今はパターンマッチングに高速なDFA（決定性有限オートマトン）を用いている。
（ AppArmor ? BoFにて 、Seth Arnold） → AppArmor?のDFAは高速なマッチングを実現しているので、TOMOYOにも応用できるのではないか。
（ Closing Receptionにて 、Chris Wright ）
・次の6ヶ月は何をするのか？（SELinuxの関係者か）
→TOMOYO Linux 2.0は1.4.1からファイルアクセスの機能のみを取り出している。
機能的に不充分なので、1.4.1の機能を2.0に移植する作業を続けて行く。
・ SELinuxが使いにくいということは理解している。 ただ、使いやすく弱いセキュリティ技術を導入してしまうと、
ユーザは簡単にそちらに流れてしまう。この事態は避けたい。
TOMOYOにはSELinuxを使いやすくする手助けをして欲しい。 （ BoFセッション後の議論にて 、Stephen Smalley ）
・ TOMOYOのようなdivergenceが出てくることを歓迎する。 （ Closing Receptionにて 、Chris Wright ）
・ネットワークの受信関係のLSMのフックを追加したいと考えている。 現状のLSMのフックではIPアドレスが分かる前に判定しているため、
TOMOYO Linux 1.4.1の機能が実現できない。 →（TOMOYOのフック挿入箇所を見て）ここに追加するのであれば、
ユーザランドへはパケットが届かないのでとりあえず問題はないだろう。 （ BoFセッション後の議論にて 、Stephen Smalley ） → AppArmor?も同じことを望むだろう。パッチにして送ってくれれば正式にコメントするし、
それほど大きな変更にはならないからマージは難しくないと思う。
（ Closing Receptionにて 、Chris Wright ）
Discussion with Stephen Smalley †
記念写真撮影後 、Stephenにお礼を言って握手して別れようとしたら、彼は「あなた達はこの後予定があるのですか？」と思いがけないことを口にしました。TOMOYO Linuxについて議論をしたいというのです。
After the souvenir picture photographing , being gratitude to Stephen , shaking hands , when it tries to divide , as for him “ as for you it is to be schedule after this ?
” With unexpected thing was mentioned .
It means we would like to arguing concerning TOMOYO Linux .
さらに驚きましたが、勿論断るわけはありません。吉岡さんをはじめYLUGのメンバーと一緒に、最初は泊まっていたホテル、Les Suiteの1Fのコーヒー店に行きましたが、店のテーブルを動かしたところお店の人が怒り出し、結局、武田君が宿泊していた部屋に移動しました。YLUGチームは横のソファに座りOSS談義？を始めました。
Furthermore you were surprised , but there is no reason which is refused of course .
The member of YLUG and together , first it went to the hotel and the coffee store of 1 F of Les which Suite have stayed , in addition to Yoshioka , but when the table of the store was moved the person of the store produced to get angry , after all , to the room where Takeda lodged moved .
The YLUG team sits down in the sofa side , OSS sermon ?
It began .
この場で 、Stephenからいくつか大変興味深いことを聞きました。
At this place , several you inquired about very much interesting thing from Stephen .
You say that SELinux is difficult , but by his so does not think .
For example it does n't mean that iptables is much more difficult ?
If to understand you try sentence structure of the policy of SELinux it is something which you can understand .
As for not thinking that the proposition of AppArmor ?
You think that in the future there are the choices of two , concerning TOMOYO Linux .
That , cooperates AppArmor ?
Seth Arnold had a BoF session and introduced future plan of AppArmor ?.
According to Seth and his material , AppArmor ? is going to incorporate some of TOMOYO Linux 's features .
I realized that we have not yet provided documentations about the differece between AppArmor ? and TOMOYO Linux .
While original TOMOYO Linux 1.X has a plenty of functionalities , TOMOYO Linux 2.0 ( LSM version ) has only MAC for file , so TOMOYO Linux 2.0 looks almost same as AppArmor ? , " another pathname - based MAC " .
Work is needed .
Stephen , Jonathan and some other people told me that AppArmor ? has a nice code of pathname handling .
TOMOYO Linux might consider incorporating it .
Closing Reception †
最終日の午 後8時から 、" Black Thorn Cafe " というパブで、OLS2007の打ち上げが行われました。翌朝帰国の便が午前7時と早いので、当初パスしようかと考えていたのですが、あやうち取り返しのつかない間違いをおかすところでした。
Of last day from 8 o'clock in the afternoon , at the pub , “ Black Thorn Cafe " , the launch of OLS2007 was done .
Because next morning return home flight 7 o'clock in the morning is quick , that it is to think whether at the beginning it will pass , but it was about to damage the mistake where recovery inside the leash is not attached .
このClosing Reception はOLSの恒例行事のようで、それほど広くはないお店を貸し切りにして、そこにOLSの参加者が集まります。OLSの参加証を見せるだけで入場でき飲み物と軽食（少し怪しげな寿司もありました）が無料です。JonathanやJamesなどの有名人も参加しています。私は午後11時くらいに引き揚げましたが、午前2時30分まで参加していた日本人の方もあったようです（その後も続いていた模様）。
The participant of OLS gets together there with the store where this Closing Reception with like the usual event of OLS , that much is wide and is not as reserving .
The participation proof of OLS just is shown be able to enter , the beverage lightly the food ( a little the doubtful sushi was ) is free .
Also the famous person of Jonathan and James etc participates .
I pulled up about 11 o'clock in the afternoon , but it seems that has also the Japanese who 2:30 AM participated to , ( the pattern which after that is continued ) .
この会場で 、AppArmor ?
のSeth Arnold , SELinux のStephen , LSM のChrisらと懇談しました。まさに「和気あいあい」で、皆愉快に語り合いながら、去りゆくOLS2007を惜しんでいます。
At this meeting place , you discussed with Chris and others of Stephen and LSM of Seth Arnold of AppArmor ? and SELinux .
Just , while with “ amiableness harmony ” , everyone talking together pleasantly , you go away and you spare OLS2007 which keeps .
AppArmor ? ( Novell ) の関係者。右から二人目がAppArmor?のBoFを行ったSeth Arnold。Sethは写真で見るよりも大きい。
ヤギ のChris。mlから受ける印象とは大違いでびっくりしたが、とても親切で気さく。右端は勿論YLUGの吉岡さん。
Seth Arnoldと打倒SELinuxを目指して？堅く握手。SethとはCrispinの話で盛り上がった。
TOMOYO Linux Mainlining Forecast †
LKMLに投稿を行い、OLS2007でBoFセッションも持つことができました。TOMOYO LinuxのBoFは成功し、カーネル開発者のコミュニティへのデビューを果たしたと言って良いと思います。BoF参加は、Stephen , Chris , Sethなどの関係者との面識ができ、議論を行えたという点で大きな成果がありました。しかし、TOMOYO Linuxのメインライン化は全く予断を許さない状況です。
You contributed in LKML , you did the fact that also BoF session has with OLS2007 .
You think that it is good saying , that BoF of TOMOYO Linux succeeded , carried out the debut to the community of the kernel developer .
There was a big result in the point that acquaintance of the authorized personnel of Stephen , Chris and Seth etc could do BoF participation , could do argument .
But , the mainline conversion of TOMOYO Linux is the circumstance which completely does not permit prediction .
今回のBoFは実質的なTOMOYO Linuxのデビューであって、昨年のOLSでBoFを持ったAppArmor?に完全に一年遅れました。AppArmor?は懸命に（あるいは強引に）メインライン化を求めており、LKMLでの議論は何ヶ月も続いています。色々言われてはいますが、メインラインに取り込まれてもおかしくない寸前のところにきていることを、関係者の議論により確認しました。先行するAppArmor?のイメージが強いことから、TOMOYO
Linux は「 AppArmor?にそっくりな後発のパス名ベースのMac」と認識されており、それだけで「またか」と思われている部分があります。Stephenは、何度も「 TOMOYO Linuxが良いものなら、それを立証せよ( prove ) 」と言っていました。TOMOYO LinuxがAppArmor?より優れていることを立証するというのは、メインラインにはいるひとつのアプローチです。
Latest BoF being the debut of substantial TOMOYO Linux , one year was late to AppArmor ?
which had BoF with OLS of last year completely .
AppArmor ? ( or ) requests mainline conversion eagerly coercively , the argument with LKML is continued many months .
The varieties it is said , but being taken in by mainline , you verified having come to the place before the strange sun/size , by the argument of the authorized personnel .
From the fact that the image of AppArmor ?
which precedes is strong , TOMOYO Linux is recognized “ path name based Mac of late start entirely in AppArmor ? , ” with just that “ and ? ” with is a part which is thought .
As for Stephen , no degree “ if those whose TOMOYO Linux is good , it proves that ( prove ) ” with you said .
TOMOYO Linux AppArmor ?
compared to proves the fact that it is superior , is one approach which enters into mainline .
実際に 、Ottawaに行って、BoFのセッションを終えての感想としては、「メインラインに入れることこそが至上命題であり、LKMLへの投稿や今回のBoFはそのスタートにすぎない」ということを実感しました。TOMOYO Linuxは、これまでこつこつと1.4系の開発により機能を拡張してきましたが、LKMLに提案した2.0（LSM移植版）ではファイル強制アクセス制御の機能しかありません。その状態でAppArmor?との比較をされて、「ほとんど同じ」と思われていることにより損をしています。せめてネットワークのMACが実装できていれば印象も変わったことでしょう。
Occasion , going to Ottawa , finishing the session of BoF , as a thought , “ very the fact that you insert in mainline is supreme proposition , you realized that contribution and latest BoF to LKML are no more than the start ” .
TOMOYO
Linux expanded function with the development of 1.4 systems so far piece by piece , but 2.0 where you propose to LKML ( LSM transplantation edition ) with there is only a function of access control file forcing .
You comparing with AppArmor ?
in the state , it loses by being thought “ most same ” .
At least if being able to mount MAC of network it is , it probably means that also impression changes .
「 Linuxメインラインの標 準MAC」として、SELinuxの地位は今後もおそらく不動だと思います。パス名ベースのコードは追加される余地はありますが、LSMメンテナのChrisから、「パス名ベースのMACを2つメインラインに入れることはない」と言われており、先行し、知名度があり、SUSEのディストリビューションに含まれているAppArmor?との競争は厳しい闘いです。
As “ a standard MAC of Linux mainline ” , as for the position of SELinux you think that in the future perhaps it is firm .
As for the path name based cord / code there is a margin which is added , but from Chris of LSM [ mentena ] , “ there are no times when path name based MAC is inserted in two mainlines ” , that it is said , precedes , there is a degree of distinction , as for the competition with AppArmor ?
which is included in the distribution of SUSE harsh fighting it is and is .
Regarding vfsmuonts †
LKMLのAppArmor?のスレッドで、PavelからAndrew Morton宛にパス名ベースのMACに影響のある非常に重要な投稿がなされています。
There have been a very important posting in LKML AppArmor ?
theread , that was posted by Pavel and addressed to Andrew Morton .
AppArmor?のパッチは、AppArmor?自体のパッチの他にvfsmountsの修正が含まれています。vfsmountsのパッチだけ採用してみては？ということが提案されており、これが採用されればTOMOYO Linuxも恩恵を受けますし、AppArmor?もよりメインラインに入りやすくなります。
AppArmor ?'s patch set consits of two parts .
One is AppArmor ?
itself , the other is vfsmounts patch .
Above posting suggests to incorporate soley vfsmounts patch .
If that patch will be acceped , TOOMYO Linux get the benefit .
7月11日に2.6.23 のMerge Windowが開きましたが、この提案の採否が注目されます。
Merge windows was opened July 11 .

メインライン提案の対象は今回投稿した2.0（LSM移植版）になります。今回のBoFで得られたフィードバックを意識して、再度LKMLに投稿、提案を行います。そのときには、AppArmor?との違いが明確になっており、SELinuxとの親和性を高める必要があります。AppArmor?のBoFの発表では、TOMOYOの機能を取り込むことが明言されていました。時間との闘いです。
これまで 「 使いこなせて安全 」 なLinuxを目指して開発してきた1.X系統についても、今後開発、質問対応等を行いますが、基本的には新規機能の追加よりはバグフィックス、機能改善になります。2.Xのメインライン化を意識して、機能の移植を行います。
Impressions of OLS 2007 †
Tetsuo Handa †
４月の頃は 「 すぐに LKML の人たちに TOMOYO を試してもらい、オタワではパス名ベースの是非を議論することになる」と思っていましたが、
ELC2007 の後は 「 オタワでの時間は短いのでパス名ベースの是非の議論は予め終わらせておきたい」と思うようになりました。しかし、
LSM に対応して LKML に投稿するのが大幅に遅れてしまい、また、 AppArmor ?
のスレッドでパス名ベースの是非は既に出尽くしてしまい、期せずしてオタワでは
TOMOYO の紹介に専念することになったという感じです。パス名ベースの是非で時間を浪費される事態は避けられましたが、
TOMOYO の本質が充分に伝わったかどうかはまだ判りません。
事前情報交換会で会場の様子を見せてもらった時から、これはお祭りなんだなと思いました。実際、対立するような場面は無く、笑いが絶えませんでした。
英語で喋るほうは大体事前に考えていた通りですが、聞く方はみんな早口で聞き取れませんでした。聞き取れないのが原因でウケ狙いのところで笑えないのはちょっと寂しいです。
Kentaro Takeda †
LSMへの移植がひとまず終わったところでひと仕事終えたつもりになっていましたが、
それは間違いでした。これからの方がむしろ大変になりそうです。
オタワ でStephen Smalley やChris Wrightと対面してる間は、奇妙な現実感のなさを感じていました。
行く前に感じていた恐れ（SELinux陣営にボコボコにされるのでは…など）は多くが杞憂で、
「オタワに集まる人は少なくとも敵対するために来ているのではない」と感じました。
いずれにせよ、カーネルメンテナにTOMOYOを紹介できたこと、
メンテナたちと個人的なつながりができたことがOLS参加の最大の収穫でした。
全般的に、英語力の不足を痛感しました。 原田さん、半田さんのサポートが充分にできない自分に歯がゆい思いをしました。
It has always gotten my goat that Internet Explorer ’s non-standard use of the object tag has forced standards - loving browsers to use the non-standard embed tag in order to embed movies on a web page .
Even on Apple ’s site , the embed tag — a Netscape extension , for Pete ’s sake !— is so entrenched that it ’s hard to even find information about using the object element for QuickTime , except in a non-standard way .
Article Continues Below
The use of embed has gone on too long .
Wishing for it to become part of the official specs is like wishing your partner would start putting the cap on the toothpaste .
It ’s not going to happen .
It ’s time to move on .
If you want to validate your website , you have to get rid of embed .
In this article , I ’ll show you how .
Online Movies : Google Video and YouTube#section2
ALA readers will remember Drew McLellan ’s seminal article on Flash Satay .
In that article , Drew described a method for inserting Flash animations on a page without using the embed element .
Flash Satay has two parts .
First , Drew figured out that you can use a single object element to call Flash as long as you specify its type adequately .
Second , to properly stream Flash movies , you have to embed a sort of reference movie .
I ’ve been experimenting with Drew ’s code on Google Video and YouTube content .
I was shocked to find that Google Video suggests you use only the embed tag to embed their video on Web pages .
Alas , not shocked that they would suggest such a thing — just shocked that it actually works on Internet Explorer , which stopped supporting the non-standard , but universally - supported embed tag years ago in favor of its proprietary implementation of the standard object tag that renders that tag completely invisible to standards - loving browsers .
It turns out that IE supports embed as long as the visitor has the appropriate player already installed .
If not , they get an error and a generic broken - plugin icon , but no help .
YouTube , for its part , does the often seen but hardly standard twice cooked approach , offering both the object and embed tags .
Since both Google Video and YouTube serve movies through the Flash player — regardless of your movie ’s format when you uploaded it — you can use Drew ’s single object method to embed such movies on your page .
Indeed , you do n’t have to use the Satay part of his code ; movies on Google Video and YouTube stream even without the reference movie he suggests .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< object type= " application /x-shockwave - flash " data= " http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf? » 8755581808731033658 " width = " 400 " height = " 326 " id =" VideoPlayback " > < param name = " movie " value = " http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?

My real peeve , however , as I mentioned above , is n’t with Flash movies — which I have little experience with — but with QuickTime and Windows Media Player movies .
I ’ve been trying to embed these in a standard way for years , but without much luck .
Quite recently , I came upon the MIME type that will let you use a single object for Windows Media Player files ( .wmv ) .
I still ca n’t quite believe it .
Eureka !
One object for Windows Media Player #section3
I am a firm believer in paying attention to mistakes .
It ’s only when I notice that I ’ve done something wrong , and figure out why , that I am able to figure out new ways of doing things right .
As I was reviewing the technique , I noticed that although it did work well for QuickTime movies ( as described below ) , it did n’t work for Windows Media Player movies …on Opera …for Windows .
I suppressed the urge to ignore it , and as I dug for an answer to that problem , I came across the MIME type that will let you use a single object to embed Windows Media Player files : video / x - ms - wmv .
To embed a Windows Media Player file , you should be able to use this code ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object type =" video/x-ms-wmv " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " autostart " value = " true " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object >
But it turns out that IE6 and IE7 and Safari ( strange bedfellows if ever there were ) , all need a little extra push , in the form of an extra param element :
< object type =" video/x-ms-wmv " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " /> < param name = " autostart " value = " true " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object >
And it works .
Personally , I consider this pretty experimental , or at the very least sacrilegious … embedding a Windows Media Player movie without a classid !
( What ’s next ?
Valid documents with no DOCTYPE ? )
I tested this simple example in IE5.5 , IE6 , IE7 , Opera Win / Mac , Firefox Win / Mac , and Safari and it worked just fine .
That said , I do n’t do a lot of scripting or Microsoft stuff , so your mileage may vary .
( Note : Of course , there are many more param elements that you may wish to use . )
Embedding QuickTime movies without embed #section4
Unfortunately , I ’m still pretty sure there ’s no type that would convince IE to open a QuickTime movie without an ActiveX control .
The obvious choices , type =" video/ quicktime " or even type =" application / x- quicktime " , only work on standards - loving browsers .
So I went a different route .
Some basic premises #section5
This technique is based on a couple of premises :
First , the object element is designed to be nested in order to help browsers degrade gracefully .
If a browser ca n’t display the outermost object , it should try the next one and then the next one until it finds one it can handle .
Once it does find an object it can deal with , it is supposed to ignore the rest .

If a browser ca n’t display the outermost , it should try the next one and then the next one until it finds one it can handle .
Once it does find an it can deal with , it is supposed to ignore the rest .
Second , most major browsers fully support the object element .
The big exception is ( surprise ) Internet Explorer .
IE6 displays all object elements it can deal with — even if they ’re nested — as well as rather ugly , ghostly apparitions of the ones it can’t .
Thankfully , IE7 does n’t do the ghosts , but it unfortunately does n’t favor the nested objects if there ’s a problem with the outer object .
It just gives you an error .

Third , Internet Explorer ( up to and including version 7 ) implements the object element in a non-standard way that makes other browsers ignore it .
I think the answer can be found in IE ’s system of conditional comments .
I started hearing about it when folks were trying to decide how to deal with IE7 ’s new approximation to CSS .
And while IE ’s commenting is peculiar to IE ( read : proprietary ) , so is its failure to properly use the object element .
It ’s a perfect match .
Embedding QuickTime for Internet Explorer#section6
I ’m going to use QuickTime for my example , but you can use the same technique with Windows Media Player movies with the classid attribute , as I ’ll show you a bit farther along .
To insert a basic QuickTime movie in Internet Explorer , we ’ll use something like this ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80 » - D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> </object >
Do n’t forget the height or the width or that horrendous classid which calls the QuickTime ActiveX control .
Note that the param element that specifies the URI of the movie has a name attribute of “ src , ” not “ url ” or “ movie . ”
You can preview the effect here .
In IE , you ’ll see a movie , in other browsers you wo n’t see a thing .
Embedding QuickTime movies for everyone else#section7
Although standards - loving browsers can’t deal with that object since the classid attribute is that awful number instead of a URL , they will keep looking to see if there ’s any nested objects they can deal with .
So , just before the closing < / object > tag , we ’ll use a standard implementation of the object element ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80- » D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < object type=" video/quicktime " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object > </object >
The width and height are required , as is the type .
If you view this combination in a standards - loving browser , it looks great , if a bit loud .
IE 6 ( and earlier ) , as we mentioned before , ca n’t quite decide what to do with the second object and basically botches it with a ghostly apparition .
What IE ca n’t see , it ca n’t mess up #section8
Although IE ’s conditional comments were designed to be used for the rather questionable purpose of serving it special code that is hidden from other browsers , we ’ll use them here to hide code from IE but not from other browsers .
( It ’s a bit of a slap in the face — though not really that surprising — that Microsoft has the nerve to refer to these other browsers as “ downlevel ” . )
Comments written with Microsoft ’s “ original syntax ” do n’t validate ( surprise ) but thankfully , Lachlan Hunt figured out a way to adjust them so that they do .
So we need to hide the second object from IE with its own commenting system .
Insert <!--[ if !IE ] >--> in front of the second < object > tag and <!--<![ endif ] --> right after the first closing < / object > tag .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80- » D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> <!--[ if !IE ] >--> < object type=" video/quicktime " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object > <!--<![ endif ] --> </object >
Now it ’s beautiful !
What ’s more you can use the whole collection of parameters with the object element as described on Apple ’s Developers site .
Next time , I ’ll test with a slightly less raucous movie .
The details for Windows Media Player #section9
If you ’d rather embed Windows Media Player files with the classid and not in the one - object method I demonstrate near the beginning of this article , the code is only slightly different .
For the classid in the initial object tag , use classid= " CLSID :6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6 " .
To specify the URL of your Windows Media Player movie , use a param element with a name attribute equal to “ url ” for most browsers and then repeat the value using a name attribute equal to “ src ” for Safari .
Then in the second , standards - compliant implementation of the object , use the same code as in the one - object method .
Here ’s an example ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object classid= " CLSID:6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153- » 00C04F79FAA6 " id =" player " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " url " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive » /fishstore.wmv " /> < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive » /fishstore.wmv " /> < param name = " showcontrols " value = " true " /> < param name =" autostart " value = " true " /> <!--[ if !IE ] >--> < object type =" video/x-ms-wmv " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive » /fishstore.wmv " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/ » catalunyalive/fishstore.wmv " /> < param name = " autostart " value = " true " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object > <!--<![ endif ] --> </object >
A small wrinkle , or , what ’s left to do#section10
As of January 2006 , Apple started promoting the use of JavaScript to call movies for web pages so that users would n’t have to click on ActiveX controls in order to activate them .
It ’s a long , convoluted story that began with a lawsuit against Microsoft and ended up making life difficult for the rest of us .
At any rate , the methods described above work almost perfectly without any JavaScript at all , with one caveat : QuickTime movies wo n’t autoplay in IE .
I ’m not sure I ’d even want the example video to autoplay !
Nevertheless , I find it highly suspicious that Windows Media Player files load in the background and autoplay without any interaction while QuickTime movies show just the initial frame while the audio plays , but no moving pictures are shown .
At any rate , I want to see how the activating ActiveX controls issue plays out before I implement what I consider a rather laborious JavaScript solution to my whole site .
I use very little JavaScript and like to keep it that way .
Whether you go the JavaScript route or not is actually irrelevant to the article at hand .
Either way , you can still eschew the embed tag for the standard object element .
I would have liked to figure out a way to hide the inner objects only from IE 6 and earlier , since IE 7 ( at least in beta 2 ) seems to be handling nested object elements properly , but I was unsuccessful .
While there is a conditional comment that would allow such a thing ( <!--[ if gte IE 7 ] >--> ) , the extra characters ( --> ) that Lachlan offered to make the thing validate are visible with IE7 ( as they should be logically ) .
Any ideas ?
On the shoulders of giants # section11
Other people have also worked on this problem .
This article agreed that two nested object elements should work but relied on what I consider rather complicated CSS to hide the second object .
Ian Hickson used the IE comments to hide a second object from IE that had Flash content .
And the aforementioned Lachlan Hunt figured out how to write valid Internet Explorer conditional comments that hide content from IE while revealing it to other browsers .
