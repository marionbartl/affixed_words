On 27th January 2010 , the 25th series of experiments studying complex plasmas will start on board the international space station ISS .
Physicists from the Max - Planck - Institute for extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany , will use them to study fundamental structure forming processes to better understand what happens in liquids and solids .
That matter exists in three states is widely known : as solid , liquid or gas .
Our Universe , however , is dominated by a fourth state of matter : plasma .
This forms , if a gas is heated to very high temperatures , so that its molecules dissociate in ions and free electrons .
A plasma is regarded as the most disorganised state of matter .
Researchers at the Max - Planck - Institute for extraterrestrial Physics , however , have found that under certain conditions plasmas can become liquid or may even crystallise .
These are called " complex plasmas " and allow new insights into the physics of liquids and solids .
Plasma physicists use them to study melting and crystallisation , motion of lattice defects in crystals , or liquid effects and other processes by looking at single atoms .
Complex plasmas consist of tiny particles ( about one thousandth of a millimetre ) that are suspended in a plasma and carry a highly negative electric charge .
Due to the strong interaction between the particles , they can form regular structures , either liquid or solid .
Since Earth´s gravitational field interferes with these processes , experiments with complex plasmas are carried out in space .
Research on complex plasmas with the PKE - Nefedov laboratory in 2001 was the first science project on board the international space station ISS and the most successful one during the first years .
Its successor PK - 3 Plus has already been running for four years and provides again unique results .
The new series of experiments , carried out from 27th to 29th January is already the 25th mission to study complex plasmas in the absence of gravity .
Moreover , PK - 3 Plus has now been installed permanently in the new ISS module MIM - 2 , and will be its first scientific experiment .
One of the experiments in the PK - 3 Plus laboratory will deal with " binary " complex plasmas : if two kinds of particles with different sizes are suspended in a homogeneous plasma , one could expect them to mix due to mutual repulsion .
Previous experiments on board the ISS , however , have shown a clear phase separation of the two particles clouds ( see 2 ) .
" This phenomenon is well known from many different systems , such as molecular liquids or colloidal suspensions , and has been studied for a long time , " says Hubertus Thomas , MPE - scientist and coordinator of the PK - 3 Plus experiments .
" In complex plasmas , for the first time we can now study these processes looking at the movement of individual particles and we hope that our latest experiments will lead to new insights into the physics of phase separation . "
The study of complex plasmas is interdisciplinary , fundamental research .
As in other fundamental research before , however , this work initiated a new approach in applied research : the results and experience gained with the plasma experiments on board the ISS and in the lab led to a new medical field , the so - called plasma medicine .
Currently a clinical trial is carried out to study how plasmas can be employed for contact - free sterilisation of wounds , hand disinfection in clinical environments or treatment of gingivitis .
SEOUL , South Korea —
When I told my friends I would visit a Korean shaman , or mudang , their responses were n’t exactly reassuring .
One Korean university student explained to me that evil spirits would hijack my body , prompting me to slit my wrists and drink my own blood until I became a minion of Satan .
“ Are you nuts ?
They ’re evil ! ” another friend exclaimed .
I ’m a skeptic , but even I was spooked .
So I was relieved when the mudang — a mellow 44 - year - old man who goes by the alias Mu-gyuk ( literally “ male exorcist ” ) — approached me with a gentle smile and a warm bow , hardly the appearance of the flesh - thirsty Dracula everyone said he would be .
For hours , Mu-gyuk reminisced about his life as a former gambling addict and prison convict , when he swears he “ saw the light ” and became a spiritualist .
After his reform , Mu-gyuk claimed he got strange headaches and chest pains ; doctors could n’t uncover his ailment , so he consulted a mudang master who advised him to become one , too .
At that point , he also claimed he could see ghosts .
So Mu-gyuk underwent a rigorous initiation ceremony that included balancing on swords to show the evil spirits his strength .
Today , he could n’t be happier .

“ People say bad things about us [ mudangs ] , ” he reflected .
“ But we ’ve managed to regain our popularity in Korea .
I think people can see most of us want to help . ”
( He warned this correspondent of bad luck should he write stories about communist North Korea . )
Indeed , South Koreans are seeing a resurgence in interest in shamanism following decades of squeamish stereotypes , like those I encountered .
That ’s thanks to a wave of attention from popular culture — and to an economic crisis that has left jobless Korean youngsters in need of ancestral blessings and fortune readings .
After the Korean War , some scholars argued Korea ’s indigenous religions would die out as the country entered a period of rapid modernization .
Since the 1960s , the country has leaped from being one of the poorest in the world to a powerhouse of skyscrapers and Samsung gadgets .
Mudangs were seen as backwards , and because of this , presidents tried to eliminate the craft until the 1980s .
As Korea ’s cities sprouted up throughout those years , migrants from the countryside sought opportunities in Seoul .
The mudangs , who wanted to keep their clientele , followed them — and today , most shamans can be found in cities , contrary to a stereotype among some foreigners .
Today , however , mudangs are living in a different Korea , and they ’ve found ways to fuse their ancient customs with their modern surroundings .
It ’s old meets new .
Mudangs , for example , can pick the gods they worship among thousands — which , in addition to indigenous Korean gods , can include Jesus , Buddha , and oddly even former South Korean dictator Park Chung - hee .
Strangely , in the 1970s , under a pro-American government , some mudangs embraced General Douglas MacArthur as their deity , throwing on sunglasses and smoking a pipe to resemble him when they channeled his spirit .
Aside from that short - lived fad , shamanism is n’t funny business in Korea .
“ Koreans take shamans ' advice seriously , ” said Kim Seong - nae , a professor of religion at Sogang University in Seoul , pointing out that mudism ( the mudang belief system ) is more a cultural custom than a religion like Christianity or Buddhism .
“ Most contemporary Koreans do not fear shamans or mudangs , but instead rely heavily on their counseling for significant life decisions such as birth , marriage , house moving , success , business and politics . ”
To advise their clients , mudangs — most of whom are women — oversee religious ceremonies called kut , during which they bang loudly on cymbals to call spirits for guidance .
Most charge between $ 20 and $ 80 for fortune - tellings ; shadier shamans have been known to warn their clients of their impending death , then demand thousands of dollars to convince the spirits they should live .
Today , seeing a mudang is a practice is so widespread that even politicians consult mudangs , sometimes asking where they should relocate their ancestors ’ remains to ensure good luck in their next election .
But with Asia ’s largest population of evangelical Christians , the recent growth of mudism has sparked some uneasiness , too .
“ Mudangs ’ activities come from ghosts who are the puppets of Satan , ” said Park Young - mo , a Christian pastor in Seoul .
“ Their resurgence is thanks to young people who are having an identity crisis , ” he added , pointing to teenagers experimenting with the art .
But critics of that stance point out that most Koreans , regardless of their religion , perform rites for their ancestors in a manner similar to some mudang ceremonies .
David Kwang - sun Seo , a Protestant theologian , argues that Korean Protestantism itself draws heavily on pre-Christian customs like mudism .
In South Korea ’s version of Protestantism , he says , Koreans often interpret “ receiving ” the Holy Spirit as being literally possessed by it — a striking resemblance to mudangs , who also claim to be possessed by spirits .
Therefore , he claims , Korean Protestants should take a more nuanced stance to their traditional ways .
For Mu-gyuk , the growing tolerance of mudangs in pop culture is good news , despite harking by skeptics .
He ’s particularly fond of a Korean reality TV show called " Exorcist , " in which the crew follows a mudang on her daily works .
“ With the pop culture references , Koreans are starting to like mudangs again , ” he ponders .
“ I do n’t think old ways could really ever die . ”
Amateur star - gazer captures astonishing images of Milky Way through hole in roof of his garden shed
An amateur star - gazer has stunned astronomers around the world with these amazing photographs of the universe - taken from his garden shed .
Peter Shah , 38 , cut a hole in the roof of his wooden shed and set up his modest eight - inch telescope inside .
After months of patiently waiting for the right moment , he captured a series of striking images of the Milky Way from the comfort of his own back garden .
Striking : Amateur astronomer Peter Shah captured this incredible image of The Pleiades from a telescope in his garden shed
His photographs show a vivid variety of star clusters light years from Earth and have been compared favourably with the images taken from the £ 2.5 billion Hubble telescope .
But Mr Shah spent only £ 20,000 to equip his garden shed with a telescope linked to his home computer .
He said : ' Most men like to potter about in their garden shed - but mine is a bit more high tech than most .
' I have fitted it with a sliding roof so I can sit in comfort and look at the heavens .
Patient : Mr Shah spent months in his back garden carefully capturing the images , including this one of The Monkey 's Head nebula
Universe :
The collection of images , including this one of The Bubble nebula , has been compared with those taken by the £ 2.5 billion Hubble telescope
' I have a very modest set up but it just goes to show that a window to the universe is there for all of us - even with the smallest budgets .
' I had to be patient and take the images over a period of several months because the skies in Britain after often clouded over and you need clear conditions . '
The office worker , who lives in a hillside bungalow at Meifod , near Welshpool , Powys , has been an avid astronomer since his mother bought him a £ 5 telescope when he was seven .
His images include the Monkey 's Head nebula , M33 Pinwheel Galaxy , Andromeda Galaxy and the Flaming Star nebula .
Inspired : Mr Shah has been a keen astronomer since his mother bought him a £ 5 telescope when he was seven .
Pictured here is the M33 Pinwheel Galaxy
Budget : Mr Shah , 38 , fitted his garden shed with a sliding roof and spent £ 20,000 linking his telescope to his home computer before capturing the images
Mr Shah 's pictures , which are each made up of about 30 frames , will be published in a new book entitled Mirror Image .
His wife Lisa has supported him through his long nights of star - gazing , supplying endless cups of coffee .
And the couple 's two - year - old son Oliver is already showing an interest in his father 's hobby .
Executives from California health insurance giant Anthem Blue Cross , under fire for scheduled rate hikes of up to 39 % , insisted Tuesday that their premiums were fair and legal , and they told lawmakers they expected that the increases would go forward .
Appearing before the state Assembly ’s health committee , the officials said that they believed rate increases for individual health insurance policies , delayed until May 1 while being reviewed by the Department of Insurance , would survive scrutiny by regulators
The testimony came as members of the committee lashed out at Anthem for its proposed rate hikes and its corporate profit a day before the rate controversy moves to Washington , where a congressional subcommittee holds a hearing Wednesday .
At issue are steep premium increases for many of Anthem ’s 800,000 California customers who buy policies for themselves because they do not have insurance through employers .
The increases , which had been scheduled to take effect March 1 , were delayed while independent actuaries , hired by California ’s insurance commissioner , review whether they are justified under state law .
Since word of rate increases in late January , the hikes and the profit of Anthem ’s parent company , WellPoint Inc. , have come under attack by customers , insurance brokers , consumer advocates , regulators , lawmakers and the Obama administration .
President Obama on Monday proposed an expansion of federal authority to regulate health insurance rate increases such as Anthem ’s as part of his national healthcare reform package .
In Sacramento , Anthem ’s president , Leslie Margolin , told the committee that much of the public frustration over the rate hikes was misdirected and should be aimed at the nation ’s healthcare system .
“ This debate and this inquiry cannot and should not be just about the insurance industry or the delivery system or regulators or legislators or customers or brokers , ” Margolin said .
“ We have wasted precious time and precious resources doing battle with each other , ” she added .
“ We must come together collaboratively and strategically to address the distressing symptoms of our troubled system -- rising premiums , for example -- and to address the fundamental underlying causes of our collective failure . ”
The health committee ’s chairman , Assemblyman Dave Jones ( D - Sacramento ) , called the Anthem hikes “ astonishing ” as he renewed his call for the state to regulate health insurance rates the way it limits increases for auto and property insurance .
“ Are you planning to go forward with the rate increases ? ” Jones asked executives from Anthem and Wellpoint during Tuesday ’s hearing in Sacramento .
James Oatman , WellPoint ’s vice president and general manager of individual business , responded : “ We believe the rate increase we have applied for is consistent with all the laws of the state of California .
We are advocating that those rates are appropriate rates . ”
The California Department of Insurance will allow Anthem ’s rate increases only if outside actuaries certify that the company spends at least 70 % of its premiums on medical claims , as required by state law , a department spokesman said .
That review should be finished by mid-April .
Anthem officials have said they meet the standard .
If the spending falls below the 70 % level , “ we will exercise our full regulatory authority to force them to lower their rates , ” department spokesman Darrel Ng said .
“ Our rule is to ensure they follow state law .
The company has been consistent with asserting that its rates are legal . ”
Oatman testified with Anthem President Margolin .
Both defended
Anthem ’s profit margin during an often - testy hearing , saying it was 2.5 % to 5 % , a figure they said put it in line with other insurers .
A Times analysis of Anthem ’s financial reports to regulators showed Anthem has transferred more than $ 4.2 billion in dividends to WellPoint since 2004 .
“ How much profit is enough ? ” Jones asked the executives .
“ We have no interest in profit beyond the range I have described to you , ” Margolin responded .
“ Profits in the range of 2.5 % to 5 % are reasonable profits .
They are appropriate profits .
They are profits that we have as . . . a responsibility to keep a viable business surviving . ”
Jones was unmoved by her testimony .
“ Have you no shame ? ” he said .
Anthem began notifying policyholders in January of the proposed rate hikes .
The company told customers at the time that it might also depart from its typical practice of increasing premiums annually and instead do so more often .
Anthem is not the only insurer across the country to raise rates by double digits , but its increases have caused a national furor over insurance costs .
Critics have roundly condemned the increases , saying they vastly exceed the rise of national healthcare spending .
Indianapolis - based WellPoint , which has taken the lead defending the rates , said that less than a quarter of those affected would see increases of 35 % to 39 % .
The average will be about 25 % , while some policyholders will see rates drop by as much as 20 % , company executives said .
WellPoint has argued that the higher premiums reflect soaring medical costs and the changing pool of individual policyholders .
Younger and healthier customers are forgoing insurance in the tough economy , leaving older and sicker people with greater health needs to share the cost of individual coverage , the company said .

The U.S. government 's move to deepen its ties to mortgage - finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by agreeing to absorb unlimited losses for the next three years is igniting a debate over whether it should bring the business operations of the companies onto its books .
A decision on how the government treats Fannie and Freddie could have broader political implications .
So far , the White House has resisted calls by Republicans to bring Fannie 's and Freddie 's obligations onto the government 's books , a move that could boost ...
Tycoon Donald Trump , citing the East Coast 's massive snowstorms , says former vice president Al Gore should be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize , according to the New York Post .
The paper reports that the billionaire told about 500 members of his Trump National Golf Club in Westchester , N.Y. :
With the coldest winter ever recorded , with snow setting record levels up and down the coast , the Nobel committee should take the Nobel Prize back from Al Gore .
Gore wants us to clean up our factories and plants in order to protect us from global warming , when China and other countries could n't care less .
It would make us totally non-competitive in the manufacturing world , and China , Japan and India are laughing at America 's stupidity .
Trump did not mention Vancouver 's lack of snow , which has prompted truckloads of snow to be carried to Olympic skiing and snowboarding venues .
As a prior post reports , global warming skeptics , including GOP Sen .
Jim DeMint of South Carolina , have used snowmageddon to taunt Gore , who has warned of the dangers of climate change .
Scientists say global warming is actually contributing to new extreme weather patterns .
The wrangling has prompted political comedian Stephen Colbert to have some fun of his own , mocking Fox News for mocking climate change .
Readers : Did Trump go too far ?

Pete Owen Jones presents the definitive guide to faith on earth , with eighty rituals across six continents in the space of a year
Ever since I was a kid I have loved taking things apart .
I love it even more when they go back together again .
If you have a few basic tools and curiosity it is amazing the things that can be done .
If you are n't handy , with patience you can learn at least a few skills that will take you far and save you money .
My brother gave me an answering machine in 1995 .
It 's not digital and makes clunking sounds as it faithfully does its work year after year .
We thought about replacing it with a silent digital model , but in Frugalville , if it is not irreparably broken it does n't get replaced .
Lately the recording mechanism started to get a little distorted .
My outgoing message was not sounding like me any more , and listening to incoming messages was like deciphering backwards masking on a Beatles album .
Time to grab the tools and rip it apart , then hope I do n't pull a Humpty Dumpty .
Even if I did , fifteen years of faithful service for a used piece of electronics makes it fully eligible for retirement in a nice museum somewhere .
I snapped on the latex gloves , grabbed my tools and opened the patient .
Since I did not study electronics anatomy , it all looked like indecipherable guts to my untrained eyes .
I went for the heart of the matter and took a look at the motor drive , something I did recognize .
Sure enough the drive belt was stretched beyond usefulness causing the devil in the machine sound effects .
From my Drawer of Potentially Useful
Things I drew several sizes of rubber bands .
After snapping Linda with one , I proceeded to choose just the right size to make a new belt drive and stretched it into place .
Then I stitched the patient up and hooked it up to a power source .
It worked .
Ya , I could replace it for less than $ 20 dollars , but now I do n't have to .
The rubber band was free .
We live in a world in which powerful interests profit from having us believe that we can not do things for ourselves , and we must rely on them - for a price .
The fact is , we are capable of doing much more than we think .
The solutions are often free , and fun .
We can build , repair , create , and enjoy ourselves while saving resources and money .
Google ’s Chrome OS wo n’t be officially launched until later this year , but the netbook - centric operating system is open source .
And that means that anybody can download the code , tinker with it , and put out a pre-release build that you can install and run .
And that ’s exactly what Hexxeh has done … repeatedly .
The latest Hexxeh build of Chromium OS ( the pre-release , open source version of Chrome ) , includes a nice surprise for anyone looking to squeeze a little HD video playback out of their mini-laptop : support for the NVIDIA ION chipset .
The NVIDIA ION platform bundles an NVIDIA graphics processor with a low power Intel Atom chip .
Right now , there are only a handful of ION - powered netbooks and nettops on the market , but if you happen to have an Eee PC 1201N , Lenovo IdeaPad S12 , Samsung N510 , or HP Mini 311 , it looks like you can install Chromium today and enable HD video playback .
Chrome OS is a light weight , Linux - based operating system designed to bridge the gap between desktop and local applications .
Or rather , demolish that gap .
Most of the applications Google expects you to run using Chrome OS are based in the cloud rather than on your computer .
The OS is basically a glorified web browser with media playback capabilities and a few other tricks includign caching for accessing some data while offline .

A group of Palestinians descended from 15 of Jerusalem 's oldest Arab families lodged a protest with the UN today in a fresh effort to prevent the construction of a " Museum of Tolerance " on the site of an ancient Muslim cemetery .
The project , run by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles , has been dogged by controversy since its launch in 2004 .
Islamic groups and individual Palestinians complained that the site , in west Jerusalem , was the ancient cemetery of Ma'man Allah , also known as Mamilla , which housed thousands of graves dating back hundreds of years and where even today there are still many gravestones and tombs .
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre argued the site was adjacent to the cemetery and that construction would be on what is today a municipal car park .
After legal battles , the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in October 2008 that building could go ahead .
But the Israel Antiquities Authority 's chief excavator for the site , Gideon Suleimani , found the site was a cemetery in use for the past 1,000 years that " abounded with graves " and should not be open to construction without a full excavation , which never happened .
He said his assessment was ignored by the court .
Then late last year Frank Gehry , the celebrity architect working on the project , withdrew .
Some 60 Palestinians have signed a petition which was lodged today in Geneva with several UN bodies , including the high commissioner for human rights , the special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief and Unesco , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation .
" This construction project has resulted in the undignified disinterment and disposal of several hundred graves and human remains , the exact amount and whereabouts of which are currently unknown and threatens to erect a monument to ' Human Dignity ' and ' Tolerance ' atop thousands more graves , " the petition says .
It describes the project as a violation of international human rights law and calls for a halt to construction , the reburial of all the remains and the preservation of the cemetery as a protected site .
" This tolerance museum to us is a museum of intolerance , " said Dyala Husseini , who has ancestors from her family and her husband 's family buried in the cemetery .
" It is very inhumane , it is very humiliating and it ignores our existence as Palestinian families here in Jerusalem .
Our families are here in Jerusalem and have been here for centuries , " she said .
Jamal Nusseibeh said one of his ancestors , the former governor of Jerusalem Burhan al - Din al - Khazraji ibn Nusseibeh , was buried in the cemetery in 1432 .
" It is part of the rich fabric of Jerusalem which always has been a symbol of tolerance , " he said .
" The fact that anybody could wish to wipe out such a structural part of this fabric in order somehow to promote tolerance is very hard to understand . "
Last month Rabbi Marvin Hier , the Simon Wiesenthal Centre 's founder , said the project was on a " fantastic site in the heart of Jerusalem " and would bring " to Jerusalem and the people of Israel , a project of crucial significance to its future " .
The centre has said the museum is being built on a car park next to the cemetery and that there was no protest about the construction of the car park 50 years ago .
" Is it better to let this site remain a parking lot , or build a centre for human dignity there , which would teach young people mutual respect and social responsibility ? " it said after the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in its favour .
The petition contains maps , photographs and other documents to make the case that the museum site is on the grounds of the cemetery , as is the car park .
When the car park was built in the early 1960s there were protests , the petition says , but Palestinians in Israel were under military law , which severely curtailed their civil rights , including their ability to challenge the work .
MYITKYINA , Burma —
On the first morning of each New Year , hundreds of people come to pray on the banks of the Irrawaddy River in northern Burma .
This year , they prayed that their villages , farms and churches would not be drowned .
A large dam will flood an area the size of New York City and displace thousands of local people over the next two to three years .
The Myitsone dam , constructed by the Burmese military government and the China Power Investment Co. , calls for a 500 - foot - wide by 500 - foot - high dam face , and is projected to produce between 3,600 to 6,000 megawatts of electricity by 2017 .
The dam will inundate 300 square miles in Kachin state , flooding 47 villages , including the Mother of Peace shrine where the traditional New Year 's prayers are held .
But the capital of Kachin state , Myitkyina , already has affordable power 24 hours a day .
So , why displace thousands of people in Burma when they already have power ?
Man prays during 24 - hour prayer against Myitsone dam , Jan. 18 .
( Ryan Libre / GlobalPost )
Because when the Myitsone dam is complete , the hydroelectric power will go to Yunnan , China .
In addition , the water reserves will irrigate a mega-plantation inside the protected Hukawng Valley in Burma , now home to the world 's largest tiger reserve , furthering the displacement of people and destruction of the environment .
The dam will generate an estimated $ 500 million in gross annual revenue for the Burmese government , which has long been criticized for its gross human rights abuses — including but not limited to the recent trial , conviction and sentencing of pro-democracy leader Aung
San Suu Kyi , and the brutal crackdown of Buddhist monks in September 2007 .
Kachin is extremely rich in natural resources .
Jade , gold , teakwood and silicone are exported in large quantities , and the mountainous , fertile terrain offers many hydropower sites .
But because the Burmese government tightly controls resources and politics , the Kachin people have little say in their land and little benefit from its exploitation .
Construction jobs are earmarked for Chinese migrants , not the local people of Kachin .
The opening ceremony for the Myitsone dam was held with high - powered officials from both the Burmese and Chinese government .
The few local villagers who were present had been
instructed to attend .
Chinese work camps already have been built near the Mother of Prayer shrine , and the first truckloads of workers are gearing up for construction .
Caravans of Burmese soldiers have arrived to secure both the dam site and the Chinese labor camps .
The signs pointing the way to the dam site are up , not in the local language , Jinghpaw , but in Chinese .
Burmese gold miners and loggers from the south also have come north with help from military contacts to start extraction , industrial and commercial enterprises .
Like many Kachins , the local villagers facing displacement are poor and pious .
The Burmese government and China are also collaborating on a pipeline to bring oil from the Bay of Bengal through lowland Burma and the Shan state to Yunan , bypassing the long maritime route through the bottle - necked Strait of Malacca , according to the China Daily .
Bilateral investment , trade and arms deals with China bankroll the Burmese military government , despite sanctions by many of the world 's largest economies , according to the BBC .
Lacking the basic rights to express their opposition , people in Burma have been unable to protest the dam and pipeline projects .
The Burmese military is bankrolled by the vast Burmese resources it extracts and sells , and it maintains power despite widespread popular opposition and international condemnation , according to the Burma River ’s Network , which represents communities in Burma affected by dam projects .
Twenty - five large dams are planned or are under construction in Burma , the Burma River Network said , and Kachin locals say they worry about the dams ' safety .
In 2006 , two dams in Kachin state broke under stress after heavy rains .
One of these dams failed and destroyed hundreds of patty fields and farms .
The other , the 2.5 megawatt Chying Hkrang dam , relatively small in comparison to the 3600 - megawatt Myitsone dam , collapsed killing five people .
Kachin people have voiced worries about the Myitsone dam 's planned location 24 miles above the state capital and 62 miles from Burma ’s earthquake prone Sagaing fault line .
" If I have to move , I will not move downstream to the capital , " said a local pastor .
" I could never get a good night sleep because I think this dam will also break . "
The Mother of Peace shrine sits on an island where the Mali and Mai rivers converge to create the great Irrawaddy River .
The New Year 's prayer ceremony is deeply religious and apolitical .
Villagers ask for forgiveness for their sins , and they pray for health , safety and peace .
" I will pray silently and directly to God for a miracle , to stop the dam project , " said one villager .
" I will not voice this prayer out of concern for my safety .
I have no illusions that the government cares what I think . "
A funny thing happened on the way back from the Debate Thursday night . . .
As I noted in my previous post HERE , Texas ’ newspapers seemed to have many commenters who thought Debra Medina had acquitted herself well in the debate on Thursday .
Possibly as a reaction to that apparent groundswell of support , many of these newspapers put up unscientific polls of their readers to see who they thought won the debate .
The results were surprising .
The Texans Uniting for Reform and Freedom website , an admittedly anti-Perry Group , shows an overwhelming vote for Medina :
CBS - 11 in Dallas had a similar result :
My Fox Dallas - Fort Worth was also similar :
As well as the Fort Worth Star - Telegram too :
In fact , eight of eight polls agree :
Source Perry % Hutchison % Medina % Medina Votes Total T.U.R.F. 8.7 3.6 87.8 344 392 CBS - 11 in Dallas 8 7 76 unk. unk . My Fox Dallas - Ft Worth 14 16 68 unk. 2517 Fort Worth Star - Telegram 14 15 62 661 1073 Big Country Blog 10 13 71.3 855 unk. Abilene Reporter - News 7 8 83 1186 1426 Univision TV 4 1 95 363 unk. KEYE Austin 11.9 16.5 56 unk. unk .
This is where I put my Bachelor ’s in Psychology and statistics to work .
The first thing I noted is that the sample sizes seem to vary greatly .
While two of the polls have the total number of respondents in the 300’s , the others var from around one thousand to around 1500 to around two thousand .
Were the Medina campaign trying to taint the results by over - voting the surveys , the sample sizes would be more regular .
But some of the surveys , while including the nubmer of total votes or votes for one candidate , do not have all the information .
We can infer this data by doing the math on the known variables , as I have in the revised table below .

And with a little re-arrangement for clarity , we have this :

As widely as the sample sizes vary , it would be impossible for a dedicated band of , say , 350 or so Medina followers to influence the results of a poll of 2,517 respondents .
This lends credibility to the results , even though the people surveyed in these polls are more likely to be active politically , and more “ fired up ” for their respective candidates .
Interesting .
So it actually appears to show a groundswell of support for Debra Medina among committed political activists .
The survey for We Are Austin.com is actually a survey about the election with ALL candidates , Republican and Democrat , included .
So according to We Are Austin.com , not only does Debra Medina place far ahead of all other Republican challengers ( including the incumbent Governor ) , she would even beat the very popular former Houston Mayor Bill White by a 6 to one margin .
And , again , obviously not a scientific poll , but . . . . interesting .
I have it on very good source that the Rasmussen organization will do a survey of the Texas Governor ’s Race this coming week .
Apparently this race is generating significant “ buzz ” in the powers that be .
Awaiting those results as well .

Issue # 122 • March / April , 2010
In a perfect world , we would get all the nutrients and medication we needed from the food we ate .
However , our diets and the foods available to us have changed in the past century , so that eating healthily can be a challenge .
Most of us have a spice rack filled with seasonings we grab in a hurry , but what do we know about these ancient herbs and their medicinal powers ?
Understanding the importance of adding oregano or basil to your spaghetti sauce , not as flavor but as a digestive aid is just one of the keys to turning your kitchen into the pharmacy it was meant to be .
Kelly M. Shattuck , a Certified Herbalist based in North Carolina , says before health food stores made specific herbs such as valerian root readily available for medicinal healing , individuals relied on their culinary herbs to play a very important pharmaceutical role .
“ The great thing about culinary herbs , ” said Shattuck , “ is that a lot people already have them in their kitchen for seasoning , which makes the whole process less intimidating . ”
She also says using kitchen herbs is typically less expensive , and does n’t require a lot of herbal knowledge or monetary investment .
“ Anyone can successfully use herbs as they were meant to be used , to heal and regenerate the body , ” said Shattuck .
“ It ’s just a matter of reading material , taking what you already have on your spice rack , and putting what you read into practice . ”
Before you begin to take stock of your spice rack , let ’s look at preparation methods .
Brewing herbal teas
Use one teaspoon of dried herb or two tablespoons of fresh herb for each cup of water .
The most common method for making a brewed tea is called an infusion .
“ Infusions are used for preparing more fragile parts of the herbs like flowers , seeds , leaves , fruits , and a few roots that are high in volatile oils , for example : valerian root and golden seal root , ” said Shattuck .
“ Place the herbs in a pan of cold water , place a tight fitting lid on the pan , and slowly over low heat bring the water to boiling point .
Take the brew off the heat right before it boils and let it sit 10 to 20 minutes . ”
A decoction is used to break down more tenacious herb materials such as roots , bark , and nuts .
“ Bring water to a boil , add the herbs , bring heat down to a gentle simmer and let brew for 15 to 20 minutes before turning off heat , ” said Shattuck who also recommends soaking tenacious herb materials overnight to soften material before simmering .
Shattuck does n’t use a tea ball when infusing teas , she says it ’s best to put the loose herbs into the water so that the herb material is able to completely release its properties .
Be sure to strain before drinking .
Your medicine cabinet
Basil ( Ocimum basilicum )
Most commonly found in Italian dishes , basil is best added at the last moment , as cooking quickly destroys the flavor .
Basil makes an excellent flavoring for sauces , pesto , dressings , infused oils , and vinegars .
You ’ll find it complements chicken , fish , and pasta dishes not to mention tomatoes and mozzarella during the summer .
As a medicinal herb , basil is commonly used to treat stress - induced insomnia , tension , nervous indigestion , and has been recommended as a tonic for melancholy spirits .
As part of the mint family , basil can be very cooling to the body .
Shattuck recommends infusing minced basil leaves and making a tea before nighttime to help you relax and settle down for the evening .
As a natural mood enhancer , adding basil to your culinary dishes just provides the additional benefit of mental well being .
Bay leaves ( Laurus nobilis ) Used as a dry leaf since the flavor intensifies after drying , bay leaves are most often added to stock , stews , braises , and grain dishes .
The fragrance of the bay leaf is slightly floral , herbal , and similar in scent to oregano and thyme .
Bay leaves have an especially beneficial effect on the stomach and intestinal tract , and contain a property that makes them useful as an alkalizing aid for an overly acidic system .
A simple remedy would be to add extra bay leaves to your soups , stews , and stocks .
You can also infuse a tea with a handful of leaves , and drink that after your meal to calm the intestinal tract .
Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) Dried pepper , derived from the peppercorn , is one of the most commonly used spices in European cuisine it ’s always seen paired with its mate , salt .
Typically , pepper is used as a basic spice for almost any savory dish .
Considered one of the great tonics in Chinese medicine , black pepper has warming , energizing , and stimulating properties .
Often used as an addition to other infusions , black pepper is valued for its ability to stimulate the senses and warm the body .
Shattuck recommends using black peppercorns in a decoction for poor circulation , for colds , or for low energy levels .
Black pepper is also a cook ’s best friend .
In the event you cut yourself while working in the kitchen , pepper applied directly to the cut will stem bleeding .
Cayenne ( Capsicum annuum ) Cayenne is the most potent , essential , and safest stimulant in your spice rack .
In the event you are out camping or hunting , be sure to pack a little cayenne .
As a hemostatic and astringent , cayenne powder applied topically to wounds will arrest bleeding , working rapidly to form a clot and seal off the wound .
It can also be taken for internal bleeding as well .
Cayenne is a wonderful heart tonic , and has an amazing effect upon circulation and stimulation of the cardiovascular system .
For those who feel weak and often chilled , cayenne taken internally increases circulation in the extremities .
Cayenne is also helpful for a sluggish digestive system , and can be sprinkled over any kind of food to aid the body ’s immune system in the event of colds and flus .
When you need extra heat use cayenne in both culinary dishes and physical wellness .
Powdered cayenne has been favored by many as a winter remedy to prevent cold feet and frostbite sprinkle it in your socks to aid warmth in frigid temperatures .
Cinnamon ( Cinnamomum verum ) Cinnamon has long been valued as a spice of precious value , and was one of the earliest spices imported from Sri Lanka .
Cinnamon can be often found in cookies , cakes , and cereals in the United States , but in the Middle East it is highly valued in savory dishes and curries .
Cinnamon ’s antioxidant properties make it a spice you might want to start using more frequently .
Cinnamon aids the digestive system , increases poor circulation , and is being tested in the treatment of type II diabetes , as it is believed to aid in blood sugar control .
Shattuck says it is often used by herbalists to make other herbs palatable .
“ If you had a cold , you could make a warming tea with ginger , and add cinnamon to make that tea taste better and add another element of medicinal value . ”
The smell of cinnamon is also thought to boost brain activity .
Cloves ( Syzygium aromaticum ) Cloves were one of the most highly prized spices of the middle - age spice trade .
Cloves are almost always used as a spice in Indian cuisine .
Cloves combined with cumin and cinnamon are found in Mexican aromatic dishes such as rice and chicken .
Medicinally , the essential oils of cloves are a must in the case of a dental emergency .
Applied topically to a tooth , the oil of clove is an analgesic and powerful germicidal that kills bacteria .
Cloves can also reduce fever : make a decoction if you have clove buds , or an infusion if you have powdered clove to reduce a fever .
Mull the cloves with cinnamon and apple peel to make a tastier tea for those suffering from acute nausea .
Cloves are also believed to have antibiotic properties , and the oil can be applied topically to burns , skin rashes , or irritations like acne .
Fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare )
The fennel root bulb and its seed are found in Italian and Middle - Eastern cooking where the aromatic flavor is used to enhance the taste of fish , eggs , breads , and sauces .
Fennel is the primary ingredient in absinthe .
Medicinally , Fennel is an amazing herb to employ in your cabinet .
Fennel has carminative properties ( reduces gas and flatulence ) and is often used when purgatives are needed to ease the side effects of purging .
A wonderful digestive aid , fennel seeds can be used to make an infusion you can drink after a meal to help digest a food that might cause gassiness or bloating .
You can also sprinkle a spoonful of fennel seeds on your food if you have a cold to clear congestion as fennel helps remove mucous from the body .
Fennel is also used to enrich the quality and quantity of a nursing mother ’s milk fennel capsules are best if a mother is trying to increase milk supply , so that she is getting a more concentrated amount of fennel than with tea .
Fennel also is used to make “ Gripe Water ” for infants which is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate , syrup , and either fennel , anise , or dill water .
In Indian medicine , fennel seeds are believed to improve one ’s eyesight .
In the event of eye inflammation or soreness , room temperature fennel tea can be applied topically with an eyedropper .
Sage ( Salvia officinalis ) Sage is found in many traditional European dishes .
Its slightly peppery flavor and savory leanings make it best when added to meats and cheeses .
And no stuffing would be complete without a good pinch of sage .
Sage also enhances pork flavors and makes an excellent sausage spice .
Sage is believed to have medicinal properties for almost any ailment .
You can make an infusion and use it as an astringent .
Sage has antibiotic properties and is effective in improving a weak digestive system and cutting excess mucous .
Sage tea is an excellent remedy for a chronic winter cough .
A cleansing herb , sage can also be used as a tonic for low energy .
For lactating mothers , sage is also effective in assisting slowing down the milk supply when weaning a baby from mother ’s milk .
Sage has a place historically as an herb that is used to cleanse and purify a space , increase fertility when burned , ward off evil , and heal snake - bites .
Garlic ( Allium sativum ) Garlic is used all over the world as a culinary herb for its pungent flavor and seasoning versatility .
You can add fresh or powdered garlic to soups , stews , stocks , meat dishes , and risottos to name a few .
Garlic is the herb of choice for colds , flus , and sore throats .
Garlic is a very powerful anti-fungal and has antibiotic properties .
In the event of a cold or flu , add powdered garlic to your meal sprinkle on your salad for added flavor and herbal healing .
Shattuck recommends making the following cold - fighting concoction using whole cloves during the winter .
“ Peel about eight or nine garlic cloves and put in a glass jar with equal parts honey and tamari or soy sauce that completely covers the top of the cloves , ” she said , allow the mixture to marinate for several weeks and then eat one or two cloves per day if you feel a cold coming on .
Garlic is an immune booster and is believed to lower cholesterol levels .
Garlic is also used in humans and animals for expelling parasites and ridding the body of intestinal worms .
Garlic can be used as an infection fighter and anti-fungal compound .
Crushed garlic is useful in healing thrush and strep throat .
At the first signs of a scratchy throat , begin self dosing with garlic cloves or powder .
You can alleviate “ garlic breath ” by chewing fresh parsley .
Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) Ginger is an ancient Asian spice that can be found in many desserts , curries , candies , seafood dishes , and vegetarian stir - fries .
Recently , candied ginger has become readily available and has shown up in coffee drinks and on the top of cream cheese frosted cupcakes .
Ginger is an excellent remedy for morning sickness and motion sickness .
Shattuck recommends taking candied ginger on any “ seafaring ” trip in the event of nausea .
Ginger is not only an excellent warming herb but acts as a decongestant in the event of a fever , draw a hot bath and sprinkle a handful of powdered ginger in your water .
The bath will induce your body to sweat out impurities , provide warming in the event of chills , and help your congestion break - up .
Towel off , put on some warm flannels , and go to bed .
You can brew an infusion of fresh ginger to help a sore throat .
Ginger can also stop diarrhea and provide relief from arthritic inflammation .
Nutmeg ( Myristica fragrans ) Nutmeg has a slightly sweet spicy flavor that is often used in cheese sauces to add a delicate taste , or in brewed drinks like eggnog , mulled wine , and mulled cider .
Nutmeg is very useful as a remedy for nausea , vomiting , and indigestion , and also helpful for diarrhea related to food poisoning .
Shattuck says in the event of food poisoning , nutmeg can settle the stomach .
She advises sprinkling powder or grating whole nutmeg over plain brown rice to reintroduce solids , and to make a tea for those who are still unable to keep anything down .
If used improperly , large doses of nutmeg could be toxic .
Oregano ( Origanum vulgare ) Oregano ( and basil ) give Italian cuisine its distinctive flavor , and is more flavorful in its dried state than as a fresh herb .
Found in Greek cuisine , oregano is a wonderful addition to salads , aromatic oils , and meat dishes .
In the United States , oregano is a staple on pizza .
Oregano can help strengthen the immune system , heal digestive eruptions , and is proven to have antioxidant properties , Hippocrates , the father of medicine , advised using oregano as an antiseptic and for respiratory ailments .
Oregano can aid in restful sleep , and an infused tea before bed is advised for nervous temperaments .
Oregano is helpful in fighting skin infections .
Shattuck says you can add oregano to your bath if you have a skin condition or persistent rash .
“ Take a handful of Oregano , tie it in a handkerchief , and toss it in your bath water . ”
Peppermint ( Mentha × piperita ) Peppermint is an easy herb to cultivate and keep in one ’s spice rack .
Believed to be the world ’s oldest medicine , it is often found in teas , candies , chewing gum , and toothpaste .
It is a soothing herb that provides a nice pick - me - up for fatigue .
It is highly calming to the digestive system and especially good for ulcerative colitis and Crohn ’s disease because of its natural calming properties .
Shattuck recommends those with intestinal issues invest in peppermint oil capsules that will get into the intestines in a concentrated form .
Peppermint is one of the tastier herbs , and makes a perfect infusion with a little raw honey .
In studies conducted in Italy in 2007 , peppermint oil was also found to relieve symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome .
Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) Rosemary has a woodsy evergreen smell that complements many Mediterranean dishes .
Rosemary makes an excellent addition to meat gravies , risotto dishes , and stocks .
Rosemary is high in iron , calcium , and Vitamin B6 .
It has long been believed to help the mind in retaining information , and Shakespeare called it the herb of “ remembrance . ”
Rosemary can provide relief for headaches through aromatherapy and ingestion .
Rosemary is often used to combat depression and is an excellent all around herb for the mind .
Thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ) Thyme is a natural source of iron and is found widely in culinary dishes all over the world .
It was used by ancient Egyptians in the embalming process , and has long been believed to purify the body and environment .
Another herb most flavorful in its dried state , thyme is found in many lamb , tomato , and egg dishes .
Its natural expectorant properties make it excellent for throat or bronchial problems .
Thyme is a natural antiseptic , and you can make a thyme infusion and gargle with it to coat a sore throat up to three times daily to reduce inflammation .
Its antibiotic properties makes thyme a well favored herb in a first - aid kitancient doctors used thyme to coat bandages , and it is believed to have anti-fungal properties that assist in healing an infected or fungal toenail .
In the event of a respiratory infection , you can make an infusion and then let the affected individual bend over the steaming thyme infusion and inhale .
Traditional use of thyme included giving it to children at bedtime to help control bed wetting and nightmares .
Tea is the easiest way to administer to children ; if they are worried about the taste you can mix it with apple juice ( half - and - half ) .
Culinary herbs enhance our daily cuisine , but they also have medicinal properties that have been all but forgotten .
Focus on the herbs you are using when seasoning your next meal ; it ’s amazing what a little knowledge can do for boosting one ’s confidence in natural herbal healing .
What does " greatest " mean ?
Probably the best definition would be the " most defining of who we are today " , something that dramatically changed the life of all humanity , and I will be referring only to inventions and not to discoveries such as the fire or the wheel .
10 - The Telescope -
It proved for the first time that the Earth is nothing more than a round piece of rock in the giant pond of space and not the center of anything , much less the universe .
many people did n't agree then , and they still do n't agree now .
9 - The Computer - Many people have the deepest , richest , most diverse , and rewarding relationship with their computer .
It plays games with them , tells them jokes , plays music to them , it does the taxes , and sometimes it ' even used to work .
8 - The Television - Wherever a TV is on , it draws attention like no other piece of furniture .
It can be source of amusement , knowledge , or , if misused , of violence and almost self - inflicted psychiatric disorders
7 - The Automobile - Once cars were invented , roads were improved .
Once roads were improved , cities developed suburbs and expanded , because people could now live in the country , yet work in the city .
Furthermore , as cars grew popular , the oil industry boomed .
Oil became a key to power and wealth , and one of the major factors for political and economic conflicts in many parts of the world .
6 - The Use of Electricity - Electricity was never really invented .
It existed all along , but humans only invented the means of generating this force and distributing it to individual buildings .
The invention was made by Edison , who siglehandedly turned electricity into a commercial application and his Pearl Street station was the world 's first electric power station .
Now , anyone throughout most of the world can tap into the grid to power everything from light bulbs to computers .
Actually , the human beings could be considered as feeding on electricity , besides organic products .
5 - The Telephone - many people imagined a form of telephony , even long before it was actually invented .
This wonder of modern technology allows anyone to talk to anyone anywhere at any given moment , even without physically seing the person , or even knowing ho he / she is .
4 - Antibiotics -
Most people actually died of infectious diseases , a few centuries ago .
The plague that broke out in 1347 , killed almost half of Europe 's population in nearly two years .
When diseases such as smallpox reached North America , they reduced the indigenous population by about 90 percent within a century .
As late as 1800 , the leading cause of death in the western hemisphere was tuberculosis .
Almost no one ever died of old age back in the day , probably the main reason why elders were revered .
3 - The Printing Press -
This may seem unimportant , but it truly is .
Gutenberg 's press , with its movable type , started the idea of publishing oral knowledge or multiplying exissting , hand - written books .
This may actually be the reason why so many people turned their backs on Christianity , putting a Bible in the hands of anybody who wanted one .
The Church no longer possessed the absolute truth , and thus the independently thinking individual emerged as the key unit of society .
In the longer term , publishing universalized literacy .
2 - The Mechanical Clock -
Time was actually a measure of events before the timepiece was invented , the main one being the Sun crossing the sky .
No universal time actually existed , only a local one .
That meant that once you agreed to meet someone at sunset , you had to clearly state where that was , because the Sun is always setting somewhere .
And of course , what clocks made possible , they soon made necessary .
In a clock - driven world , most of us are now either " on time , " " ahead of schedule , " or " running late . "
1 - The Toilet -
You can half all you can , but then try this experiment .
Try to imagine New York , Paris or Tokyo without toilets .
It 's impossible .
The modern city were made possible by man 's ability to bring clean water in densely populated spaces and to remove the waste .
Without toilets and plumbing any tall building would be impossible .
Remove apartment buildings , office towers , and dense city centers from your picture of the world and you have to change the whole rest of your picture too , because the implications keep rippling .
Of course , this top is n't an absolute one , and anyone could argue its classification , but , in fact , it all comes down to how important is this or that invention to a specific individual , and how it influences his way of perceiving the world .
Cook County has been a " dark pool of political corruption " for more than a century , a new study by the University of Illinois at Chicago says .
Nearly 150 employees , politicians and contractors in the nation 's second - largest county have been convicted on corruption charges since 1957 , according to a report released Thursday by the university and the Better Government Association ( .pdf )
The 33 - page study gives a history of corruption , starting from 1869 when county commissioners were jailed for rigging a bid to paint City Hall .
It also details hiring scandals , including some under Cook County Board President Todd Stroger .
Stroger has n't been charged with any crime .
In the last 36 years , 31 sitting or former Chicago alderman have been convicted of corruption or other crimes .
The last was Ike Carothers ( 29th ) , who earlier this month plead guilty to charges he accepted gifts in exchange for his votes on zoning issues .
The study says reforms could turn things around , including stricter campaign finance laws and amending a county ethics ordinance .

A drug user has become the first person to die in England from a batch of anthrax - contaminated heroin which has now killed 11 addicts in the UK and Germany .
The unnamed user from Blackpool is the second case in England to emerge in the last week after it emerged five days ago that a female addict from London was being treated in hospital .
The death in Blackpool follows nine fatalities across central Scotland since the contaminated heroin emerged in early December in Glasgow .
There have been 19 confirmed cases in Scotland , with deaths in Glasgow , Lanarkshire , Dundee , Fife and Stirling .
The German victim died in Aachen in December but the death was only officially linked to the batch found in the UK last week , after the strain was found to be " indistinguishable " from the type of anthrax found in Scotland .
The surge of cases – the most serious anthrax outbreak in the UK in recent times – has puzzled police and health experts , who remain uncertain how or where the heroin became infected .
The frequently lethal bacteria is mostly found in animals in Asia and Africa , and very rarely occurs in Europe .
They are investigating whether the heroin was contaminated at its likely source in Afghanistan , perhaps from contaminated soils or contact with infected animal skins , or was infected by a cutting agent used by drugs dealers or traffickers closer to Europe .
The cases in London and Germany have no known link to the Scottish outbreak , increasing anxieties that the contamination could be widespread .
There has been only one previous case of a heroin user dying from anthrax , in Norway in 2000 .
Professor Qutub Syed , director of the Health Protection Agency in north - west England , said the risk to non-heroin users , including the close relatives of addicts , was " negligible " .
He added : " It is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person and there has been no evidence of a significant risk of infection being passed on in the current situation in Scotland . "
Dr Arif Rajpura , the director of public health with NHS Blackpool , repeated warnings to heroin users to stop taking the drug or watch closely for unusual symptoms , including rashes , swelling , severe headaches or high temperatures .
" Heroin users are strongly advised to cease taking heroin by any route , if at all possible , and to seek help from their local drug treatment services .
This is a very serious infection for drug users and prompt treatment is crucial , " he said .

Chevron Using Six Public Relations Firms to Discredit Indigenous Groups
In $ 27.3 Billion Environmental Case In Ecuador
Lobbyists – Mac McLarty , John Breaux , Trent Lott , Mickey Kantor , Carla Hills and Others – Charged With Misrepresenting Facts
Amazon Defense Coalition
20 November 2009 - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : Karen Hinton at +1.703.798.3109
Washington , DC – Chevron has retained at least twelve public relations firms and lobbyists to discredit claims of Amazon indigenous groups on the eve of an expected multi-billion dollar judgment against the oil giant in an environmental lawsuit in Ecuador , according to representatives of the tribes in the U.S .
Although Chevron is near the top of the list of highest - spending lobbyists in Washington , the campaign seems to be backfiring .
Politico , one of the most influential publications on Capitol Hill , reported this week that Chevron 's lobbying was " drawing fire from environmentalists , media ethicists , state pension funds , New York 's attorney general , members of Congress , and even Barack Obama when he was a Senator . "
The article also quoted Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) as calling Chevron 's lobbying " clumsy " and " very heavy handed " .
Sanchez - who on Tuesday characterized the Chevron lobbying as " extortion " in testimony before Congress – said she plans to write three letters to Members of Congress , blasting what she called the oil giant 's " misguided approach " to dealing with the lawsuit from the indigenous groups .
Separately , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is investigating the company to determine if it is misleading its own shareholders about the financial risk from the Ecuador case , where damages are assessed at up to $ 27.3 billion , Politico reported .
An American legal advisor to the plaintiffs , Steven Donziger , criticized the public relations and lobbying effort .
" Chevron is paying huge fees to lobby the U.S. government to inappropriately quash a legal case brought by indigenous tribes in the country where Chevron asked for the trial to be held , " said Donziger , who has been working on the matter since it was filed in U.S. federal court in 1993 .
The case , which alleges Texaco dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste in the Amazon from 1964 to 1990 , was transferred from U.S. federal court to Ecuador in 2002 at Chevron 's request .
The oil giant filed 14 expert affidavits in the U.S. court praising Ecuador 's court system , but later began a campaign to discredit those same courts once the evidence in the Ecuador trial pointed to its culpability .
The public relations firms working for Chevron include Hill & Knowlton , which represented the tobacco industry and – as it did in the debate over tobacco and cancer – has tried to deny a link between oil contamination and cancer ; Edelman Worldwide , which is believed to be preparing a Wal - Mart - style political campaign against the indigenous groups in anticipation of an adverse court judgment ; Sard Verbinnem , which handles financial press in an effort to stem a budding shareholder revolt against Chevron management for its handling of the case ; Robinson Lerer Montgomery , a well - highly connected New York - based agency ; Sam Singer and Associates , which handles the matter in the San Francisco area , where Chevron is located ; and the Washington - based CRC Public Relations , which helped create a pro-Chevron video by former CNN correspondent Gene Randall to counteract a highly unflattering 60 Minutes segment on the legal case that broadcast earlier in the year .
The Randall video , which did not mention that it was paid for by Chevron , was blasted by the Columbia Journalism Review for " blurring the line between public relations and journalism . "
The President of CRC , Greg Mueller , spearheaded the Swift Boat campaign against John Kerry and is a former senior aide to Pat Buchanan .
Among Chevron 's lobbyists is Wayne Berman , former McCain campaign national finance chair who chairs the governmental relations practice at Ogilvy Worldwide ; former Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott ; Mac McLarty , former chief of state to President Clinton who is lobbying the State Department ; Mickey Kantor and Carla Hills , former U.S. trade ambassadors who are lobbying their former agency to cancel Ecuador 's trade preferences ; Peter Romero , who served as U.S. ambassador to Ecuador in the early 1990s under the first Clinton Administration ; Brian Pomper , the former staff director to U.S. Sen .
Max Baucus ; Scott Parvin , a career lobbyist who formerly worked with Kantor at the law firm Mayer Brown ; and several members of Chevron 's governmental relations office in Washington , headed by William Irwin .
Lawyers for the Amazon communities have long said Chevron 's public relations and lobbying firms are part of a broader effort by the company to undermine the rule of law in Ecuador in anticipation of an adverse judgment .
The company has taken out advertisements in both Ecuadorian and American newspapers attacking lawyers for the communities and various judges who have presided over the case .
The public relations firms and lobbyists also state incorrectly that Chevron was released from further clean - up responsibility in Ecuador by the government in exchange for a limited clean - up in the mid 1990s .
But the terms of the release itself expressly exclude the private claims in the current lawsuit and the so - called remediation was a fraud that has led to the indictment of two Chevron lawyers and several former government officials , said Donziger .
Evidence at trial against Chevron includes more than 50,000 chemical sampling results produced by the company itself , which prove that 100 % of its former well sites are highly contaminated with cancer - causing toxins , according to an independent court - appointed Special Master who reviewed the evidence in the case and assessed damages .
A final decision on liability and damages is expected next year .

Let 's say you are a blogger who writes about music regularly and includes links to music in your posts .
How do you avoid having your blog censored off the Internet by " DMCA takedown notices " sent out by music industry lawyers ( as happened last week to several blogs hosted by Blogger ) ?
Of course , you could get authorization from all the relevant copyright owners before you post or link to a song .
Unfortunately , that 's virtually impossible for many music bloggers .
In some cases , it may be impossible to figure out who the copyright owners are ( consider the problem of live concert bootlegs , rare B - sides , out - of - print material , defunct labels ) .
In other cases , you might have authorization from someone , but it could end up being the wrong person ( i.e. , an independent promoter or member of the band who does n't actually have all the rights to give you ) .
And even if you get authorization from all the right people , you could still find yourself on the receiving end of a DMCA takedown from the entity that controls the copyright in another country ( because your blog can be accessed from that country ) .
In other words , it 's quite likely that many music bloggers can never be sure that a DMCA takedown notice wo n't arrive someday .
If one does arrive , your blog hosting service probably wo n't take your side .
The law gives online hosting services strong incentives to comply with takedown notices — prompt responses to takedown notices are often the only reliable shield that hosting services have against copyright infringement lawsuits and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of damages .
No matter how much your hosting service values your business , it is not likely that they will be willing to bet their business to save your blog .
While most hosting providers will let you send a " DMCA counter - notice " to contest a bogus takedown notice , sending a counter - notice can have serious consequences if you 're not absolutely sure that you had all the necessary legal rights to post the songs or links in question .
Sending a DMCA counter - notice is serious business , as it leaves the copyright owner with few options ( other than suing ) in order to keep the song down .
So we recommend that bloggers research copyright law and , if in doubt , consult a qualified attorney ( or contact EFF ) before sending DMCA counter - notices .
The DMCA also gives hosting services strong incentives to " terminate repeat infringers . "
That 's why most blog hosting services will delete your account ( and thus your entire blog ) after receiving multiple DMCA takedown notices .
The industry norm seems to be a " 3 strikes " policy , although the number of " strikes " can vary .
This policy can be particularly unfair when a copyright owner sends multiple DMCA takedown notices all at once , or within a few days of each other — you can find your blog deleted before you even find out who was complaining or can send a DMCA counter - notice .
Many hosting providers also mark every DMCA takedown notice on your " permanent record " — simply deleting the file or the link wo n't expunge the " strike " on your account ( generally , only a DMCA counter - notice will do that ) .
So a DMCA takedown notice received for your blog might still count as a " strike " years later ( again , this is because service providers want to be able to tell a court that they were good about " terminating repeat infringers , " lest they lose their shield against copyright infringement lawsuits ) .
Of course , you may be able to talk the copyright owner into withdrawing a DMCA notice ( " your marketing department sent me an email saying this link was legit " ) .
And there may be informal strategies that work most of the time ( like deleting links after a short period of time ) .
However , at the end of the day , it 's nearly impossible to be sure you 'll never receive a DMCA takedown notice .
With that in mind , here are a few practical things you can do to minimize the disruption that the DMCA process might inflict on your blog :
I 've been wanting to address this ad for a while because I feel ambivalent about it .
I really like the concept of Disaboom , right down to the name , which contains enough association with the familiar term " disability " so that viewers know what it 's about , but adds the " boom " so that the result sounds like a magical exclamation or an energetic comic - book sound effect .
A quick glance at the sight , which divides into Health , Living , Community and Jobs , shows that Disaboom confronts the major concerns of people with disabilities [ i.e. , notice that Health is one of the primary ones ! ] , but does not emphasize the limitations of disabilities .
Instead , with categories like Community and Jobs , Disaboom highlights that the concerns of people with disabilities are universally human ones for a productive existence and companionship .
So I 'm all for Disaboom as a site .
However , I feel that this ad has both positive and negative points .
On the plus side , the man in the ad contradicts the prevailing stereotype that people with disabilities , especially people who have paralyzed lower extremities , completely lack sexual interest , experience and desire .
The man is presented as a sexually active person who does n't have any time or patience for stupid misconceptions about people with disabilities .
Since the ad is aimed presumably at people with disabilities , the audience will probably not put themselves in the place of " people who have stupid misconceptions about the sexuality of disabled people , " but will instead identify with the man , saying to themselves , " Yeah , I have romantic and / or sexual interests and , like this guy , am sick of being seen as asexual ! "
This appeal to the audience members ' frustration and intelligence will likely motivate them to click through and see what 's going on .
I also appreciate that the man is portrayed as confident , active and independent .
On the negative side , the subject of the ad is , as far as I can tell , a hard - bodied Caucasian guy .
In other words , he fits many of the current bourgeois American standards for attractiveness [ white , muscular , male ] .
Needless to say , people with disabilities come in all colors and genders , so I think that the ad would be more effective if it were a series , each with a different character with a different race , sex and disability .
[ That would be kind of hot , actually .
Off the subject a bit , I 'm picturing a poster showing a grid of photos with all types of people , all types of romantic encounters , all types of disabilities , and the legend LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES . ]
The fact that there 's only a muscular white guy representing " sexual activity " glosses over the fact that people of other races , genders and disabilities have interests in sex and romance too .
Also on the negative side , not only is this guy the picture of modern white bourgeois hegemonic masculinity , but I can't shake the feeling that he 's also passing as non-disabled .
Tattoos aside , he looks like a non -disabled guy sitting down in a chair that just happens to have wheels .
While some people indeed use wheelchairs with no back and no handlebars and a low - slung profile , other people with disabilities have much more obvious tools that they use ; an electric wheelchair , for example , can have six wheels , headlights and tail lights , a control box with joystick and horn , storage pouches on either side , footrests , leg braces , head rest , reclining seat , adjustable cushions and posture support , a backpack on the back and an obvious computer on board , all of which are much more obvious than a discreet little set of wheels under your butt .
Here 's a randomly selected six - wheeler , the Invacare Pronto M94 , just for your information , the likes of which I see much more regularly than the chair shown in the Disaboom ad .
I feel that the Disaboom ad downplays the unavoidable obviousness of some mobility aids in its attempt to make the guy in the picture seem more stereotypically " non-disabled .
"
All in all , though , I think this ad is a great start , provocative and well done .
I 'd just like to see it as the first in a series , though , featuring a wide array of colors , shapes , sizes and disabilities .
In a nation where median household income hovers just above $ 50,000 a year and jobless claims are soaring , one would think the political and financial elite might be mindful of stepping on the little guy when they ’re speaking in public .
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele ?
Not so much .
At a recent debate with possible Democratic Senate candidate Harold Ford , Jr. , Steele boasted that after taxes , $ 1 million “ is not a lot of money , ” apparently trying to leverage a rhetorical attack against President Obama ’s tax policies .

President Obama has said he wants the Bush - era tax cuts on wealthy Americans to expire , returning tax rates to Clinton - era levels and shifting more of the burden from poor families to those earning over $ 250,000 per year .
“ Trust me , after taxes , a million dollars is not a lot of money , ” Steele said , according to the Associated Press .
Ford reportedly retorted , “ Who in here makes a million dollars a year ? ”
No hands were raised , to which Steele asked , “ How many of you want to make a million dollars a year ? ”
Just two percent of Americans earn over $ 250,000 per year , with membership in higher income brackets growing even thinner , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Current rates tax people making over $ 372,950 per year some 35 % .
Think Progress notes that taxes on $ 1 million would still leave about $ 675,000 — a total which Steele apparently scoffs at .

The RNC chairman earns as much as $ 20,000 for every speaking engagement , according to The Washington Times .
Oceans of ink , terabytes of blog space and an eternity of television time have been devoted to the latest object of media fascination , the “ tea party ” movement .
Now ( finally ! ) , a poll conducted by CNN gives us some hard data on the Tea Party Nation .
Neither “ average Americans , ” as they like to portray themselves , nor trailer - park “ Deliverance ” throwbacks , as their lefty detractors would have us believe , tea partyers are more highly educated and wealthier than the rest of America .
Nearly 75 % are college educated , and two - thirds earn more than $ 50,000 .
More likely to be white and male than the general population , tea partyers also skew toward middle age or older .
That ’s the tell .
Most came of age in the 1960s , an era distinguished by widespread disrespect for government .
In their wonder years , they learned that politics was about protesting the Establishment and shouting down the Man .
No wonder they ’re doing that now .
Look closely at the tea partyer and what you see is a famil - iar American genus : a solidly middle - class , college - educated boomer , endowed by his creator with possessions , opinions and certain inalienable rights , the most important of which is the right to make sure you hear what he has to say .
The tea party is a harbinger of midlife crisis , not political crisis .
For men of a certain age , it offers a counterculture experience familiar from adolescence -- underground radio , esoteric tracts , consciousness - raising teach - ins and rallies replete with extroverted behavior to shock the squares -- all paid for with ample cash .
The partyers are essentially replaying the ‘ 60s protest paradigm .
( We ’re aging boomers ourselves , so we know it when we see it . )
They fancy themselves the vanguard of a revolution , when in fact they are typical self - absorbed , privileged children used to having their way -- now -- and uninhibited about complaining loudly when they do n’t .
It ’s the same demographic Spiro Agnew called “ an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals . ”
In a flashback of “ turn on , tune in , drop out , ” the partyers reject mainstream culture , don the equivalent of Che T - shirts that say “ Do n’t Tread on Me , ” and join sects with trippy names like Oath Keepers , Patriotic Resistance and Freedom Force .
Instead of getting themselves “ back to the garden , ” they get off the grid and , like the Bill Ayers crew , indulge in fantasies about armed rebellion against the establishment .
But the ( often - overlooked ) truth about the ‘ 60s is that the great accomplishments we associate with the era -- civil rights , putting a man on the moon -- were made not by boomers but by the generation born before World War II , which accepted shared sacrifice and saw it as an expression of their belief in duty , honor and country , not as socialism .
At Woodstock , Haight - Ashbury and the marches on Washington , the boomers socialized rather than sacrificed .
They made great theater , and the media could n’t resist them .
It still can’t .
The tea partyers ’ pictures and sound bites are so good , no one cares that their math does n’t add up :
Cut taxes and the deficit but keep your hands off my Medicare ; do something about jobs but do n’t increase spending .
Everyone understands it ’s about something deeper .
Ah , tea partyer , we know ye well .
One of your signs says “ Listen to ME ! ”
That ’s all that ’s ever really mattered -- the original “ me generation ” grabbing the spotlight and the world ’s attention by whatever means necessary .
The rest , whether beads , bell bottoms or birther slogans , is just a means to the same end .

UPDATE February 27 , 2010 at 11:00 -- I just published an updated article on this for the Huffington Post US Department of Defense Ahead of Most Companies with a New Social Media Policy
++++++
Just an hour ago , the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) released its official policy covering new media and social media .
With some three million employees , the DoD is one of the largest organizations in the world .
This is big news .
I 'm still digesting what ’s in here , but wanted to get this out right away .
The policy ( Directive - Type Memorandum 09-026 ) , which is effective immediately , states that employees of DoD ( U.S. the Army , Air Force , Navy , and Marines ) can use new media .
Check out the memorandum
Read about it on the Department of Defense blog
Late last year , I had an opportunity to visit The Pentagon and spend time with Roxie Merritt , Director of New Media Operations at the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs in the U.S. Department of Defense ( the top social media person at the DoD ) .
At the time she was working on this policy
She told me at the time : “ It 's not about controlling the message any more .
It 's about giving people as much information and resources and facts as they can . "
Check out my video interview with Roxie .
Ok , now , I love this !
I took one look at it and it put a big smile on my face .
Just looking this really made my day .
In April 2006 , the Conservative leader , David Cameron , was asked a direct question by the Sky News reporter Joey Jones : what exactly was it about the Tory party he wanted to change ?
It was the sort of opportunity Tony Blair would have relished .
Instead , an exasperated Cameron said : " What are we doing here ? . . .
Sorry , I thought we were doing a short interview . "
Then he brought the conversation to an end and asked for the footage to be withheld .
Four years on , Cameron 's relations with his party are troubled ; in particular , many backbenchers feel let down by their leader over the MPs ' expenses scandal .
" There is no open - door policy with David , " says one disgruntled MP on the party 's right .
" David is not a popular leader [ internally ] , " says another .
" If we were n't ahead in the polls , he would be in serious trouble . "
There are only five people who consistently have access to the Tory leader : the influential shadow schools secretary , Michael Gove , the shadow chancellor , George Osborne , the shad­ow foreign secretary , William Hague and Cameron 's two very different senior strategists , Andy Coulson and Steve Hilton .
Fault lines
Senior MPs on the party 's left are worried about Cameron 's direction of travel .
" On every important policy area , behind the spray paint and when you look at the small print , [ Cameron ] has failed to move on from our disastrous 2005 manifesto , " one told me .
And even a shadow cabinet minister concedes : " It is true that there is an issue about David , judgement and weakness when it comes to caving in [ to the right ] .
It comes from a deep - seated lack of self - confidence . "
Cameron has done much to change the image of his party , and his desire to reach out beyond the core Tory supporters is genuine .
But on policy , he and Osborne have long boasted that they need no " Clause Four moment " , no dramatic demonstration of change equivalent to Neil Kinnock 's expulsion of Militant in 1986 .
On each major policy issue , from allying with fringe far - right parties in Europe to offering tax allowances to married couples , Cameron has ultimately jumped rightwards .
The Cameroon project has been to maximise the perception of change while minimising the reality of it .
The approach is summed up by a sentence in a leaked document about Tory candidate selection , written by Gove .
" Like a conjuror , we 'll get more applause if the audience cannot see exactly how the trick is performed . "
In order to understand the fault lines in the Conservative Party , as well as its recent dip in the polls , one has to revisit the period during which Cameron became leader , in late 2005 .
On the advice of Gove , Cameron went for the top job sooner than he had planned .
Gove had been the brains behind the candidacy , in 2001 , of Michael Portillo , about whom Gove , a former Times leader writer and columnist , wrote a biography and whose economic and social liberalism inspired Cameron .
To win over the right , Cameron not only pledged to withdraw from the mainstream European People 's Party [ EPP ] grouping , but also signed up to all nine principles of the Thatcherite " Conservative Way Forward " group .
Pro-gay rights , female - friendly and ruthlessly slick , the Portillo and Cameron campaigns shared an opposition to Kenneth Clarke .
The former chancellor felt that both men should have supported him as the party 's modernising and reforming leadership candidate .
He had meetings in his office with Portillo in 2001 and Cameron in 2005 to persuade them to support him .
They did not .
This is important , because the Cameron - Portillo path is different from the one Clarke would have pursued .
Clarke jokes privately that Cameron has done " what I would have done , only without the fights " .
But this is only half true : Clarke would undoubtedly have waged war with his party to show the country it was changing , but he would not , for example , have pulled out of the EPP .
He would n't have backed down over a policy of no new grammar schools , as Cameron did in 2007 , when faced with a small backbench rebellion .
Indeed , 2007 was the turning point for Cameron , the year he became the heir to the former leader William Hague : first playing the mood music of change , only to revert under stress to a " core vote " strategy .
The arrival in the summer of 2007 of the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as communications director is said to have coincided with a partial decline in influence of Cameron 's ideological " guru " and strategist Steve Hilton , who seems to understand modern , liberal Britain in a way many inside Conservative central headquarters do not .
Slash the state
Slowly but surely , the 2006 slogan " vote blue , go green " has been pushed aside , along with the strongest Tory advocate on the environment , Cameron 's fellow Old Etonian Zac Goldsmith .
" Family values " are back , as is the former leader Iain Duncan Smith , whose answer to " Broken Britain " , as he tells Jonathan Derbyshire , is to promote marriage rather than the redistribution of wealth .
Despite this , economic liberals on the right of the party believe Cameron has n't gone far enough and are keen for him to abandon his policy of ring - fencing National Health Service and international development spending ( the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the pledge to protect spending on health and overseas aid will entail real - term cuts of 18.5 per cent for all other departments ) .
But , on the biggest issue of all , the economy , he has pushed a Thatcherite , state - slashing line .
His recent U - turn ( when he claimed that a Tory government would not make " swingeing " cuts to spending in its first year in office ) is a result not of a shift in ideology but , according to one senior Tory backbencher on the Tory right , " a lack of confidence " .
Some Tory MPs believe the forthcoming TV debates between party leaders will be a defining test for Cameron .
Having enjoyed perhaps the easiest ride of any opposition leader of recent times , the smooth Tory frontman now faces the intense pressure of a close general election campaign , without ever having said what it is about his party he feels must change .
Until he does , and until he shows voters that he has changed the substance as well as the presentation of the Tory message , he will remain , however fashionable he is in the metropolitan media , vulnerable in the country at large .
Hallelujah !
The first child born of the Fiat - Chrysler marriage arrives in just 18 months when the Italian automaker brings the awesome 500 to the United States .
Better yet ,
Fiat has no plans to significantly change the sweet microcar before rolling it into Chrysler showrooms .
The way Fiat sees it , the 500 - which perfectly updates the adorable Cinquecento - could take a big bite out of the market Mini has carved for retrocars .
" The Fiat 500 – we see that , like the Mini , as a sort of a boutique car that we think we can sell in good numbers on the East and West coasts in the same way that Mini has been successful in the U.S. , " Fiat spokesman Richard Gadeselli told Automotive News ( sub. req . ) .
The 500 is the only Fiat - badged vehicle slated for the United States , Gadeselli said .
Everything else will sport a Chrysler nameplate on the hood .
" They will be Chrysler products , " he said .
" They will be specific to Chrysler .
The vehicle architectures will be based on our stuff , and there will be some powertrains .
The vehicles will be U.S. vehicles , designed for U.S. customers by a U.S. company . "
Yeah , yeah .
Now bring us the Abarth 500 , please .

GALLUP NEWS SERVICE
PRINCETON , NJ -- Some 145 years after the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species , controversy about the validity and implications of his theory still rages .
Darwin personally encountered much resistance after his book was published in 1859 .
Seventy - nine years ago , the famous Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee brought the issue of exactly where human beings came from into sharp public focus in the United States .
Indeed , as recently as this month , a court case in Cobb County , Ga. , dealing with the treatment of evolution and creationism in school textbooks received nationwide publicity .
November 's National Geographic Magazine asked on its cover : " Was Darwin Wrong ? " and then proceeded to devote 33 pages to answering that question .
Darwin might be surprised to find such debate still raging nearly a century and a half after he published his book .
He might also be surprised to find that even today there is significantly less than majority agreement from the American public that his theory of evolution is supported by the evidence .
Gallup has asked Americans twice in the last three years to respond to the following question about Darwin 's theory :
Just your opinion , do you think that Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution is – [ ROTATED : a scientific theory that has been well - supported by evidence , ( or ) just one of many theories and one that has not been well - supported by evidence ] , or do n't you know enough about it to say ?
Supported
by evidence Not supported
by evidence Do n't know
enough to say No
opinion % % % % 2004 Nov 7-10 35 35 29 1 2001 Feb 19-21 35 39 25 1
Just a little more than a third of the American public is willing to agree with the " scientific theory well supported by evidence " alternative , while the same percentage chooses the " not well supported by evidence " alternative .
Another 30 % indicate that they do n't know enough about it to say or have no opinion .
There has been essentially no significant change in the responses to this question since 2001 .
What do we make of these responses ?
To be sure , most Americans are not scientists , and it 's probable that the last formal exposure to biology and evolution theory for many came decades ago in high school or college -- if then .
Confronted with this question asking for thoughts about a scientific theory , it 's perhaps surprising that even more did not choose the " do n't know enough to say " alternative .
Yet , this is not just any theory .
It is one of the most basic theories in science today , and most biologists and other scientists believe that the theory is so well supported by data that it is a basic part of the scientific firmament .
As National Geographic stated in its November cover story : " The evidence for evolution is overwhelming . "
Thus , it is of great interest to the scientific community to find that the public appears just as willing to say that the theory of evolution " has not been well supported by the evidence " as it is to say that it has been well supported .
Certainly , as noted , some of this skepticism about the scientific validity of Darwin 's theory comes from a lack of basic training or knowledge of science .
But there 's more to views of the theory of evolution than just scientific knowledge .
The highly controversial aspect of the theory -- the one that caused such an uproar when Darwin first promulgated it almost a century and a half ago -- was that it implied a contradiction with the story of man 's creation as told in the book of Genesis in the Bible .
Creationism
The recent Gallup Poll found strong presumptive evidence that this implication of the theory of evolution for the origin of mankind may be driving some of the lack of public belief in the theory .
The poll shows that almost half of the U.S. population believes that human beings did not evolve , but instead were created by God -- as stated in the Bible -- essentially in their current form about 10,000 years ago :
Which of the following statements comes closest to your views on the origin and development of human beings -- [ ROTATE 1-3/3-1 : 1 ) Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , but God guided this process , 2 ) Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , but God had no part in this process , 3 ) God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so ] ?

Forty - five percent of Americans agree that God created man in his present form about 10,000 years ago .
( This time frame was included in the question when it was originally framed in 1982 because it roughly approximates the timeline used by biblical literalists who study the genealogy as laid out in the first books of the Old Testament . )
About half of Americans agree with the two alternatives that are compatible with evolution -- that human beings developed over millions of years either with or without God 's guidance in the process .
These views on the origin of man have essentially not changed over the last 22 years .
Although there has been minor fluctuation in the percentages choosing each alternative across the six surveys in which the question has been included over the years since 1982 , the basic patterns have remained remarkably constant .
Indeed , the percentage of Americans who choose the " 10,000 year " alternative has varied only within the narrow range of 44 % to 47 % across the six surveys ( and two decades ) .
Biblical Literacy
Although 45 % of Americans believe that humans were created by God pretty much in their present form at one time 10,000 years ago -- a view that corresponds to the account of creation as presented in the Bible -- only 34 % of Americans believe that the Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally , word for word :
Which of the following statements comes closest to describing your views about the Bible -- the Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally , word for word , the Bible is the inspired word of God but not everything in it should be taken literally , or the Bible is an ancient book of fables , legends , history , and moral precepts recorded by man ] ?
Actual Inspired Fables No opinion % % % % 2004 Nov 7-10 34 48 15 3 2002 Dec 9-10 30 52 15 3 2001 Feb 19-21 27 49 20 4 1998 Jun 22-23 33 47 17 3 1993 Jun 18-21 35 48 14 3 1991 Nov 21-23 32 49 16 3 1984 Nov 40 41 12 7 1984 Sep 37 46 12 5 1983 May 37 43 11 9 1981 Dec 11-14 37 42 11 -- 1980 Jul 29 - Aug 2 40 45 10 6 1978 Apr 18 - May 1 38 45 13 6 1976 Aug 24-27 38 45 13 5
Forty - eight percent of Americans believe that the Bible was inspired by God , although is not to be taken literally , while 15 % say that the Bible is an ancient book of " fables , legends , history , and moral precepts recorded by man . "
Gallup has been measuring these attitudes using this question since 1976 , and there has been little substantive change since .
Indeed , the current views of the American public on the issue of biblical literacy are remarkably similar to what was recorded in August 1976 , almost 30 years ago .
The discrepancy between the 45 % who believe that man was created by God 10,000 years ago , and the 34 % who believe the Bible is literally true suggests that there are some Americans whose belief in the " instant " creation of humans is not necessarily based on a literal interpretation of the Bible .
A segmentation of Americans based on their responses to the questions about creationism and biblical literacy finds that a quarter of Americans can be considered to be true literalists -- believing not only in the literal interpretation of the Bible , but also in the creationist view of the origin of humans .
Another one in five believe in the creationist explanation , but not in biblical literalism .
Nine percent believe in biblical literalism but not creationism , while the largest group -- 46 % -- neither believe in biblical literalism nor the creationist explanation for the origin of humans .

It is not surprising to find that the biblical literalists who believe that God created humans 10,000 years ago tend to be more religious and Protestant .
Given the recent emphasis on the importance of religion in the Nov. 2 presidential election , it is of interest to note that this " true believer " group tends to be more Republican than the sample average .
This group also skews toward those who do not have a college degree .
At the other extreme , the roughly half of Americans who tend to reject biblical literalism and creationism are much less likely to attend church , tend to have higher levels of formal education , and to be political independents .
The Demographics of Support for Darwin's Theory of Evolution
Here is the breakout of support for Darwin 's theory ( that is , those who say that it is a scientific theory well supported by the evidence ) within subgroups :
Subgroup % Who Believe that Darwin's Theory of Evolution
Is a Scientific Theory Well Supported by the Evidence Postgraduate education 65 % Liberal 56 College graduate 52 West 47 Seldom , never attend church 46 Catholics 46 50 - to 64 - year - olds 44 Men 42 East 42 18 - to 29 - year - olds 41 Independent 40 Democrat 38 Moderate 36 SAMPLE AVERAGE 35 Nearly weekly church attendance 35 30 - to 49 - year - olds 34 Some college 32 Women 30 Republican 29 Midwest 29 Protestant 28 South 27 Conservative 26 Weekly church attendance 22 Age 65 + 21 High school or less 20
The same basic patterns are found here as reviewed in reference to the creationist and literalism question .
Belief that Darwin 's theory has been well supported by the evidence is strongest among those with the most education , liberals , those living in the West , those who seldom attend church , and among Catholics .
The lowest levels of belief that Darwin 's theory is supported by the scientific evidence is found among those with the least education , older Americans ( many of whom say they are unsure about the theory in general ) , frequent church attendees , conservatives , Protestants , those living in the middle of the country , and Republicans .
Survey Methods
These results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected national sample of 1,016 adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Nov. 7 - 10 , 2004 .
For results based on this sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum error attributable to sampling and other random effects is ±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

MELBOURNE , Australia -- Roger Federer experienced quite a range of emotions these past two Australian Opens .
A year ago , he sobbed on court after losing a thrilling final in five sets .
Federer was all smiles Sunday after rather easily beating Andy Murray 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 ( 11 ) for a fourth championship in Melbourne and 16th Grand Slam title overall .
" All of a sudden , it was over , and it hit me , " Federer said .
" It was very much a roller - coaster . "
While Murray missed a chance to end a drought for British men at Grand Slam tournaments that stretches all the way to 1936 , Federer became the first Dad to win a major singles title since 2003 .
He also now can aim at a true , calendar - year Grand Slam , something no man has accomplished since 1969 .
" I'm over the moon winning this again , " the 28 - year - old Swiss star said .
" I played some of my best tennis in my life these last two weeks .
It 's also very special -- the first Grand Slam as a father . "
" I'm over the moon winning this again , " Roger Federer said Sunday .
" I think I played some of my best tennis in my life these last two weeks . "

Federer had only recently discovered he was to become the father of twins when he lost the Australian Open final in five wrenching sets against rival Rafael Nadal last year , then broke down during the presentation .
This time , Federer was in control of the action pretty much throughout against Murray , and afterward , it was the 22 - year - old from Scotland whose voice was breaking and who was choking back tears .
" I can cry like Roger , " Murray said .
" It 's just a shame I can't play like him . "
Compounding the emotions for Federer in Australia a year ago :
He missed a chance to tie Pete Sampras ' then - record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles .
But Federer did n't have to wait long .
He matched that mark a few months later at the French Open , where he also completed a career Grand Slam by winning a major on clay to go with his grass and hard - court titles .
Then he regained his Wimbledon crown for major No. 15 .
In his first major after his twin daughters were born , he was upset in the U.S. Open final by Juan Martin del Potro .
Now the girls are six months old , and Federer has settled into living and traveling with the family .
He 'll head to the French Open in May as the defending champion for the first time .
In Melbourne , where he also won titles in 2004 and 2006 - 07 , Federer said he 'd returned to his highest level .
That can't make other players feel too good .
Federer also credited the likes of Murray and Nadal for helping him lift his game .
" I always knew I had it in my hand .
The question is do I have it in my mind and in my legs ? " he said .
" That 's something I had to work extremely hard at .

In regards to whether or not China truly sold down its holdings of U.S. treasuries recently , the situation remains a bit murky .
But Citi's Alan Heap thinks it happened for sure .
Moreover , he thinks China has a plan for the cash they pulled out of the U.S. --
They 'll use it to buy 191 tonnes of gold from the IMF .
Alan Heap @ Citi :
The IMF announcement that the fund intends to sell 191t of gold sent a quiver through the market last week .
However there was nothing new here .
The gold is the residual from the planned sale of 403 tonnes which will partially finance new loans to developing countries .
...
The bank said that sales would be phased over time .
But also kept open the possibility of direct transfers to other central banks .
...
The PBC [ People 's Bank of China ] is the most likely central bank buyer .
The bank is deeply dissatisfied with the performance of its US treasury holdings and has made clear its intention to diversify including into gold .
In November and December the PBC sold USD46bn of treasures ; they must be buying something .
While he remains rather neutral on gold , with a 2010 target price of just $ 1,162 , he also highlights how Gold bullion demand picked up in Q4 as well , driven by ' Unidentified Investment ' .
Which could be good news for early 2010 .

It ’s a typical sight in fishing areas : a trawler or other boat being followed by seabirds eager to gulp down the unwanted fish the crew throws back .
Research has shown that the supplemental food such discards provide can affect bird populations , in some cases improving reproductive success .
Now a study has shed light on a different impact of fishing - boat discards .
Researchers report in Current Biology that they can affect birds ’ patterns of movement on large scales .
Frederic Bartumeus of the Center for Advanced Studies of Blanes , in Blanes , Spain , and colleagues analyzed satellite tracking data for two species of shearwaters on foraging trips off Spain ’s Mediterranean coast .
Here is a grook — a short rhyming epigram — by Piet Hein :
He [ Minsky ] said he was trying to attract people to the Lab interested in working on constraint languages , or at least attract hackers who might grow into it .
" But I do n't know whether it 's possible anymore , because good hackers are very quickly aware of their hundred - thousand - dollar value making products for people .
I look for selfish people who do n't give a damn what happens in the outer world for five years .
At some point you need a hero who will actually work for himself rather than make it easier for others to work .
All the people who have short - range goals will be forgotten . "
All of Minsky 's examples of hard problems seemed to circle back on semantic questions , problems of meaning and cognition rather than just signal processing .
" As far as I 'm concerned , " he said , " the heuristic for making discoveries is start with a distinction that people make and argue that there are three ways rather than two .
Probably all good ideas start by making a distinction , and then they usually die by stopping there and dividing everything up into those two .
Information theory is interested in signal and noise .
Maybe we should make a tri-stinction — signal , noise , and meaning . "
After a dinner of take - out dim sum , Minsky , who had been reading the Koran with some dismay at its violent inquiry - blunting formulae , sermonized , " Religion is a teaching machine — a little deadly loop for putting itself in your mind and keeping it there .
The main concern of a religion is to stop thinking , to suppress doubt .
It 's interested in solving deep problems , not in understanding them .
And it 's correct in a sense , because the problems it deals with do n't have solutions , because they 're loops .
' Who made the world ? ' ' God . '
You 're not allowed to ask , ' Who made God ? ' "
I said , " Science feels and acts like a kind of religion a lot of the time . "
Minsky had heard that one before : " Everything is similar if you 're willing to look that far out of focus .
I 'd watch that .
Then you 'll find that black is white .
Look for differences !
You 're looking for similarities again .
That way lies mind rot . "
That lively loop has been cycling in my mind ever since .
news Man Jumps From CN Tower With No Parachute ( Thirty Years Ago )
Almost thirty years ago , stuntman Dar Robinson leapt from the crown of the CN Tower with no parachute , no airbag , and only a thin wire looped around his torso to keep him from splattering on the sidewalk below .
Today , we can relive that jump thanks to this excellent documentary video―uploaded by YouTube user Retrontario and posted today at 1 ♥ T.O. ―which , for no apparent reason , is narrated by Chuck Norris .
Robinson jumped from the CN Tower on two separate occasions .
The first , in 1979 , was for an action movie called Highpoint , in which Robinson was doubling for Christopher Plummer .
Robinson wore a parachute for the original jump .
It was , at the time , the highest such leap by any stuntman .
According to Toronto Star articles from the time , he received $ 250,000 to do it .
The second jump , in 1980 , is the one shown in the video above , staged not for a movie but for a documentary on Robinson which eventually aired on ABC .
The video above is not from the 1980 documentary itself .
It ’s a segment on the MAKING OF the original documentary , from a second , completely separate documentary on Robinson , filmed in 1987 .
The occasion for the second documentary was Dar Robinson ’s death , in 1986 , after he ( unintentionally ) rode a motorcycle off a cliff during a routine stunt for another now - obscure eighties action movie .
Here , with more information on Dar Robinson ’s untimely demise , is another YouTube clip ―which , for no apparent reason , is hosted by Bill O’Reilly :
Still , to have lived to leap from the tallest free - standing thing on the planet not once but twice , and to have recorded it all in a video that remains stunning despite narration by Chuck Norris ?
Not bad .
This article originally stated that Dar Robinson was paid $ 250,000 to perform his second jump from the Tower — the one featured in the video — in 1980 ; in fact , that sum was for his first , in 1979 .
Mozilla confirmed late Thursday that it failed to detect malware in a pair of Firefox add - ons , which may have infected up to 4,600 users .
The add -ons have been removed from Firefox 's official add - on download site .
According to an entry on the Mozilla Add - ons blog , Sothink Web Video Downloader 4.0 and all versions of Master Filer were infected with Trojan horses designed to hijack Windows PCs .
Both add - ons were in the " experimental " area of Firefox 's add - on download site , where newer extensions remain until they undergo a public review process .
To install experimental add - ons , Firefox users must view and accept an additional warning .
Master Filer was downloaded about 600 times in the five months ending Jan. 25 , when it was pulled from the site .
Sothink Web Video Downloader 4.0 was downloaded approximately 4,000 times between February and May 2008 .
The most up - to - date version of the latter , which captures streaming videos in a variety of formats , is 5.7 .
Any Windows users who installed one of the two add - ons would have also silently executed the Trojan , which would then infect the PC .
Mac and Linux users who installed the add -ons were not affected .
Mozilla acknowledged that its security process failed .
" [ Add-ons ] performs a malware check on all add - ons uploaded to the site , and blocks add - ons that are detected as such , " said yesterday 's blog .
" This scanning tool failed to detect the Trojan in Master Filer . "
After adding more scanning tools to the process , a rescan of all add - ons uncovered the attack code embedded in Sothink Web Video Downloader 4.0 , which was yanked from the download site Tuesday .
Mozilla urged users who downloaded the add-ons to uninstall them and , because that does n't scrub the Trojan from the system , to also run an antivirus scan to detect and delete the malware .
Little could be found on the Web about the author of Master Filer , identified as " haklinim , " other than that he or she used an anonymous proxy server in Japan to shunt traffic to a developer biography , which Mozilla has also deleted .
SourceTec Software , which makes Sothink Web Video Downloader , is based in China , according to the phone number listed on its Web site .
The company did not reply to a request for comment or an explanation of how its add - on was infected .
Mozilla also was unavailable late Thursday to respond to questions , including why the infected Sothink Web Video Downloader add - on was not detected in 2008 , and whether it planned to reach out to users who had downloaded the tainted extensions .
Although Mozilla has removed both add - ons from its download site , post - 4.0 editions of Sothink Web Video Downloader remain available on other download sites .
It 's unknown how many copies of version 4.0 of the add - on were downloaded and installed from non-Mozilla sources , such as CNet 's Download.com .
This is not the first time that Mozilla has missed malware in an add - on .
In May 2008 , it admitted a worm inside a Vietnamese language add - on had gone undetected for months , and had been downloaded nearly 17,000 times .
The then - head of Mozilla 's security , Window Snyder , called the impact on users " limited . "
After the worm snafu , Snyder said Mozilla would boost the number of times it scanned files for malware , and would also up the frequency of scans of its entire add - on catalog " to address this sort of case in the future . "

The Presidents of the United States officially come into power when the inauguration ceremony takes place .
It is the inauguration that signifies the beginning of the tenure of the president .
The first and second Presidential inauguration of Barack Obama held on the 20th of January , 2009 , and 21st January 2013 , respectively .
The question is , did Republicans skip Obama ’s inauguration ?
President Barack Obama came into power on the platform of the Democratic Party .
According to reports from his second inauguration , many high profile Republicans skipped the inauguration .
They were those who had official duties to perform at the ceremony and had to be there .
However , others skipped the event .
They either traveled out of town or refused to attend .
Thus , the answer to the question did Republicans skip Obama ’s inauguration is in the affirmative .
Is An Inauguration An Exclusive Event ?
With many Republicans skipping the inauguration of Obama , and the question that readily comes to mind is if the US inauguration ceremony is an exclusive event that only members of the political party that wins can attend .
An inauguration is a national event that celebrates and installs the American President .
Irrespective of party affiliations , the inauguration of President makes him the President of all Americans , and not just the President of members of his political party .
However , with the politics that come with the general elections , the prominent members of the adverse party , who have no official role to play during the inauguration , skips the event .
It is like an unspoken rule for them to allow the party coming into power to enjoy their celebration without disturbing them with their presence .
Besides skipping an inauguration and taking a vacation for a few days , the members of the other also host counter - inaugural parties for them to sit and watch the inauguration on TV while mourning their loss .
Notable Republicans That Traveled Ahead Of Obama ’s Inauguration
They were several Republicans that skipped the inauguration of Barack Obama during his second term inauguration .
It happens to be a perfect weekend to get away for the Republicans since they would instead not attend the inauguration .
Charles Spies and his wife , Lisa Spies , organized a Las Vegas trip .
The trip was for about 100 republicans .
They were those who need to be out of town as the inauguration was to take place .
They tagged the trip with the slogan “ We still believe in America . ” which was a derivative from their campaign slogan that was “ Believe in America . ”
Other Republicans that traveled out of town were Ben Ginsberg .
He went with his family for a weekend vacation .
Russ Schriefer traveled with his wife to Switzerland , Kevin Sheridan traveled to Charleston , S.C. , for a work retreat , Ron Bonjean also traveled with some Republicans to Mexico .
The Significance Of An Inauguration In America
An inauguration ceremony is an essential event in America that has persons traveling into town to be a part of the event .
The essence of the event is to mark the beginning of a new tenure for the president of America .
The ceremony holds whether the president is coming into the office for the first term or a second term .
When Does The Inauguration Hold ?
The presidential inauguration holds on the 20th of January at noon .
It is the tradition since 1937 .
However , on three occasions , the 20th of January fell on a Sunday , and the ceremony moved to the next day .
In such circumstances , a private swearing - in holds on a Sunday while the public event is the one that shifts to the next day .
Activities That Take Place At The Inauguration
An inauguration is a national event .
The event features several activities .
It starts with a morning worship service , which began in 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt participated in a morning service on the day of his inauguration .
After the worship service , a procession of the President - elect , Vice President - elect , and their families , along with others , will move to the Capitol for the swearing - in ceremony .
At the swearing - in ceremony , the swearing - in of the Vice President - elect takes place before that of the President - elect .
After the oath of the President , the President gives an inaugural speech .
When the ceremony is getting to an end , the activity that takes place is the departure of the outgoing President , and the new President usually escorts him .
After this , the new President and his Vice will proceed back to the Capitol Building to participate in the Inaugural luncheon hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies .
The Morning Worship Service
In 1933 , Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a morning service on the morning of his inauguration before going to the Capitol Building for his swearing - in .
Ever since it became a traditional activity that forms part of the inauguration .
The past Presidents that also attended morning services as part of their inauguration activities are George Bush , Harry Truman , John F. Kennedy , and Lyndon Baines Johnson .
Others are Richard M. Nixon , James E. Carter , Ronald W. Reagan , Dwight Eisenhower , William Clinton , Barack H. Obama , and Donald Trump .
The activity has the significance of incorporating the religious beliefs of the American state into the events that lead to the start of a new term of governance .
The Procession To The Capitol Building
After the end of the morning service , it is a tradition for the President - elect , the Vice - President - elect , their families along with the members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to move to the Capitol Building in a procession to commence the inaugural ceremony .
However , before heading to the Capitol Building , the entourage stops at the White House , where the president - elect and the outgoing President will have a short meeting .
It is after the meeting that the outgoing President will join the entourage to the Capitol Building for the inaugural ceremony .
The Swearing - In Of The Vice– President
At the Capitol Building , the searing - in of the Vice President - elect is before the President ’s swearing - in .
There is no specified officer to administer the oath to the Vice President .
It is after the swearing - in of the Vice President that he delivers an inaugural address .
After the Vice President and the Senators take their oath of office , the next thing is for the President ’s swearing - in .
The Swearing - In Of The President
The swearing - in of the President - elect holds on the west front of the Capitol Building .
It is unlike that of the Vice - President and Senators that takes place on the east front .
After the swearing - in of the Vice President , they move over to the west front for the President ’s swearing - in to take off .
The swearing - in of the President includes the taking of the oath of office by the President .
It is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court that administers the oath to the President .
It is the oath of office that signifies the beginning of a new term of office and passes power to the President .
Other activities that constitute a part of the President ’s swearing - in ceremony are the inaugural address by the President , other speeches , parades , rendition of poems , etc .
The President renders the inaugural address to outline their plans for the country as they take over the vehicle of governance .
Thus , the inaugural address is often the subject of public discussions after the inauguration has come to an end .
Inaugural Luncheon
The JCCIC is in charge of organizing a luncheon as part of the Inauguration celebration .
It is usually for the President and other dignitaries at the Capitol Building .
It is a ceremony for food , drinks , more speeches , and the presentation of gifts .
The inaugural luncheon is only one of the luncheons which the President partakes of on that day .
After the Inaugural luncheon , he also leaves for the White House .
It is at the White House that the outgoing President and his wife , with the members of the committee , will be hosting another luncheon as part of the celebration for the day .
The Venue Of The Inauguration Ceremony
The Inauguration usually takes place at the Capitol Building , except for a case like that of Barrack Obama ’s second term that took place in the White House ’s Blue Room .
The Capitol Building is at Washington , D. C.
It is the seat of the legislature in the United States and houses the Congress .
It serves as the venue for major national events such as Independence Day celebrations , the Presidential inaugurations , and others .
The Organizers Of The Inauguration Ceremony
A significant and national event like the Presidential Inauguration is one that requires lots of planning and organization for it to be a hitch - free and successful event .
Thus , there are always persons behind them , working to ensure that everything is in its place .
The JCCIC , according to tradition , is in charge of organizing the inaugural ceremonies of the President and his Vice .
Conclusion
All elections come with a variance of political interests that usually centers on party affiliation .
Thus , it is not so surprising when members of a political party skip the inauguration of the adverse party when that party wins .
It is also not surprising that the question , did Republicans skip Obama ’s inauguration , answers affirmatively .

Teide Sky Trails

Explanation :
The snow capped Teide volcano is reflected in a pool of water in this nearly symmetric night sky view from the Canary Island Tenerife .
Bright north star Polaris stands above the peak in an exposure that also captures the brilliant trail of a polar orbiting Iridium satellite .
Of course , with the camera fixed to a tripod , the stars themselves produce concentric trails in long exposures , a reflection of the Earth 's rotation around its axis .
In fact , you can add about 4.5 hours of exposure time to this image by just sliding your cursor over the picture .
Large astronomical observatories also take advantage of the calm Canary Island sky .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) 
Utah lawmakers will not consider a law that would ban discrimination against gay men and lesbians in the workplace and in housing , and will instead spend the next year studying the issue , key lawmakers said Friday .
In exchange , opponents of gay - rights legislation will drop any effort to prevent local governments from passing their own nondiscrimination laws this legislative session .
Gay - rights advocates had hoped to build on recent momentum created by the Salt Lake City Council , which passed nondiscrimination ordinances last year .
Those ordinances passed after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints said it would support the measures .
In Utah , few law changes occur if the church disapproves .
More than 80 percent of state lawmakers are Mormon , including Gov. Gary Herbert , a Republican .

Today ’s Programming Praxis problem is about checking whether or not a number is prime .
We ’re supposed to implement the Miller - Rabin primality test , which is probably the most well - known algorithm to do this .
Let ’s go .
First the imports :
import Control .
Arrow import Data .
Bits import Data .
List import System .
Random
The Miller - Rabin algorithm calls for random numbers .
Since I did n’t want to make is Prime an IO function , we have to pass it a random number generator as well .
isPrime :: Integer -> StdGen ->
Bool is Prime n g = let ( s , d ) = ( length *** head ) . span even $ iterate ( flip div 2 ) ( n - 1 ) xs = map ( expm n d ) .
take 50 $ randomRs ( 2 , n - 2 ) g in all ( \x -> elem x [ 1 , n - 1 ] || any ( == n - 1 ) ( take s $ iterate ( expm n 2 ) x ) ) xs
You may have noticed the expm in there .
In theory all you have to do is mod ( random_number ^ d ) n .
However , in our test case of 2^89 – 1 , both the random number and d can easily be 10 digits .
And 10 - digit - number ^ 10 - digit - number is a very big number , which takes a while to calculate .
As a result , your algorithm is going to be terribly slow , as I discovered in my initial attempt .
The solution lies in using modular exponentiation .
This is a much faster way of calculating mod ( a ^ b ) m .
In Scheme this function is apparently in the standard Prelude , but I could n’t find a Haskell library that has it defined .
No matter , we ’ll just make our own :
expm :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer ->
Integer expm m e b = foldl ' ( \r ( b ' , _ ) -> mod ( r * b ') m ) 1 . filter ( flip testBit 0 . snd ) . zip ( iterate ( flip mod m . ( ^ 2 ) ) b ) $ takeWhile (> 0 ) $ iterate ( flip shiftR 1 ) e
And there ’s our primality checking code .
To test it , use :
main :: IO ( ) main = print .
is Prime ( 2 ^ 89 - 1 ) =<< getStdGen

First revealed at E3 , Super Mario Galaxy 2 is said to have 90 percent new levels with the rest being levels from the original Mario Galaxy with different objectives .
Shigeru Miyamoto said at the time that the original plan was to " essentially create new variations of the worlds in Super Mario Galaxy . "
But , over time , the developers have had so many ideas that most of those originals were cut .

Barack Obama says healthcare reform is a top priority for his administration US President Barack Obama has unveiled new plans to reform US healthcare and revive stalled legislation on the issue , aiming for bipartisan support .
One of the key proposals gives the US government new power to block health insurers from imposing excessive premium increases .
It is the first time that Mr Obama , who has made healthcare a key priority , has put forward proposals himself .
On Thursday he will hold bipartisan talks at the White House on the issue .
The Republican reaction to Mr Obama 's efforts has so far been critical , with House Republican leader John Boehner saying the proposals took the same approach as that of previous Democratic bills .
STEPS AHEAD Mr Obama 's proposal comes ahead of bipartisan meeting
He hopes Republicans will lay out their ideas , which he " is willing to incorporate " New proposal attempts to bridge bills already passed by Senate and House White House could support muscling bill through Senate through " reconciliation " , although Republicans would be furious Reconciliation only requires 51 votes , not 60 If Senate and House vote in favour , bill will go to Mr Obama for approval " The president has crippled the credibility of this week 's summit [ on Thursday ] by proposing the same massive government takeover of healthcare based on a partisan bill the American people have already rejected , " he said in a prepared statement .
It is a critical moment for a president whose popularity has fallen steeply since his election , says the BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell .
Healthcare has become a rallying point for conservatives who say Mr Obama is bent on introducing European - style big government , and it has worried many Americans who are not clear about what it would cost them .
But failure to pass something would look like a failure to govern by the president , our editor adds .
' More affordable ' Mr Obama 's proposal " helps over 31 million Americans afford healthcare who do not get it today - and makes coverage more affordable for many more " , the White House said on its website .
It gives the federal Health and Human Services Department - in conjunction with state authorities - the power to deny substantial premium increases , limit them , or demand rebates for consumers .
This comes after one of the biggest companies , Anthem Blue Cross of California , announced it would raise premiums by as much as 39 % from 1 March .
I ask members of both parties to seek common ground in an effort to solve a problem that 's been with us for generations
Barack Obama
Q&A : US healthcare reform Health bills : House v Senate Mr Obama 's latest plan requires most Americans to take out health insurance coverage , with federal subsidies to help many afford the premiums .
It bars insurance companies from denying coverage to people with existing medical problems or charging them more .
A tax on high - cost health insurance plans objected to by House Democrats - and trade unions - is to be scaled back .
Mr Obama says reform of the healthcare system is crucial for the US economy to rein in costs over the long term .
The plan would put " our budget and economy on a more stable path by reducing the deficit by $ 100 bn ( £ 64.5 bn ) over the next 10 years - and more than $ 1tn ( £ 644bn ) over the second decade - by cutting government overspending and reining in waste , fraud and abuse " , he said .
Bitter debate The Democrats ' loss of a Senate seat in Massachusetts to Republican Scott Brown in January deprived them of their filibuster - proof 60 - seat majority in the Senate , although they still control both houses .
But White House officials said the new plan would make it easier to avoid the filibuster and use a process requiring a simple majority in the Senate .
" Our proposal is designed to give ourselves maximum flexibility to ensure we can get an up - or - down vote if the opposition decides they need the extraordinary step of filibustering health reform , " said White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer , quoted by Reuters news agency .
Thursday 's debate , which is to be televised , is seen as a key moment in Mr Obama 's bid to pass new legislation , and comes after months of often bitterly contested congressional debates .
Mr Obama referred to the talks in his weekly radio address on Saturday , saying : " I do n't want to see this meeting turn into political theatre , with each side simply reciting talking points and trying to score political points .
" Instead , I ask members of both parties to seek common ground in an effort to solve a problem that 's been with us for generations . "
The House of Representatives and the Senate adopted different versions of the bill at the end of last year , and they must now be combined into a single bill Mr Obama can sign into law .

There seems to be a wide range of people who are concerned in the US with the TSA putting Body Scanners in the security lines as another line of defense against terrorism .
This article from the Washington Post explains much of it .
I think the above might be an unintended consequence for those men who are “ underpacking ” .
or help share the post by clicking below …
Bayesian probability is a great model of rationality that gets lots of important things right , but there are two ways in which its simple version , the one that comes most easily to mind , is extremely misleading .
One way is that it is too easy to assume that all our thoughts are conscious – in fact we are aware of only a tiny fraction of what goes on in our minds , perhaps only one part in a thousand .
We have to deal with not only “ running on error - prone hardware ” , but worse , relying on purposely misleading inputs .
Our subconscious often makes coordinated efforts to mislead us on particular topics .
But at least many folks are aware of and try to deal with this ; for example , I ’ve seen a lot of good related posts on this at Less Wrong lately .
There is , however an even bigger way in which the simple Bayesian model is extremely misleading , and I ’ve seen no discussion of it at Less Wrong .
We may see one part in a thousand of our minds , but that fraction pales by comparison to the fact that we are each only one part in seven billion of living humanity .
Taking this fact seriously requires even bigger changes to how we think about rationality .
OK , we do n’t need to consider it for topics that only we can influence .
But for most interesting important topics , it matters far more what the entire world does than what we personally do .
For such topics , rationality consists mainly in the world having and using good systems ( academia , news media , wikipedia , prediction markets , etc. ) for generating and distributing reliable beliefs on which everyone can act .
When seven billion minds are involved , the overwhelming consideration must be managing a division of labor , so that we do n’t each have to redo the same work .
Together we must manage systems for deciding who should be heard on what .
Given such systems , each of us will make our strongest contributions , by far , by fitting into these systems .
So to promote rationality on interesting important topics , your overwhelming consideration simply must be : on what topics will the world ’s systems for deciding who to hear on what listen substantially to you ?
Your efforts to ponder and make progress will be largely wasted if you focus on topics where none of the world ’s “ who to hear on what ” systems rate you as someone worth hearing .
You must not only find something worth saying , but also something that will be heard .
Yes , existing who - to - hear systems are far from perfect , but that fact simply does not make it rational for you to work on topics where a better system would approve you , if only such systems existed .
Wishes are not horses .
It might make sense for you to work on reforming our systems , but even then your best efforts will work through channels where current systems can rate you as a person to hear on that meta topic .
When what matters is how the world acts , not how you act , rationality on your part consists mainly in improving the rationality of the world ’s beliefs , as determined by its main systems for deciding who to believe about what .
Just wishing we had other systems , or acting as if we had them , is delusion , not rationality .

Hydro is water so i believe it is a type of resin that is made using the process of frozen water

The term is often associated with higher - quality marijuana , though the truth of that connotation is debatable .

We picked up " International Typographic Style " also known as " Swiss Style " , which bloomed in 1950s , as the theme from the history .
A few weeks ago I noted how Lisa Miller ’s lawyers at Liberty Counsel and her supporters at the Protect Isabella Coalition were quietly trying to wash their hands of her after she kidnapped her daughter and disappeared .
Well , it looks like these right - wing activists are still active in supporting her , as they gathered for a prayer rally in Virginia last week during the court hearing at an event which featured a briefing from Mat Staver and the participation of Wiley Drake :
Concerned Women for America ( CWA ) of Virginia joined the Protect Isabella Coalition and other conservatives , who traveled from as far away as Suffolk , Harrisonburg , and Roanoke , and as near as Bedford and Lynchburg , at the Bedford County Courthouse on February 17 , to support Lisa Miller and her daughter , Isabella , in prayer .
While we were disappointed not to be allowed in the courtroom — the judge had honored an ACLU request to deny access to the public — it was a privilege to join Pastor Wiley Drake of Buena Park , California , and others across the country on the Telephonic Prayer Line to pray during the court proceedings .
Mat Staver , chief attorney for Liberty Counsel , briefed our group before and after the hearing .
The opposition wanted the Virginia court to find Lisa in contempt of court for failing to follow a Vermont court ’s order to relinquish custody of her daughter , Isabella , to Janet Jenkins , who was Lisa ’s homosexual companion before Lisa ’s conversion to Christianity .
It should be noted that Miss Jenkins is a Vermont resident who has no biological ties to Isabella and has never sought to adopt her , but has been awarded full custody by a Vermont court merely on the basis of Lisa and Miss Jenkins ’ brief “ civil union . ”
Judge Harrison did not issue an order for Lisa ’s arrest , because she can not be found for papers to be served .
The judge also denied Janet Jenkins the opportunity to testify by phone , because there was no one present in Vermont to swear her in as a witness .
The next hearing on this case is tentatively scheduled for May 19 , 2010 .
Please continue to pray for the three judges of the Appellate Court of Virginia ; pray that their decision will put up a firewall between the laws of Vermont and Virginia to protect Isabella and allow Lisa to return to her home state .
This post contains a relatively important revelation : everybody who has been involved in this case insists that they have no idea where Lisa Miller has gone and that they have had no contact with her since she disappeared … so why is CWA and the Protect Isabella Coalition praying that she will be allowed to “ return to her home state ” ?
That suggests that she is not in Virginia at the moment … and how would these supporters know that unless they know where Miller actually is ?
So here is a simple question : Does CWA or the Protect Isabella Coalition know Miller ’s whereabouts ?
If so , why are n’t they informing the authorities ?
Are these groups protecting and hiding Miller as she run from the law and violates her court orders ?

I love when women gamers receive mainstream media attention , as it underscores that we do exist and we do play .
Unfortunately , gaming while female is still seen as some extreme novelty , which leads many writers to conclude that women are attracted to gaming in order to meet men .
Phoebe Frangoul lays the stereotypes on thick in her piece :
Girls got bored with watching their boyfriends spending hours playing computer games , logged on , and got hooked .

Because there 's no way these women could have enjoyed gaming in their own right .
But how have the boys responded to women invading their virtual world ?

What the hell is this ?
Are we talking about Warcraft or a James Bond movie ?
The Times could have really titled this article " From Warcraft with Love . "
Guilds are often known for their interpersonal intrigues - feuds and flirtation are the order of the day in many .
Throw some girls into the mix and geeky gamers - not famed for their social skills - would be forgiven for getting their joysticks in a twist .

Sigh .
Once again - all male gamers are geeks , all females ( who are not gamers as a rule ) woo them with their feminine wiles .
Women say they can catch up with friends , flirt and even find love in this virtual world .
It 's like Facebook .

As her feelings for Nicky grew , Jennifer 's relationship reached crisis point : " Me and my partner separated shortly after this , however , we were forced by financial difficulties to live in the same house .
One night we were arguing and I did n't realise I 'd left the webcam on and Nicky had helplessly witnessed us fight .
It was at this point he came to my rescue .
Nicky and his dad drove across the country and took all my stuff up to Cumbria , where I stayed with his parents until I had enough money to support myself .
This was a true escape for me as I had little family I could rely on and I had nowhere to go . "

5 -STRING BANJO TUNINGS
Compiled by Anita Kermode
There 's an enormous variety of " reasons " - musical necessities or conveniences , traditional contexts , personal choices or chances - bearing on any banjo - tuning or ( just as important , when it comes to " atmosphere " ) pitch .
The appended file does n't get into the reasons .
It merely unpacks some of the bare bones .
And probably not in the best order .
Pick through them as you will !
Paul Schoenwetter ( Banjo - List member ) actually used (! ) the " Submit a Tuning " form to send me a quotation from Pete Seeger 's 1948 mimeographed 1st edition of " How to Play the 5 - String Banjo " .
Having mentioned Art Rosenbaum , who has made such important contributions to our understanding of old - time banjo styles and tunings , I feel I can't omit a few words , at least , from Pete Seeger , without whom , and whose ground - breaking manual , many of us might never have discovered the fabulous five - string .
In my own ( 1962 ) 3rd-edition - revised , under the heading Harmony Lesson : " Mountain Minor " Tuning , Pete uses as an example of this tuning a version of " East Virginia " based on the playing of Walter Williams .
But here 's a bit from 1948 not in the 1962 edition : " Remember , you have to change all your chords now , to compensate for the change [ from open - G ] .
Folk musicians do this , however , in order to play tunes that would be impossible otherwise ... I learned [ " East Virginia ' ] originally from a Library of Congress Record , though by now have gradually changed it a good deal ... Treat it freely , and do n't copy me note for note . "
Which was , and is , sterling advice !
For those who started playing banjo ( or are even now starting to play ) with the help of earlier editions of this manual , I 'll add a few comments Pete made in 1962 .
He says he never found time to revise it yet again , but that if he did , he 'd start with the open - G , rather than the ( standard ) C-tuning .
And : " What I call here ' the Basic Strum ' I think I 'd call ' a simple strum ' and teach it not at the very beginning , but somewhere later on .
For the first chapter I think I 'd show the pattern I learned from old Bascom Lunsford ... " ( i.e. the 2 - finger I - I - T pattern ) .
He also says he'd include a picture of one of the great West African musicians singing and playing the Kora !
Thanks to Banjo - List member Carroll Smith , I 've recently seen a copy of a fascinating little treatise , " Old Time Banjo Playing in Knott County , Kentucky " , by George R. Gibson ( now living in Florida ) .
I believe this has not yet been published anywhere .
George began on banjo in the late 1940s , learning by listening to and observing his father and other Knott County neighbors who played in ( very various ) old - time styles and traditional tunings .
George lovingly describes these , paying attention , as well , to questions of pitch .
( He suggests dropping down at least two steps for some of the tunings he discusses . )
I 've now incorporated in my list a number of the examples he gives , as well as adding one tuning ( f#DABD , an alternative " Little Birdie " tuning ) not there before .
-
As for what is now commonly known as clawhammer style , George considers this as only one version ( which has unfortunately displaced many other old techniques ) of what he prefers to call " stroke style " .
His own sterling piece of advice is that you should play in whatever style feels most comfortable for you ; and that if you do learn a down - picking style , you should * also * learn a 2 - finger style .
-
If / when George Gibson 's piece becomes publicly available ( on the Net or in print ) , a notice of it will be posted here , as well as on Banjo - List .
Though I 've somewhat revised my original file to make it shareable on the Banjo - L Web page ( thanks to Donald Zepp 's efforts on behalf of all who would like to share ) , it 's still personal and highly UNauthoritative .
It was never intended as a piece of systematic research .
Just some " work - in - progress " from a musically - untrained enthusiast .
And of course there are plenty more banjo - tunings out there , either unheard of by me , or still waiting to be plucked from new " atmospheres " .
For the sake of visual consistency and " searchability " , I 've used only a sharp ( # ) symbol in my headings for the different tunings .
I leave it to others to translate sharps into flats , where appropriate .
The " examples " given are very selective , on the whole arbitrary , and based chiefly on recordings I actually have .
There are some tabs mentioned , but usually from the pages of The Banjo Newsletter ( BNL ) rather than from available banjo - tutors and tab - books ( which are pretty thoroughly covered in the Clawhammer Tune Index ) .
Just to confuse things , I 've thrown in a few examples from the bluegrass brothers / sisters .
When it comes to absolute pitch , I 've here and there noted how a given tune comes out on recordings I 've got ; but on the whole I 've given relative pitches .
As for " keys " , I 'm sure I 've gone wrong here and there , if not ( I hope ) everywhere .
Hey !
Do n't try to count the number of tunings listed here .
There are some cross-references ( clearly indicated , I hope ) that will throw you off .
Quantity does n't interest me nearly as much as those different Atmospheres .
That 's why , e.g. , gDGDE and fCFCD each get their own slot .
Finally , I hope that those who do visit this file will contribute to future additions and revisions .
You can reach me direct at akermode@dircon.co.uk .
Thanks !

After years in the L.A. street gang world , Ronald Lamonte Barron devoted his life to preventing young people from following in his footsteps .
Barron , a former member of the Mansfield Crips gang that claims territory around Pico Boulevard and La Brea Avenue , was one of a few gang outreach workers who was trusted enough by Los Angeles authorities to counsel young offenders in the jails .
Barron was leaving a bar in his old neighborhood Sunday night with his girlfriend when he noticed a tagger defacing a wall on Pico .
Detectives said he confronted the tagger , who fatally shot him as his girlfriend and others looked on .
The Los Angeles Police Department said surveillance video from nearby businesses captured the killing in the 5000 block of West Pico Boulevard in the Mid-Wilshire district .
The footage appeared to show a gunman wearing dark - colored clothing arguing with Barron in front of “ numerous witnesses , ” LAPD detectives said .
The suspected gang member , a Latino 20 to 25 years old , approximately 6 feet tall and 180 pounds , then pulled out a pistol and shot Barron multiple times at point - blank range before calmly walking off .
Shot in the head and chest , Barron fell in the middle of the busy thoroughfare .
The 40 - year - old was pronounced dead at a local hospital a few hours later .
His slaying stunned colleagues at Amer - I - Can , where Barron had worked for more than a decade .
The loss was also felt at City Hall and LAPD headquarters , where officials rely on gang interventionists like Barron to help reduce the grip of gangs in some neighborhoods .
Barron was considered a veteran in the field .
“ Very few people reach that level , ” said attorney Connie Rice , a prominent civil rights attorney and leader of the Advancement Project , which is providing formal training for gang outreach workers .
“ There are a lot of con artists who claim to be interventionists , ” Rice said .
Barron “ was one of the genuine ones .
He was dedicated .
He was trusted enough to go into the jails .
That ’s a pretty rare status . ”
Authorities do n’t believe his work in gang intervention played any role in the killing .
LAPD Cmdr .
Andy Smith said Monday that there was “ every indication that he was shot because he confronted the man who writing on the wall . ”
There have been a string of cases in recent years in which taggers have fatally shot those who dared to call them out .
In 2008 , Jose Jorge Perez was fatally shot in East Hollywood after pulling his car over to tell a group of men to stop tagging .
Maria Hicks , a 57 - year - old Pico Rivera grandmother , was gunned down in 2007 after she honked her car horn , flashed her lights and followed a tagger who had defaced a wall .
That same year , Robert Whitehead was killed in Valinda after challenging young gang members he caught crossing out another gang ’s graffiti on a neighbor ’s garage .
Barron played a role in an unusual but lauded program to pass out tens of thousands of bottles of water in the inner city during the hottest days of the year -- an effort to encourage sobriety and stem violence .
He also was an ambassador who traveled the country to spread the word about Amer - I - Can and its contributions to helping at - risk youth .
Over the weekend , Barron had attended a fundraiser for Calvin Hodges , another gang outreach worker who was shot three months earlier in Nickerson Gardens , leaving him partly paralyzed .
Barron “ was known for being an educator , ” said Marcus “ Big Ship ” Bell , an intervention worker from Amer - I - Can .
“ He was really into the kids and really into social change . ”

Database Journal published an article yesterday about the Top 10 Reasons Why Access Still Rocks for Developers .
After I wiped the coffee off my monitor , I had to write a rebuttal .
The following headlines are theirs , not mine , but the responses are mine .
1 . The price is right .
The author says :
“ Access is freely available … to everyone who has Microsoft Office Professional . ”
That ’s like saying fine Corinthian leather is completely free … to anyone who has a Chrysler Cordoba .
Microsoft Office Professional is not free – it ’s $ 400 !
If you want free , go download SQL Server Express Edition right now .
It ’s completely free , period .
2. Landing pad for data .
That ’s not even a sentence .
You have to read through his points one by one to understand where he ’s going :
“ I regularly copy and paste data from Excel and Notepad directly into Access tables . ”
You know what ’s really funny is that I regularly copy / paste data from SQL Server into Excel !
It ’s all about what you ’re familiar with .
Excel has a heck of a strong feature as a front end , and I ’d make the argument that I ’d rather do a lot of my “ landing pad ” work in Excel , not Access .
The author goes on to point out :
“ While I have 10 years experience with SQL Server , I only recently learned how to use SQL Server Integration Services ( formerly DTS ) because Access is easy - peasy - lemon - squeezy … ”
Access does have a great reputation for ease - of - use .
This is the one point I ’ll grant the author .
3. Plethora of books and training materials
Amazon search results reveal roughly 10,000 books for Microsoft Access and 5,000 books for Microsoft SQL Server .
How many books do you need ?
What platform do you think has too few books available that your # 3 reason to use Access is the book selection ?

You want to go there ?
Really ?
There are ~1700 Stack Overflow questions tagged with Access , and hundreds of thousands tagged with SQL Server .
Not to mention the wildly vibrant # SQLhelp on Twitter , and SQLslack.com .
But the author goes on to kick sand in the face of the SQL Server community by saying :
“ I never felt the camaraderie or the community in SQL Server or .
Net newsgroups that was ubiquitous in the Access ones . ”
Of course not , dude – because you ’re pimping Microsoft Access .
SQL Server people *** hate*** Access people .
If I had a dollar for every time I encountered a stupendously poorly crafted Access “ database ” that required amazing rework in order to scale , I ’d – well , actually , I do .
I have a lot of money from those projects , come to think of it .
Actually , would you mind sending me your client list ?
5. Subforms
The author writes :
“ This might be outdated , but I ’m going to include it anyhow .
Decades ago when I developed in PowerBuilder , Visual Basic 6 and Access , the ability to drag and drop a form onto another form to create a synchronized pair was huge . ”
Welcome to 2010 .
Among many interesting new things such as flat panel monitors , hybrid cars , and the wheel , we ’ve also come to embrace many new programming concepts like MVC .
While it was initially intriguing to get your application chocolate in my database peanut butter , we have found over time – decades , in fact – that the application might work best when it ’s separated from the database .
6. Reports
See above .
7. VBA
See above , but one quote has to be shown :
“ Real Access developers do n’t use macros … we write VBA code . ”
I do n’t even know where to begin with that one .
8. Integration with “ real ” databases .
Why not just use a real database from the start ?
SQL Server Express Edition is completely free , and not only do the databases scale up beyond 4 gigs , your career can scale too .
The skills you learn working with Express Edition translate to a better long - term career as a database administrator or developer on huge projects – projects where you do n’t have to be the one guy writing data storage , reports , and workflows all inside the same tool , by yourself .
One of the author ’s points is just flat out incorrect :
“ The front end was an Access 97 mdb file , which linked to an Oracle database .
On Friday at noon , 125 employees would scramble to update their digital “ time sheets ” and the system did n’t blink .
Maybe it was the fact that the data was in Oracle or maybe it was because the Access used Pass Through queries to execute stored procedures and server side views , but the reason does n’t matter . ”
Actually , that does matter .
You could have written the front end in .
NET , C++ , or Classic ASP , and it would have scaled if Oracle ’s doing all the work .
9 . New features in 2010
The author says :
“ Table macros and publish to Web .
‘ Nuff said . ”
Errr , wait – up in # 7 , I thought you said real Access developers do n’t use macros ?
10 . The Play - Doh factor
The author says :
“ Access applications are easy to mold and shape into whatever you or your client needs .
In this context , easy means inexpensive . ”
If we reword “ applications ” to be “ proof - of - concept apps ” , I ’d agree .
But when the client builds a web site for their online store , does it scale ?
If they suddenly become the next bacon salt , can they sustain a load of hundreds or thousands of customers ordering simultaneously ?
Can they build StackOverflow in Access ?
No way – again , I ’ve followed behind too many Access projects that suddenly ran into problems with scaling or data volumes .
Folks , come on over to the SQL Server side .
We make real dough , not the play kind .

I announced my return to my co-workers my taking a dump , and then using to the toilet paper to write “ I ’m back ” in shit across the reception room .
My boss saw this , yelled “ oh fuck ” and called the police .
The smell growing in the men ’s locker room ?
You guessed it , I shat on a paper plate , placed it in one of the vented lockers , and slapped on a Master lock .
That should fossilize in a few months .
The stained carpet in the main hallway ?
Me also .
When I had diarrhea a few weekends ago , I drove to the office ( making several stops along the way ) at 3 am .
I stripped naked , and taking a page out of my dog ’s playbook , crab - walked down the hallway while expelling a liquid stream of greenish shit .
I am impressed with my own distance of 30 + feet .
It was me who dropped the corn - filled turds in not one , but all three of the boss ’s coffee cups .
Starbucks again motherfucker !!!
The missing fichus tree ?
Um , yeah , I definitely got it .
What added to my enjoyment was that it took a week for the secretary to identify the cause of the smell .
I had to laugh out loud when I saw that fichus hanging half out of the dumpster one morning .
The missing fish tank in the chief engineer ’s office ?
I really let a man -sized turd go in that one .
Rumor has it when the CE saw the poop floating near his now dead fish , he through the whole damn thing in the parking lot behind the office .
To allay suspicion , I even shat in my own trash can one night .
One day ’s unpleasantness is indeed a small price to pay for my continued activities .
It was me who shat on the portrait of the company founder .
Only part of it rolled off when the picture was re-hung .
It was me that shit near the intake of our HVAC system .
It was me that crapped in the Executive bathroom ’s urinalAnd it will be me that does not stop until everyone here quits , or I get a damned raised , beyond the friggin COLA .
I will keep you all updated as this progresses over the next few months .
Love , The Phantom Shitterthis is in or around
In your office ( again ) ?

BlueChips is a simple finance tracking application designed for small groups of people with shared expenses .
It was designed and developed by groups of students who got tired of the headaches of managing lots of little payments between roommates .
Demo
If you want to try out BlueChips , you can go to http://demo.bluechi.ps
Example Scenario Larry lives with Curly and Moe. Larry gets the utility bill , and enters it as an expenditure on their BlueChips site .
Everyone shares the utilities , so it ’s just an even split .
A week later , Moe pays the rent .
Curly has a smaller room , so he pays a smaller fraction of the rent .
At any time , any user can visit the BlueChips site and see who needs to pay who how much in order to settle the books .
After a few months ,
Moe has paid for a disproportionate amount of stuff , so the other roommates each make a transfer to Moe , and enter the amounts in BlueChips .
Additional Features Support for negative expenses
Uses any authentication mechanism which can set the REMOTE_USER environment variable , including authentication modules supported by Apache , nginx , lighttpd , and others .
Email notifications of changes ( optional )
100 % test coverage
Installation and Setup Install BlueChips using easy_install : easy_install BlueChips
Make a config file as follows : paster make - config BlueChips config.ini
Tweak the config file as appropriate and then setup the application : paster setup - app config.ini
Host the application behind an authentication layer which sets REMOTE_USER .
Apache Configuration
The recommended deployment platform for BlueChips is Apache , mod_wsgi , and any Apache module which provides authentication .
Here is an example vhost configuration : < VirtualHost bluechips.example.com:80 >
ServerName bluechips.example.com
WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/bluechips.wsgi
< Directory / var / www >
Order deny , allow Allow from all </ Directory > < Location /> AuthType Basic AuthName " Example BlueChips Site " AuthUserFile /etc/ apache2 / passwords Require valid-user </ Location > </ VirtualHost >
The bluechips. wsgi wrapper script looks just like : from paste.
deploy import loadapp application = loadapp ( ' config:/var/www/ssl/config.ini')

The Upper West Side is Mr. Sitchin ’s Mesopotamia , Broadway a fertile valley .
He has Lincoln Center , Zabar ’s , Fairway , dry cleaners that deliver and a galaxy of take - out restaurants .
For research , the New York Public Library is down on 42nd Street , and the archives of the Jewish Theological Seminary up on Broadway at 122nd Street .
“ In Florida , if you do n’t have a car , you might as well lay down and die , ” he said .
“ I ’ve been all over the Western world and I know of no other place where an older person like myself can survive on his own .
I raise my hand , and my chauffeured car  a yellow cab  takes me anywhere .
I can call any restaurant or store and get what I need delivered in minutes . ”

Born in Russia and raised in Israel , Mr. Sitchin studied economics in London and worked as a journalist and editor in Israel before moving to New York in 1952 .
Here , he was an executive at a shipping company and , with his wife of 66 years ( she died in 2007 ) , raised two daughters .
He spent his free time studying , leading archaeological tours to ancient sites and spreading his unusual gospel .
Starting in childhood , he has studied ancient Hebrew , Akkadian and Sumerian , the language of the ancient Mesopotamians , who brought you geometry , astronomy , the chariot and the lunar calendar .
And in the etchings of Sumerian pre-cuneiform script  the oldest example of writing  are stories of creation and the cosmos that most consider myth and allegory , but that Mr. Sitchin takes literally .
" All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing . "
This was written by Edmund Burke .
He was not a Democrat or a Republican .
He was an English royalist and an arch - conservative .
Opposing such a " triumph of evil " should have nothing to do with ordinary politics .
Stick to basics and " No Torture " reaches across political lines .
From NAACP to John Birch Society .
Catholics to Baptists .
Muslims .
Soccer fans .
Cooks .
All Buddhists .
Even law students .
If slaughter happens
Because some are not tortured ,
Well then : so be it .
Evidence .
Collect the publicly available evidence on what the last Administration did .
Use the seminal timeline work from DanK is Back .
Follow the Federal Rules of Evidence guidelines .
Indictment .
Detail the U.S. Code violations .
Nothing soft , here .
Get legal work done to specify which sections of the code were violated with which actions .
Knowledge and thoroughness .
Lawyers needed .
Petition Signup .
Set up a solid petition signing system -- PetitionOnline is a good model .
Validate email addresses , at least .
A neutral site might be best .
Advertising .
Get the voting mechanism advertised and posted around the tubes .
Talk it up in classes and offices .
Women get to exercise the traditional threat to withhold sex until the men go sign it .
Your ordinary grassroots advertising campaign .
ACLU and kos are plausible .
The John Birch Society would be a good site for a voting embed ; they trumpet that the Constitution is worth dying for .
Netroots is grassroots politics .
Do keep in mind that this is a mainstream CONSERVATIVE political agenda item .
Law & order ; death before dishonor .
Evils perpetrated under the orders of the Bush Administration are well known .
Torture was approved .
Telephone calls were made from Vice President Cheney in the White House to individual interrogation teams , urging them to tear into the victims .
Documentation includes published papers , photographs , and sworn statements :
The " Torture Memo . " August 2002 from the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel .
Argues that it " may be justified " to torture al Qaeda suspects .
The memo also argues that international law " may be unconstitutional " where it prohibits torture .
The " Rumsfeld memo . "
March 2003 from a Pentagon working group .
It declared not only that the American president has the power to evade international law and torture foreign prisoners but that interrogators who follow the president 's commands are immune from prosecution .
The Abu Ghraib photographs .
Remember what they show : not just torture but guards who appear absolutely certain of their legal and moral right to torture .
Large numbers of uniformed personnel stand around watching .
The " Dog Handler Testimony . "
Two Army dog handlers assigned to Abu Ghraib submitted sworn statements that military intelligence officers told them to use dogs to frighten prisoners .
The Army had said that any use of dogs in interrogations would have needed approval from the U.S. military commander .
DanK is Back got the timeline together .
He also posted a separate Cheney timeline .
We need to get this work together and draw up a rough for an indictment .
Asking 10,000,000 people to sign a petition is a serious matter -- it should be based on fact and on law .
Suggestions needed !!
Initial contributions include :
-- Signatures :
The signature system will have to include a manual validation process .
Best option seems to be posting a follow - up email .
If the email goes through and the name is reasonable , count the signature .
Signature should include name , email , and zip code or a country code .
Everyone on the planet should be allowed to sign up .
Signing Icons can go anywhere on the web .
Target will be thousands of blogs and web sites .
-- Online positioning :
Positioning and advertising will be critical .
Best , a non-profit 501( c ) ( 3 ) .
Hopefully a sensible home can be found .
The effort deserves a logo .
Suggestions are welcome .
-- Computer Technology :
These are simple programming problems that will require no more than a half - dozen pages .
Different sites for different languages , worldwide , also make sense .
-- Identity and mission :
The motto can be as simple as " No Torture . "
The Biblical Ten Commandments were originally stated simply as " No Other Gods , " " No Murder , " " No Stealing , " and such .
This project deserves thoroughness .
The key to success is getting the Signing Icons out to a very large number of blogs and web sites .
We will target 10,000,000 signatures .
If that does n't work then we will go for 20,000,000 signatures .
Then , if that does not work , we will go to 30,000,000 signatures and on from there .
Feedback to The Signers will memorialize events and government response .
Ultimately , these people -- The Signers -- will matter to those in power .
The original American Signers , led by John Hancock , put their names to our Declaration of Independence , July 4 , 1776 .
These signers will put their names to a fundamental value of civilization , affirming the Convention Against Torture , February 4 , 1985 .

Forse ricorderete ciò che successe ad Abit .
Spero non seguano la stessa sorte altre aziende piuttosto famose e valide nel panorama dell 'ICT .
Tra esse DFI , CSX ed Mtron .
Riguardo DFI , posso darvi maggiori informazioni poichè pervenutemi direttamente da ( ex ) dipendenti della stessa azienda .
InformaticaEasy.net , come forse saprete , è in costante ( direi perlomeno quotidiano ) contatto con circa 70 Aziende leader nel campo dell 'ICT / produzione hardware e software .
Tutto ciò è ovviamente cruciale , anzi indispensabile , per un sito web come questo , che offre recensioni di componentistica hardware ed altri gadget hi-tech gentilmente forniti direttamente da tali aziende .
Senza dimenticare i molteplici comunicati stampa relativi a nuovi prodotti o , in genere , a novità , che mi pervengono quotidianamente sempre da parte delle medesime Aziende .
Un contatto " privilegiato " ( passatemi il termine ) come questo , mi permette di percepire alcuni aspetti della mentalità dell ' Azienda stessa , la disponibilità , la filosofia con cui opera , i suoi obiettivi ( pubblicitari e non ) primari , la tipologia e la preparazione dei suoi dipendenti , i vincoli ( di qualunque natura e indirizzati ad una vastità di categorie di persone , dall ' utente finale a chi come me recensisce e " articolizza " ) che essa impone .
Ad esempio , è stato evidente l'impatto che la crisi economica globale ha avuto sui big dell 'ICT : a partire da tale avvenimento , infatti , i sample concessi per le recensioni diventano sempre più limitati e/o sono sottoposti a criteri ( non scendo nel merito ) più rigidi e ristrittivi .
Ovviamente ci sono delle eccezioni .
Si tratta dunque di " anomalie " positive , ovvero di aziende che non modificano determinati criteri nonostante certi avvenimenti di impatto economico globale gravino inevitabilmente su di esse .
Sintomo , dunque , che il fatturato non ne risente .
Considerazioni , queste , sempre e soltanto relative alla sezione Marketing / PR , ovvero i dipartimenti con i quali InformaticaEasy .
net è maggiormente a contatto .
Sebbene siano svariati i contatti con " Senior Engineers " e personalità operanti nella progettazione ( che , ad esempio , forniscono dettagli tecnici relativamente a prodotti che recensisco ) , il discorso di questo articolo è indipendente da essi .
Una crisi economica si ripercuote sul fatturato di un'Azienda , dunque sui suoi ricavi e sulle sue risorse economice e conseguentemente umane .
Non solo : anche i prezzi di vendita dei prodotti che propone sul mercato spesso vengono opportunamente ritoccati , così come i sample messi a disposizione per le recensioni .
Si instaura , insomma , un circolo vizioso da cui è possibile uscire contando e sperando su un mercato più redditizio e su opportune strategie di marketing nelle quali non oso minimamente intromettermi , data la mia clamorosa inesperienza in tal senso .
Ricollegandomi a quanto detto nei primi paragrafi , spesso è facile percepire , anche agli occhi di un inesperto , quando un'azienda inizia ad " allentare la presa " : parlando per esperienza personale , noto ad esempio che i nuovi comunicati stampa stentano ad arrivare , i relativi siti web aziendali non vengono più aggiornati , non sono più annunciati nuovi prodotti dopo lassi di tempo piuttosto ampi , non ricevo risposte da Aziende che fino a poco tempo fa erano felici di collaborare con me e con InformaticaEasy .
net che rappresento .
In alcuni casi , tale situazione si potrebbe rivelare stranamente apparente : ciò significa che le cricche di rottura sono in realtà inesistenti e si è venuto a creare solamente un assurdo equivoco .
Ma purtroppo non sempre è così .
Fare informazione su un sito di informatica credo significhi non solo parlare dei prodotti di un'Azienda , ma anche dell ' Azienda stessa .
Ecco perchè in questo articolo ho voluto prendere in esame tre Aziende delle quali , come si suol dire , non si sente più parlare da tempo .
Il tempo è un'unità di misura variabile nell ' informatica : senza dar torto alla fisica , infatti , nell ' ambito delle nuove tecnologie un prodotto come un microprocessore può diventare vecchio anche dopo 6 mesi .
Questo perchè escono prodotti " next - gen " nei confronti dei quali anche la concorrenza dovrà adeguarsi sfornando prodotti opportunamente concorrenziali atti a contrastarlo .
Ciò vale , chiaramente , anche per la stessa Azienda che produce tale prodotto : risulta ovvio che un nuovo esemplare va a rimpiazzare il vecchio .
Ciò vale per un sistema operativo , per una tecnologia di produzione di un display , per un alimentatore , ecc ...
Tutto ciò è riassumibile in due termini : progresso e concorrenza .
Se uno dei due elementi viene a mancare , inevitabilmente viene meno anche l'altro .
Ma di quali Azienda parlo ?
Quali sono queste situazioni instabili ?
Di seguito ne tratteremo tre .

The Archbishop of York spoke out today against anti-homosexual laws being debated in Uganda .
Dr John Sentamu , who was born in the country , branded the proposals as " victimising " .
A private member 's bill is going through Uganda 's parliament which would see gay and lesbian people sentenced to a minimum of life in prison if convicted of having sex .
People who failed to report homosexual acts taking place would risk up to three years in prison while those convicted of having sex with a minor would receive the death penalty .
Sentamu said that Uganda 's current laws meant the bill 's provisions were , in effect , already in place .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " I 'm opposed to the death sentence .
I 'm also not happy when you describe people in the kind of language you find in this private member 's bill , which seems not only victimising but also a diminishment of the individuals concerned . "
He said the Anglican church in the UK had been trying to help their counterparts in Uganda as they consider a response .
" The reason why [ the Archbishop of ]
Canterbury and I have n't actually come out publicly and said anything is not because we do n't want to say anything – because the position is very clear – but rather because we are trying to help , " he said .
" We are trying to listen and sometimes people have not understood that at the moment the law in Uganda , without this bill , does exactly the same thing . "
Sentamu said that while people may have " traditional " views about sexuality , the Anglican communion is committed to recognising that gay people are valued by God .
Uganda 's president , Yoweri Museveni , has been urged to consider the effects on the country 's human rights record if the proposals become law .
Sweden has threatened to withdraw aid if the bill , introduced by MP David Bahati , is passed .
The Africa minister , Lady Kinnock , has also raised it with her Ugandan counterpart .
Advertising is a bubble .
If that 's a true statement , Google is a bubble too .
And if that 's true , many of the goods we take for granted on the Web are at risk .
Let 's run down some evidence .
Google has more than a million servers .
The company is notoriously silent on the exact number , but I was told by a Google official that it was headed toward a million in the next couple years — and that was seven years ago .
For a peek at the future , Jeff Dean of Google gave a presentation at an ACM workshop in October 2009 , outlining “ Spanner ” , a “ storage and computation system that spans all our data centers ” .
His “ design goals ” slide described a “ future scale ” with “ ~106 to 107 machines , ~1013 directories , ~1018 bytes of storage , spread at 100s to 1000s of locations around the world .... ”
Google 's data centers are already public utilities on the scale of coal - fired power plants .
Google is silent about the number and size of these as well .
In March 2008 , Rich Miller of Data Center Knowledge wrote , “ The conventional wisdom is that Google has dozens of data centers .
We 're aware of at least 12 significant Google data center installations in the United States , with another three under construction . ”
Those data centers serve enormous sums of traffic .
According to the ATLAS Internet Observatory 2009 Annual Report , Google has reached # 3 among the top ten “ Tier 1 ” Internet backbone providers last year .
Just two years earlier , Google was n't on the list .
As a Tier 1 player , Google “ peers ” with others on the list .
That means they pay nothing to each other for data transit .
Tier 1 status is more a matter of traffic rather than physical fiber backbone .
Google has plenty of backbone , but where it rules is with traffic .
The greatest source of inbound traffic for most Web sites has long been search engines , where Google has a near monopoly .
Consider the case of StackOverflow.com .
Last year it reported , “ 83 % of our total traffic is from search engines , or rather , one particular search engine ” .
Google was first with 3,417,919 .
Yahoo was second with 9,779 .
To some big - old business categories , Google 's threat is apocalyptic .
Take geographic data .
For many years , NAVTEQ and Tele - Atlas have enjoyed something of a duopoly in the geo- business , providing data to GPS companies , car companies , avionics manufacturers and so on .
When you looked at Google Maps , you saw NAVTEQ's or Tele - Atlas ' logo .
That ended last October , when Google dumped Tele - Atlas , just like it had dumped NAVTEQ earlier , as a source of US map data .
As it does in so many other business categories , Google is now giving its US geo data away for free — or less .
Bill Gurley reports , “ Google will pay you to use its mobile OS .
I like to call this the ' less than free ' business model .
This is a remarkable card to play .
Because of its dominance in search , Google has ad rates that blow away the competition . ”
Sound familiar ?
It 's roughly the same thing Microsoft did to the browser business .
It eliminated that business by offering Internet Explorer for free .
Back then , however , the browser business was new and small .
Google goes for bigger game , such as the phone business .
Android might be the most apocalyptic move ever laid on a standing industry .
First , Google creates an open phone design on a Linux platform , lines up a pile of handset makers behind it and then works deals with carriers as well .
I 've done a lot of consulting work in the telco world over the last few years , and here 's the most graphic way I 've heard Google 's approach to the industry explained : “ Google feeds a dock rope down the gullet of the monster , waits for the rope to come out the back end , and then yanks it straight . ”
Of course , the phone business needs some straightening .
We 're long overdue for white - box phones and data paths that look and feel like the real Internet , rather than billed phone connections .
I 've got no problem with Google hastening history there .
I 'm just worried about the way Google makes money .
Nearly all of it comes from advertising .
That 's what pays for all the infrastructure Google is giving to the rest of us .
As our dependency on Google verges on the absolute , this should be a concern .
Think of advertising as oil and Google as one big emirate .
What happens when the oil runs out ?
Maybe it already is .
Citing a “ Natural Born Clickers ” study by ComScore and Starcoma , Ad Age last year reported that “ the number of people online who click display ads has dropped 50 % in less than two years , and only 8 % of Internet users account for 85 % of all clicks ... What 's more , the 8 % of Internet users that compose a majority of clicks is also down by half from the last study , which found 16 % are responsible for 80 % of clicks .
The 2008 study found half of all clicks come from lower - income young adults . ”
The free rides wo n't go on forever .
There are better ways than advertising for demand and supply to find each other ( including search , which is free ) , and more will be found .
Google will be in the middle of that discovery process , no doubt .
But it 's an open question whether Google will make the same kind of money in a post - advertising marketplace .
I 'm betting they wo n't .
Republicans " may well " back a pared - down jobs bill set for a Senate vote this week , their leader said Sunday .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) said that GOP lawmakers could end up supporting a $ 15 billion package set for a vote , even after expressing frustration toward Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) pulled an earlier , larger version of the bill that was negotiated on a bipartisan basis .
" We may well , " McConnell said during an appearance on " Fox News Sunday " when asked if GOP senators would back the package .

The bill is set for a vote on Monday , and Democrats , having lost their 60 - vote majority with the special election of Sen. Scott Brown ( D - Mass. ) , and having Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) absent to begin cancer treatment , will need to rely on Republicans to help pass the package .
Reid pulled the larger bill , which had been negotiated by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , out of concern that Republicans would balk at supporting the plan , or seek to slow down its progress .
" What was a mystery to us is how the bipartisan bill got shelved .
I thought it was moving along a bipartisan path , " McConnell responded Sunday .
" Many of my members were going to support it .
And all of a sudden the majority leader decided to skinny it down . "
The minority leader denied that the GOP would have sought to slow down the jobs bill 's progress , saying they had intended to move forward with the original package as quickly as lawmakers plan to move ahead with the current proposal .
Reid said this weekend that at least one Republican , Scott Brown , has signaled there 's a good chance he 'll support the bill .

If you ’re new to GUI programming ( and wx Python in particular ) , you may not know what a “ book ” control is .
It may be that other languages call this control something different too .
In wxPython , a book control allows the user to switch between various panels .
The most common examples are browsers and system option dialogs with tabbed interfaces .
This article will walk you though the creation and basic configuration of these controls .
wxPython currently has seven of these controls built - in with an eighth in the agw AUI widget .
I will cover the following widgets in this article ( although not necessarily in this order ) : AUI_Notebook , Choicebook , Listbook , Notebook , Toolbook , and Treebook .
In the second article , I will cover the two agw book controls : FlatNotebook and the one embedded in the new agw AUI .
Please note that this first post is a three page article .
I personally do n’t think the default WordPress pagination is very clear .
wx .
Notebook
We will start with the most familiar book widget , the wx .
Notebook .
The following screenshot gives you an idea of what it should look like :
Each notebook tab ( or page ) will be made with a wx .
Panel object .
I have created three different panel classes that we will use for the tabs .
I have taken some code from the wxPython Demo for these panels ( and the book widgets ) and modified them for this tutorial .
Let ’s take a look at one of the panels to give you an idea of what I ’m doing :
import wx class TabPanel ( wx .
Panel ) : " " " This will be the first notebook tab " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " " " " wx.Panel.__init__(self , parent=parent , id=wx.ID_ANY ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) txtOne = wx .
TextCtrl(self , wx. ID_ANY , " " ) txt Two = wx .
TextCtrl(self , wx. ID_ANY , " " ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add( txtOne , 0 , wx . ALL , 5 ) sizer .
Add( txtTwo , 0 , wx . ALL , 5 ) self .
SetSizer( sizer )
The code above will create a panel with two text controls inside a vertical BoxSizer .
That is all it will do .
Now let ’s see how we can use this code in conjunction with a wx .
Notebook .
Here ’s a simple demo :
import images import wx import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree ######################################################################## class NotebookDemo(wx.Notebook ) : " " " Notebook class " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : wx.Notebook.__init__(self , parent , id=wx .ID_ANY , style= wx .
BK_DEFAULT #wx.BK_TOP #wx.BK_BOTTOM #wx.BK_LEFT #wx.BK_RIGHT ) # Create the first tab and add it to the notebook tabOne = panelOne. TabPanel ( self ) tabOne.SetBackgroundColour( " Gray " ) self .
AddPage ( tabOne , " TabOne " ) #
Show how to put an image on one of the notebook tabs , # first make the image list : il = wx.
ImageList ( 16 , 16 ) idx1 = il.Add(images.Smiles.GetBitmap( ) ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) # now put an image on the first tab we just created : self .
SetPageImage ( 0 , idx1 ) # Create and add the second tab tabTwo = panelTwo .
TabPanel ( self ) self .

Let ’s break this down a bit .
First , I create an instance of the wx .
Notebook class and name it NotebookDemo .
In its “ __init__ ” , I have some styles commented out .
These styles tell the notebook where to place the tabs ( i.e. on the top , left , right or bottom ) .
The default is to place them on the top .
You can comment out the default and uncomment one of the other lines to see the difference .
To create the first tab , all we need to do is the following :
# Create the first tab and add it to the notebook tabOne = panelOne. TabPanel ( self ) tabOne.SetBackgroundColour( " Gray " ) self .
AddPage ( tabOne , " TabOne " )
Actually , we do n’t even need to set the background color , but I did that to make the text controls stand out a bit more .
If we do n’t set the color , we can make this into a one - liner like this :
self .AddPage(panelOne.TabPanel(self ) , " TabOne " )
The AddPage ( ) method is the primary way to add a page to a notebook widget .
This method has the following arguments :
AddPage ( self , page , text , select , imageId )
I only add the page and the text for the tab .
If you want , you can pass “ True ” as the 4th argument and make that tab be selected .
The first tab will be selected by default though , so doing that would be kind of silly .
The fifth argument allows the programmer to add an image to the tab ; however , we do that with the next bit of code :
# Show how to put an image on one of the notebook tabs , # first make the image list : il = wx.
ImageList ( 16 , 16 ) idx1 = il.Add(images.Smiles.GetBitmap( ) ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) # now put an image on the first tab we just created : self .
SetPageImage ( 0 , idx1 )
As you can see , we first create an ImageList and set the images to be 16 × 16 .
Then I use the “ images ” module from the wxPython Demo to create a smiley face and add that to the list .
Next I assign the list to the notebook using AssignImageList ( ) .
To set one of the images from the ImageList on one of the tabs , you call SetPageImage ( ) and pass the tab index as the first argument and the bitmap ImageList item instance as the second ( i.e. idx1 ) .
In this example , I only add an image to the first tab .
The next few lines of code adds two more tabs to the notebook and then binds a couple of events : EVT_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING
and EVT_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED .
The EVT_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING
is fired when the user has clicked on a different tab then the one currently selected and ends when the new tab is fully selected .
When the next tab is fully selected is when the EVT_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED event gets fired .
One handy use for the EVT_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING event is to veto the event should you need the user to do something before switching tabs .
The documentation is your friend .
You will find many handy methods there , such as GetPage , GetPageCount , GetPageImage , GetSelection , RemovePage , and DeletePage as well as many others .
The last topic I need to touch on for the wx .
Notebook is how to nest the tabs .
Nesting tabs is actually very easy to do in wxPython .
All you need to do is create a panel with a notebook on it and then make that panel into a tab on another Notebook .
It ’s kind of hard to explain , so let ’s look at some code instead :
import panelOne , panelTwo import wx class TabPanel ( wx .
Panel ) : " " " This will be the first notebook tab " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " " " " wx.Panel.__init__(self , parent=parent , id=wx.ID_ANY ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL )
# Create some nested tabs on the first tab nestedNotebook = wx .
Notebook ( self , wx .
ID_ANY ) nestedTabOne = panelOne.TabPanel(nestedNotebook ) nestedTabTwo = panelTwo.TabPanel(nestedNotebook ) nestedNotebook .AddPage(nestedTabOne , " NestedTabOne " ) nestedNotebook .
AddPage(nestedTabTwo , " NestedTabTwo " ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(nestedNotebook , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) self .
SetSizer( sizer )
The above code just creates the panel with a notebook on it .
I reused some of the panels for this sub-notebook .
Now we just need to insert it into another notebook ( or vice - versa ) :
import images import wx import nestedPanelOne , panelTwo , panelThree ######################################################################## class NestedNotebookDemo( wx.Notebook ) : " " " Notebook class " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : wx.Notebook.__init__(self , parent , id=wx .ID_ANY , style= wx .
BK_DEFAULT #wx.BK_TOP #wx.BK_BOTTOM #wx.BK_LEFT #wx.BK_RIGHT ) # Create the first tab and add it to the notebook tabOne = nestedPanelOne. TabPanel ( self ) self .
AddPage ( tabOne , " TabOne " ) #
Show how to put an image on one of the notebook tabs , # first make the image list : il = wx.
ImageList ( 16 , 16 ) idx1 = il.Add(images.Smiles.GetBitmap( ) ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) # now put an image on the first tab we just created : self .
SetPageImage ( 0 , idx1 ) # Create and add the second tab tabTwo = panelTwo .
TabPanel ( self ) self .
AddPage ( tabTwo , " TabTwo " ) # Create and add the third tab self .
AddPage(panelThree.TabPanel( self ) , " TabThree " )
This code snippet really is n’t very different from our very first piece of code .
The only difference is importing the right panel and adding it as a page to the notebook .
Now we ’ll move on to our next book control .
wx .Choicebook
The wx .
Choicebook is a fusion of the notebook and wx .
Choice widgets .
This allows the user to click a drop - down control to choose which page to view .
The Choicebook also inherits from wx .
BookCtrlBase , so it has most of the same methods that wx .
Notebook has .
Let ’s take a look at a quick demo :
import wx import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree ######################################################################## class ChoicebookDemo( wx.Choicebook ) : " " " Choicebook class " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : wx.Choicebook.__init__(self , parent , wx .
ID_ANY ) # Create the first tab and add it to the notebook tabOne = panelOne. TabPanel ( self ) tabOne.SetBackgroundColour( " Gray " ) self .
AddPage ( tabOne , " Book One " ) # Create and add the second tab tabTwo = panelTwo .
TabPanel ( self ) self .
AddPage ( tabTwo , " Book Two " ) # Create and add the third tab self .
AddPage(panelThree.TabPanel( self ) , " Book Three " ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_CHOICEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED , self .OnPageChanged ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_CHOICEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING , self .OnPageChanging )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanged ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanged , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanging ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanging , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip( ) ######################################################################## class DemoFrame ( wx. Frame ) : " " " Frame that holds all other widgets " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Choicebook Tutorial " , size = ( 600,400 ) ) panel = wx. Panel( self ) notebook = ChoicebookDemo( panel ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(notebook , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) panel. SetSizer( sizer ) self .
Layout ( ) self .
Show ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = DemoFrame ( ) app.MainLoop ()
The code above is mostly the same as that of the notebook example , but even simpler .
You just use the AddPage ( ) method to add a new page to this book control too .
The rest of the methods are pretty much the same as well from what I could see from the documentation .
Take note that the Choicebook does have its own set of specially named events .
If you use one of the other book ’s event names instead , you ’ll quickly find that your event handlers are not fired .
wx .Listbook
The Listbook control uses a ListCtrl to instead of tabs to control the notebook .
In this case , you can actually use labeled pictures to change tabs .
It ’s kind of weird , but I think it ’s kind of cool too .
As with the Choicebook , this control inherits from the BookCtrlBase and has the same methods .
The primary differences seem to lie with the Listbook ’s appearance and in its unique set of events .
Let ’s take a quick peek at my demo to see how to create one !
import images import wx import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree ######################################################################## class ListbookDemo( wx.Listbook ) : " " " " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Listbook.__init__(self , parent , wx .ID_ANY , style= wx .
BK_DEFAULT #wx.BK_TOP #wx.BK_BOTTOM #wx.BK_LEFT #wx.BK_RIGHT ) # make an image list using the LBXX images il = wx. ImageList ( 32 , 32 ) for x in range ( 3 ) : obj = getattr ( images , ' LB%02d ' % ( x+1 ) ) bmp = obj. GetBitmap ( ) il .
Add( bmp ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) pages = [ ( panelOne.TabPanel( self ) , " Panel One " ) , ( panelTwo. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Two " ) , ( panelThree. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Three " ) ] imID = 0 for page , label in pages : self .
AddPage ( page , label , imageId=imID ) imID += 1 self .
Bind(wx.EVT_LISTBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED , self .OnPageChanged ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_LISTBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING , self .OnPageChanging )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanged ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanged , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanging ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanging , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip( ) ######################################################################## class DemoFrame ( wx. Frame ) : " " " Frame that holds all other widgets " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Listbook Tutorial " , size = ( 700,400 ) ) panel = wx. Panel( self ) notebook = ListbookDemo( panel ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(notebook , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) panel. SetSizer( sizer ) self .
Layout ( ) self .
Show ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = DemoFrame ( ) app.MainLoop ()
The Listbook ’s “ tab ” controls can be set run along any of the sides , just like the wx .
Notebook .
You can also attach images with the same methods we used in the Notebook example at the beginning .
I shortened the code up a bit by putting the panels in a list and looping over it , but other than that , there ’s not much more to write about concerning this widget .
wx .
Toolbook
The Toolbook is a wx .
Toolbar plus a wx .
Notebook , which means that you use labeled bitmap buttons to control which “ tab ” of the notebook you are viewing .
As you probably noticed with the Listbook example , I used the wxPython demo ’s “ images ” module for its images and I use it again in my sample code here .
import images import wx import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree def getNextImageID ( count ) : imID = 0 while True : yield imID imID += 1 if imID == count : imID = 0 ######################################################################## class ToolbookDemo( wx.Toolbook ) : " " " Toolbook class " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Toolbook.__init__( self , parent , wx .ID_ANY , style= wx .
BK_DEFAULT #wx.BK_TOP #wx.BK_BOTTOM #wx.BK_LEFT #wx.BK_RIGHT ) # make an image list using the LBXX images il = wx. ImageList ( 32 , 32 ) for x in range ( 3 ) : obj = getattr ( images , ' LB%02d ' % ( x+1 ) ) bmp = obj. GetBitmap ( ) il .
Add( bmp ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) imageIdGenerator = getNextImageID(il.GetImageCount ( ) ) pages = [ ( panelOne.TabPanel( self ) , " Panel One " ) , ( panelTwo. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Two " ) , ( panelThree. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Three " ) ] imID = 0 for page , label in pages : self .
AddPage ( page , label , imageId=imageIdGenerator.next ( ) ) imID += 1 self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TOOLBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED , self .OnPageChanged ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TOOLBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING , self .OnPageChanging )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanged ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanged , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanging ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanging , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip( ) ######################################################################## class DemoFrame ( wx. Frame ) : " " " Frame that holds all other widgets " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Toolbook Tutorial " , size = ( 700,400 ) ) panel = wx. Panel( self ) notebook = ToolbookDemo( panel ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .

Layout ( ) self .

#---------------------------------------------------------------------- if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = DemoFrame ( ) app.MainLoop ()
The Toolbook follows in the footsteps of the previous controls as its lineage comes from the wx.BookCtrlBase .
This widget ’s claim to fame is its look and feel ( although it looks very similar to the Listbook ) and the Toolbook ’s unique events .
I used some fun code from the wxPython demo to help in assigning images to the toolbar ’s buttons , but that ’s really the only difference of any importance .
For full disclosure , read the docs for this control !
wx .
Treebook
The Treebook control is a combination of the wx .
TreeCtrl and the wx .
Notebook .
Most TreeCtrls that I ’ve seen do not use images , but the wxPython demo uses them for the Treebook , so I decided to use them too .
As you can see from the screenshot above , the bitmaps give the Treebook an interesting flavor .
Let ’s see how to make one of these controls !
import images import wx import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree def getNextImageID ( count ) : imID = 0 while True : yield imID imID += 1 if imID == count : imID = 0 ######################################################################## class TreebookDemo( wx.Treebook ) : " " " Treebook class " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx .
Treebook.__init__(self , parent , wx .ID_ANY , style= wx .
BK_DEFAULT #wx.BK_TOP #wx.BK_BOTTOM #wx.BK_LEFT #wx.BK_RIGHT ) il = wx. ImageList ( 32 , 32 ) for x in range ( 6 ) : obj = getattr ( images , ' LB%02d ' % ( x+1 ) ) bmp = obj. GetBitmap ( ) il .
Add( bmp ) self .
AssignImageList ( il ) imageIdGenerator = getNextImageID(il.GetImageCount ( ) ) pages = [ ( panelOne.TabPanel( self ) , " Panel One " ) , ( panelTwo. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Two " ) , ( panelThree. TabPanel( self ) , " Panel Three " ) ] imID = 0 for page , label in pages : self .
AddPage( page , label , imageId=imageIdGenerator.next ( ) ) imID += 1 self .
AddSubPage ( page , ' a sub-page ' , imageId=imageIdGenerator.next ( ) ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TREEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED , self .OnPageChanged ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TREEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGING , self.OnPageChanging ) #
This is a workaround for a sizing bug on Mac ... wx .
FutureCall ( 100 , self .
AdjustSize )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def AdjustSize( self ) : # print self .
GetTreeCtrl().GetBestSize( ) self .GetTreeCtrl( ) . InvalidateBestSize( ) self .
SendSizeEvent ()
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanged ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanged , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def OnPageChanging ( self , event ) : old = event .
GetOldSelection ( ) new = event .
GetSelection ( ) sel = self .
GetSelection ( ) print ' OnPageChanging , old : %d , new : %d , sel:%d
' % ( old , new , sel ) event .
Skip( ) ######################################################################## class DemoFrame ( wx. Frame ) : " " " Frame that holds all other widgets " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Treebook Tutorial " , size = ( 700,400 ) ) panel = wx. Panel( self ) notebook = TreebookDemo( panel ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(notebook , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) panel. SetSizer( sizer ) self .
Layout ( ) self .
Show ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = DemoFrame ( ) app.MainLoop ()
As with the Toolbook , I once again used a some code from the wxPython demo to create this demo and reused some of my own “ framework ” code .
Besides the specialized events of the Treebook , you should also take note that it has an AddSubPage method , which adds a sub -node to the tree which in turn adds another page to the notebook .
There are several other methods that only this control has : CollapseNode , ExpandNode , GetPageParent , GetTreeCtrl , InsertSubPage and IsNodeExpanded .
I think they ’re pretty self - explanatory , but do n’t be afraid to read the documentation .
wx .AuiNotebook
Our final control for this article comes from the wx.aui namespace : the AuiNotebook .
This is the only notebook control in this article that does not inherit from the generic BookCtrlBase .
Be sure to study this control ’s API to fully understand how to work with it as the AuiNotebook has several methods that are unlike the other controls we ’ve seen so far .
The AuiNotebook allows the user to rearrange the tabs , drag the tab into its own area ( as you can see from the screenshot above ) or even drag the tab from one AuiNotebook to another .
The following code snippet will allow you to do all these things :
import wx import wx.aui import panelOne , panelTwo , panelThree class DemoPanel ( wx .
Panel ) : " " " This will be the first notebook tab " " " #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " " " " wx.Panel.__init__(self , parent=parent , id=wx.ID_ANY ) # create the AuiNotebook instance nb = wx.aui.AuiNotebook ( self ) # add some pages to the notebook pages = [ ( panelOne.TabPanel( nb ) , " Tab 1 " ) , ( panelTwo. TabPanel( nb ) , " Tab 2 " ) , ( panelThree. TabPanel( nb ) , " Tab 3 " ) ] for page , label in pages : nb. AddPage ( page , label ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(nb , 1 , wx.EXPAND ) self .
SetSizer ( sizer ) ######################################################################## class DemoFrame ( wx. Frame ) : " " " Frame that holds all other widgets " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " AUI - Notebook Tutorial " , size = ( 600,400 ) ) panel = DemoPanel ( self ) self .
Show ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = DemoFrame ( ) app.MainLoop ()
For this simple example , I just created an instance of AuiNotebook by instantiating against wx.aui.AuiNotebook ( self ) and passing in a wx .
Panel .
Then I added some pages using the AuiNotebook ’s AddPage ( ) method .
Notice also that you can close any tab by clicking on its individual “ x ” .
Now you know how to make your own AuiNotebook !
Wrapping Up
In the second part of this article , we will discover the many interesting features of the AGW Notebooks .
One of the main reasons I left them out of this round - up is because they are pure python modules and have lots of extra capabilities that are not in this set of widgets .
All of this code was tested using wxPython 2.8.10.1 ( unicode ) , Python 2.5 on Windows XP and Vista .
All the examples should run fine on Mac and Linux too , but feel free to let me know how well they work in the comments !

WASHINGTON , Feb. 23 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / --
Groups are calling for Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada to apologize for sexist remarks made yesterday , according to Men 's News Daily .
Reid 's comments served to stereotype men as " abusive , " while ignoring the well - established scientific fact that men and women in partner relationships are equally likely to be violent .
Reid 's remarks on the Senate floor can be seen here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTc8X9AJpmE
Over 250 scholarly studies show women are as physically aggressive , or more aggressive , than men in their relationships with their male partners , according to Martin Fiebert , professor of psychology at California State University : http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm
" Senator Reid 's bizarre and unfounded statement demonstrates an unimaginable disconnect from the millions of unemployed Americans who are not abusive .
These persons are understandably frightened about their futures and the security of their families , " notes Paul Elam , editor - in - chief of Mensnewsdaily.com .
" Mr. Reid needs to apologize immediately . "
Numerous political leaders have highlighted the existence of male victims of domestic violence :
" Domestic violence touches the lives of Americans of all ages , leaving a devastating impact on women , men , and children of every background and circumstance . "
-- President Barack Obama
and children of every background and circumstance . " -- President " Domestic violence cuts across all races , all income brackets , all levels of education – and both sexes . " -- Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell
-- Governor " When we think of domestic violence , we think of the women as being the victims .
But it 's also men victimized as well . " -- Rep. Judy Biggert ( R - IL )
The " Abusegate , Investigate ! " campaign is requesting the government launch a probe into the widespread fraudulent and illegal practices of the domestic violence industry : http://abusegate.mensnewsdaily.com/.
Many believe current domestic violence laws unduly infringe on Americans ' civil liberties .
The Washington Civil Rights Council has termed domestic violence programs the " biggest civil rights roll - back since [ the ] Jim Crow era . "
http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20091013/OPINION03/710139998
The following 16 groups are demanding that Sen .
Reid issues an apology for his sexist statement : African - Americans for VAWA Reform , CPF / Fatherhood Coalition , Dads and Moms of Michigan , Fathers ' and Children 's Equality , Fathers for Equal Rights of America , Illinois Fathers , Men and Fathers for Justice , Men ’s Equality Conference , National Organization for Men , National Congress for Fathers & Children of New Hampshire , Petition for Child Support Reform , Shared Parenting Works , TABS ( Taking Action against Bias in the System ) , Utah Father ’s Rights Meetup Group , Washington Domestic Violence Press , and the Washington Civil Rights Council .

One of Dubai 's biggest investment companies , Dubai World , has asked for a six - month delay on repaying its debts , raising fears among investors about the financial health of the emirate .
Following six years of rapid growth , the Dubai economy has slumped since the second half of 2008 , which has led to property prices falling sharply .
Here , Dubai residents describe the changes the worsening economic situation has brought and what lessons can be learnt .
KEVIN DRAPER , FOUNDING CHAIRMAN OF A COMPANY
In 1996 I established a company in Dubai which designs and builds exhibition stands .
After 12 years of impressive growth it was valued at £ 18 m earlier this year .
It 's a high - profile company with high - profile clients .
A takeover was imminent but the economic collapse changed everything in less than one year .
Client budgets were slashed and as a result we had to take a 60 % reduction in our sales turnover .
I am currently in the UK living with my elderly parents and seeking investment to be able to continue trading .
It 's a riches to rags story .
I have a house in Dubai , which is in a great development with fantastic views .
I am trying to sell it at the moment , so that I can invest in my company .
The falling property prices mean that I 'll lose money on the house too .
Dubai was overheated in the property sector , there was so much speculation going on .
I do n't think development will continue in the same way .
I have n't given up on Dubai .
It 's a great place to live
Most importantly , I think some laws need to change .
One of the biggest challenges businesses and individuals in Dubai face is that a debt payment delay is a criminal offence .
You can go to prison for a bounced cheque .
There are many British expats in jail right now because they 've delayed their debt repayments .
This is exactly why people are leaving overnight and abandoning their cars at the airport .
Many of my staff have been jailed .
Because of delays of business transactions I could face immediate imprisonment as soon as I fly back into Dubai .
I could also be prevented from travelling back to the UK .
It is a terrifying prospect .
The punishment is so severe and I think that this is definitely a contributor to Dubai 's problems .
It 's an old law that needs to catch up with the economic development of the country .
But I have n't given up on Dubai .
It 's a great place to live .
I am currently employing 140 people there and will continue to try to make it a success .
I am sure that Dubai will sort out its problems .
SARAH , WESTERN JOURNALIST
Six months after I bought a flat , it lost more than half its value .
I 'm trapped here - even if I rent it , the rental income wo n't cover my mortgage payments .
Lots of people have left - my neighbour , an architect from the US , was fired and her whole company shut down .
You see cranes and construction material everywhere , but nothing is being built .
The airports are empty .
There are not that many people when you go out shopping , and there are almost no Westerners in the bars and clubs .
All the big Dubai events are gone , and it's more about Abu Dhabi these days .
It 's like something 's died and the city is in mourning .
MATTHEW , PERSONAL TRAINER Dubai World has fuelled the emirate 's rapid economic growth of recent years
We moved to Dubai two years ago .
One of the questions we asked ourselves was how is this property boom sustainable and who is going to live in all these tower blocks .
Friends already living here assured us that if you build them , they 'll come .
They even urged us to invest - thank goodness we did n't .
There are lots of rumours of buildings that have been empty from the moment they were built .
I know a few tower blocks that are never lit up in the evenings .
So I think Dubai has made mistakes and what we see happening here is not only down to the global downturn .
Many people have left - mostly people employed in the construction and property industries .
Quite a few guys from the rugby club have left .
We are not affected personally , as neither of us work in industries hit by the recession .
This is not to say we are n't watching the pennies .
We are worried , of course , but I am sure they 'll turn it around .
There 's too much money invested here to let it all go wrong .
The word out there at the moment is that Abu Dhabi will bail Dubai out and people here are confident that sooner or later it will happen .
ANONYMOUS BUSINESSMAN , TEXTILE INDUSTRY
This news does n't come as a surprise to anyone here , although the government has kept quiet on the subject and people do n't discuss it .
We 've been concerned about the situation for quite some time .
Since July we 've had two increases in our electricity bills .
Our monthly bill was £ 15,000 , now it is nearly £ 30,000 .
That is a massive industrial price hike and it's totally unjustified in this oil - rich country .
Everyone is aware of the situation , but people do n't dare talk openly about it .
Everyone is worried .
I am quite pessimistic .
I do n't think it will get better soon , it will take at least five years for the economy to recover
The property market has crashed - we were n't involved in property , but many people did get involved and many people left overnight .
If you go to the airport you 'll see many abandoned cars .
I myself know a few people who are no longer around .
It makes you wonder where did these people go .
The personal debt situation is very worrying .
Leaving the country is the obvious solution for the foreigners - there are no loyalties , no families to stick around for , so people leave overnight .
I am quite pessimistic .
I do n't think it will get better soon , it will take at least five years for the economy to recover .
Everyone is affected - the banks , the economy , the industry , individuals .
I think this will be the end of the Dubai dream .
They 'll definitely introduce taxes from next year , there are no more gaps to fill in the market , other places are cheaper to run businesses and the industry will dry up .
They 've got to get together in Abu Dhabi , they need to bail us out .
Otherwise , it 's not looking good .
We are thinking of shifting the business elsewhere - perhaps to the subcontinent .
ANDREW , MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A COMPANY
I have to say , I think the West and the UK in particular focus too much on the negative stories from Dubai .
Like all places , Dubai has been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
But believing rumours of 5,000 cars abandoned at the airport , which has only 1,950 parking spaces , is a case of not letting the truth spoil a good story .
Is the request to delay payment damaging ?
Potentially it is , but it's a brave strategy and will see what will emerge out of it now that the information has been put out there in the region .
I am affected by falling house prices in the UK , not in Dubai .
The falling property prices here result in cheaper rent , which is good for me .
And of course our business has been affected and like any businessman I am worried about the world economy .
We are working twice as hard for less return , but I am optimistic about the future .
The days of building big buildings to fill them with people who are going to build more buildings are gone .
Dubai now needs to reinvent itself .
It needs to move on , put property speculation behind and aim at building a service economy .
We have no rain , no tax and no jury service .
I can think of many worse places to be .
REBECCA , TEACHING ASSISTANT
The news did n't come as a surprise .
People have been talking about the bad state of the economy for a long time .
We have n't been affected personally , we are only aware that we need to look after our savings .
We bought our house about five years ago and although house prices have dropped , the value of our house is still higher than the price we paid .
But I know many people who lost their jobs and businesses and fell into debt .
We lost many friends this year .
This is the sad thing for us .
People who have debt leave without telling anybody .
I feel unsure about the future of Dubai .
When I was listening to the news this morning I was thinking , if things get worse , maybe we should consider moving .
It 's not what I want to do , but the thought crossed my mind .
As my husband says , Dubai has been going too big too fast and now there are not enough funds to sustain this development .

Nasa 's budget is under the spotlight .
According to a report in the New York Times , its mission to return astronauts to the moon would be grounded as part of a stringent 2011 budget .
According to reports , the space agency would get an additional $ 5.9 billion over five years to encourage private companies to build , launch and operate their own spacecraft for the benefit of Nasa and others .
Nasa would pay the private companies to carry US astronauts .
So , how much does the US spend on Nasa and the space programme ?
Thanks to the Office of Management and Budget , we have data going back to 1962 on federal spending for each area of government .
Figures from 1958 to 1962 are from richardb.us .
We 've worked out Nasa spending as percentage of government spending - and added which president was in charge at the time .

[ review ] Killzone 2 – PS3
A bullet whizzes by your helmet and into the wall next to you .
In the next two seconds , your movements will either cause your frantic death or the succession over your enemies .
The score is tied with one kill to go – who will it be ?
Welcome to my second review , this time of Killzone 2 for the PS3 .
I wo n’t be the first one to say that this game is fantastic , but it does n’t go without its flaws .
Killzone 2 is an action packed , fun filled frantic frenzy with a competitive spin and top notch polish , and is , frankly , one of the best shooters of 2009 , or , dare I say , the last couple of years .
Graphics
At the time of its release , no other video game could stand up to the beautiful visuals that Killzone 2 had so easily provided .
It reigned as king of console visuals for a very long time , and to many it still remains that way .
It is undeniable truth that Killzone 2 is a beautiful game .
The rays of light so seamlessly bounce off of objects , the gritty setting is evident on all the grimy walls and rusty rails .
Killzone 2 perfectly portrays the objective that Guerrilla was attempting to convey – the atmospheric sense of Helghan , and the scene of war and all its attributes .
Sun shafts , glowing eyes , and a dirty room
There ’s really not much to say here .
If graphics were ever an issue in games for you , be they too bad or an unrealistic art style , neither of these issues reside in this game .
Detail a plenty , Killzone 2 is sure to satisfy your graphical hunger .
The only other game that can combat Killzone 2 ’s graphics is Uncharted 2 , which came out in late 2009 ( as compared to early 2009 ) .
Even if you are part of the small percentile of gamers ( according to Kotaku ) that does not have an HDTV , the game may not shine in its full beauty , but it will still look great .
And for those wondering , this game runs up to 720 p – that ’s 1280 x 720 pixels , people .
The Verdict : 10/10
Gameplay ( + Multiplayer )
I ’ve seen many reviews that not only praise Killzone 2 ’s gameplay , but demolish it in the same sentence .
Killzone 2 has some of the most polished gameplay I ’ve seen in this life .
Guerrilla comes out with a new approach to a rapidly accelerating genre , and boosts the level of activity to an unquantifiable number .
Games are remembered for their gameplay and not their graphics – hence is why Killzone 2 will last through the years .
The single player campaign for Killzone 2 is great in terms of gameplay .
Numerous weapons to try your hand at , even a vehicle for your expertise only .
All this and more is included in the campaign .
However , one facet that the campaign ’s gameplay has over the multiplayer ’s gameplay , is a first person cover system .
To my knowledge , Killzone 2 is the first of hopefully many games to feature this , and do it RIGHT .
After countless failed attempts developers kept on persisting , but now its time to learn a lesson from Killzone 2 .
Without the first person cover system , the campaign would be shoddy and less enjoyable .
It makes the game feel less like a game and more like an immersive experience , where you are directly involved , and tactics are more of an option .
Take note , though , this feature is not available in multiplayer .
Which is exactly something that should have been induced .
You see , tactics ring even truer in the multiplayer aspect of this AAA title .
‘ Why is that ? ’ , you may ask .
Either prevent your team from dying or revive them when they do
Killzone 2 ’s multiplayer was nothing short of success .
From the moment I first clicked ‘ Warzone ’ to get to the multiplayer , the well crafted menus suited my perfectly .
Killzone 2 contains a host of brand new features you just do n’t ever see incorporated with a console FPS .
This brings the magnitude of Killzone 2 ’s success to a highly influential level in the FPS genre .
And , if we are so lucky as to see that developers gain inspiration from Killzone 2 , we can expect many amazing titles like it .
I praise Killzone 2 because it is evident Guerrilla poured their hearts and talent into crafting this fine specimen of a game .
This slice of Wikipedia will put it best for me and save me the trouble :
Warzone , the title of the online multiplayer component of Killzone 2 has been developed by Guerrilla Games in conjunction with the game ’s single - player campaign . []
The online multiplayer gameplay is class - based , meaning the player can choose a class of character which is specialized for a specific role to better suit the player ’s needs in battle .
There are 7 classes in total , in which the player can mix and match two according to their playing style , and can switch abilities upon death .
There are 15 weapons available to the player , most of which cannot be used until the player reaches a certain rank .
Two of these weapons are secondary firearms , and a further two weapons ( Boltgun and Flamethrower ) are exclusive to the downloadable maps “ Suljeva Cliffside ” and “ Arctower Landing ” .
Players play as either the ISA or Helghast , with a few gameplay difference , the character model and respawn points , and the “ lean and peek ” cover system removed .
Each class levels up with experience gained from killing or completing mission objectives , with enough experience they unlock new weapons , skills etc. as well as a new class that is unlocked .
Each class has two badges , the Primary badge selects the class and their specified skill , the secondary badge has an extra skill for the specified class but can be swapped to create your own custom class .
Warzone plays out through dynamic matches where multiple game types are played in a single round .
The game ships with five different game types including Assassination , Search & Retrieve , Search & Destroy , Bodycount and Capture & Hold .
Online matches can connect 2 to 32 players , and they can group into six squads of up to four players .
If an online match does not have a full 32 players , computer - generated “ bots ” can be added in to create bigger teams ( but only in an unranked match ) .
Killzone 2 also offers a clan system , which allows clans of up to 64 players to compete for “ Valor Points ” , an in - game currency that clans can use to bet on tournaments .
Players can also play offline against AIs with Skirmish mode and unranked online multiplayer but there ’s no offline multiplayer mode for splitscreen human players .
Eight multiplayer maps are included on disc at release , Guerrilla has stated that further maps will be made available as future downloadable content .
A further 6 maps have been added to multiplayer since release via downloadable content purchasable from the PlayStation Store .
The classes are especially well done .
I personally am not at the max level in the game , but I have done plenty of time with all the weapons and classes , etc .
When I mentioned earlier how the multiplayer demands the cover system because of its stronger approach on tactics , I was n’t kidding .
At the same time , there is reason to vouch for no cover ( although nobody is really at a disadvantage ) .
Were the cover system in place for the multiplayer , snipers would go practically undetected , engineers could hide and replace sentry turrets at their nearest convenience , and anybody could lob grenades at the enemy and be protected in the next moment .
And while all this is true , it does not excuse the amount of trouble that is done when a team is being spawn killed .
Not only is it horrendously difficult to combat spawn killing , but it is especially easy to do so with an intelligent team .
For this reason some of Killzone 2 ’s issues hold no restrictions .
But it is particularly useful that one of the seven classes can put a green smoke marker – which indicates a location which his allies may spawn on .
Killzone 2 , outside of its core ingame play , is executed flawlessly .
During spawning you choose a location to spawn ( there normally are n’t more than one ) , and so long as it is a pre designated spawning location , it is protected by sentry turrets .
Depending on the server ( more on this later ) you join , there will be all five gametypes toggled , or a selection of them .
When creating a server , if you were to toggle on all the gametypes ( and of course , maps but that really is n’t important ) , you would play a rotation of all the gametypes on the same map , without the map ever resetting .
It seamlessly integrates the gametypes together .
You also choose your weapons and badges ( basically your classes ) while spawning .
All at the same time , you can join squads !
Squads are premade in the menu , but the first person to join is a squad leader .
You can send requests to squad leaders to join their squads , or the other way around .
All these features function well together , and UI for it is done in harmony .
During my playtime of Killzone 2 , I ’ve had many memorable moments , all due to the great engineering of the game and the fantastic gameplay .
But if there ’s one thing that irks me , and many others , its the heavy ( or sticky ) aiming .
Most say its realistic , I say bahh , and then I finally got used to it and stopped complaining .
The Verdict : 9/10
Story
Personally my perceived weakest point of the game , it suffices , but it does not exceed my expectations .
It is a story of revenge – the Helghast are pissed and want their planet back .
The ISA said hell no and began to invade Helghan .
Well , at this point , you have to show off your mad skills and take down the Helghast and their grandpa of a leader ( who , if you ’ve played and beaten the game , you ’ll know is a royal idiot ) .
The story fails to explain some key points during the campaign , which I wo n’t mention for spoiler sake .
The only reason this category wo n’t be marked down more than a few points is because the story is not an essential element of this game .
While it is thrilling to go through the hell of Hell - ghan ( get it ? haha …. yeah ) and come out successful ( minus plot twists ) , it seems that some of the moments are best left untold , or , in other words , left out of this game .
Because they cause a dire action on what could ’ve been a more rational and explainable story , making you ask , “ How did that happen ? ” or “ Why did that happen ? ”
All in all , the story really managed to surprise me once , with a well executed plot twist .
The other times , it just felt like , “ what the hell am I doing here ? ” , which was quickly replaced by my being in awe of the amazing gameplay and graphics .
Killzone 2 is barely saved in this regard , but for me to give it something of a bad rating , it would need to be essential … and its not .
Mostly because this is an FPS game , but the other half of me wants to negate that notion because of the various holes in the plot .
Either way , the story does what justice does , albeit not as good as the special forces do justice .
The Verdict : 7.5/10
Presentation / Content / Other
Guerrilla has done a good job in the other areas of the game .
Killzone 2 includes some extras , credits , and the usual .
But what I love is how Guerrilla included a server browser with this game .
Being a console game , you normally would n’t be suspect of not having a server browsing system , but this just adds to the greatness of the game .
Servers are created by you , the user , with all the options at your side , that is maps , gametypes , etc .
Sadly the population drops quite a bit if you do n’t have the downloadable extra maps , but there is always one or two healthy , large servers available even if you have n’t shelled out the PSN cash for them .
Along with servers is the inclusion of clans .
The clan integration with the Killzone website is done well , and players can bet points on tournaments to see which clan will win .
Not having participated in it myself , I ca n’t give proper judgment , but it sounds like a lottery ( well , except for the fact that you can win ) .
This image has nothing to do with this category
Killzone 2 also bears a more contemporary control scheme – which seems to act as an adaptation of multiple title ’s signature controls .
So it takes a bit of getting used to , but they ’re good .
Like all other PS3 games , you ca n’t completely customize your controls , but there are four presets to choose from .
Note that changing sensitivity or toggling critical aim does n’t eliminate the atrocity of the built in heavy aiming … so do what you can to get used to it .
Killzone 2 takes good advantage of Sixaxis , like being able to spin a loading screen to make the long wait seem even longer .
It also takes what should n’t be pro skill to turn a wheel with the sixaxis … but you know , there has to be something to remember this game by .
However , the best instance of the sixaxis being used is the aim of the sniper rifle when the scope is in use .
In other words , if you have a high blood sugar level , sniping probably is n’t your thing in this game .
The Verdict : 10/10
In the end , Killzone 2 is a well crafted game that puts its foot in the door of new concepts and , instead of using the door for its intended purpose and swinging it , Guerrilla throws a nuke at that door and barely has enough time to get into suitable cover .
Hence why we did n’t see Killzone 2 for all those years .
Overall : 9.1
This game deserves your attention if you ’re an FPS fan .
Just please , do me a favor and do n’t expect a marvelous story .
Killzone 2 – buy it today !
Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat , who has made the evacuation of the disputed Beit Yonatan dependent on the demolition of illegal Arab buildings in east Jerusalem , is forging ahead with his plan .
Sources in Jerusalem City Council said that Barkat is attempting to apply pressure on everyone involved in the affair , in order to gain support for his plan raze Arab houses in east Jerusalem .
They added that city officials will start distributing demolition orders to Arab homes in the coming days , at the same time as posting the evacuation order on the walls of Beit Yonatan .
Plot Thickens Advisor : J'lem mayor has no authority to demolish Arab homes Ronen Medzini Jerusalem Municipality 's legal advisor continues to fight mayor on Beit Yehonatan affair .
Ynet learns advisor Yossi Havilio sends letter to prosecutor stating that number of demolition orders against 200 Arab houses not in city 's jurisdiction Advisor : J'lem mayor has no authority to demolish Arab homes
Beit Yonatan , which houses Jewish families in the heart of east Jerusalem 's mostly Arab Silwan neighborhood and was constructed without a building permit , is slated for evacuation but the court order has yet to be applied .
Meanwhile , MK Eli Yishai ( Shas ) continues in his attempts to retroactively obtain building permits for the house .
Associates of Barkat said that the mayor was feeling wounded by the affair , especially by the angry letter sent to him by State Prosecutor Moshe Lador .
" Barkat is trying to provoke a storm , " one source said , adding , " He hopes to go back to Lador and say , ' see what you 've done ? ' . "
' Mayor playihg with fire '
Barkat 's decision was met by harsh reactions ont he part of the opposition .
" The mayor is playing with fire , " said council member Dr. Meir Margalit ( Meretz ) to Ynet .
Beit Yonatan , center of controversy ( Photo : Noam Moskovitz )
" This is really raising the stakes in east Jerusalem .
It 's such a sensitive area , and this move is a slap in the face of efforts by the international community to bring ( PA President ) Mahmoud Abbas back to the negotiating table , " he said , adding that it was also a stab in the back for Silwan residents who have cooperated with Barkat during the year in order to reach an agreement over the issue of illegal building .
Margalit added that the state prosecutor had only ordered Beit Yonatan to be evacuated and sealed .
He had not ordered the demolition of Silwan houses .
Barkat is planning to demolish these houses " only to satisfy the extreme Right in time for the next elections , " he said .
Tibi : Yishai breaking international law
Meanwhile , the Knesset Internal Affairs Committee convened to discuss the issue of illegal construction in the Arab sector .
MK Ahmed Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) referred to the Beit Yonatan affair and strongly criticized Yishai 's intervention .
" He has skirted a significant demolition order and broken international law , " he said .
Turning his attention to building without permit in the Arab sector , Tibi blamed the State .
" Thousands of homes are constructed without authorization because no building permits are issued , " he said .
Meanwhile , MK Talab El - Sana ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) said that the lack of a master plan for construction in the Arab sector constitutes discrimination .
" You ca n't just demolish without issuing any permits .
The public simply cannot cope with that , " he said .

Is Barack Obama More AIPAC Than J Street ?
Anxiety about Barack Obama has afflicted Israelis since his meteoric rise to the White House .
Here was an untested president , one whose agenda in the Middle East could only be imagined .
Would Obama ’s America be Israel ’s lifeline in a dangerous and often hostile world ?
Or would this American president experiment with mistaken or even unfriendly ideas that could wreak havoc for Israeli security ?
Israeli anxiety was particularly visible in the circle around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who took office two months after Obama in March 2009 .
The new prime minister and his aides were hearing a stream of worrying reports from Republican friends in the United States , some of whom who painted Obama as a closet Marxist or a confirmed radical with Muslim roots pursuing a Third World leftist agenda .
Would Obama waste precious time chasing illusory " openings " for engagement with Iran while the Islamic Republic completed its final sprint to nuclear weapons ?
Would Obama be open to the dangerous advice of the pressure - on - Israel crowd and try to impose unacceptable terms for a Palestinian state , terms that the Israeli public and national security leadership believe would lead Israel to war and insecurity , not peace ?
Would he cluelessly undermine the broader strategic balance on which Israeli and regional security depends ?
Israel ’s anxieties deepened in May 2009 .
Barely eight weeks after Netanyahu took office , Obama turned global attention to the most divisive issue in the U.S. - Israel relationship : Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and special envoy George Mitchell announced loudly that Obama wanted a total freeze on construction of Jewish homes , even in Jerusalem , and that Obama did not consider himself bound by earlier compromises about settlement issues .
Many Israelis , even some who despise the settlements , saw this heavy - handed approach as artless at best , if not downright antagonistic .
The episode reinforced the perception that Obama was naïve about the Middle East and easily swayed by the left — a decision - maker who could be erratic , unpredictable , and dangerous .
A theory emerged that placed much of the blame on White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Senior Advisor David Axelrod , two American Jews from Chicago .
Some of Netanyahu ’s people painted them as devotees of the strain of Middle East diplomacy that views Israel as the obstacle to peace .
Various acolytes of the American Democratic left , occasionally presenting themselves as representing the true Obama worldview only intensified the impression that Obama ’s team was unsympathetic to Israel .
One after another argued that if only Obama acted to coerce Israel into accepting some perfectly reasonable agreements such as replacing Israeli security personnel in the West Bank with international peacekeepers , peace would be possible .
J Street a dvisor and former Council on Foreign Relations fellow Henry Siegman , for example , wrote that Israel is no longer a true democracy but an " apartheid regime " under " the influence of Israel ’s settler - security - industrial complex " that wants to " retain Israeli control of Palestine from the river to the sea . "
America ’s " special relationship with Israel is sustaining a colonial enterprise . "
But " President Obama is uniquely positioned to help Israel reclaim Jewish and democratic ideals on which the state was founded . "
This will , of course , require " forceful outside intervention . "
M.J. Rosenberg , formerly of the Israel Policy Forum , wrote that , " No matter who heads Israel ’s … government , it is President Barack Obama who holds 51 cards in the deck . "
FP contributor Stephen M. Walt added , " Unless the U.S. president is willing and able to push Israel … peace will simply not happen . "
This chorus of voices from the Democratic left strengthened the impression in Israel that Obama , or at least some of his top officials , must agree .
However , over the past 12 months , some counterevidence has begun to suggest that Obama and his top advisors are not in fact believers in the catechism of the ideological left .
Yes , Obama is drawing down in Iraq , as he pledged in his campaign .
But this is a policy embraced by many in the center , not just the left .
At the same time , he is greatly increasing the deployment of American soldiers in Afghanistan from 38,000 to 100,000 .
Another important part of progressives ’ agenda is to cut what they saw as bloated budgets for national security , redirecting allocations to underfunded domestic programs .
But Obama has rejected this advice and instead increased the Bush defense budget from $ 513 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $ 537 billion for fiscal year 2010 and $ 549 for 2011 .
If defense budgets are one of the best indicators of the direction of policy , Obama ’s defense budgets mark him as no leftist .
Another key indicator of foreign policy direction is a president ’s willingness to accept human life costs for national security goals .
Obama is putting American soldiers at risk in Afghanistan , and he seems to accept that some level of civilian casualties is a regrettable but unavoidable reality if global security objectives are to be achieved .
Obama has greatly increased drone strikes against al Qaeda in Pakistan , undeterred by frequent reports of civilian casualties .
In December , the president personally issued the order for U.S. airstrikes in Yemen , killing 35 suspected Al Qaeda agents but also , collaterally , dozens of civilians .
Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a form of encouragement by European liberals .
But his Dec. 10 Nobel acceptance speech could have been written by a conservative : " Nations — acting individually or in concert — will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified , " he said in Oslo .
On issues that touch Israel more directly , Obama ’s choices actually align him more closely with Israel than with his progressive colleagues .
Many on the left continue to believe that the United States has not made a good - faith effort at diplomatic outreach toward Iran .
But Obama said on Feb. 9 , " We have bent over backward to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation … .
We gave them an offer … .
They rejected it ….
They in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to [ nuclear ] weapons . "
The intelligence community is producing a new National Intelligence Estimate reportedly assessing a much greater threat from Iran than the 2007 document .
On Israeli -Palestinian issues , Obama and his team have changed the pitch , if not the words to the song , after his initial stumble on the settlements freeze .
He has , to the consternation of the J Street left , accepted Netanyahu ’s compromise and moved on .
Mitchell said on Nov. 25 , " We believe the steps [ toward a partial settlements freeze ] announced by the prime minister are significant and could have substantial impact . "
In a Jan. 7 interview with Charlie Rose , Mitchell said , " The Israelis are not going to stop settlements in or construction in East Jerusalem .
They do n’t regard that as a settlement because they think it ’s part of Israel . "
Mitchell had the unusual task of explaining to European allies on Jan. 12 why it is unrealistic to expect a freeze on construction in Jerusalem — a freeze that he himself had demanded just months earlier .
Obama is also unyielding in the face of demands that he open relations with Hamas .
He says this would undermine the peace process as long as Hamas continues to reject the existence of Israel , and it would undermine Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .
And he is striking a more realistic general tone about the prospects for radical change in the region .
In an interview with Time on Jan. 21 , he said , " If we had anticipated some of [ the ] political problems [ in Israeli - Palestinian negotiations earlier ] we might not have raised expectations as high . "
In a series of recent statements , Obama has tried repeatedly to define himself as a man of the center , not the left .
At a Jan. 29 meeting with House Republicans , he maintained , " I am not an ideologue . "
In a Feb. 9 interview with Bloomberg News , he said he is pursuing a " fundamentally business - friendly " agenda and is a " fierce advocate " for the free market .
" The irony is that on the left we are perceived as being in the pockets of big business ; and then on the business side , we are perceived as being anti-business . "
The lesson Obama and his key advisers took from the Jan. 19 Republican upset victory in the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race is very different from the one that is popular among progressives .
MoveOn and two allied groups commissioned a poll to show that Massachusetts voters actually wanted a stronger health - care bill than the one Obama was supporting .
But Emanuel and Axelrod paid more attention to the fact that the independents and swing voters who voted for Obama in 2008 deserted him in droves , including suburban union members who also helped Republicans win formerly Democratic offices in New Jersey and Virginia .
The Obama team is worried that independents and Democratic centrists are fleeing to the GOP .
It is not the progressives that they want to woo .
Meanwhile , on the unhappy left , many now think that Obama merely postured as a progressive candidate in 2008 to outflank Clinton in the Democratic primaries .
The Nation says he was never " a movement Progressive the way Reagan was a movement Conservative . "
Emanuel is the new whipping boy for many on the left , who say he cares more about the imperiled reelection prospects of " Blue Dog " Democrats in Congress than he does about scoring policy victories for the progressive agenda .
Of course , this could all be tactical , and not the true measure of Obama ’s ultimate intentions .
But , at least for the moment , the anxiety in Israel is subsiding , and people are taking a more positive view of this president than they did a year ago .
A hit squad that murdered a senior Hamas official in Dubai used the stolen identities of six British citizens and faked at least five other European passports , it emerged today .
The international investigation into the assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh last month is certain to examine the role played by Israel , where as many as seven of the victims of identity theft , including at least four Britons , are currently living .
Some reports yesterday suggested a team of 17 people were involved in the meticulously - planned killing .
Six have yet to be identified .
Official sources said UK authorities issued the British passports used by the assassins in Dubai last month .
They confirmed that the killers had not altered the names and numbers in the passports , but the photographs had been changed .
At least six of the people whose names appeared on British passports used by the assassins in Dubai live in Israel .
All deny any involvement .
" I am obviously angry , upset and scared – any number of things , " Melvyn Mildiner , one of them , told Reuters .
" And I 'm looking into what I can do to try to sort things out and clear my name . "
Israeli press reports named three other British Israelis whose identities were used – Paul Keeley , Stephen Hodes and Michael Barney – as well as Michael Bodenheimer , who emigrated from the US 30 years ago but whose name appears on one suspect 's German passport .
Two others living in Israel were identified as James Clark and Jonathan Graham , whose names are almost identical to those appearing on two forged British passports used by the suspects .
The revelation fuelled already widespread speculation in the region over Mossad involvement in the killing of Mabhouh and an orchestrated plot involving 11 assassins , mostly posing as tourists in Dubai .
Mabhouh was one of the founders of the military wing of Hamas and had been wanted by Israel for his role in the 1989 kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers on leave .
His participation was acknowledged by Hamas last month .
The Israeli government would not comment on allegations of its involvement in Mabhouh 's killing .
If confirmed , the allegations would trigger a diplomatic row with Britain and the other three European nations whose passports were used – Ireland , Germany and France .
The Irish Republic said the three Irish citizens named by Dubai police as suspects did not exist , while the German government said the passport number of the sole German suspect was either incomplete or wrong .
The authorities in Paris refused to comment on the authenticity of a French passport used by one of the killers .
Dubai public prosecutors have issued warrants for " premeditated murder " against the 10 men and one woman in the suspected team of assassins – the first step in obtaining a " red notice " from Interpol to track down wanted fugitives abroad .
Police in the emirate described the killing as meticulously planned , with the hit squad arriving on different flights and checking into different hotels .
They were seen on surveillance video tailing Mabhouh from the moment he arrived in Dubai .
His murder , in his hotel room near Dubai International airport , took 10 minutes , and early forensic tests suggest that he was suffocated .
The assassins left on flights to Europe and Asia before the body was discovered on 20 January .
Authorities in the United Arab Emirates identified Austria as a possible " command centre " for the operation .
In a sign that the country would be seeking formal assistance from European states , the Dubai attorney general , Essam al - Humaidan , told the Abu Dhabi - based National newspaper that the UAE had signed judicial treaties with certain European countries , enabling the " extradition of the suspects wherever they hide " .
Michael Levi , a Cardiff University professor of criminology and an expert on identity theft , said that if the British travel documents used by the assassins predated the introduction of biometric e-passports , they would not be hard to tamper with .
" The sort of organisation that can pull off a hit like that will be able to make those sort of changes , " he said .
" The point is that , in any system , you only have to be good enough to pass the scrutiny of the people you 're going to come across . "
The Foreign Office said it was too early to speculate on who could have carried out the identity theft against the British citizens involved .
In recent decades , Mossad has gained a reputation for using passports of other countries , and Britain had a diplomatic row with Israel in 1987 over its use of forged British passports .
In 1997 , a Mossad hit squad used doctored Canadian passports in a botched attempt to kill the Hamas leader , Khaled Meshal , while two suspected Israeli agents were jailed in New Zealand in 2005 for obtaining the country 's passports illegally .
Rami Yigal , a former Mossad official , told Israel Army radio the assassination " does n't look like an Israeli operation " .
There was a mixture of praise and criticism of Mossad in the Israeli press today .
Yossi Melman , a respected security correspondent for Ha'aretz , said Mossad had used forged passports on operations in the past and noted that , in this case , all the " operatives " involved in the assassination had left Dubai without being caught .
" As such , unless dramatic evidence is found to definitively prove an Israeli connection , it is likely that the state of Israel will emerge from this affair unblemished and Mossad will continue enjoying a reputation of fearless determination and nearly unstoppable capabilities , " Melman wrote .
However , another Ha'aretz columnist , Amir Oren , said there were now " enormous question marks " over the operation and said the Mossad chief , Meir Dagan – whom he described as " belligerent and heavy - handed " – should quit .
He said the case was likely to bring a diplomatic crisis for Israel and added : " But even if whoever carried out the assassination does reach some kind of arrangement with the infuriated western nations , it still has an obligation to its own citizens . "
Bobby Razak , the filmmaker behind the Legalize MMA documentaries and various Tapout short films , has released another interesting film about MMA , only this time he looks at the sport from the perspective of two children participants .
The Future of MMA By Bobby Razak from Bobby Razak on Vimeo .
Payout Perspective :
I ’m not a film critic , but in my eyes Razak is a talented filmmaker and an asset to the sport of MMA .
The latest offering is an interesting look at the growth of grassroots MMA and a glimpse of the types of born - fighters we can expect to enter the sport in ten years .
However , the film and some of its content do raise some questions about the participation of children in the sport .
I ’m not a pediatrician , either , but I do wonder what kind of physical toll the sport of MMA might take on the young , undeveloped brains and bodies of children .
Is it safe ?
If so , where do we draw the line ?
What are the limitations ?
I ask not because I do n’t necessarily know the answers – my slightly educated opinion tends to believe that rolling , wrestling , and limited muay thai training is perfectly fine for children .
I ask because I think this is something the sport of MMA really needs to think about and have an answer for .
MMA is n’t just about the live events anymore – it ’s now truly becoming a lifestyle .
It ’s the way we talk , the way we dress , the activities we undertake , the music we listen to , and the people we spend our time with .
The more this lifestyle is perpetuated – with things like UFC Gyms , the ubiquity of Tapout and Affliction clothing , etc – the more we ’re going to see participation from those of all ages .
Someone is going to inevitably call MMA on the participation of children , and the sport needs to be ready to answer that call unequivocally .
Note : Give Tapout a pass for the near eye - rolling amount of product placement .
The company has done a lot for the sport of MMA , and they likely funded the entire production .
It should get some promo out of the film .
Remember when the public option was the controversial part of the health - care bill ?
Now it 's the Medicare reforms , which are far more modest than what the Republicans are proposing , and the individual mandate , which Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe and every co-sponsor of Wyden - Bennett supported before they decided to turn on the policy because doing so was politically convenient .
Next week ?
Who knows ?
In comments , Theora Jones makes the case that it can , and will , be anything .
I was just at a health policy conference where wonks were talking about the " parts of the bill we all agree on , " which were various demos and health delivery system change provisions .
And I was like … " we all agree " on these ?
Any one of these provisions could be controversial if someone thought it was in their interest to demagogue it .
Heck , we could make medical education and licensure sound like a Stalinist plot if it suited our purposes ( " the ONLY doctor you are allowed to see in America is a doctor who has attended a government - approved school , who has studied at a government - approved hospital training program , who has passed a government - approved test of how he will practice medicine , who can be reported anonymously to a panel of government - appointed bureaucrats and then have to justify to them the way he practices medicine , and who must by law prescribe ONLY government - approved medicines ! " ) .
The only reason we think we all " agree " on these things is because nobody except honest , informed , smart and well - intentioned wonks are paying attention to them !
You see this over and over again that people " from across the spectrum " " agree " on something until , you know , there 's a possibility it will actually HAPPEN .
At which point people who would be losers start digging into the details of this policy so they can demagogue it , while at the same time people who have a political interest to see their opposition fail start trumpeting these demagogued points , and the bill is suddenly " controversial . "
At which point someone " centrist " says , " Hey , why do n't we do this other thing that none of you have paid much attention to ?
It seems so much less controversial ... "
At which point people start digging into the new thing and demagoguing it and then it's lather , rinse , repeat until we decide that it's " too hard " to address this issue and oh it's so lamentable that " Washington " can't find a " common ground , common sense " solution which is somehow , magically , not offensive to anyone .
At a certain point , reporters and politicians and observers of DC need to grow up and realize that " moderate " does not mean " uncontroversial . "
Especially when , for goodness ' sake , organizations and parties have figured out that they can gin up controversy over anything !
It 'll be hard for News Corp. to put a positive spin on the departure of MySpace Chief Executive Owen Van Natta , who 's quitting after less than ten months on the job .
The official reasons for Van Natta 's resigning are vague , but the Los Angeles Times reports that the MySpace chief often clashed with News Corp. , and particularly Jon Miller , the company 's head of digital media .
Van Natta 's underlings ( who Miller hired ) , Chief Operating Officer Mike Jones and product chief Jason Hirschorn , will replace him as co-presidents .
MySpace 's troubles began before Van Natta climbed aboard last April , and have n't improved since .
In January 2009 , comScore reported that Facebook drew twice the global traffic of MySpace .
U.S. traffic tilted Facebook 's way last June .
And last month , comScore reported that MySpace had lost more than a quarter of its online video viewers year - over - year , even as online video explodes .
Buzz is hard to quantify , but MySpace has n't received much of it since Van Natta became CEO .
The one major news maker for MySpace was its acquisition of iLike , a music discovery tool , but MySpace was cagey about its reasons for the purchase .
Two developments have followed : MySpace powers a portion of Google 's Music Search , which itself was sort of a dud , and MySpace Music got a straightforward facelift to integrate iLike , among other changes .
It 's a far cry from the Facebook home page redesigns that cause people to freak out , or the major events for which Twitter is the pulse .
Even Miller said that MySpace has stopped innovating .
What happens now ?
News Corp. has ambitions to turn MySpace into a portal for movies , music , television and games , moving it away from its social networking roots , says the L.A. Times .
But MySpace has been saying that for a while , even under Van Natta 's command , and there 's no shortage of portals for that content already .
Om Malik offers a more likely scenario : News Corp. could unload MySpace and its other major digital property , IGN , if the right deal came along .
From there , I believe the site would whither , or at least become a niche place for either music or social networking , like the old days .
No matter what happens , MySpace is unlikely to reclaim its former glory .
OK - my girlfriend and I adore doing the fine dining thing - we love things like foie gras , waygu beef , kobe beef , tartre , etc , but recently we are noticing a lot of people out at our favorite restaurants being what I 'd call " food snobs " .
Really complaining about wet aged vs. dry aged ( not just discussing , but complaining when they find out that something is wet aged rather than dry aged ) and the such .
Two questions - with the rise in the awareness of food are you encountering more food snobbery ?
Second , how do you deal with it when it presents itself at your table ?
I 'm also curious as to how you define food snobbery .

As I got more serious about cooking , I splurged and bought myself a very nice Kai Shun santokuÂ­ like the previously reviewed Tosagata Hocho .
I used its preternaturally sharp edge with joyous dispatch for about 6 months , until I woefully cut some citrus with it and left it dirty overnight , eroding that wonderful edge .
I ’ve never been able to get that magic edge back , even with pro sharpening .
On a visit to a local Asian market , I found a series of Thai - made Kiwi brand knives .
In the store , they were nearly free :
The large tapered chef ’s knife ( model # 21 ) that soon stole my heart cost around $ 4 ; the paring knife was $ 1.50 .
These knives are very sharp and schuss through veggies and meats like it ’s nothing .
Do n’t go hacking at bones with the thinner models , but Kiwi also makes quite usable cleavers for around $ 8 .
The miraculous part is , the knives hold an incredible edge for months with proper use of your steel , and they take a new edge with aplomb after a few strokes on a stone .
I have owned knives by Wusthof , Kyocera , Calphalon , and Ikea ( :: shudder : : ) and the Kiwis are the most consistently sharp , most durable , and have the most effective shapes .
I ’ve bought or suggested them for all of my foodie friends , and people ca n’t get over how wonderful they are .
They do n’t look like much , but they ’re well - balanced , very sharp .
It does n’t hurt that I could have picked up a full set for less than my crappy block - o - food - manglers cost 10 years ago .
As far as longevity goes , I ’ve had my main chef ’s knife for about four years , have steeled it every time I used it and given it a few good hones on my Spyderco Sharpmaker .
It ’s still wicked sharp , and while I have n’t babied it , it looks none the worse for wear .
I used my paring knife to whack the lid off a persnickety glued - shut can of Lyle ’s Golden Syrup , and in my zeal , the tip bent over almost double .
I thought ,
Oh no !
But then I bent it back in place with a pair of pliers , and it ’s basically good as new .
They ’re definitely the Jeep Wranglers of the kitchen .
I suggest buying them locally if you live in an area with Asian markets ; if not , they can be picked up online at generally higher prices .

When the wars of the former Yugoslavia finally ended in 1999 , the region was left with hundreds of battle - hardened men who had become accustomed to crime and easy money .
With the fighting over , many of them turned to crime full - time .
In the era of electronic banking , banks no longer carry much cash , so jewels are the softest target for thieves .
The former Yugoslav criminals saw their opportunity and are now the world ’s most feared diamond thieves .
Interpol has dubbed them the Pink Panthers .
In a GlobalPost exclusive report , four of the thieves reveal how they plan their robberies , how they dispose of the stolen diamonds — and who is winning the battle between them and police departments from Paris to Dubai .
PODGORICA , Montenegro —
Each member of the gang did his or her job perfectly .
The attractive young woman seduced the son of the jewelry store owner in Rome to find out where the safe was in the owner ’s house .
She also discovered that the owner needed builders for repairs .
Some of the others secured the renovation contract and cased the house .
The get - away driver spent weeks learning every one - way road and stop sign in downtown Rome .
And eventually the safe - cracker , the smallest in the group , hid himself inside a false - bottomed chest that the others left on the balcony of a bedroom where the safe was located .
As luck would have it , he did n’t even have to break into the safe , which was hidden behind a painting .
The jeweller ’s other son left it open for 15 minutes , plenty of time for the diminutive safe - cracker to remove the diamonds and make his escape to the street , where the driver was waiting for him .
Back in their rented apartment in Ostia , near the Fiumicino airport outside Rome , the gang met up and celebrated .
“ That was one of the most beautiful jobs I ’ve ever done , ” the get - away driver said , smiling at the memory in an interview with GlobalPost at a seaside fish restaurant in the former Yugoslav republic of Montenegro late last year .
It sounds like a plot from Ocean ’s Eleven .
But the October 2001 robbery , described in detail by the driver — a rakish , multilingual career diamond thief — is exactly the sort of daring heist that a loosely affiliated group of 200 thieves from the former Yugoslavia has been pulling off with such frequency that Interpol has dubbed them the Pink Panthers .
Since 1999 , the criminals have stolen $ 340 million worth of jewelry in more than 160 robberies in at least 26 countries .
The Panthers have choreographed some spectacular jobs :
In 2007 , a group of men drove two cars through windows and into the forecourt of a mall in Dubai , racing out to rob a jewelry store of $ 3.4 million worth of jewels ; in 2004 two men and two women raided a jewelry store in Tokyo , smashing a display cabinet and escaping into the bustling crowds with $ 30 million in jewels , in what was the biggest grossing robbery in Japan ’s history ; in 2003 two men stole £ 37 million in jewels from a diamond store in London .
Only a fraction of those jewels have been recovered but police did find a 2.32 carat blue diamond ring hidden in a jar of face cream belonging to the girlfriend of one of the thieves , echoing a scene from the first Pink Panther movie starring Peter Sellers .
A name — and something of a legend — was born .
But behind the sheen of glamour the moniker has given these thieves lies a darker history .
Many Panthers were blooded during the Balkan wars in the 1990s , taking advantage of the ample opportunities for crime during the violent chaos in Croatia , Bosnia and Kosovo .
Along the way they learned how to work in decisive , daring teams , and to cast aside their national and ethnic differences in search of a universal goal — getting rich quick .
The wars “ were fruitful ground for them to make connections , ” said Dejan Durovic , the head of the Interpol office in Montenegro .
“ War was useful for them to build the network .
After the crisis has finished , after the war has finished , they had to continue their way of working , they could n’t do it anymore in these territories so they just transferred abroad their activities , to Europe . ”
While the Panthers pose none of the threat to European stability that the wars of the 1990s did , their anarchic , transnational crime wave is an unpleasant hangover of the wars and wildly at odds with the rules - based modern society represented by the EU , an organization that all of the former Yugoslav republics one day hope to join .
( Slovenia has already made it into the club . )
Montenegro , the smallest of the former Yugoslav republics , is home to a large number of Panthers , according to Interpol .
Many Montenegrins are proud of their warrior heritage , particularly their defeat of the Ottoman empire in the 17th century , and their independent streak showed when a majority voted for independence from Serbia in 2006 .
It ’s a shockingly beautiful country , with some of the most dramatic coastline in the Adriatic , the coastal mountains rising suddenly into a breathtaking patchwork of deep river gorges , jagged peaks and turquoise Alpine lakes .
As the economy transitions from state - run socialism to free - market capitalism , average Montenegrins still have to struggle with a per capita gross domestic product just slightly more than that of Lebanon and Botswana .
Unless you happen to be in on the influx of foreign investment in the luxury tourism industry , it can be tough to make a good living in Montenegro .
Meeting those who have been tempted to make their money in international crime rather than through hard graft at home took GlobalPost reporters many weeks to arrange .
They are cautious men who choose when and where they want to meet — usually at night , usually in a cafe or restaurant they know and usually at the last minute .
Three of the criminals were interviewed in Montenegro , one in Vienna — all on condition that their identities be protected and their names changed .
One of the four has since been arrested by police in a western European country and is now in custody there .
Yugoslav criminals were operating in western Europe even before the country fell apart in the early 1990s , but it was n’t until the Kosovo war ended in 1999 — and , with it , the highly profitable smuggling business that accompanies most wars — that the men who had bonded over the years of fighting began to look in earnest outside the region for a new revenue stream .
Over the years police officers around Europe and in other parts of the world realized they were increasingly dealing with jewel thieves from the former Yugoslavia , many with connections to each other , and in 2007 Interpol set up a multi-national team devoted to catching them .
The cops at headquarters in Lyon , France , named it Project Pink Panther .
The truth , however , is that the existence of a coherent Pink Panther gang is almost as fanciful as anything Inspector Clouseau ever nosed around in .
Interpol officials and the criminals themselves agree that the so - called gang is a loose conglomeration of separate gangs , many of whom know each other , and some of whose members are interchangeable .
“ There are several groups , ” said Nikola , the pseudonym of the driver who took part in the heist in Rome in 2001 .
“ In a group there are five or six .
Over six is too much .
If there ’s more the share is smaller .
There must be mutual confidence in each other . ”
Most jobs start with a piece of gathered intelligence , the criminals explained .
This can be as sophisticated as an insider passing on information about a jewelry store ’s security system , or as primitive as a thief noticing that a particular store has , say , a major display case near the front door and sits on a street that allows for a fast getaway .
A gang will often include a woman , who will accompany one of the male gang members into a store on a reconnaissance mission .
One criminal , a Croat who says he is now in legitimate business , recalled working with a team of Montenegrin and Serb criminals he met in Lausanne .

“ I speak French and I was able to visit various watch shops and jewelry stores , ask questions , observe and recognize the weak points of security without raising any suspicion , ” said the man , who was interviewed in Vienna earlier this year .
“ I had a girlfriend from a wealthy Viennese family and she was a perfect cover without knowing it .
Sometimes I was given money to buy her pretty expensive things like earrings or necklaces .
After a month or so those guys would storm the targets and disappear . ”
Often the heists are very primitive .
“ Any good robbery should take up to 20 seconds , ” said Zoran , a Serbian career criminal who helped supply the Bosnian Serb army with cigarettes , gasoline , alcohol and other goods during the war in Bosnia and has photographs of himself with alleged Bosnian Serb war criminals Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic .
“ In case we are dealing with sophisticated security and a strong police presence we always set up decoys or activate alarms somewhere nearby to divert attention . ”
Zoran said he has pulled off several robberies in the Netherlands .
“ The first thing I do when I arrive in Holland is I get a good car , preferably a BMW 5 Series , with a hook on the rear .
The hook is important because it helps when I drive in reverse into a jewelry shop . ”
The powerful car “ is needed to speed away and not be caught by police .
But a few times they had reinforced glass so when I hit the display window I bounced back .
That was unpleasant . ”
Zoran has a second method .
“ Another way is to have someone else wait in the car and two of us walk in a shop in fancy clothes and I carry a briefcase , ” he said .
Zoran led a reporter to another room in his house in the Montenegrin capital , Podgorica , and showed the reporter a briefcase , which Zoran then opened to reveal a large hammer with a short handle .
“ This hammer goes into the front window if we see that the displayed stuff is genuine and worth our effort , ” he said .
“ If the real stuff is inside and shown at request , then we use the hammer for the desk and table with the jewelry inside . ”
And then they run .
Durovic , the head of Montenegro ’s Interpol bureau , believes that many Europeans are unprepared for the war - nurtured nerve of the Panthers , the gumption required for smashing and grabbing during the daytime and in the heart of swanky commercial districts in cities like Monte Carlo , Geneva and Paris .
“ They can not recognize that those people have the courage to commit [ these crimes ] and they are not ready for that , ” he said .
Montenegrin Rifat Hadziahmetovic , suspected " Pink Panther " member , was arrested in Cyprus , March 31 , 2009 .
( Reuters )
Two days before the interview in September with Durovic , a group of armed men had stolen a helicopter in Stockholm and raided a cash depot in a spectacular raid .
Soon afterward , Serbian officials told journalists that they had warned Sweden that the heist was being planned .
( Eleven men , reportedly some ethnic Serbs , have been arrested by Swedish police .
The Swedish police have not released the names of the men . )
Durovic said he had no information about the robbery other than what he had read in the newspapers but he was inclined to believe at least some of the perpetrators were veterans of the Balkan wars .
“ That is something that nobody would expect — and that ’s their advantage , ” he said .
“ Probably some of them were with military experience . ”
No matter how the robberies are conducted , with a hammer or a helicopter , there ’s a level of efficiency and sophistication in the handling of the stolen goods that has police bemused .
“ We do n’t know how they do that because I would say probably many Pink Panther members have been arrested at least one time in their life but very rarely stolen goods are recovered , ” said Emmanuel Leclaire , Interpol ’s assistant director of the Drug and Criminal Organizations Directorate at headquarters in Lyon .
“ We do n’t know what are the processes to receive these jewels and watches . ”
Part of the answer sits on the muscular right wrist of Rocco , a criminal who was a friend of Arkan , the late Serbian gangster and war criminal , in the form of a glinting gold Rolex .
Rocco explained that the watch , worth $ 33,000 , was a gift from one of the Panthers in appreciation for his great work , which during an interview in the otherwise empty upstairs section in a bar in Podgorica , he explained is to “ arrange purchases of the final product . ”
Stolen watches go on the black market but jewels are taken from their moldings and reset , or cut to look different .
“ The goods are reshaped , laundered and sold into regular channels , ” he said , meaning legitimate jewelry companies .
The buyers pay between 18 percent and 25 percent of retail value , he said .
Marbella in Spain , Amsterdam in the Netherlands , and the Belgian city of Antwerp are popular desinations for stolen jewels , according to Rocco and Zoran .
Like their crimes , the Panthers can be both crude and sophisticated .
Rocco has the classic look of the mid-90s paramilitary : shaved head , multiple tattoos and a matching deep voice .
But he ’s also well - versed in European politics and Montenegrin history and has traveled extensively , including to the diamond mines of Sierra Leone .
Nikola , the driver from the Italian job , is smoother still .
He speaks fluent English and said he speaks Czech , Slovak and Polish also — and some Italian , Spanish and French .
The men often pick up languages during their spells in foreign prisons but they are also diligent students , realizing that language is a crucial tool for gathering information about a target in a foreign country and escaping safely after the robbery .
Many Panthers are big spenders .
Nikola , who described himself as a “ medium fish , ” said some of the big fish have villas in Spain and spend lavishly on cars , jewelry , gambling and prostitutes .
Nikola ’s splurge is travel .
“ When I get money I go to Brazil , to South Africa , to Kenya ” on vacation , he said .
The Panthers ’ success has turned them into folk heroes in the eyes of some Montenegrins , who complain that their own honest hard work has n’t paid dividends .
“ You can realize why guys from Cetinje are doing this , ” said Zoran Pajovic , 39 , a bar owner in the Montenegrin city that seems to produce more jewel thieves per square mile than any other in Montenegro .
Pajovic ’s bar was for many years a meeting point for pro-independence campaigners .
Now , three years after his political dream came true , his bar is quiet and his standard of living still low .
He admitted that friends in some of the gangs had offered him work .
“ Of course we were tempted , ” he said .
But it ’s a risky way to make a living .
“ Some were lucky and got away with it all their life ; others were caught immediately . ”
Zoran Kostic .
( Interpol )
Among those recently caught was former Cetinje resident Zoran Kostic , a prominent Pink Panther who was arrested in Paris in June in relation to the robbery of a jewelry store in Lausanne , Switzerland in May .
Kostic , 38 , escaped from prison in Montenegro a decade ago ( after shooting dead one of Pajovic ’s friends ) and is suspected of committing many robberies in various countries .
But when GlobalPost visited his family ’s home in Cetinje there was no sign that any of Kostic ’s wealth had benefited his loved ones .
The family lives in an apartment in the basement of an elementary school , at the end of a dark , dirty corridor , its walls covered in graffiti .
A young woman who identified herself as his sister declined to comment other than to say , “ We hope it turns out well [ for him ] but you ca n’t predict . ”
Interpol ’s success in arresting Kostic and numerous other Panthers has some of the criminals worried , even though both they and the police know that no thief stays in prison forever and that once the criminals make it to their home countries in the former Yugoslavia they cannot , according to each country ’s constitution , be extradited .
Two of the men interviewed said they felt the police were nevertheless winning this latest Balkan war .
Part of the problem , according to Nikola , is the unwanted glamour and mythological status the Pink Panther moniker has given to these criminals .
“ When they give you a name you ’re in big trouble , ” he said , as he finished up a dinner of fresh sea bass at the seaside restaurant and lit a cigarette .
“ Because every single small policeman is trying to catch you .
We lost a lot of guys because of that name .
Some of our co-workers got drunk in casinos and were bragging about it , thinking they are something .
It ’s better to be nothing .
The best criminals are those who stay out of prison . ”
Montenegro - based investigative reporter Jovo Martinovic contributed to this story .
Martinovic and McAllester have been interviewing former paramilitaries , soldiers and war criminals in the former Yugoslavia since the end of the war in Kosovo in 1999 , which McAllester covered as a staff correspondent for Newsday .
McAllester is the author of the highly acclaimed non-fiction book Beyond the Mountains of the Damned : The War Inside Kosovo .
Martinovic was a reporter on the award - winning NPR documentary , Massacre at Cuska .
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - The Taliban bombing that killed three U.S. special forces soldiers in Pakistan on Wednesday could further weaken the government and hurt U.S. efforts to win more backing in the fight against militants .
While the presence of U.S. soldiers to train paramilitary forces is hardly a secret , it is a highly sensitive matter in Pakistan , where anti-American anger runs high .
“ It will only convince the public , even moderate Pakistanis who are anti-Taliban , that the government is doing nothing expect lying to them , and the military ( is ) for that matter , ” said Ahmed Rashid , a Pakistani analyst and expert on militants .
“ It will be a big blow for public morale . ”
Wednesday ’s attack at a girls ’ school near the Afghan border is likely to generate elaborate conspiracy theories , with one simple question already asked :
Why were special ops troops attending the inauguration of a girls school anyway ?
First television channels said the dead foreigners were journalists , then officials said they were aid workers .
Only later did the Pakistani military and the U.S. embassy say they were American soldiers .
Pakistan ’s foreign ministry spokesman said the U.S. soldiers were invited by the Pakistani paramilitary Frontier Corps to attend the inauguration of the U.S. - funded project .
“ It is going to pose some problems for the Pakistani government , ” said Riffat Hussein , a professor at Pakistan ’s Quaid - e - Azam University .
“ It might even lead to some kind of questioning in the Pakistani parliament about the presence of American special forces on Pakistani soil . ”
RESOLVE OF THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN
Suspicions are likely to deepen at an unfortunate time for the United States , which sees long - time ally Pakistan as a vital in its fight against Taliban and al - Qaeda militants in Afghanistan .
Washington wants Pakistan to go after Afghan Taliban who cross the border to attack Western troops in Afghanistan , a move that could antagonize militants Islamabad has long seen as assets .
But Pakistan ’s military is already stretched against the homegrown al Qaeda - backed Taliban , which claimed responsibility for Wednesday ’s bombing .
The violence highlighted the resolve of the Pakistani Taliban and raised questions about the effectiveness of a government security crackdown launched in mid-October that destroyed the group ’s bases in their main stronghold .
It also further lifted the profile of the Pakistani Taliban , whose leader Hakimullah Mehsud appeared in a farewell video with the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA agents in Afghanistan in December .
The Pakistani Taliban have previously focused on toppling the government , not attacking U.S. soldiers , but now the United States faces the prospect of coming under further attacks from them .
NEW ALARM BELLS
The possibility Pakistan ’s Taliban may have known U.S. troops were traveling in the convoy will ring new alarm bells .
“ A lot of the bombings in Pakistan have been inside jobs .
In the sense that they have been carried out by people in the security services who leaked information to the bombers , ” Rashid alleged .
“ Is this such a case ?
If so it ’s very , very dangerous . ”
U.S. defense officials said Islamabad had in the past thrown up obstacles to expanding the Special Operations mission over fears of a public backlash , frustrating U.S. officials .
Winning more Pakistani cooperation could be even more difficult now , judging by the reaction from some Pakistanis .
“ If they were trainers what they were doing in such a sensitive region ?
They should train in a garrison instead of roaming around , ” said Syed Sajjad Ali Shah , a retired school principal .
“ Our rulers are not politicians .
They ’re money - makers .
They do n’t care what ’s happening to the country .
What ’s good and what ’s not good for the country . ”
Unpopular President Asif Ali Zardari has little room for maneuver anyway , with frustrations spreading over the troubled economy and chronic power shortages .
He could become more vulnerable if his aides , including the defense and interior ministers , are prosecuted under revived corruption charges .

DENVER 
In the last two weeks , more than 100 mostly tiny earthquakes a day , on average , have rattled a remote area of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming , putting scientists who monitor the park ’s strange and volatile geology on alert .
Researchers say that for now , the earthquake cluster , or swarm  the second - largest ever recorded in the park  is more a cause for curiosity than alarm .
The quake zone , about 10 miles northwest of the Old Faithful geyser , has shown little indication , they said , of building toward a larger event , like a volcanic eruption of the type that last ravaged the Yellowstone region tens of thousands of years ago .
The area is far from any road or community , and the park is relatively empty in winter .
Swarms of small quakes , including a significant swarm last year , are relatively common .
But at a time when the disastrous earthquake in Haiti on Jan. 12 has refocused global attention on the earth ’s immense store of tectonic energy , scientists say that the Yellowstone swarm , if only because of its volume , bears close observation : as of Sunday , there had been 1,608 quakes since Jan. 17 .
It began : " My inspiration in life is a man I met in Nigeria called Ben Kenobi .
He taught be so much about the Force that spirituality has ; it can be used for good and it can be used for bad . "
Mark Thompson , the director general of the BBC , is in discussions with Vatican officials over the pope contributing to Radio 4's Thought for the Day religious slot .
Mark Damazer , the controller of Radio 4 , revealed today that Thompson , who met senior Vatican officials in Rome earlier this month , is personally leading negotiations with the Vatican in the hope of securing a contribution from the leader of the Catholic church .
" Mark 's better qualified then me on two grounds , " Damazer said , referring to the fact that Thompson is a devout Catholic as well as being the BBC 's most senior executive .
" Mark knows of my aspiration , " he added .
Damazer joked that he would not leave his job at Radio 4 until the pope had contributed to the Today programme 's
Thought for the Day strand , which is produced by the corporation 's religious affairs department in Manchester .
Pope Benedict XVI is due to visit the UK later this year .
Thompson discussed BBC coverage of his visit with Vatican officials during his visit to Rome on 3 February .
It is not clear whether the Pope would record a Thought for the Day during his UK visit , but it is possible he could be persuaded to make a longer contribution that could be aired elsewhere in the schedule .
Damazer is also bringing back What the Papers Say as a Radio 4 show as part of its general election coverage , renamed What the Election Papers Say .
The long - running newspaper review format was dropped from TV two years ago .
He said the programme would continue after the election and may return for good if it proves popular .
Damazer 's station will also air a selection of early radio shows recorded by Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise over the coming month .
They were discovered by Wise 's wife when she moved home .
Wise bought the recordings from a BBC employee soon after they were made in the 1950s and the corporation has restored them .
" It 's comedy history and BBC history , " Damazer said .
They include performances of some sketches which would later be reprised on the duo's TV shows in their 1970s heyday .
Other Radio 4 programming highlights in the coming months include a one - off show about Byron written and narrated by comedian David Walliams and a David Hare play about Craig Murray , the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan .
Damazer also said Radio 4 will broadcast another James Bond story – Goldfinger – following its successful version of Ian Fleming 's Dr No novel .
Ian McKellan will star as Goldfinger , with Toby Stephens playing Bond .
Television historian Simon Schama has agreed to present A Point of View , which is currently in the old Letter from America slot on Friday evenings .
He is confirmed for the next three months , or 10 programmes .
Stephen Poliakoff has written Playing With Trains , a two - part play about the advertising industry , for Radio 4 .
The Now Show , the vehicle for comedians Punt and Dennis , will be renamed The Vote Now Show , for the duration of the election campaign and broadcast every Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday .
Radio 4 will also transmit a recording of Lenny Henry playing Othello , a role which won the 51 - year - old best newcomer at the London Evening Standard theatre awards last year .
What the Papers Say , which features guest journalists discussing the last week 's press coverage , was originally screened by ITV but switched to Channel 4 in 1982 and then to BBC2 in 1989 .
The BBC decided to drop the show , and the annual screening of the What the Papers Say newspaper awards , but ITV Productions , which made it , said at the time it hoped to find a new home for the programme .

Security was tight in Karachi as mourners gathered for victims ' funerals
Thousands of mourners have attended funerals for those killed in a double bomb attack targeting Shia Muslims in the Pakistani city of Karachi .
The death toll from Friday 's bombings rose overnight to 33 , with 165 injured .
A police official told AFP news agency more then 10,000 people had attended a funeral for 14 Muslim victims .
Five Christians are to be buried later .
The attacks - the second at a hospital where victims of the first attack were being treated - targeted Shia pilgrims .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appealed for calm amid fears of growing tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims .
Security was tightened in Karachi as the mourners gathered .
Pakistani TV channels broadcast images from the sports field where the bodies of 14 victims were taken , showing many people dressed in black , beating their chests and chanting religious slogans .
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Karachi has a long history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia communities .
The first of Friday 's blasts was caused by a motorbike laden with explosives targeting a bus carrying Shias to a religious procession .
Then , another bomb exploded outside the entrance to the emergency ward of Jinnah hospital , where the victims of the first attack were being treated .
Sectarian tension
The bombings happened in spite of tight security across Pakistan as Shias marked the end of the Arbaeen religious festival , with Friday the final and most important day of 40 days of mourning for the Prophet Muhammad 's grandson .
Forty days ago , during the last major Shia festival , a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers in the city .
Sectarian tension between the Shia minority and the Sunni majority rose after the December attack , and riots erupted .
Tension remains high , and paramilitary troops were deployed in the city days ago amid deadly clashes between rival political groups .
The Shia -Sunni schism originates from a dispute soon after the death of the Prophet Muhammad over who should lead the Muslims .
Sunnis remain the majority globally , with Shias estimated to number about 10 % of all Muslims .

Thanks to advanced CSS properties , such as gradients and shadows , it ’s now quite easy to turn a dull web form into something beautiful – with minimal effort .
I ’ll show you how in today ’s tutorial !
This tutorial includes a screencast available to Tuts + Premium members .
Subtle background gradients give depth to the fields while shadows lift them from the page .
Even more impressive is that this is done without any images at all .
By following this tutorial you will not only end up with a lightweight and beautiful form , you ’ll also learn and understand new CSS3 techniques , such as box - shadow , gradients , opaque colors , and rounded corners .
CSS3 ?
CSS3 is the next generation of CSS that is currently under development , but that does n’t stop browsers from already implementing many of the prominent features .
Opera has greater levels of support for CSS3 ( except background gradients ) in their next version ( 10.50 Beta ) .
Internet Explorer has also stated that they will have improved CSS3 support with version 9 ; however , only time will tell how true this is .
The things you can do with CSS3 ( shadows , gradients , round corners , animations , etc ) all serve a purpose of creating beautiful effects without having to integrate images or scripts , resulting in quicker loading times .
Step 1 : The HTML
Before we begin styling we need something to style , so here is the form .
Each field is inside a paragraph with its own class , and the three first fields have a label explaining their use .
How does it look without any styling ?

Functional , but dull .
Let ’s start pimping out this form .

Step 2 : Basic Styling
Before we dive into the CSS3 techniques we need to create a basic layout for browsers that do n’t yet support CSS3 .
How does our effort look so far ?
Not too bad .
Now , let ’s begin our enhancements with the more advanced CSS3 .
Step 3 : Box -shadow
Box - shadow does exactly what it sounds like : creates a shadow around a box .
The syntax for box - shadow is fairly simple :
Horizontal offset is the placement of the shadow from left to right .
If you set it to “ 2 px ” the shadow will be 2 pixels to the right .
Vertical offset is the same but up / down .
Blur is simply the amount of blur the shadow will have , where 0 is minimum .
This is how our box - shadow will look like :
Here we have three lines that look similar .
box - shadow is pure CSS3 and so far only used in Opera .
is pure CSS3 and so far only used in Opera .
- webkit - box - shadow is for browsers using the Webkit engine , like Chrome and Safari .
is for browsers using the Webkit engine , like Chrome and Safari .
- moz - box - shadow is for browsers using Mozilla ’s Gecko engine , like Firefox , Camino , Flock , and SeaMonkey .
Until CSS3 becomes the standard , you have to use all three methods .
Internet Explorer has their own weird way of doing things , and although it ’s capable of making a shadow it will not look the way we want it .
3
You might notice that there was no normal RGB color used , this is because we ’re using two CSS3 techniques on the same line : box - shadow and rgba .
RGBA ( Red Green Blue Alpha ) is , simply put , color with opacity .
The syntax for rgba is this :
It ’s perfectly fine to use a light grey for the shadow ’s color , but if you are using any other background than white it will look strange .
An opaque black on the other hand will work well no matter what background .
So our box - shadow is black with 10 % ( 0.1 ) opacity , no horizontal and vertical offset , and with a blur of 8 pixels .
It will look like this :
The keyword here is subtlety .
If we apply too much shadow , it will look ugly ; if we apply too little , it wo n’t have an effect .
Basically , we do n’t want anyone to notice the shadow , but still have it lift the fields from the page .
Step 4 : Background Gradient
While the box - shadow syntax is easy to grasp , gradients are trickier .
With CSS3 gradients , you can create some amazing shapes — from dart boards to rainbows — so as you can imagine it has a more complex syntax .
Thankfully , we do n’t need to code a rainbow today ; we just need a straight linear gradient .
Syntax for Webkit :
Syntax for Gecko :
As you can see , the methods are quite different , so this will require some explaining .
Webkit gradients require a start point ( X and Y ) , an end point ( X and Y ) , a from - color , and a to - color .
The angle is determined by where start and end are , and the gradient will be colored with the “ from ( color ) ” fading to “ to ( color ) ” .
Gecko gradients , on the other hand , require only a start point ( Y ) , and at least two colors .
If you want a gradient going from top to bottom ( 90deg ) you do n’t need to assign an angle .
So to get a simple linear gradient from top to bottom – black to white – we would do like this :
And it would appear like this :
( I will continue to use the black color for demonstration ; at the end , I ’ll switch to the real color we will be using for the form . )
Now that we have the basics out of the way , we can start making the form look how we want .
The first thing we want to do is limit the height of the gradient so that it looks the same for both input fields and textarea ; otherwise the gradient would fill the entire height , like this :
This is how we limit the background gradient to 25px in Webkit and Firefox :
For Webkit , instead of setting the end point to “ left bottom , ” we set it to “ left 25 ″ , indicating it will end 25 pixels from the top .
For Gecko , we do the same thing by simply adding a “ 25 px ” value to the end color .
And the result is :
The second thing we want to do is create a thin white line at the top of the gradient , to give the subtle visual impression that the field is raised .
How important can a single pixel be ?
Take a look at this article : Adding Depth with Pixel Perfect Line Work .
To create this , we ’ll need three points in the gradient .
In the previous example , our gradient had two points : top and bottom ( black →white ) .
Here , we ’ll add an additional point in between them ( white→black →white ) .
To illustrate :
How do we do this ?
In Webkit we use the color - stop function , but unfortunately it does n’t support values in pixels , only percentage .
But thanks to paying attention to math in school we figure that 4 % of 25 px is 1 px .
For Gecko , we simply add a third color between the first two and give it a “ 1 px ” value , indicating that it should end 1 pixel from the top .
The thin white line :
Now , let ’s change the black color ( #000000 ) to a more fitting light grey ( # EEEEEE ) :
Just some small detail work remains .
First , we ’ll create a darker shadow for the fields when the user hovers or selects it :
It ’s just an increase from 10 % to 15 % , but what we are after is , once again , subtlety .
The last thing we do is create some rounded corners for the button3 to further make it stand out from the other elements :
The value is the radius the corners will be rounded by .
The standard border - radius is intentionally left out since Opera seems to have some problem with it .
Result :
Step 5 : The Other Browsers
Now we just need to take care of the browsers that do n’t support CSS3 yet ( IE ) , or only partly does ( Opera ) .
We want the different versions ( CSS3 and the normal ) to look as similar as possible , and the simplest thing is to go back to the old way : images .
Simply take a screenshot of the beautiful CSS3 form and save a small portion of the gradient as an image .
Next , use it in the input and textarea as a background .
As long as the CSS3 gradients comes after the background image , browsers that support CSS3 will ignore the image .
And now we are done !
Enjoy your form and I hope you have learned something .

Actually , Jim Rogers did n't say that the pound will collapse in the very near future ...
It was all made up by this guy , to the right , whose company put out the following press release as what appears to have been a publicity stunt :
FT Alphaville ( Pic & Quotes ) :
Pound Could Collapse Within Weeks , Predicts Billionaire Financier Jim Rogers
February 25 , 2010 – Press Dispensary – The UK Pound is on the brink of a collapse which will herald a downturn worse than 2008/ 9 , it could well happen within weeks and the British government is powerless to prevent it .
And this in turn will foreshadow a global economic winter that could come before the end of 2010 and make the last two years seem like a mild spring day .
Rogers found the claim ' outrageous ' and rushed to correct misunderstandings with the media .
Meanwhile , the culprit , Vince Stanzione , says it was a mix up and that his company 's press release was n't meant to be sent out .
Regardless , it was great exposure for his ' Trading Day Seminar ' either way ... and a ray of attention for this self - described renaissance man :
. . . a self - made multi-millionaire based in Europe .
Beginning aged 16 at NatWest Foreign Exchange in London , he quickly made his mark and then left to form his own company , since when he has been involved in mobile communications , premium rate telephony , interactive gaming , publishing and television and financial trading .
He currently lives most of the year between Spain and Monaco and trades his own funds , mainly in currencies and commodities .
He also teaches a small number of students and produced the best - selling course on Financial Spread Betting .
Vince Stanzione is the author of ‘ How to Stop Existing & Start Living ’ and ‘ Making Money From Financial Spread Trading ’ , is the Spread Betting Expert for Growth Company Investor and writes monthly columns for The City Magazine , Canary Wharf and Vicinitee Magazine .

God gave rock 'n 'roll to you !
So US rock band Kiss chanted in the early 90s , a cover of the original song by British group Argent .
My relationship with this " divine " gift started early .
At 12 , I riffled through my brother 's vinyl collection and emerged a fan of U2 , Faith No More and Led Zeppelin .
Recently , aged 31 , I set out in my coolest headscarf to see the best live band in the world : Muse , on their Resistance Tour .
I looked around , but spotted not one of my species – an " undercover Muse - lim " , as one friend dubs me .
But there are others .
Shabana , a solicitor and mother of three , has listened to rock music for as long as she has worn a headscarf .
She has dragged her husband to a Jon Bon Jovi gig ; her son has taken up electric guitar .
" People are always surprised to find out about my rock collection , " she says .
" They take one look at my headscarf and assume I 'll be into choir music ! " I know the feeling .
So does Arub , an architecture student and Kerrang !
subscriber , who says that she and nearly all her hijab - wearing friends would rather listen to Linkin Park than shallow pop .
" Rock appeals because it rebels against the norm , it sells on the angst of not belonging – something women in hijab relate to , " she says .
" It 's the natural choice for a hijabi . "
Arub 's words strike a chord .
When , at 18 , I decided to wear a headscarf , some friends said I would belong even less to a country where I was born , bred and buttered .
But being in a minority can give confidence : I was surer of my identity and even of my Britishness .
I feel the relevance of rock instinctively as lyrics from my album collection pulsate in my head : " I will never know myself until I do this on my own . . .
I will break away , I 'll find myself today " ; " Do n't be afraid of what your mind conceives / Stand up for what you believe . "
The call of rebellion , the claim for independence : there is an affinity between rock music and those like me , Shabana and Arub – women secure in both their faith and music taste .

A mysterious X - shaped pattern of space debris seen by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope was probably two asteroids that collided , scientists said Tuesday .
The object , called P/2010 A2 , was discovered in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter by the Lincoln Near - Earth Asteroid Research sky survey , or LINEAR , on January 6 , NASA said .
The shape , and the streamers of dust shooting off of it , were photographed by Hubble on January 25 and 29 , according to NASA .
Astronomers have long thought the asteroid belt is being ground down because of collisions , but such a head - on crash had never been seen before .
" If this interpretation is correct , two small and previously unknown asteroids recently collided , creating a shower of debris that is being swept back into a tail from the collision site by the pressure of sunlight , " said principal investigator David Jewitt , from the University of California at Los Angeles .
At first , astronomers thought what they saw might be a main belt comet , a rare case of a comet orbiting while in the asteroid belt .
But the images taken by Hubble revealed the complex X - pattern of filamentary structures near the object 's nucleus .
Jewitt said the filaments are made of dust and gravel .
Some of them are being swept back by radiation pressure from sunlight , creating the long , straight dust streaks , he said .
The nucleus of the presumed boom is 460 feet in diameter , NASA said .
Asteroid collisions happen fast , with an average impact speed of more than 11,000 mph , or five times faster than a rifle bullet .
“ The hollow words “ deficits do n’t matter ” echo through my mind .
They are spoken in the arrogant tone of supposedly educated people who continue to spread their debt backed manure .
Of course they spread this manure knowing that it fertilizes their returns . ”
“ Is it possible to add money to inflate away debt in a system in which money is backed by debt ? ”
“ In a system in which money is backed by debt , what happens to the supply of money if you decrease the quantity of debt ? ”
1 . Avoid the disaster about to unfold – regardless of how we get there , by inflation or deflation , the math of debt that underlies our currency does not work .
This would break that math and preempt the negative events that are going to follow should we fail to take action .
2 . End the practice of debt backed money for our Federal Government .
Lower taxes and more productivity result .
3 . Provide direct and immediate relief for people in debt , accomplished in a way that ’s fair to everyone including those who are not in debt and without creating excessive price inflation , deflation or a giant “ moral hazard . ”
4. Provide direct and immediate compensation for those who are savers and have been damaged by past practice .
5. Provide relief for States , almost all of whom are in deep debt trouble .
6 . Cleanse the banks and financial businesses of unserviceable debts and derivatives and would ensure that they stay that way .
All banks would survive the transition , immediately benefiting from improvements in our citizen ’s balance sheets .
The same process would be used to cleanse other financial like businesses .
7. Businesses , both large and small , would immediately benefit from our citizens and the banks improved balance sheets .
8. Unfunded liabilities would immediately get better with zero percent price inflation .
9 . Limits on special interests would separate their money from politics lessening the pressure to continually increase the quantity of money .
This allows long term decision making .
Special interests associated with the banking , oil , defense , food , insurance , and other industries would no longer have their huge pull .
Thus politicians would not have to focus on spending our resources on special interests , but instead on the interests of the people .
Budget pressures would decrease as a result .
10 . States would exercise more control over their own destiny .
Lower taxes on the state level , more productivity .
Low cost money would become available to repair and upgrade current infrastructure and to build the infrastructure of tomorrow ’s commerce .
11 . The powers possessed by the central banks would be greatly diminished freeing our country and others from their methods of control via debt , now even issued worldwide by the IMF .
Countries would no longer be working to pay central banks interest .
Instead they would work to develop their own rule of law .
Their productive labors could be used to improve their own infrastructure , to feed and cloth themselves , and to build a future for themselves .
In other words , they need to be taught how to fish , not simply given a fish and asked to pay it back forever and ever .
12 . No price inflation eroding away future savings .
People who take on reasonable debt could once again make progress towards paying it off .
13 . Massively supports education , underpinning progress so that we may continue to lead the world in innovation and the production of meaningful technologies .
14 . Provides a national mission - focused on creating the energy and infrastructure of the future .
REAL and meaningful economic growth would ensue and massive new employment would result .
THE PROBLEM : All money in the United States , except coins , is created as someone ’s debt .
When our nation spends more than it takes in , a deficit is created and our government “ borrows ” the money mainly from commercial banks .
As the debt builds , so does the interest .
As the interest takes up a larger percentage of the budget , real programs get squeezed .
The latest example of the squeeze is Obama ’s announcement cancelling future manned space flights .
No more advancing the human race in space , it ’s too expensive .
NASA ’s total annual budget ?
$ 18 billion .
Amount spent on interest on just the current national debt ?
At the traditional rate of 5 % it will total more than $ 700 Billion in 2010 !
But guess what ?
While the Treasury Department reports that “ only ” $ 383 billion was spent on interest last year …
Please let that sink in .
That ’s right , this is no joke !
Yes , that chart from the Treasury is completely misleading – as in deceptive .
In fact , when all the money spent buying down interest rates is considered , we are actually spending ALL of our nation ’s income , or more , just for the privilege of using our own money system !
Consider that by the end of 2010 we will have $ 14.3 Trillion just in current debt , just at the Federal level .
“ Deficits do n’t matter , ” right ?
Yet we are seeing debt driven eventsaround the globe .
And since the end of 2008 through September of 2009 , the U.S. Federal Reserve had committed $ 6.4 Trillion just aimed specifically at programs designed to keep interest rates low !
And that is conservative , in fact it can be said that the purpose of nearly all the backstops and bailouts was to keep the cost of debt low !
This would include backstops like the one given to the FDIC to prevent bank panic from spreading … is that not in effect buying down interest rates ?
Of course it is .
Total commitments ?
More than $ 11 Trillion as of September 2009 .
If that ’s too much of a stretch for you , let ’s be really conservative and only look at the amount of money actually invested by the Federal Reserve during that timeframe to buy down rates , about $ 1.5 Trillion !
The largest section of this money went directly into buying up mortgage paper through the GSEs .
So , we spent $ 1.5 Trillion , at least , buying down interest rates , the sole purpose of which is to mask the debt load .
This is because debt saturation has occurred and at normal interest rates , the debt load cannot be supported by incomes .
That is true on all levels .
If you combine the amount the Treasury spent directly on interest in 2009 , $ 383 billion , and add it to the $ 1.5 Trillion used to keep rates low , then it can and should be said that the Treasury actually spent $ 1.88 Trillion on interest !
How much money did the Federal Government take in ?
$ 2.2 Trillion is all .
Remember , comparing debt or interest to GDP is a FALSE argument , a Red Herring .
Income is the only thing that matters when it comes to carrying debt .
$ 2.2 Trillion in income , $ 1.88 Trillion in real interest expense .
How are we looking ?
This conservative estimate means that we actually only have about $ 320 billion to spend on everything else that ’s not interest related .
States going bankrupt ?
Roads in disrepair ?
The value of your retirement falling ?
Jobs hard to find ?
People going hungry ?
According to http://www.federalbudget.com/ , this is how Congress currently spends our money .
Note that their Treasury Department expenditures exceed $ 700 Billion in 2010 , and that just the top three budget items exceed the total amount of revenue collected by our government .
That ’s without any mention of the amount spent to keep rates low .
Have you ever been trapped by logic ?
When this happens to your brain , it will know it .
Oh sure , you may try to weasel your way out , but deep inside you will know you ’ve been had .
To those who think this can reverse or that it was a one - off expenditure , you simply do not understand the exponential growth that is occurring , nor will you see the parabolic collapse that is coming .
The collapse of debt has already begun in the private sector , but the government is simply picking up that collapse and creating a parabolic growth phase of government spending and government debt .
Here it is presented in the Fed ’s own charts …
What exponential growth ?
This exponential growth : That chart spans more than the past century and is experiencing a classic parabolic blow off move that has gone quite vertical .
Parabolic moves ALWAYS collapse , it is just a matter of when .
When this curve collapses , it is going to be very painful for many people indeed .
Looking at that chart , is there anyway possible to believe the budget forecasts stating that the deficit is going to start coming down soon ?
What would that mean to the economy if it really happens at this point ?
Would the economy still be growing or would it be shrinking ?
Are those light bulbs I see coming on ?
Pretty illuminating is n’t it ?
Okay , now we ’ve seen that our outlays ( spending ) are skyrocketing , let ’s take a look at the collapse of current receipts , again our nation ’s income , but this time let ’s view it in terms of year over year change .
Here you will see a historic collapse of tax revenue on the Federal level :
The chart of outlays has moved into a parabolic blow off phase upwards , while at the same time the chart of current receipts has already peaked and is now collapsing downwards .
This , of course , is causing deficits to enter a parabolic move of their own – the Fed refers to this deficit as our “ national savings .
” The hollow words “ deficits do n’t matter ” echo through my mind .
They are spoken in the arrogant tone of supposedly educated people who continue to spread their debt backed manure .
Of course they spread this manure knowing that it fertilizes their returns .
The stench of that manure ripens further as many argue that we can simply print money without debt and that will inflate existing debt away .
That is a comical notion if you understand that it requires income to service debt and that the rate of debt expansion is far outstripping the rate of income growth .
If that math does n’t convince you that change is about to come to our monetary system , then nothing will !
Remember the housing bubble ?
“ Real estate never goes down , ” remember ?
I was one of the few who was warning about it early on , but now everyone seems to think they saw it coming .
Do you see this coming as well ?
Or , do you believe that it ’s possible to “ inflate away debt … ” even though your money is backed by debt ?
YES , absolutely the rules are going to change , that ’s exactly what I ’m saying .
But I ’m also saying that the rule changes will not be simply printing money within the same old framework .
The day after the TARP program was announced in November 2008 , I wrote a paper called Death by Numbers .
In it , I simply added up all the debts on the personal , corporate , and Federal Government levels and demonstrated how the same people are ultimately responsible for all the debt on each level to the tune of $ 303,053 per man , woman , and child in the United States – more than $ 1.2 million just for my family of four , and this did not include the debt on the state and local government levels .
People were stunned , you cannot argue the numbers , yet nothing has changed .
Besides getting worse that is .
Recently I updated the math in an article called Zombie Nation – The Rise of the Mathematical Plague .
In it I added the cost of additional debt , not counting the trillions spent bailing out mortgages in the GSEs , and showed that eachin the United States is now responsible for $ 704,530 each !
This is an impossible math situation as the average wage simply cannot support that much debt , especially when interest is considered .
Now , through demonstrating how much of our income actually goes to interest on our debt , we are demonstrating the same bad math just expressed in another manner .
But let ’s have some fun and challenge the sanity of those who believe that adding debt will cure a debt problem by asking a couple of pretty easy questions …
This is what many people are saying will happen , right ?
Of course the fact is that almost all of our money is backed by debt .
Creating more money means creating more debt .
The real question becomes how do incomes keep up with the debt creation ?
Are they ?
Of course not … Next question :
Of course the supply of money would fall !
Do you see the dilemma that is created when you back your money with debt ?
We ca n’t pay back our debts without decreasing the supply of debt backed money , and if we do that , then the economy will suffer .
But if we continue to pile on debt , then more and more of our money will go to pay interest and our economy will suffer .
Those are the choices we are presented with in our current Federal Reserve Debt based system .
ThusAnd it ’s not just us who are damned .
The entire world is built around the same clearly unsustainable system .
This begs the question , “ Why is our system built like that , and to whose benefit was it made that way ? ” I think you know the answer to that question – this current system was built around the Federal Reserve
Act that was passed in the year 1913 , and it took the money power from Congress and moved it to the private banks and bankers .
The very same interests that created this monetary conundrum are telling us “ consumers ” that we need to spend more to get their credit ( debt ) flowing again !
LAUGH OUT LOUD , that is hilarious !
Then they use the money created and the tax dollars that flow to them from us CITIZENS to buy the political and judicial systems !
Talk about irony of ironies , the money system does n’t even belong to them , it belongs to us !
We do n’t have to pay anyone for the right to use our own monetary exchange system , that notion is simply ludicrous , yet we have all been living under that system our entire lives !
Simply put , our money system was stolen from us .
We can either take it back or we can continue to swim in the manure , The globe is saturated with debt .
Adding one dollar of debt now15 cents from GDP .
The velocity of debt is zero , the debt saturation point .
Adding additional debt will only cause future defaults andemployment .
This debt saturation is causing default waves that ripple around the globe .
Subprime in the U.S. , Banks in the U.S. , Commercial Real estate , etc .
Now the debt bombs are detonating in Dubai , then Greece , in Portugal , Spain , Ireland , and even Japan .
The bombs are just waiting to explode in England , Germany , the rest of Europe , and even China .
Even if the bombs do n’t explode immediately , the debt smolders causing global economies to suffocate .
Germany is the latest to report that despite all the efforts to prevent it , their GDP is simply not growing ( neither is ours in reality ) .
Our statistics are not comparable with bygone eras .
Debt saturation has caused a phase transition and attempts to cover - up this transition have resulted in huge distortions of the truth .
Below is a chart published by SG Cross Asset Research showing their computations of net liabilities to GDP .
This includes liabilities that are off balance sheet , and they far exceed the liabilities carried on balance sheet :
Yes , our governments are insolvent .
Insolvent being a condition in which you can no longer service current debts .
That has already occurred in the United States .
That is why we resorted to “ Quantitative Easing ” and why we use several methods to artificially buy down our interest rates .
If we could have continued to borrow more money at normal rates we would have but we did n’t and we ca n’t as the stress in our debt auctions is now showing time and again .
We can show that insolvency in the math in several different ways .
Thus you are a witness to the biggest lie and accounting scandal in the history of mankind .
No , that is not an exaggeration , it is a fact , a very sad fact that we are all going to have to face one way or the other and soon .
To all those who point to this ( Democrat / Republicans ! ) and that ( bad assed unions who are ruining our country ) and claim the other thing ( banks need to lend more , lol ) regarding our economy , all I can really say is that your eye is way off the ball .
The game of debt backed money with the ever escalating interest going to private individuals is nearing an end … the mathematical outcome of the game was decided before it ever started .
If you view the current situation objectively , you will come to the inescapable conclusion that the rules of the game must change .
Who is it that is going to bring those new rules to you ?
The same people who created the current debt backed system ?
Have you heard of any solutions that address this root of the problem ?
Are you waiting to be rescued , or are you hiding in your bunker ?
THE SOLUTION : Yes , printing money without debt is an alternative , but that does n’t make the current debt go away and it does n’t bring spending back to match income .
The quantities of money required to be printed would be so vast that you would soon find yourself printing trillion dollar bills .
Another solution would be to buckle up , spend FAR less , tax FAR more , and default on current debts .
The economy will suffer hugely and for decades as a result , and in the end , with debt backing our money the result would be that eventually the same old cycle would repeat as the next debt bubble builds anew .
The inescapable conclusion is that if you live inside of a debt backed box , our nation and human kind will continue to be held back .
There is only one right answer for the long haul , for the good of our nation and of the world .
That answer is to replace the Federal Reserve Act with the provisions of Freedom ’s Vision .
This will return the money system to Congress and to the People where it belongs .
It will cleanse the debts and derivatives to lessen leverage in the economy while restoring balance sheets , not just for our Federal Government , but for States , Banks , Businesses , and Individuals .
Implementing Freedom ’s Vision will :
Many argue that such a plan is not possible or is too difficult to implement .
Some feel that collapse must happen first while others do not see the threats at all .
As I look back through history , here is what I see : I see that mankind has been making a steady march towards progress .
I see the evolution to the Magna Carta , then to our own Constitution .
I see the evolution of economic theory , although painfully slow , it has progressed from rudimentary trade , theories of self - interest , to Adam Smith ’s Invisible Hand , to an understanding of supply and demand .
I see monetary systems and their progression from sea shells , to wooden sticks , to metal coins , to gold , to paper , to digital .
Now THE major hurdle to overcome is how debt backs our money .
We CAN and we WILL overcome this obstacle .
It is the next step in the progression , a step that will be taken .
To think that we will not progress goes against thousands and thousands of years of history .
It will happen because the math of debt is forcing it to happen , it is the only logical conclusion .
Nature has a way of pointing in the right direction .
When that direction is clear , you know it , it is just , the math supports it and therefore it will last and become the next step forward for humankind .
Yes , “ it ’s the DEBT , Stupid ! ”
It time to get on with Freedom ’s Vision !
Neil Young – Rockin ’ in the Free World :
In Kenya , as hunger gradually continues to be a problem , locals are turning to any options they have available to feed them and their families .
Recently with a prevailing drought which has dried out much of the Yala swamp in Lake Victoria , the semi-aquatic Sitatunga is forced out of its natural habitat .
Due to this they have become very vulnerable to poaching and residents are quoted with saying , ‘ We ca n’t die of hunger when we have a lot of food provided by God in this swamp . ’
In Kenya , the western region is the eastern most range of the species in Africa .
Due to the high anthropogenic pressure on wetlands in the country , the antelope has continuously suffered loss of the habitat and illegal hunting , bringing its population down to the verge of regional extinction , Sitatunga is now restricted to the Wetlands of L. Victoria , Nzoia basin , Nandi wetlands and Lewa Wildlife Conservancy where it was introduced .
The Standard Newspaper reported that locals are now invading the wetland and killing the rare Sitatunga and Waterbuck .
The newspaper stated that about 4 of these animals are killed daily and sold as bushmeat in the marketplace .
Another report by Saiwa Swamp National
Park states that there are only a few hundred Sitatungas remaining in isolated populations , all of which face extinction from local threats .

the Gaza blockade , implemented by Israel and Egypt and endorsed by most governments , collectively punishes 1.5 million refugees by inhibiting education , reconstruction , health and nutrition to allow the people to break out of a vicious circle of abuse .
Hamas is cruelly and strategically using the Gaza situation to its political advantage .
Israel used the highest grade weaponry to indiscriminately kill civilians , target aid organisations and schools .
We allowed a record of 1 billion people to go hungry , while the world is producing sufficient food .
The international community ignored the widespread violence against civilians , mostly women and children .
Meanwhile the largest UN Peacekeeping force in the world was unable to make a significant difference in the world 's biggest human catastrophy .
Continued their short sighted armed interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan , plunging any country they touch , into chaos .
Further mixing humanitarian and military causes , continues to put the lives of aidworkers at stake .
Where the world 's political leaders failed to come up with a significant agreement to protect the environment .
The international community failed to execute the international arrest warrant for the Sudanese President , accused of genocide and crimes against humanity .
Non-action allowed the Darfur genocide to continue , tolerated the expulsion of a dozen NGOs on allegations of spying .
Meanwhile Khartoum arms fractions in South Sudan , preparing for a new war .
for being schizophrenic at the cost of human suffering in Sri Lanka , Afghanistan , Sudan , Zimbabwe , Ethiopia , DRC , Myanmar and so on , and so on . further monopolized the seed market , using the US government to introduce GMO food and seeds into developing countries .
Shame on Monsanto for single - handedly causing the autumn corn harvest in South Africa to fail .ex aequoThe international community failed to stop the politicization of the civil war , with the US through its proxy Ethiopia , and some Arab states through their proxy Eritrea who did nothing but put oil on the fire .
Meanwhile the donor community failed to provide sufficient aid to sustain the feeding centers and refugee camps .
The international community failed to pressure Zimbabwe 's government to provide sufficient social security , social safety nets and proper social welfare to its citizens , turning what once was the breadbasket of Sub- saharan Africa , into a well of hunger and human suffering .
The international community and the UN underestimated the level of corruption during the elections , trying to cover it up while supporting Karzai , ignoring all reports of large scale fraud .
Here are the results , sorted by number of votes :
Let 's hope that 2010 will mean a fresh start for a better year .
A year we , humanity as a whole can be proud of .
I know , I will be an optimist until the day I die ...
Two years ago the Labor Party won a decisive election victory in part by riding a public mood demanding action on climate change after years of stonewalling .
The new Government promised to spearhead world efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Today it's on the run , retreating from a surge of militant anti-climate activism that believes climate science is a left - wing plot aimed at promoting elites , wrecking the economy and screwing the little man .
What happened ?
Part 1 : Climate cyber- bullying
Australia 's most distinguished climate scientists have become the target of a new form of cyber - bullying aimed at driving them out of the public debate .
In recent months , each time they enter the public debate through a newspaper article or radio interview these scientists are immediately subjected to a torrent of aggressive , abusive and , at times , threatening emails .
Apart from the volume and viciousness of the emails , the campaign has two features - it is mostly anonymous and it appears to be orchestrated .
The messages are typically peppered with insults .
One scientist was called a " Loudmouth , arrogant , conceited , ignorant wanker " .
The emails frequently accuse the scientists of being frauds who manipulate their research in order to receive funding , such as this one to Ben McNeil at the UNSW :
" It 's so obvious you are an activist going along with the climate change lie to protect your very lucrative employment contract . "
They often blame the recipients of being guilty of crimes , as in this one received by Professor David Karoly at the University of Melbourne :
" It is probably not to ( sic ) extreme to suggest that your actions ( deceitful ) were so criminal to be compared with Hitler , Stalin and Pol Pot .
It is called treason and genocide .
" Oh , as a scientist , you have destroyed peoples trust in my profession .
You are a criminal .
Lest we forget . "
Receiving emails like these is unsettling and at times disturbing , which of course is the point .
They become worrying when they cross the line to personal threats , such as these sent to Professor Andy Pitman at the UNSW :
" There will be a day of facing the music for the Pitman type frauds ...
Pitman you are a f**king fool ! "
And this one :
" If we see you continue , we will get extremely organised and precise against you . "
When Pitman politely replied to the last , the response was more aggressive :
" F**k off mate , stop the personal attacks .
Just do your science or you will end up collateral damage in the war , GET IT . "
All threats have to be taken seriously , and at times warrant calling in the police .
The police are able to trace anonymous emails to their sources and take action against those who send them .
The police are now advising those who received abusive and threatening emails to resist the immediate urge to delete them and keep them in a separate folder for future reference .
Climate campaigners have also noticed a surge in the frequency and virulence of this new form of cyber - bullying .
The following was received by a young woman ( who asked that her name not be used ) :
" Did you want to offer your children to be brutally gang - raped and then horribly tortured before being reminded of their parents socialist beliefs and actions ?
" Burn in hell .
Or in the main street , when the Australian public finally lynchs you . "
Another campaigner opened her inbox to read this :
" F**k off !!!
" Or you will be chased down the street with burning stakes and hung from your f**king neck , until you are dead , dead , dead !
" F** k you little pieces of sh*t , show youselves in public !! ! "
Greens Senator Christine Milne told me that senators ' inboxes are bombarded every day by climate deniers and extremists , so that now they are running at least 10 to one against those who call for action on climate change .
She describes it as a " well - organised campaign of strident , offensive and insulting emails that go well beyond the bounds of the normal cut and thrust of politics " .
It was widely reported that in the days before the Liberal Party leadership challenge last November , MPs were blitzed with emails from climate deniers .
Some MPs were spooked into voting for Tony Abbott , the only one of the three contenders who had repudiated climate science .
Australia 's alternative government is now led by climate deniers .
Journalists hit
Journalists too have become the victims of cyber - bullying .
I have spoken to several , off the record , who have told of torrents of abusive emails when they report on climate change , including some sufficiently threatening for them to consult their supervisors and consider police action .
One was particularly disturbed at references to his wife .
Another received the following from someone who gave his name and identified himself as medical representative at major pharmaceutical 's company :
" You sad sack of s**t .
It 's ok to trash climate change sceptics yet , when the shoe is on the other foot , you become a vindictive , nasty piece of s**t not able to face the fact that you 're wrong about climate change and you 're reputation is now trash . "
Anonymous emails are usually more graphic .
" Your mother was a goat f**ker !!!!!!
Your father was a turd !!!!!!!
You will be one of the first taken out in the revolution !!!!!!!!
Your head will be on a stake !!
C**t ! "
Few of those on the receiving end of this hatred doubt that the emails are being orchestrated .
Scores of abusive emails over a few hours are unlikely to be the product of a large number of individuals spontaneously making the effort to track down an email address and pour forth their rage .
While some individuals act alone , increasingly the attacks are arranged by one or more denialist organisations .
It 's fair to assume operatives in these organisations constantly monitor the media and , when a story or interview they do n't like appears , send messages out to lists of supporters , linking to the comments , providing the scientist 's email address and urging them to let him or her know what they think .
One or two of the cyber - bullies have hinted at the level of organisation , with one following an abusive rant with the comment : " Copies of my e-mails to you are also being passed out to a huge network for future reference . "
Net rage and free speech
The purpose of this new form of cyber - bullying seems clear ; it is to upset and intimidate the targets , making them reluctant to participate further in the climate change debate or to change what they say .
While the internet is often held up as the instrument of free speech , it is often used for the opposite purpose , to drive people out of the public debate .
Unlike the letters pages of newspapers , on the internet anonymity is accepted and the gate - keepers , where they exist , are more lax , so the normal constraints on social discourse do not apply .
On the internet , the demons of the human psyche find a play - ground .
If a group attempts to have a considered discussion about climate science on an open forum it is very soon deluged with enraged attacks on climate science , sometimes linking for authority to well - known denialist websites .
Most scientists long ago stopped attempting to correct the mish - mash of absurd misrepresentations and lies in web " discussions " .
Is the new campaign of cyber - bullying working ?
Receiving a large number of offensive emails certainly wears most people down .
Some scientists and journalists probably do change what they say or withdraw from debate .
Others have strategies for dealing with the abuse - never replying , deleting without reading or swapping loony emails with colleagues , and cultivating a thick skin .
The effect of the cyber - bullying campaign on some scientists - including those I have mentioned - is quite opposite to the intended one .
The attempts at intimidation have only made them more resolved to keep talking to the public about their research .
Their courage under fire stands in contrast to the cowardice of the anonymous emailers .
Tomorrow : Who is behind the cyber - bullying campaign ?
Just occasionally , we feel as if we might be a little too harsh with Barney Frank .
He has , after all , been something of a singular lightning rod for many of the more adverse consequences of the housing boom .
Without question he has taken a disproportionate share of the heat generated by increasing scrutiny of Government Sponsored Entities like Fannie and Freddie .
True , he was involved directly in crafting provisions of the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Indeed , as he chairs the House Committee on Financial Services , he is uniquely exposed to all things " credit crisis " and most things " bailout . "
Yes , his loose alliance with figures like , say , Maxine Waters , tends to draw sporadic sniper fire from the trenches ( well , and sustained grazing fire from the MG42 nests ) .
And , obviously , some of the more publicly scrutinized aspects of his personal life have aligned social conservatives against the Congressman .
The combined effect of these disparate circumstances gives us pause in those moments when we begin to form our critiques of the Distinguished Gentleman from Massachusetts .
Then we come to our senses .
With the exception of the last item on our list , Frank has richly earned the ire , skepticism , dismay and disgust that has begun to plague him .
The disproportionate housing bust radiation to which he has been exposed is actually directly in line with the disproportionate level of grandstanding , aloof and arrogant presumption Mr. Frank has exhibited over all matters housing for the last two decades .
His shameless use of the " minority " and " redlining " rationales to enable his personal ( and taxpayer funded ) socio- regulatory experiments and expand his personal empire of finance policy micromanagement power makes his re-purposing of TARP language to support politically connected ( and inept ) banking ventures is the worst kind of cronyism .
His continual leveraging of his Committee chair responsibilities to expand risk and limit scrutiny over the GSEs make it easy to mistake him for the most egregious deregulators in the Republican party .
The latest news today prompts us again to assert that it is simply time for Frank to go .
In the heat of the credit crisis and as TARP was being hurriedly drafted , Frank injected language to carve in eligibility for OneUnited , a middling Boston bank facing near imminent and ignominious failure .
Some $ 12 million in bailout funds ( a pittance in the larger scheme of things ) eventually made its way to OneUnited .
In itself , this raises eyebrows .
Then again , perhaps one can dismiss as somewhat noble the efforts of a Congressman to carve out special interest exceptions for businesses in his home state .
That is , until you dig a little deeper .
OneUnited got in trouble in the first place by being heavily invested in , you might have guessed it , Fannie and Freddie .
So large were its holdings in the GSEs that when they were pressed into receivership , OneUnited 's reserves sunk below limits .
Frank originally claimed his intent in giving OneUnited special attention was to preserve one of the few ( and largest ) minority owned banks in the country .
Forgetting for a moment questions surrounding the desirability of permitting politically popular classes preferential treatment in the disbursement of crisis aid , OneUnited exposes deeper flaws in neo -Keynesian bailout theory .
Funds disbursed at the whim of politicians tend , quelle surprise , to be allocated on political criteria .
So when Frank intervenes directly , one is prompted to look for connections .
It 's a short look .
Unsurprisingly , one finds that Maxine Waters , who shares a number of legislative duties and frequent camera and mic time with Frank , has a former OneUnited director and recent ( if not current ) OneUnited stockholder for a husband .
Waters is presently entangled in a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations that she broke ethics rules to help broker a deal for the bank .
Would it surprise you to know that , though based in Massachusetts , BankUnited does most of its lending in Maxine 's home state of California ?
Probably not if you 've been reading Zero Hedge for any length of time .
How is it that a Boston bank ends up lending mostly to the multi- thousand miles distant home state of its politically connected former director and stockholder and is also mostly ( and eventually disastrously ) invested in the pet projects of one of its most senior legislative regulators that also happens to be a close colleague of that stockholders wife ?
One might ask the question " Were any of OneUnited 's major investments commercially motivated ? "
But wait , there 's more .
OneUnited is one of a subset of banks to enjoy non-cumulative dividend terms on the securities bought by the government with bailout funds .
We are certain that you will be shocked to learn that the bank ( despite showing a profit so far in 2009 ) has n't actually been paying these dividends , and that in not paying them they are automatically forgiven .
It will be seen that OneUnited has , in effect , an interest free loan from the taxpayers .
According to Congressman Frank , Congressman Frank is shocked and dismayed to learn this ( though his personal involvement in crafting the terms of OneUnited 's bespoke bailout causes one to wonder how he missed the import of non-cumulative dividends ) .
The most dismaying part of our work here at Zero Hedge is often the self - realization that narratives like these simply no longer surprise us .
Neither do reports like the one recently issued by Ran Duchin and Denis Sosyura which concludes , unsurprisingly , that connections to finance committee legislators and the Federal Reserve boards are a fairly reliable predictor for a bank 's likelihood of sucking down TARP funds .
Expect much more of the same .
WASHINGTON 
Two former employees of Blackwater Worldwide have accused the private security company of defrauding the government for years by filing bogus receipts , double billing for the same services and charging government agencies for strippers and prostitutes , according to court documents unsealed this week .
In a December 2008 lawsuit , the former employees said top Blackwater officials had engaged in a pattern of deception as they carried out government contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan , and in Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
The lawsuit , filed under the False Claims Act , also asserts that Blackwater officials turned a blind eye to “ excessive and unjustified ” force against Iraqi civilians by several Blackwater guards .
Blackwater has earned billions of dollars from government agencies in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks , when the company won contracts to protect American diplomats in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The former employees who filed the lawsuit , a married couple named Brad and Melan Davis , said there was little financial oversight of the money .
Toward an Interstellar Archaeology
Suppose a civilization somewhere in the cosmos is approaching Kardashev type III status .
In other words , it is already capable of using all the power resources of its star ( 4*1026 W for a star like the Sun ) and is on the way to exploiting the power of its galaxy ( 4*1037 W ) .
Imagine it expanding out of its galactic niche , turning stars in its stellar neighborhood into a series of Dyson spheres .
If we were to observe such activity in a distant galaxy , we would presumably detect a growing void in visible light from the area of the galaxy where this activity was happening , and an upturn in the infrared .
Call it a ‘ Fermi bubble . ’
That ’s the term used by Richard Carrigan ( Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ) in his latest work on what he calls ‘ interstellar archaeology , ’ the search for cosmic - scale artifacts like Dyson spheres or Kardashev civilizations .
A Fermi bubble would grow as the civilization creating it diffused through space .
Carrigan notes that , as Carl Sagan and others observed , the time to colonize an individual system is small compared to the travel time between stars .
An expanding front of colonization might then move forward at a rate roughly comparable to the space travel velocity .
A civilization could engulf its galaxy on a time scale comparable to the rotation period of the galaxy , and perhaps a good bit shorter .
Evidence for Artifacts ?
You might think a galaxy like the M51 Whirlpool galaxy would be ideal for such study , but Carrigan says a rough qualitative estimate shows there are no unexplained ‘ bubbles ’ at the level of 5 percent of the M51 galactic area .
The quest is tricky because spiral galaxy structure includes natural voids — even if a void in visible light with infrared enhancement were traced , it would be hard to regard it as anything other than natural .
In fact , James Annis has suggested that elliptical galaxies , which exhibit little structure , might be a better place to look for Fermi bubbles than spiral galaxies .
Whatever the case , we ’ve moved a long way from conventional SETI , listening for intentional transmissions from other civilizations .

Where else could we turn in the study of interstellar archaeology ?
Theoretically , synthetic or unnatural constituents in an exoplanet atmosphere could one day show us a sign of ETI .
We ’re already managing to study the atmospheres of particular gas giants , but thus far we lack the spectral sensitivity to clearly identify atmospheric signals of life or intelligence .
A better bet might be stellar spectral signals , looking for example for signs of nuclear fission waste products that have been disposed of inside a star .
More intriguing still is the idea of spectral modulation in stars nearing the end of their lives .
Writes Carrigan :
… in the red giant phase Earth will most likely be swallowed as the sun expands .
On the other hand if there was some possibility of life continuing the situation might engender a spirit of grand engineering and also an urge to communicate .
In many cases the red giant environment generates varying maser signals .
Modulation could emerge from dust clouds … moving and transforming in the spirit of weather systems on the Earth .
( “ Dust clouds ” here is used to describe dust clumps around a star . )
Modulation could also arise from linking the magnetic field from a Jupiter - scale planet and the stellar equivalent of the solar wind .
Dyson Spheres as Markers
As to those Dyson spheres , their use would greatly expand the useful area for activities for any culture that could build them , absorbing most or all visible light and re-radiating the energy of the star at lower temperatures .
Various searches for infrared excesses around visible stars –hoping to target a partial Dyson sphere , perhaps a ring — have been attempted , but no candidates emerged from searches of several thousand stars .
Even a pure Dyson sphere , completely surrounding its star , is a tricky catch because there are natural objects that mimic it , especially since dust clouds surround stars as they are born and as they die .
Carrigan used data from the IRAS spacecraft ’s database of low resolution spectra , discarding objects that had been previously well categorized and narrowing the sample to sixteen sources that he calls ‘ mildly interesting . ’
The result :
Only three of these had relatively low spectral statistical fluctuations .
All of the sixteen sources have some feature which clouds their identification as a Dyson sphere .
In practice , most of the LRS candidates have higher temperatures and just do n’t look much like the spectrum expected from a Dyson sphere .
The search suggests that there are few if any even mildly interesting candidates within several hundred light years of Earth .
What can we do to sharpen the search for objects like Dyson spheres ?
Carrigan adds :
…a Dyson sphere does not require intent to communicate on the part of a civilization .
The current detection reach is comparable to a SETI search .
However there is a problem of confounding signatures from mimics such as carbon stars .
Searches for potential Dyson spheres would be sharpened by developing more realistic pictures of construction scenarios including such factors as time to build and approaches to stability …
Finally it would be interesting to consider how stellar evolution might stimulate the necessity of such large scale structures with a view to looking at candidate objects in the later stage of evolution along the main sequence .
A Parallel Track for SETI
When we contemplate the kind of structures or effects sought by the interstellar archaeologist , we acknowledge they demand technologies so far beyond our own that their construction seems all but miraculous .
We can look for Dyson spheres , for example , but scarcely imagine how a culture could build at this scale .
But these are limitations of our own state of development , and they do n’t keep us from extrapolating to what civilizations far older than our own might be capable of developing .

Would we be able to detect signs of interstellar engineering in such an object ?

As we supplement existing SETI searches with the search for interstellar artifacts , we have much to do to separate natural signatures from possible signs of intelligence , but engineering on a stellar or even galactic scale should be observable if our imaginations give us a serious hint of what to look for .
The paper is Carrigan , “ Starry Messages : Searching for Signatures of Interstellar Archaeology ” ( preprint available ) .
Highly recommended especially for its overview of current scholarship on the subject , including the fascinating work of James Annis and his search for Kardashev Type III civilizations .
Note this on Annis ’ work :
The distribution of galaxies on a plot of galactic optical brightness or luminosity versus the maximum rotation velocity or radius of the galaxy follows a fairly consistent pattern .
Cases lying below the typical galactic trend line reflect visible light that has been absorbed and emitted somewhere else in the electromagnetic spectrum .
Annis examined existing distributions for spiral and elliptic galaxies and looked for sources below the normal trend lines where more than 75 % of the visible light would have been absorbed .
No candidates were found in a sample of 137 galaxies .
From this Annis inferred a very low probability of a Type III civilization appearing that would be found using this search methodology .
But Carrigan goes on to say :
With more recent information it is possible to extend the search to samples that are considerably larger and also more robust .
It may be time to revisit this possibility .
In particular with a sample ten to one hundred times larger one could examine the nature of a handful of outliers in more detail looking for any unique features such as a higher than normal infrared component .
These outliers might be candidates for a radio SETI search .

SpaceX 's debut Falcon 9 rocket stands atop its launch pad at Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in late Feb. 2010 for final tests ahead of its maiden test flight .
A new rocket built by a California - based company tolaunch commercial spacecraft on cargo trips to the International Space Station forNASA is poised atop its Florida launch pad for some final tests .
The two - stage Falcon 9 rocket built by Space ExplorationTechnologies ( SpaceX ) was hoisted into vertical launch position at the CapeCanaveral Air Force Station Saturday in preparation for its maiden test flight laterthis year .
The company is one of two firms contracted by NASA to provideunmanned cargo shipments to the spacestation on commercially built spaceships .
The medium - lift Falcon 9 rocket is the second boosterdeveloped by the Hawthorne , Calif . - based SpaceX , which was founded by PayPalco - founder and entrepreneur Elon Musk .
The company ?s smaller Falcon 1 rocket completed itssecond successful launch into orbit last year .
It was the fifth launch of aFalcon 1 , which suffered three failures before hitting success on try numberfour .
A Malaysian satellite rode the fifth Falcon 1 rocket to orbit in lastsummer ?s flawless launch .
Liftoff of the first Falcon9 rocket is expected to come sometime in the next few months , possibly byMay , SpaceX officials have said .
But the final launch date hinges on successfulsystems and engine checks .
Fueling rehearsals , called a wet dress , and a short , 3.5 - second static test firing of the Falcon 9?s first stage engines are thenext major milestones .
? SpaceX has not set specific dates for wet dress or static fire as [ the ] schedule will be driven by the satisfactory completion ofall test objectives and a thorough review of the data , ?
SpaceX officials said ina Sunday update .
This is not the first time SpaceX has hauled its 180 - foot ( 55 - meter )
Falcon 9 rocket vertical atop its launch pad .
The company assembledand moved its first Falcon 9 to pad in January 2009 as part of integrationtests .
But this year SpaceX aims to launch its first Falcon 9missions .
The rocket is designed to haul SpaceX?s unmanned Dragonspacecraft , which the company plans to use to fly 12 cargo missions to the spacestation under a $ 1.6 billion contract with NASA .
Another company , Virginia - based Orbital Sciences , isbuilding its own Cygnus spacecraft and the Taurus 2 rocket to launch eight unmannedcargo flights to the space station under a separate $ 1.9 - billion contract .
Both companies have expressed an interested in modifyingtheir vehicles to carry astronauts .
NASA is banking on commercialspacecraft arising to ferry astronauts to orbit since its Constellationprogram in charge of replacing the shuttle fleet with new rockets and vehicleswas cancelled earlier this month .
The chief executive of gay rights group Stonewall today claimed it was " very difficult to recommend " that anyone from a minority community complain to the Press Complaints Commission , after its ruling on Jan Moir 's Stephen Gately column .
Ben Summerskill , a former Observer journalist , criticised the PCC 's role as the press industry 's self - regulator over Moir 's Daily Mail article , a piece that he described as " dancing on the grave of a prematurely dead young man " .
However , the PCC chairman , Peta Buscombe , defended the regulator , saying it came down on newspaper editors " like a ton of bricks " over individual discrimination .
Buscombe admitted the Moir column " just failed to cross the line " in terms of breaching the PCC 's code of practice , adding that she had " huge sympathy " for Gately 's civil partner , Andrew Cowles , who made the complaint .
The PCC rejected the complaint from Cowles , but admitted in its ruling that it had been " uncomfortable with the tenor of the columnist 's remarks " .
" The difficulty people have with the PCC is it says that it regulates decency and of course it 's self - regulating , " Summerskill told BBC Radio 4's Today programme .
" We would n't allow investment banks to say , ' do n't worry about auditors , we 'll self - regulate ' , or mining companies to say , ' do n't worry about health and safety , we 'll look after ourselves ' .
" And I think we have got to a position where it 's very difficult to recommend that anyone from a minority community makes a complaint to the PCC . "
However , Buscombe rejected this claim .
" In terms of discrimination , he [ Summerskill ] suggested maybe people who feel discriminated against should n't come to the PCC , that is entirely wrong , " she told Today .
" Where it 's questions of individual discrimination , we actually come down on editors like a ton of bricks , indeed we did a month ago in relation to someone who had had gender reassignment . "
She said the Daily Mail – whose editor , Paul Dacre , chairs the editors ' code of practice committee that writes the newspaper industry guidelines enforced by the PCC but is not on the commission itself – was " nowhere near this " .
She also defended the system of self - regulation : " It works because this is regulation that is independent of the state and we are therefore flexible and free to be able to consider important things like freedom of expression , which in a free society sometimes creates unpleasant articles which create rigorous debate .
" We respond to that debate and indeed the fact that we are talking about it this morning means that we can have legitimate criticism , editorial judgement can be questioned and I think that 's absolutely right . "
She said the watchdog 's decision had been made by 17 people " thinking about these issues very hard " .
" A lot of this has to do with context and this very important principle we had to face : the extent to which newspapers ' columnists should be free to publish what many will see as unpalatable and unpleasant stories , " she said .
" It was difficult because the commission found it in many areas extremely distasteful and we had strong debate in some areas . "
There was especially fierce discussion around the issue of the article 's timing , a day before Gately 's funeral in October , something for which Moir later apologised .
Buscombe said there had been another recent example of a private individual 's death where a complaint had been upheld , but Gately 's case was felt to have been sufficiently public , after " acres of comment " about his life and death , to have justified the Mail 's decision to publish .
" It just failed to cross the line , " she said , adding that the PCC had " huge sympathy " with Cowles and appreciated he had brought the complaint .
Separately , the Crown Prosecution Service has decided there is " insufficient evidence " that Moir 's article breached the law .
After two complaints , the Metropolitan police passed the article to the CPS to see if it had broken any laws .
" Having considered that material I have decided that there is insufficient evidence that any offence has been committed , " Tony Connell , the CPS London complex casework lawyer , said last night .
" In coming to this conclusion I have paid particular attention to article 10 of the Human Rights Act , which protects individuals ' freedom of expression .
It is an established legal principle that this freedom applies equally to information and ideas that are favourably received as to those which offend , shock and disturb .
" Though the complainants and many others found this article offensive , this does not make its publication unlawful . "
Peter Tatchell , the co-founder of gay rights group OutRage ! , called for the PCC to be disbanded .
" By failing to uphold its own standards and enforce its own code of practice , the PCC has demonstrated that it is unwilling , unable and unfit to regulate newspapers .
We need a new press regulator with principles and teeth . "
He said Moir 's article had been factually inaccurate to claim Gately 's death was " unnatural " or " lonely " , while her claim that it represented " another blow to the happy - ever - after myth of civil partnerships " was , he said , " just a cheap homophobic jibe at Stephen and the gay community " .
" If Jan Moir had made similar comments about a black or Jewish person , and disparaged their race and community , the PCC would have ruled against her .
" She may well have been arrested and charged with inciting racial hatred .
Why is the PCC adopting double standards on homophobia ?
" This ruling brings the PCC into disrepute .
It 's another nail in the coffin of this discredited , feeble institution .
The PCC is past its sell - by date .
It should be replaced by an independent statutory body with real power and principles . "

No blockhead - Finance Minister Jim Flaherty laughed off the incident
A Canadian minister was lucky not to get a frosty reception after he wrecked part of an igloo built by Inuit to welcome officials to a G7 summit .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty was felled when the block of packed snow , weighing up to 20 lb ( 9kg ) , crashed down as he crawled out of the shelter .
The archway slab on the igloo , in the northern town of Iqaluit , collapsed as it got snagged on the hood of his coat .
The sealskin - clad builders of the snow house said they would quickly fix it .
' Deconstructing '
" I 'm deconstructing here , " an unscathed Mr Flaherty said , keeping his cool as he emerged from the igloo , which had been erected just hours earlier .
The structure was set up on the sidelines of the weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations to welcome delegates .
" I do n't have anything against these G7 people or anything .
We want to welcome them , " one of the igloo's builders , Pitseolak Alainga , told Reuters news agency .

Advertisement Iceland could become a " journalism haven " if a proposal put forward by some Icelandic MPs aided by whistle - blowing website Wikileaks succeeds .
The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative ( IMMI ) , calls on the country 's government to adopt laws protecting journalists and their sources .
It will be filed with the Althingi - Iceland 's parliament - on 16 February .
If the proposal succeeds it will require the Icelandic government to consider introducing legislation .
Julian Assange , Wikileaks ' editor , told BBC News that the idea was to " try and reform Iceland 's media law to be a very attractive jurisdiction for investigative journalists " .
He has been in Iceland for a number of weeks and is advising MPs on the IMMI .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The hope is that journalist - friendly laws will encourage media businesses to move to Iceland .
" If it then has these additional media and publishing law protections then it is likely to encourage the international press and internet start - ups to locate their services here , " Mr Assange said .
He believes the political mood in Iceland is receptive to the need for change .
" The Icelandic press has itself suffered from libel tourism , so there does seem to be the political will to push this through . "
Wikileaks is a non-profit website that has established a reputation for publishing leaked material .
In October 2009 , it posted a list of names and addresses of people said to belong to the British National Party ( BNP ) .
Other high - profile documents hosted on the site include a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta , a document that detailed restrictions placed on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
It recently had to suspend operations because of a lack of funding .
Legal threats
The IMMI aims to pull together good practice from around the world and incorporate it into a single body of law .
" We 've found good laws in different countries but no country that has all of these laws put together , " said Mr Assange .
The proposal has been informed by Wikileaks ' experience in fighting legal threats to publication .
We do n't want to be the Vikings of transparency in the way the bankers presented themselves
Birgitta Jonsdottir
" In my role as Wikileaks editor , I 've been involved in fighting off many legal attacks , " Mr Assange said in an e-mail .
" To do that , and keep our sources safe , we have had to spread assets , encrypt everything , and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions .
" We 've become good at it , and never lost a case , or a source , but we can't expect everyone to go through the extraordinary efforts that we do . "
Measures in the IMMI include legal protection for sources and whistleblowers and the protection of communications between sources and journalists .
' Transparent nation '
The proposals also include steps to end so - called " libel tourism " , the practice of pursuing libel actions in the most favourable legal jurisdiction irrespective of where the parties are based .
But legal threats are faced not just by journalists , but by publishers , internet hosts and other " intermediaries " , Wikileaks said .
As a result , the proposals include plans to clarify the protection for " mere conduits " .
Griffin says leaked BNP list fake Palin e-mail hack details emerge Wikileaks has been working with a small group of Icelandic legislators on the issue .
One of the proposal 's supporters , Birgitta Jonsdottir of The Movement , a political party with 3 MPs in the Icelandic parliament , told the BBC that she was confident the measure would become law .
" From what I have experienced from discussions with MPs from all the different parties , there is incredible good will , " she said .
But the troubles of the financial sector may lead some Icelanders to be sceptical of efforts to transform their country and Ms Jonsdottir is aware of the need not to make exaggerated claims , " We do n't want to be the Vikings of transparency in the way the bankers presented themselves , " she said .
But Ms Jonsdottir believes that making a strong statement in favour of freedom of expression could be a way for Iceland to create a positive new identity .
" There are still very many Icelanders who feel ashamed .
I think it is part of the self - recovery we have to go through , " she said .
' Positive support '
At a meeting with a small group of Icelandic MPs about the IMMI , to which the BBC had exclusive access , Mr Assange stressed how Iceland 's image would benefit from becoming a champion of free speech .
For example , one of the proposals calls for the creation of The Icelandic Prize for Freedom of Expression which " promotes Iceland and the values represented in this proposal " .
It seems the Icelandic proposal is going to pull all those laws together and put them in one place
Julian Assange
Whether arguments like that are persuasive enough to convince a majority of Iceland 's legislators remains to be seen .
Mr Assange says that at present around 14 MPs are known to support the proposal .
There is also interest in the IMMI among some members of the Icelandic government .
The Icelandic Minister for Education Culture and Sports Katrin Jakobsdottir told the BBC that she thought that " the general idea was good " and said that she thought that it " might get positive support " .
But she stressed that it was very early days and that the changes would involve many ministries .
She said that elements of the proposal coincided with changes to media law currently being considered by her department .
But not everyone is convinced of the need for an Icelandic " journalism haven " .
Andrew Scott Senior , lecturer in law at the London School of Economics and a critic of the need for extensive libel reform in the UK , said that caution was needed .
" The provisions allowing defendants to counter - sue ' libel tourists ' in their home courts could transform the humble Icelander into a legal superman , virtually untouchable abroad for comment written - and uploaded - at home , " he said .
" Its debatable whether such laws are ever appropriate . "
His view is not shared by Mr Assange .
" We have received approximately 100 legal threats in the past 18 months so we are keen to see legislation that protects the press and quality reporting " , he said .
At present Wikileaks operates in a number of different jurisdictions to " take advantage of good laws , " he said .
" It seems the Icelandic proposal is going to pull all those laws together and put them in one place . "

The mayor of Vallejo , California is Osby Davis and he ’s a conservative Christian .
That ’s an issue only because he ’s bringing his church teachings into the political sphere .
A couple weeks ago , he was quoted in the New York Times :
… Mr. Cloutier was defeated — by only two votes — by Osby Davis , a devout Assemblies of God follower .
“ I do n’t know what the fear is about considering Vallejo as a city of God , ” Mayor Davis said .
If believed , he said , “ that God created heaven and earth and everything that ’s in it , and that God is sovereign , then you believe that he is already a part of this community and this is already his city ; and so what ’s the big deal ? ”
Mr. Davis thought the question asked about the Folsom Street Fair was “ really , really unfair . ”
But his faith does inform the way he sees gay people .
“ They ’re committing sin and that sin will keep them out of heaven , ” he said .
“ But you do n’t hate the person .
You hate the sin that they commit . ”
So Davis managed to tear down any wall of separation between church and state .
And he condemned the GLBT community to hell .
Not bad for two paragraphs of work .
Davis later apologized about his anti-gay remarks .
( He must have forgotten ; you ’re not supposed to say those things out loud ! )
The NYT has released both a transcript and audio of the original interview to provide a greater context .
It turns out Davis said a number of disturbing things , and the NYT did him a favor by limiting what they quoted .
Davis just kept digging his own hole deeper and deeper … the Q( uestioner ) is NYT columnist Scott James :
Q : I think the concern has to do with some phrase that I ’ve heard that people want to make Vallejo into a , quote , “ City of God . ”
That seems to be the sticking thing , that possibly what some people have in mind is a theocracy , ripping down the division between church and state .
A : I do n’t know what the fear is considering Vallejo a “ City of God . ”
If you have the faith that we have and believe God created heaven and earth and everything in it and God is sovereign then you believe that he is already a part of this community and this is already his city , so , what ’s the big deal ?
Q : I think the big deal is that the version of God is a Christian God .
A : Well , that ’s our faith .
Our faith is a Christian God .
Someone else ’s faith might be a Muslim whose god is Allah , but does that mean we shrink back from exercising our faith because our faith is not consistent with someone else ’s ?
No it does not .
It means that we can exercise our faith right along someone exercising theirs .
If we as a Christian faith community want to consider this as a city of God , who is it hurting ?
The principles upon which a city of God would stand are principles of love , mercy and grace so I do n’t see how that in and of itself would hinder anyone else ’s ability to call a city whatever they want to call it .
Love , mercy , and grace ?
Right … unless you ’re gay .
The fact that Davis managed to barely eke out a political victory should just give us all the more incentive to support advocates of church / state separation who run for political office , regardless of their faith .
This man is a lawsuit waiting to happen .

The " Pants on the Ground " phenomenon has infiltrated the Canadian government -- where one member of the legislative assembly broke out in song to attack a member from a rival political party .
It all went down Friday morning inside the New Brunswick Legislature -- when veteran politician T.J. Burke used " General " Larry Platt 's theme song to explain how an opposition member had been caught with his " pants on the ground " during a recent radio interview .
In our series of viewpoints from African journalists , Sola Odunfa considers whether Fela Kuti 's song Suffering and Smiling still rings true for Nigerians .
You have to live in Nigeria to get a feel of what it really means and takes to be resident here .
Reading media reports or watching TV does not and cannot convey a vivid picture of the suffering the people are undergoing .
The late music icon Fela Anikulapo - Kuti said that Nigerians were Suffering and Smiling .
They laughed and danced to the throbbing Afrobeat rhythm .
That was more than a decade ago .
Hot air Are Nigerians still suffering ?
YES .
Smiling ?
Definitely NO .
We have not had light for three days now and our generator has broken down
Sola Odunfa 's sister
Even the parasitic politicians in the capital , Abuja , can no longer afford to smile , at least not outside their homes .
I phoned my younger sister on the outskirts of Lagos just before I sat down to this letter .
Normally the question " How are you ? " would elicit the response : " Thank you , we are managing . "
But times have changed .
" Bros , " my sister said bluntly , " things can not be worse -o!
God will punish all those people who have brought this suffering on us .
They and their children will not ... "
I interrupted : " Ah sister , curses ?
You can not do that .
Have you forgotten that we are in Lent ? "
Nigerians are sick and tired of fuel and power shortages
" Bros , " she retorted , " I could not sleep last night and the night before .
At about two o'clock my daughter came into my room .
You know she needs to sleep well at night to be able to leave for work by six in the morning , but when she came into my room sweat was streaming from her neck .
I too was fanning myself with a magazine .
" We have not had light for three days now and our generator has broken down .
The air from outside is hot .
" Bros , I must confess to you that for about five minutes last night my daughter and I were competing for curses on this useless government . "
Working late
If only she knew that there was no electricity in my area all through last month , not to mention the nationwide fuel scarcity which grounded our generators .
Ice - cold water has become a luxury for the man in the street
And when power was , mercifully , restored it came intermittently for only one week .
Now we have electricity for one or two hours every other day .
Meanwhile the average temperature daily is approaching the thirties with high humidity .
Ice - cold water has become a luxury for the man in the street .
People are sweating both indoors and outdoors day and night .
In Lagos many more residents sleep outdoors now .
An electric fan here is a non-functional piece of furniture in homes .
Office workers who have the privilege stay late at work , not because they want to increase productivity but to enjoy the air conditioning .
Even they too are complaining loudly and are raining curses on those they believe are making life more difficult for them .
Lying prostrate
Who is not cursing in Nigeria today ?
Tens of thousands of young graduates are currently being released into the saturated labour market at the end of the compulsory one - year national youth service .
Nigeria is the eighth largest oil exporter but cannot supply its people with power
They are told at their passing - out parade to seek self - employment because there are no jobs for them out there .
Self - employment without capital or experience ?
They will end up in the army of unemployed youths roaming the streets .
Curses , curses everywhere and by everybody .
Honestly I do not know who the targets of those curses are .
Nigeria as a nation is lying prostrate .
Wasted curses ?
If we are to believe media reports President Umar Yar 'Adua too is lying prostrate in Saudi Arabia where no - one , except his closest family members , has been allowed to see him since 23 November last year .
The terrible twins called Suffering and Cursing are not in a hurry to leave
They say the Nigerian leader is under the care of the Saudi king 's personal security guards and no - one may see him without their permission .
So , the man seems to be impotent - curses on him are wasted .
Luck has re-designated the vice - president as Acting President Jonathan .
The office was thrust on him without any effort on his part .
Nigerians will be unfair to direct their curses at him at this time .
However once he has served long enough to take responsibility for the state of the nation , campaigns will be in high gear for the next presidential election .
The one - time fisherman 's parents knew one or two things when they christened him , Goodluck !
In spite of all that , the curses can not be mere hot air .
On Ash Wednesday last week , a warning rang out in churches around the country : " Those who steal and they who defraud others , God will judge . "
The congregations responded : " Amen , Lord have mercy upon us . "
Verily , verily I say unto you , the terrible twins called Suffering and Cursing are not in a hurry to leave Nigeria .
Thanks for your comments .
Please read a selection below : what will you say again no electricity but NEPA bills are coming every month .
SOLA , cursing and smiling na be yam .
JOHNNY , kano Sola ...
You 've summarized our dear country and Fela was a soothsayer I 'll give him that .
Nigeria has n't just gone downhill but it's now under the hill .
What pains me the most is that our upcoming generation are diligently following in their footsteps .
It starts from students politics , they embezzle out rightly and no one is there to call them to order .
So the thought is , if I can do this now and go scot free why stop .
We need to rebrand our mindset and with that arm ourselves with the right ammunition to kick those lying , thieving and corrupt leaders we have who parade themselves as martyrs .
Iyorshase Mbapinen , Makurdi , Nigeria I have read the article and the comments made .
Nobody have written lies .
We pray everyday but the situation seems to deteriorate .
Am a student that is scared of the Future .
God help us !
Enamerherhe Donald , Delta state University
Whenever I call a friend or family to find out how they are , the only thing I hear is ' I am fine , it 's only hunger ' , ' The heat hear is horrible ' , ' John was involved in an accident in Lagos - Benin express road ' , ' Armed robbers went to Mrs Adekunle 's house ' , ' They found a dead body near Festac Junction ' .
Na wah oh .
Whwn will we begin to hear good things from our relatives .
This sort of thins discourage people from going back .
I plan to go back home sometime , but I will delay it as much as possible .
Nocho , London Rubbish !
I can better that .
My mother house had no light for almost 3 months , and yet without fail every month she received an electricity bill .
When I enquired why she paid she said she was scared of being disconnected .
Sola , Beckenham , UK I left Nigeria a few months ago to join my husband .
On arrival , passing a fuel station , the first thing my 3 - year - old son said was " Mummy they are selling fuel and there is no queue " .
In order to get him to bed we have to switch off all the lights and tell him NEPA has taken light .
Everyone , including children knows what it means to live in Nigeria .
But that is not the end of the road us , Nigeria is a blessed nation , God has made it so .
For these blessings to be made manifest in the lives of the average Nigerian , I think we should seek the face of God and pray more for our leaders .
Very difficult I know , but possible .
The government has all it takes to provide basic necessities like light , water , good roads , shelter , hospitals etc .
These are luxuries to the average Nigerian that curses will not provide .
If God has blessed a nation no man can curse it , not even bad leaders .
So let us do one thing , PUSH - Pray Until Something Happens .
Meg , San Antonio , Chile
If Fela were alive , he would have rained tons of more potent curses on our corrupt political elite .
Truth -
Having a conscience is extinct .
Many a time , in the middle of an internet chat with friends , they seem to go offline suddenly .
I get angry ... They return to say it was a powercut .
They remind me , " Have you forgotten ? "
We 'd love to speak better of our country out there and not paint out some facade .
Nigerians are one of the most enduring homo sapiens on the planet but for how long will these continue ?
Emmanuel , Windhoek , Namibia
Why would we not suffer and Smile , Like Sola said , when fela was singing , we were dancing , we did not take it as a cue to stand up for whatever rights we had left , now look .
One things if for sure , the ruling class only think of themselves , because they are taking us for granted , until we show them that we ( the People ) are what democracy is all about .
This will all continue .
Gabriel , Lagos , Nigeria Sola , you are doing a great job .
suffring is a national anthem in Nigeria to day .
My whole body has become heat rashes because of no power supply .
Thompson idagu , Lagos Nigeria suffer and smiling went to suffer and grin , now we are close to suffer and cry .
fred , holland
The truth of the matter is that Nigerians are yet to define what they want as pretence and sentiments beclouds our sense of reasoning .
To me , the worst part in Nigeria been faced with electricity problem is kano State .
A place where you eat , sleep and dream of generator noise and fumes .
Amana Akoh , kano , Nigeria Nigeria , is simply defined as land of paradoxes .
First , we produce crude oil but buy its end products .
Second , we die aloud yet keep silent inside .
How come we swim in blessings and sweat with curses ?
Time is now !
Talk , seriously , is cheap !
Michael Irene , London I guess we 've been cursing since the Babangida days , and it has only grown worse .
Maybe we should stop cursing , mobilize people and take proper actions .
Ogundipe Olusegun , Brussels
Thanks 4 d opportunity to contribute , u see d words suffering and smiling in - sha Allah it will end one day but d truth of d matter is that d so called PDP is satanic agent have nothing to offer dis country , they all know d people that are capable , inteligent and have wisdom to govern us but they will denying them .
Honestly if Baba himself i mean Asiwaju were to be giving only two years u will see that Nigeria will be better than London that we are all running to .
Anyway any hw they run d affairs of dis country God will always see us through
Murtala abdul waheed , Ilobu osun Nigeria I totally subscribe to sola view .
Nigerians are suffering and smiling , fela kuti is a prophet and everything he was saying about Nigeria and It 's government then were right .
Fela speak for the people , because Nigerian were afraid to stand against their corrupt leaders .
And because Fela was a brave man and he sacrifice a lot to the goodness of Nigerian nation .
up till now nothing still work in that country called nigeria .
It is only in Nigeria that people sample and sale things in high way and the authority even patronise them .
Paul Chibuzor Anyaorah , Huesca Spain Sola , you actually write for most of African states , what ever happens during birth , that we always end up with such bad leaders .
We never seem to get anything right its amazing .
Nigeria produces oil and has not fuel , Kenyan leaders feast on donor money meant for children and patients .
what happened to our morals ?
Dee Rwigi , nairobi , kenya I may sound like a mad man but i feel it is high time we hand ourself back to the europeans for recolonization
Abdulfatah Odua , Maiduguri , Nigeria i refuse to agree with you sola .
you are always painting this country black .
mention how many people run their mouth and pen castigating their nations in the media .
its only you .
we are not worse than other nations .
our country has its challenges , but we will get out of it .
i have faith that when the population decide to believe God and put the right people in charge things will change .
but pls we are not the only ones passing tru these challenges , Sola if i may ask you , did you have light in your village when you were born ?
we must not be like europe , they did not become what they are in one year .
it took years of challenges and commitment , which we dont have here in Nigeria .
i rest my case
asieco , akure , nigeria
The wickedness of our leaders will never allow them to 0ffer anything good to the ordinary man .
Dozie Aniobi , Enugu Nigeria
I agree with Sola .
Now , it 's ' suffering and cursing . '
Next phase , ' complacency and siddon look syndrome . '
Finally ' fire on the mountain , run run run ' Enough is enough .
Francis , Okobo I live in Ukraine which is nowhere close to ' MY ' oil - rich Nigeria in terms of resources and abundant manpower .
But since my arrival I 've never seen anything like that power black - out am so used back home .
Ukrainians have ' nothing ' to sell to the world unlike Nigeria : but are living comfortably far ahead of most Nigerians .
In as much as I want to see my parent and friends during my summer break due in July I feel discouraged .
Munzali Sunusi , Kiev , Ukraine Sola 's story gives me the creeps !
It sounds like the description of the place " hell " where we are told is a place of darkness where people will be screaming and cursing .
We , Nigerians , made it the way it is !
If we do not like the way it is then we should tell ourselves the truth and change it .
Chigbo Mgbemene , Nsukka , Nigeria I totally agree with Sola .
Why would people not curse when the situation in the country has become so unbearable .
Bad leaders , no jobs , no good healthcare service , education zero , everytime fuel scarcity .
I must confess sometimes I wish I were n't born here .
Our sick President is back in the country and we are waiting to know his condition .
Well , maybe there 's hope for Nigeria , but let it comes fast .
Annabel Okweri , Lagos , Nigeria the man clamouring 4 good news should come down nd see if there is any good news xcpt 4 d rich livin in stolen luxury if dts good news 4 him
olaitan lanre , festac town lagos true talk sola .
Lets not say things with the pains and hatred in our hearts it can no longer get worse for it has gotten to its peak it can only get better .
Imagin stayin for three month without light how worse can life be ?
Vivian Onyenekwe , Imo state , Nigeria Speak up Sola , speak up !
These are the sad realities fuelling the mass exodus of skills and knowledge which we Nigerians are so capable of .
Fela sang , you write and countless other Nigerians across the global village prove why we are the Giant of Africa .
Yet the irony is , a Nigerian only ever succeeds once they are out of Nigeria .
You explain the reasons for this well .
Speak up Sola because I hear you and feel this suffering of which you speak .
Sophia Binaware Clark , Pretoria , SA Fela 's shuffering and shmiling is no longer a song to our ears but the very reality before our eyes .
The Power calamity ravaging Nigeria did n't start yesterday ... e don tey !
What baffles me is that , the president , governors , senators , ministers and even local government chairman do n't sleep in darkness like the average Nigerian and they seem to get fuel readily available to run their luxury cars , jets and helicopters ....
I think something is seriously wrong somewhere .
Seyi , Lagos , Nigeria
The problem is Nigerians are waiting for Jesus to come and save them from the everyday suffering .
and behold Jesus is coming soon !!!!
yeah right !!!
well , i smell revolution around the corner .
Ladi , London
All , I repeat all of Fela 's songs about the socio-economic or socio-political climate in Nigeria remain relevant .
The tragedy is the conditions have worsened tremendously since he sang them .
All these ' Vagabonds In Power ' simply seek to lead Nigeria to her ruination at this point , but they will not succeed .
Mohammed Anjorin , Atlanta , GA i grew up listening to fela 's music and at that time it was just nice music ; but now im just amazed at how true those words are ; he was the greatest philosopher out that entity called nigeria ; the most corrupt nation in the whole universe ; i've tried to relocate back to nigeria several times and the suffering is just unimaginable ; so i;ve completely given up on that suicide venture ; i've resigned to the hands fate had dealt me ; being born a nigerian but dying as an american ; its such a shame ; i'm sorry !
olugbenga awe , hinesville , ga , usa Sola , thanks you !
The thing that makes me so sad about our beloved country is the waste .
Nigerians are one of the most hard working people out there , but no resources .
Because of that , we have to go and stay in foreign countries for better living and collect insults from people who depend on our oil .
How is it we have the source of power but yet very powerless ?
Lomlom , Houston TX " Hope for were " as Nigerians always says , i think if our African brothers ( Nigerians ) will sit down and want someone to build their country for them then i say poor them , when will Nigerians forget about the past and concentrate and present and build a better Nigeria , when will they talk as a country and forget about their tribalism and individual self benefits , when will they be proud of their country and say Yes we can do it as Ghana has done .
Massoud Abdulraman Yembone , Kumasi , Ghana That Nigerians are suffering and cursing is no longer news .
What is news is that those who we believe can turn the situation around have become a proverbial dog that breaks the bone that is hung around her neck .
We need prayer in this country .
Chris Nnadi , Nsukka , Enugu state , Nigeria kudos to baba fela .
he has said it all .
i see baba fela as a prophet .
he saw things and he told the world about those things through his songs .
YES we are still suffering .
worse than when baba fela sang this song .
NO we are not smiling that much this days .
this is because the suffering is getting unbearable .
still there 's no light , no house , no food , no water ...
Agun ' wale Ayodeji , Lagos , Nigeria Nigerians are total fools .
we certainly deserve the suffering that has fallen upon us .
we all wait for divine solution to our problems .
there 's no divinity anywhere .
its either we are ready to sacrifice with the last ounce of blood in our vein or continue to live in the misery .
. . . have a story of mine : 2 day ago there was a massive queue at one of the petrol station and people were shouting at each other and there was some sort of commotion , i tried with the attendant on duty and some other people also waiting on line to get fuel , for us to reach a selling formula at least to reduce the level of disorderliness on that nozzle as we call it here .
we reached an accord which is 4 jerry cans , 2 keke maruwas and a car .
that was the selling formula ... then sudden a 2008 prado jeep drove in , went to another nozzle and was attended to immediately .
in the process i looked at every one and i started shouting that this is wrong , that this should n't be allowed , i tried to raise a consensus to stop the sale but do you know what my fellow Nigerians were saying leave him alone his a ' big man ' , his not disturbing your nozzle why are you complaining abi u bi human right activist .
my heart cried .
but i relented not i walked up to the attendant laid an offensive complain which i made sure the driver of the car heard .... and started shouting insulting everyone in the petrol station calling them fools .
they were just staring , didnt talk , didnt act , plainly scare for nothing .
i dont do internet complains and all those stupid noise making on the net , it makes no sense .
the solution is action .
if we want change we need to start acting rightly , we need to be the change we desire .
we need to start not later , not tomorrow , we need to start now .
So stop this cyber action and re-divert the energy where it is need , in the real world , where real things , real events and happenings meet at a cross-road .
we are dwelling too long on this awareness train . . . !
Tolu Adams , lagos , nigeria Electricity ?
thats a laugh where i live at Iju .
we rarely have light , we provide 99 % of our own electricity with the generating set .
fuel is meant to be 65 naira per litre , but the fuel attendent tells you its 80 naira while the machine reads 65 naria .
Its anonying when some Nigerians abroad think we are whining without doing anything , we talk and they hear us .
Sooner rather than later , a revolution will take place in this Country and heads will roll .!!!!
miyaki , lagos I remember dancing to Fela 's music in the late 70s and early 80s .
I spoke to my Dad this week and he was complaining that it was quite unusually hot , maybe its this global warming thing going around the world .
I partially agree with him , that the changing climate might have something to do with it , also will be the fumes coming from the millions of generations running day and night due to power outages .
The wrong people are trying to implement the uninterrupted power supply goal , how can managers who not experienced uninterrupted power or implemented one be in charge .
What we need is experienced power professionals from Ghana , Europe , US , Asia , who have it many times before to come to ur rescue .
They need to be supported by qualified programme and project managers , change managers who know how to implement change , not pen pushers in the office , who cannot manage office move from one location to another .
China delivered a fantastic infrastructure for the Beiging Olmypics , London will deliver its own for 2012 , SA will deliver for World Cup , Why , they used professionals from any where in the world who can help them achieve their set goals , not the Nigerian corrupt and nepotism approach .
Change is coming soon through the young generation with global exposure .
Fashola is using this approach I have explained above in Lagos , keep watching and you will see an amazing transformation of Lagos .
Dipo Onasanya , Preston , UK I 'm on my bed soaked in my own sweat because of d bad power supply which as bin out for 2wks ...e no go beta 4 d unborn children of those in power who are making life difficult for us .
amen
Yimika olabode , lagos .
Nigeria D 1st question i'll ask God whenever i see him is , why did u make me a Nigerian ?
A country so rich ( with resources ) but poor , blessed but cursed ( wit corrupt leaders ) .
A nation filled with intrigues , yet the more things change the more they remain the same .
I weep for this great nation with it 's handful of corrupt leaders .
Sunny amanda , Kaduna Nigeria we nigerians are like doves - so quiet and calm .
with no mother to look after us we have been taken by vultures .
where do we start from ?
ifeanyi chukwu anunwa , guangzhou , china fela kuti is just a prophet .
you have to be in nigeria to know how we suffer .
it is not that we laugh or enjoys it , just that we have no choice .
sola is right .
Elochukwu , anambarg , nigeria Sola has said the truth , nothing but the truth .
Nigerians are no longer smiling to what is going on in the country today .
Everybody is trying to see that his or her voice is heard , and those in the outside world hear them .
Nigeria is one of the largest producers of oil , but look at what is going on around us .
It 's very bad .
I just want to say one thing .
It might not be published , but let me just say it .
To Nigeria 's leaders :
It 's a shame , with all the natural resources we have , what have they done for the country ?
Nothing .
All they know how to do is steal from the country and save for their unborn children .
Anything that has a beginning must always have an end .
Omobhude , Port Harcourt , Nigeria I have only one comment to make - you have spoken the mind of the teeming population .
Sola Adegoroye , Lagos , Nigeria Fela 's words are as true as hell .
Nigerians still suffer and smile .
Do you know of any country on earth that has vast crude oil and natural gas fields yet there is no functioning refinery ?
Petrol is as rare as gold , power stations go without gas supplies yet citizens smile ?
That 's Nigeria !
Chinedu Igwe , Barrow in Furness , UK
The suffering continues but the true problem of Nigerians is our docility .
We seem to think its okay to ' manage ' whatever situation we find ourselves in no matter how dire .
We need to stand up and soon .
I wish I could type more but my battery only has an 8 hour life and I 've not had electricity for 3 days !
Tome Obaro , Lagos , Nigeria Sola , though I might not know you , your story seems similar with mine .
I made the same phone call to my sibling back home in Nigeria who lives on the outskirts .
All they said was it 's been four days no light .
The situation seems hopeless .
Is n't this barbaric from our so called leaders ?
For years we have been clamouring and protesting for a better Nigeria , but instead they continue plunging into a deeper abyss , without human conscience .
I weep for my beloved country .
Jibolajosh , Beijing , China Smiling and cursing is an everyday slogan in Nigeria .
For example , my younger sister woke up on Sunday morning to narrate to me how she fought with vampire in her dream and she woke up to discover she was in absolute darkness .
Her next action was to run out of the house to curse those in in charge of government in Nigeria , by saying " e no better for people wey spoil Nigeria " .
So is the order of the day and so shall it be .
Ibitayo Ogunmola , Lagos , Nigeria I agree with Sola .
Everybody is cursing this useless government , but so have they for the past 30 years so it 's not news at all .
I would like to see a positive item of news about our beloved Nigeria from Sola Odunfa written here on the BBC , because I know it cannot all be bad news from Nigeria all the time .
Richard Orishaba , Enfield , UK I grew up to Fela 's revolutionary and thought provoking music .
In one of his songs he said the cost of food was high and the general standard of living was horrendous .
But then , life in Nigeria was n't bad at all .
Little did we realise that he was ahead of the game , he knew where we are heading to .
He was a great man who forever live in our hearts .
Rotimi Akano - Williams , Buckinghamshire , UK Thanks Sola , a well written truth that more Nigerians are feeling the heat now .
Not everyone is smiling anymore as even the ruling class seemingly is becoming smaller and smaller in size , throwing more people into an opposition camp .
People that once had power are shoved away from government - joining the general public in suffering .
But the smiling is gradually disappearing as this set of people complain of the heat of hardship they face too .
The ordinary Nigerian will keep smiling no matter what .
" Where there is life , there is hope " .

A source passes on a document with Palin 's fee schedule :
Sarah Palin ’s appearance early next month at the first tea party movement ’s convention in Nashville , Tenn. , has stirred controversy in conservative circles over her reported decision to charge a substantial fee .
Palin ’s aides and conference organizers wo n’t comment on financial arrangements , but documents obtained by POLITICO reveal the going rate for the former Alaska governor : $ 100,000 a speech , with a discount to $ 75,000 for West Coast appearances .
Palin has reportedly waived the fee for some charitable events , but what ’s billed as a meeting of the grass - roots conservative movement is not among those .
David Reilly at BusinessWeek takes dead aim at Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and the New York Fed in Secret Banking Cabal Emerges From AIG Shadows .
The idea of secret banking cabals that control the country and global economy are a given among conspiracy theorists who stockpile ammo , bottled water and peanut butter .
Wednesday ’s hearing described a secretive group deploying billions of dollars to favored banks , operating with little oversight by the public or elected officials .
We ’re talking about the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , whose role as the most influential part of the federal - reserve system -- apart from the matter of AIG ’s bailout -- deserves further congressional scrutiny .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was head of the New York Fed at the time of the AIG moves .
The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform also focused on what many in Congress believe was the New York Fed ’s subsequent attempt to cover up buyout details and who benefited .
By pursuing this line of inquiry , the hearing revealed some of the inner workings of the New York Fed and the outsized role it plays in banking .
This insight is especially valuable given that the New York Fed is a quasi - governmental institution that is n’t subject to citizen intrusions such as freedom of information requests , unlike the Federal Reserve .
This impenetrability comes in handy since the bank is the preferred vehicle for many of the Fed ’s bailout programs .
It ’s as though the New York Fed was a black - ops outfit for the nation ’s central bank .
As Representative Marcy Kaptur told Geithner at the hearing : “ A lot of people think that the president of the New York Fed works for the U.S. government .
But in fact you work for the private banks that elected you . ”
Let ’s take Geithner at his word that a failure to resolve the insurer ’s default swaps would have led to financial Armageddon .
Given the stakes , you might think Geithner would have coordinated actions with then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Yet Paulson testified that he was n’t in the loop .
“ I had no involvement at all , in the payment to the counterparties , no involvement whatsoever , ” Paulson said .
Fed Chairman Bernanke also was n’t involved .
In a written response to questions from Representative Darrell Issa , Bernanke said he “ was not directly involved in the negotiations ” with AIG ’s counterparty banks .
Geither said he recused himself from the bank ’s day - to - day activities , even though he never actually signed a formal letter of recusal .
New York
Fed staff and outside lawyers from Davis Polk & Wardell edited AIG communications to investors and intervened with the Securities and Exchange Commission to shield details about the buyout transactions , according to a report by Issa .
That the New York Fed , a quasi - governmental body , was able to push around the SEC , an executive - branch agency , deserves a congressional hearing all by itself .
Later , when it became clear information would be disclosed , New York Fed legal group staffer James Bergin e-mailed colleagues saying : “ I have to think this train is probably going to leave the station soon and we need to focus our efforts on explaining the story as best we can .
There were too many people involved in the deals -- too many counterparties , too many lawyers and advisors , too many people from AIG -- to keep a determined Congress from the information . ”
Think of the enormity of that statement .
A staffer at a body with little public accountability and that exists to serve bankers is lamenting the inability to keep Congress in the dark .

Strange Conspiracy Involving No One
Geithner recused himself although there is no record of it .
Paulson knows nothing about it and was not in the loop
Bernanke either does not remember and / or was not involved .

The image of banks locking their doors to keep customers from making withdrawals during a bank run is what immediately came to mind when we heard that Citigroup was telling customers it has the right to prevent any withdrawals from checking accounts for seven days .
" Effective April 1 , 2010 , we reserve the right to require ( 7 ) days advance notice before permitting a withdrawal from all checking accounts .
While we do not currently exercise this right and have not exercised it in the past , we are required by law to notify you of this change , " Citigroup said on statements received by customers all over the country .
What 's going on ?
It seems that this is something of an error .
The seven day notice policy only applies to customers in Texas , Ira Stoll reports at The Future of Capitalism .
It was accidentally included on customer statements nationwide .
" Whatever the explanation , it does n't exactly inspire confidence in Citi , " Stoll writes .
" But it 's hard to believe a bank would be sending out a notice like that on its statements . "
UPDATE : According to Stoll , Citi issued a statement saying that it has been required to make this change by Federal regulations -- and it no longer sounds like it 's limited to Texas :
Update : Citibank has now released the following statement by way of explanation : " When Citibank moved to unlimited FDIC coverage in 2009 , we had to reclassify many checking accounts to allow for immediate withdrawals in order to ensure all customers qualified for the additional coverage .
When we moved back to standard FDIC coverage with most major banks in 2010 , Citibank decided to reclassify those accounts back to make them eligible again for promotional incentives .
To do so , Federal Reserve Reg D requires these accounts , called NOW accounts , to reserve the right to require a 7 - day notice of withdrawal .
We recently communicated this technical requirement to our customers .
However , we have never exercised this right and have no plans to do so in the future . "
A suburban Philadelphia school district has agreed to preserve webcam evidence on student laptops as a lawsuit alleges that officials spied on students at home .
EDUCATION ON TWITTER EDUCATION ON TWITTER PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) 
School officials in Pennsylvania who admit remotely activating student webcams to locate missing laptops could have used far less intrusive methods such as GPS tracking devices , technology and privacy experts say .
The Lower Merion School District instead finds itself defending a potential class - action lawsuit after a student complained of being photographed inside his home and accused of selling drugs .
RELATED : Lawsuit : U.S. school spied on students via laptops
The FBI is investigating the school district for possible wiretap and computer - use violations .
" The issues raised by these allegations are wide - ranging and involve the meeting of the new world of cyberspace with that of physical space .
Our focus will only be on whether anyone committed any crimes , " U.S. Attorney Michael Levy said Monday , taking the unusual step of confirming the FBI and Justice Department investigation .
While pledging to cooperate with any criminal probe , lawyers for the district also appeared in court for the first time Monday in the civil case , negotiating an agreement aimed at preserving computer evidence .
The district agreed not to destroy any evidence that might be found on its servers or on the nearly 2,300 laptops issued to students at its two high schools .
Harriton High School student Blake Robbins and his family hope to learn " whether there were systematic violations or whether this is an isolated instance , " according to their lawyer , Mark Haltzman .
The district activated the webcams after 42 laptops disappeared in the past 14 months .
Eighteen were located , district spokesman Doug Young said Monday .
He did not immediately know whether any were found — after webcam pictures were taken — in student homes .
Young has declined to discuss whether Blake Robbins ' laptop was reported missing , because of the litigation , but said the district did not violate its policy to activate webcams only for that purpose .
Yet Robbins insists in court filings that it was never reported missing .
Either way , technology and privacy experts agree that GPS , " call home " and other location tracking software offer better results without raising privacy concerns .
" There are less intrusive ways to track stolen laptops , no question about it , " said Marc Rotenberg , a Georgetown University law professor who serves as president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington .
The company that owns the LANrev remote - activation software allegedly used by Lower Merion no longer promotes its use for anti-theft purposes .
" webcam pictures are not useful in tracking down the culprit , " said Stephen Midgely , vice president of global marketing for Absolute Software , which recently bought the LANrev software .
The user in the picture is often not the person who stole the computer , and the photos are usually inadmissible in court , he said .
Nonetheless , a Lower Merion network technician marveled at LANrev 's theft - tracking potential in a May 2008 MacEnterprise.org webcast .
" Fantastic feature — I can't speak highly enough of it , " network technician Michael Perbix said , describing how the system could not only provide network address data to help police track down a missing machine but also send back screen shots and pictures from the built - in camera at regular intervals .
Perbix said he had once used the feature to try to locate laptops mistakenly thought to be missing .
" By the time we found out they were back , I had to turn the tracking off and I had a good 20 snapshots of the teacher and students using the machines in the classroom , " he said .
According to Rotenberg , those photographs could also raise legal problems for Lower Merion , since officials have said students did not sign waivers agreeing to the hidden use of webcams .
" The question is whether the wiretap law applies when the school tries to communicate with laptops at school .
That 's a very interesting dimension in this case , " Rotenberg said .
The American Civil Liberties Union also entered the case Monday , filing a friend - of - the - court brief in support of the student , arguing the alleged secret webcam activation in a home amounts to an illegal search .
Robbins filed suit last week , alleging that Harriton officials took a photo of him inside his home in November .
He said he learned of it when an assistant principal said she knew he was engaging in improper behavior at home .
According to Haltzman , the supposed pills were actually Mike and Ike candies .
Lawyer Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. , who represents the district , urged families and community members not to jump to conclusions .
" To the extent any mistakes were made , we will make recommendations for any needed changes in policies and procedures , " Hockeimer said .

Medical Dispensary Donates $ 1500 to Local Library
I wanted to share an interesting article I saw in our morning 's local paper , The Orange County Register , ( www.ocregister.com, Local page 3 ) .
Medical marijuana dispensaries in my area have been taking a lot of heat lately .
Some have shut down and others are threatened .
City governments are trying to force them out .
In Lake Forest , CA , the city council has requested financial records to make sure they are not operating illegally .
Is this legal ?
What are they looking for ?
Where is the ACLU when you need them ?
In an interesting twist , the El Toro Library received a donation of $ 1500 .
The local Friends of the Library chapter ( a used book store attached to libraries ) accepted the donation without realizing that it was from 215 Agenda , a medical marijuana dispensary .
It turns out , now get this , cancer patients who legitimately purchase their medicine from 215 Agenda also read books .
( Who would have thought ? )
Adam Moody , the manager at 215 Agenda , heard that the local library was experiencing a financial crunch and put out a donation jar in his store .
Many patients made donations and these were passed on to the library .
The dispensary also did a toy drive for Orangewood Chidlren 's home .
OK , so some people are exploiting the medical marijuana laws , but does this justify denying books and pain killers to cancer patients ?
Come on , city council , show some .

• Singer Tom Meighan says it was ' brilliant ' to wear the shirt • Umbro planned ' away ' launch of away shirt
Umbro has launched the England football team 's new away shirt in an unusual fashion – by having it worn by Tom Meighan , the lead singer of the band Kasabian , at a concert in Paris .
Speaking after a concert on Monday night , Meighan was quoted by the Leicester Mercury as saying : " It 's brilliant to be the first band ever to launch an England shirt and where better to launch this particular kit than away from home ?
" When Umbro approached us to represent England away we jumped at the chance as we are all football fans and loved the idea of revealing the England away shirt when playing in the country of one of our great footballing rivals . "
The history of momentum - exchange tethers goes back many , many years but is bound by a common thread that , until recently , limited the realization of this technology .
That common thread is the need for high specific tensile strength .
The first idea of concept of a tether dates back to the imagination of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , the Russian schoolteacher who first developed our modern concepts of rocketry and first derived the rocket equation .
In the late 1800s , Tsiolkovsky visited Paris and saw the Eiffel Tower .
He was so impressed by the sight that he imagined a tower reaching up far into space .
He calculated the height at which such a tower would have to be before the centrifugal force from the Earth ’s rotation balanced the pull of gravity ( inadvertently calculating the altitude of geosynchronous orbit ) .
Tsiolkovsky , of course , could not conceive of any material that could withstand the compressive forces of such a structure , but sixty years later , a Russian engineer named Yuri Artsutanov picked up the thread of Tsiolkovsky ’s work and first worked out the engineering principles of what is now called a “ space elevator ” , a long tether hanging all the way from geosynchronous orbit to the surface of the Earth .
The space elevator required materials with specific tensile strength far in excess of any known material , and still does .
Further conceptual engineering work on the space elevator concept was done in the early 1970 ’s by American engineer Jerome Pearson .
The space elevator was a hanging tether , and payloads were required to traverse its length in order to achieve orbit .
The beginnings of rotating momentum - exchange tethers date to the late 1970s , when Hans Moravec , a robotics researcher at Stanford University ( now at Carnegie - Mellon ) was intrigued by a suggestion of his friend John McCarthy of a satellite that “ rolled like a wheel ” around the Earth .
Moravec began a scientific investigation of the concept , which he first called a “ non-synchronous orbital skyhook ” and later a “ Rotovator ” .
Like the space elevator , it reached all the way to the surface of the Earth , but unlike the elevator , it rotated about its axis a number of times per orbit .
A payload would be picked up by the tip at the surface of the Earth and then thrown half a rotation later into an interplanetary trajectory .
The Rotovator was a good deal shorter than the space elevator ( ~4200 km vs. 40 , 000 – 100,000 km ) but was not much better in terms of materials required .
Moravec published a paper on the subject in the Journal of Astronautical Sciences where he speculated on advanced forms of matter that might have the strength needed to build the Rotovator .
About a year after the JAS paper was published , Dupont ’s development of Kevlar excited Moravec to the possibilities of Rotovators built with conventional materials .
He wrote a short paper called on the subject which was never published .
The paper showed that Kevlar skyhooks were not feasible around the Earth but could be reasonably built around the Moon and Mars .
In an appendix to this unpublished paper , Moravec speculated on the possibility of skyhooks built in interplanetary space that would assist spacecraft traveling between the Earth and Mars .
To the great benefit of future tether researchers , his equations for the cross-section of a tether , in the absence of a gravitational field , could be integrated in closed - form .
Thus , the Moravec “ tether equation ” was first derived .
(1)
(2)
(3)
Moravec was able to derive analytical expressions for the area of the tether as a function of its distance from the rotational center .
He then numerically integrated the area expression along the length of the tether to calculate volume and mass .
As an aside , in an appendix , he considered the case of a tether spinning in free space .
When the tension on the tether was only due to centrifugal forces , the area expression could be analytically integrated to a closed - form solution .
Thus the Moravec mass ratio was derived .
The equation could be simplified by realizing that fundamentally , the mass ratio is a function only of the velocity ratio , which itself is the ratio of the tip velocity of the tether and the characteristic velocity of the tether material .
Further insight into the value of the equation was gained by comparing it to the rocket equation and noting the similarities and differences .
Moravec wrote a few articles on the subject for space - themed publications , but basically returned to his robotics work .
Nevertheless , Moravec ’s equation still serves as a foundation to all momentum - exchange tether work to this day .

One of the reasons I ran for President was because I believed so strongly that the voices of everyday Americans , hardworking folks doing everything they can to stay afloat , just were n’t being heard over the powerful voices of the special interests in Washington .
And the result was a national agenda too often skewed in favor of those with the power to tilt the tables .
In my first year in office , we pushed back on that power by implementing historic reforms to get rid of the influence of those special interests .
On my first day in office , we closed the revolving door between lobbying firms and the government so that no one in my administration would make decisions based on the interests of former or future employers .
We barred gifts from federal lobbyists to executive branch officials .
We imposed tough restrictions to prevent funds for our recovery from lining the pockets of the well - connected , instead of creating jobs for Americans .
And for the first time in history , we have publicly disclosed the names of lobbyists and non-lobbyists alike who visit the White House every day , so that you know what ’s going on in the White House -- the people ’s house .
We ’ve been making steady progress .
But this week , the United States Supreme Court handed a huge victory to the special interests and their lobbyists -- and a powerful blow to our efforts to rein in corporate influence .
This ruling strikes at our democracy itself .
By a 5 - 4 vote , the Court overturned more than a century of law -- including a bipartisan campaign finance law written by Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold that had barred corporations from using their financial clout to directly interfere with elections by running advertisements for or against candidates in the crucial closing weeks .
This ruling opens the floodgates for an unlimited amount of special interest money into our democracy .
It gives the special interest lobbyists new leverage to spend millions on advertising to persuade elected officials to vote their way - – or to punish those who do n’t .
That means that any public servant who has the courage to stand up to the special interests and stand up for the American people can find himself or herself under assault come election time .
Even foreign corporations may now get into the act .
I ca n’t think of anything more devastating to the public interest .
The last thing we need to do is hand more influence to the lobbyists in Washington , or more power to the special interests to tip the outcome of elections .
All of us , regardless of party , should be worried that it will be that much harder to get fair , common - sense financial reforms , or close unwarranted tax loopholes that reward corporations from sheltering their income or shipping American jobs off - shore .
It will make it more difficult to pass commonsense laws to promote energy independence because even foreign entities would be allowed to mix in our elections .
It would give the health insurance industry even more leverage to fend off reforms that would protect patients .
We do n’t need to give any more voice to the powerful interests that already drown out the voices of everyday Americans .
And we do n’t intend to .
When this ruling came down , I instructed my administration to get to work immediately with Members of Congress willing to fight for the American people to develop a forceful , bipartisan response to this decision .
We have begun that work , and it will be a priority for us until we repair the damage that has been done .
A hundred years ago , one of the great Republican Presidents , Teddy Roosevelt , fought to limit special interest spending and influence over American political campaigns and warned of the impact of unbridled , corporate spending .
His message rings as true as ever today , in this age of mass communications , when the decks are too often stacked against ordinary Americans .
And as long as I ’m your President , I ’ll never stop fighting to make sure that the most powerful voice in Washington belongs to you .
It is just more efficient to beat your competitors by buying legislation than it is by competing in the marketplace .
When you can purchase $ 1 billion in tax breaks , subsidies , mandates , contracts , whatever by spending a few million on candidates / influence , etc. it just makes more sense to do so .
The return on investment is just so much higher than building factories , spending on research , paying employees , and other tedious , time - consuming , capital - intensive work .
For some time companies have recognized that the rewards from lobbying outperform the rewards from competing in the marketplace , and this ruling just amplifies that .
This 2006 New York Times article , Google Joins the Lobbying Herd , discussed how Google felt it had “ no choice but to get into the arena ” to start “ spreading its lobbying dollars ” around to politicians and quotes Lauren Maddox , a lobbyist for Google , saying the " policy process is an extension of the market battlefield . "
This supreme court ruling just clinches this shift away from markets .
The game is necessarily going to be to use the superior resources of larger companies to purchase barriers that block smaller , innovative companies from getting anywhere , and force them to be absorbed .
Companies that think they can opt out of this and continue to compete with innovation , superior products and services are just mistaken .
Any company that does n't see this change will find that their competitors are working to buy legislation / rulemaking against them , and wo n't last long .
It 's going to take a little while for this to sink in , but it is inevitable now .
The governmental interest in regulating corporate political communications , especially those relating to electoral matters , also raises considerations which differ significantly from those governing the regulation of individual speech .
Corporations are artificial entities created by law for the purpose of furthering certain economic goals .
In order to facilitate the achievement of such ends , special rules relating to such matters as limited liability , perpetual life , and the accumulation , distribution , and taxation of assets are normally applied to them .
States have provided corporations with such attributes in order to increase their economic viability and thus strengthen the economy generally .
It has long been recognized , however , that the special status of corporations has placed them in a position to control vast amounts of economic power which may , if not regulated , dominate not only the economy but also the very heart of our democracy , the electoral process .
Although Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) , provides support for the position that the desire to equalize the financial resources available to candidates does not justify the limitation upon the expression of support which a restriction upon individual contributions entails , 9 the interest of Massachusetts and the many other States which have restricted corporate political activity is quite different .
It is not one of equalizing the resources of opposing candidates or opposing positions , but rather of preventing institutions which have been permitted to amass wealth as a result of special advantages extended by the State for certain economic purposes from using that wealth to acquire an unfair advantage in the political process , especially where , as here , the issue involved has no material connection with the business of the corporation .
The State need not permit its own creation to consume it .
Massachusetts could [ 435 U.S. 765 , 810 ] permissibly conclude that not to impose limits upon the political activities of corporations would have placed it in a position of departing from neutrality and indirectly assisting the propagation of corporate views because of the advantages its laws give to the corporate acquisition of funds to finance such activities .
Such expenditures may be viewed as seriously threatening the role of the First Amendment as a guarantor of a free marketplace of ideas .
Ordinarily , the expenditure of funds to promote political causes may be assumed to bear some relation to the fervency with which they are held .
Corporate political expression , however , is not only divorced from the convictions of individual corporate shareholders , but also , because of the ease with which corporations are permitted to accumulate capital , bears no relation to the conviction with which the ideas expressed are held by the communicator .
...
The Court assumes that the interest in preventing the use of corporate resources in furtherance of views which are irrelevant to the corporate business and with which some shareholders may disagree is a compelling one , but concludes that the Massachusetts statute is nevertheless invalid because the State has failed to adopt the means best suited , in its opinion , for achieving this end .
Ante , at 792-795 .
It proposes that the aggrieved shareholder assert his interest in preventing the expenditure of funds for nonbusiness causes he finds unconscionable through the channels provided by " corporate democracy " and purports to be mystified as to " why the dissenting shareholder 's wishes are entitled to such greater solicitude in this context than in many others where equally important and controversial corporate decisions are made by management or by a predetermined percentage of the shareholders . "
Ante , at 794 , and n. 34 .
It should be obvious that the alternative means upon the adequacy of which the majority is willing to predicate a constitutional adjudication is no more able to satisfy the State 's interest than a ruling in Street and Abood leaving aggrieved employees to the remedies provided by union democracy would have satisfied the demands of the First Amendment .
The interest which the State wishes to protect here is identical to that which the Court has previously held to be protected by [ 435 U.S. 765 , 816 ] the First Amendment : the right to adhere to one 's own beliefs and to refuse to support the dissemination of the personal and political views of others , regardless of how large a majority they may compose .
In most contexts , of course , the views of the dissenting shareholder have little , if any , First Amendment significance .
By purchasing interests in corporations shareholders accept the fact that corporations are going to make decisions concerning matters such as advertising integrally related to their business operations according to the procedures set forth in their charters and bylaws .
Otherwise , corporations could not function .
First Amendment concerns of stockholders are directly implicated , however , when a corporation chooses to use its privileged status to finance ideological crusades which are unconnected with the corporate business or property and which some shareholders might not wish to support .
Once again , we are provided no explanation whatsoever by the Court as to why the State 's interest is of less constitutional weight than that of corporations to participate financially in the electoral process and as to why the balance between two First Amendment interests should be struck by this Court .
If you listen to too much Tweety on TV -- why he's on MSNBC instead of Fox is beyond me -- you may have the idea that no one is upset about the ruling by the 5 corporate justices on the Supreme Court that corporations -- including foreign corporations -- can buy every American election they want and Congress has no say in the matter .
But that 's hardly the case .
Yesterday we looked at President Obama 's weekly speech to the nation , in which he focused on the clear and present dangers Roberts , Alito , Scalia , Thomas and Kennedy have imposed on American democracy , to the cheers of Republicans and the clinking of champagne toasts by banksters , lobbyists and corporate management .
Even if you watched the video yesterday , it is worth reading the transcript :
Dave Johnson , over at Seeing The Forest is n't a politician ; he 's a businessman , but he sees the dangers as clearly as the president -- and worries that the Supreme Court has basically made Adam Smith 's sanctified Marketplace just about irrelevant .
The decision , he says , " shifts the business playing field away from competing in the marketplace with products and services , to purchasing government / legal / reguatory advantages , subsidies and monopolies . "
Now only size matters .
Unlike President Obama and , like the rest of us , Dave Johnson , Byron White has no stake in this fight .
That 's because the former All - American football halfback -- who played for the Colorado Buffaloes in college and then the Pittsburgh Pirates ( Steelers ) and the Detroit Lions , acquiring the nicknamed Whizzer -- passed away in 2002 .
Oh , and he served on the Supreme Court from 1962 to 1993 .
Many remember him as an anti-Choice defender of the unborn and a dissenter in the Roe v Wade decision .
But he also dissented in the 1982 decision in , in which he was very clear that corporate communications and individual freedom of speech were very different cups of tea indeed :

The New Rules of War
Every day , the U.S. military spends $ 1.75 billion , much of it on big ships , big guns , and big battalions that are not only not needed to win the wars of the present , but are sure to be the wrong approach to waging the wars of the future .
In this , the ninth year of the first great conflict between nations and networks , America ’s armed forces have failed , as militaries so often do , to adapt sufficiently to changed conditions , finding out the hard way that their enemies often remain a step ahead .
The U.S. military floundered for years in Iraq , then proved itself unable to grasp the point , in both Iraq and Afghanistan , that old - school surges of ground troops do not offer enduring solutions to new - style conflicts with networked adversaries .
So it has almost always been .
Given the high stakes and dangers they routinely face , militaries are inevitably reluctant to change .
During World War I , the armies on the Western Front in 1915 were fighting in much the same manner as those at Waterloo in 1815 , attacking in close - packed formations — despite the emergence of the machine gun and high - explosive artillery .
Millions were slaughtered , year after bloody year , for a few yards of churned - up mud .
It is no surprise that historian Alan Clark titled his study of the high command during this conflict The Donkeys .
Even the implications of maturing tanks , planes , and the radio waves that linked them were only partially understood by the next generation of military men .
Just as their predecessors failed to grasp the lethal nature of firepower , their successors missed the rise of mechanized maneuver — save for the Germans , who figured out that blitzkrieg was possible and won some grand early victories .
They would have gone on winning , but for poor high - level strategic choices such as invading Russia and declaring war on the United States .
In the end , the Nazis were not so much outfought as gang - tackled .
Nuclear weapons were next to be misunderstood , most monumentally by a U.S. military that initially thought they could be employed like any other weapons .
But it turned out they were useful only in deterring their use .
Surprisingly , it was cold warrior Ronald Reagan who had the keenest insight into such weapons when he said , “ A nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought . ”
Which brings us to war in the age of information .
The technological breakthroughs of the last two decades — comparable in world - shaking scope to those at the Industrial Revolution ’s outset two centuries ago — coincided with a new moment of global political instability after the Cold War .
Yet most militaries are entering this era with the familiar pattern of belief that new technological tools will simply reinforce existing practices .
In the U.S. case , senior officials remain convinced that their strategy of “ shock and awe ” and the Powell doctrine of “ overwhelming force ” have only been enhanced by the addition of greater numbers of smart weapons , remotely controlled aircraft , and near - instant global communications .
Perhaps the most prominent cheerleader for “ shock and awe ” has been National Security Advisor James Jones , the general whose circle of senior aides has included those who came up with the concept in the 1990s .
Their basic idea : “ The bigger the hammer , the better the outcome . ”
Nothing could be further from the truth , as the results in Iraq and Afghanistan so painfully demonstrate .
Indeed , a decade and a half after my colleague David Ronfeldt and I coined the term “ netwar ” to describe the world ’s emerging form of network - based conflict , the United States is still behind the curve .
The evidence of the last 10 years shows clearly that massive applications of force have done little more than kill the innocent and enrage their survivors .
Networked organizations like al Qaeda have proven how easy it is to dodge such heavy punches and persist to land sharp counterblows .
And the U.S. military , which has used these new tools of war in mostly traditional ways , has been staggered financially and gravely wounded psychologically .
The Iraq war ’s real cost , for example , has been about $ 3 trillion , per the analysis of Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes — and even “ official ” figures put expenditures around $ 1 trillion .
As for human capital , U.S. troops are exhausted by repeated lengthy deployments against foes who , if they were lined up , would hardly fill a single division of Marines .
In a very real sense , the United States has come close to punching itself out since 9/11 .
When militaries do n’t keep up with the pace of change , countries suffer .
In World War I , the failure to grasp the implications of mass production led not only to senseless slaughter , but also to the end of great empires and the bankruptcy of others .
The inability to comprehend the meaning of mechanization at the outset of World War II handed vast tracts of territory to the Axis powers and very nearly gave them victory .
The failure to grasp the true meaning of nuclear weapons led to a suicidal arms race and a barely averted apocalypse during the Cuban missile crisis .
Today , the signs of misunderstanding still abound .
For example , in an age of supersonic anti-ship missiles , the U.S. Navy has spent countless billions of dollars on “ surface warfare ships ” whose aluminum superstructures will likely burn to the waterline if hit by a single missile .
Yet Navy doctrine calls for them to engage missile - armed enemies at eyeball range in coastal waters .
The U.S. Army , meanwhile , has spent tens of billions of dollars on its “ Future Combat Systems , ” a grab bag of new weapons , vehicles , and communications gadgets now seen by its own proponents as almost completely unworkable for the kind of military operations that land forces will be undertaking in the years ahead .
The oceans of information the systems would generate each day would clog the command circuits so that carrying out even the simplest operation would be a terrible slog .
And the U.S. Air Force , beyond its well - known devotion to massive bombing , remains in love with extremely advanced and extremely expensive fighter aircraft — despite losing only one fighter plane to an enemy fighter in nearly 40 years .
Although the hugely costly F - 22 turned out to function poorly and is being canceled after enormous investment in its production , the Air Force has by no means given up .
Instead , the more advanced F - 35 will be produced , at a cost running in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
All this in an era in which what the United States already has is far better than anything else in the world and will remain so for many decades .
These developments suggest that the United States is spending huge amounts of money in ways that are actually making Americans less secure , not only against irregular insurgents , but also against smart countries building different sorts of militaries .
And the problem goes well beyond weapons and other high - tech items .
What ’s missing most of all from the U.S. military ’s arsenal is a deep understanding of networking , the loose but lively interconnection between people that creates and brings a new kind of collective intelligence , power , and purpose to bear — for good and ill .
Civil society movements around the world have taken to networking in ways that have done far more to advance the cause of freedom than the U.S. military ’s problematic efforts to bring democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan at gunpoint .
As for “ uncivil society , ” terrorists and transnational criminals have embraced connectivity to coordinate global operations in ways that simply were not possible in the past .
Before the Internet and the World Wide Web , a terrorist network operating cohesively in more than 60 countries could not have existed .
Today , a world full of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallabs awaits — and not all of them will fail .
But the principles of networking do n’t have to help only the bad guys .
If fully embraced , they can lead to a new kind of military — and even a new kind of war .
The conflicts of the future should and could be less costly and destructive , with armed forces more able to protect the innocent and deter or defend against aggression .
Vast tank armies may no longer battle it out across the steppes , but modern warfare has indeed become exceedingly fast - paced and complex .
Still , there is a way to reduce this complexity to just three simple rules that can save untold amounts of blood and treasure in the netwar age .
Rule 1 : “ Many and Small ” Beats “ Few and Large . ”
The greatest problem traditional militaries face today is that they are organized to wage big wars and have difficulty orienting themselves to fight small ones .
The demands of large - scale conflicts have led to reliance on a few big units rather than on a lot of little ones .
For example , the Marines have only three active - duty divisions , the U.S. Army only ten .
The Navy has just 11 carrier strike groups , and the Air Force about three dozen attack aircraft “ wings . ”
Almost 1.5 million active service members have been poured into these and a few other supporting organizational structures .
It is no wonder that the U.S. military has exhausted itself in the repeated deployments since the 9/11 attacks .
It has a chronic “ scaling problem , ” making it unable to pursue smaller tasks with smaller numbers .
Add in the traditional , hierarchical military mindset , which holds that more is always better ( the corollary belief being that one can only do worse with less ) , and you get massive approaches to little wars .
This was the case during the Vietnam War , too , when the prevailing military organizational structure of the 1960s — not much different from today ’s — drove decision - makers to pursue a big - unit war against a large number of very small insurgent units .
The final result : 500,000 - plus troops deployed , countless billions spent , and a war lost .
The iconic images were the insurgents ’
AK - 47 individual assault rifles , of which there were hundreds of thousands in use at any moment , juxtaposed against the U.S. Air Force ’s B - 52s , of which just a hundred or so massed together in fruitless attempts to bomb Hanoi into submission .
The same problem persists today , the updated icons being the insurgents ’ thousands of improvised explosive devices and the Americans ’ relative handful of drones .
It is ironic that the U.S. war on terrorism commenced in the Afghan mountains with the same type of B - 52 bombers and the same problematic results that attended the Vietnam War .
The U.S. military is not unaware of these problems .
The Army has incrementally increased the number of brigades — which typically include between 3,000 and 4,000 trigger - pullers — from less than three dozen in 2001 to almost 50 today .
And the Marines now routinely subdivide their forces into “ expeditionary units ” of several hundred troops each .
But these changes hardly begin the needed shift from a military of the “ few and large ” to one of the “ many and small . ”
That ’s because U.S. military leaders have not sufficiently grasped that even quite small units — like a platoon of 50 or so soldiers — can wield great power when connected to others , especially friendly indigenous forces , and when networking closely with even a handful of attack aircraft .
Yet the evidence is there .
For example , beginning in late 2006 in Iraq , the U.S. command shifted little more than 5 percent of its 130,000 troops from about three dozen major ( i.e. , town - sized ) operating bases to more than a hundred small outposts , each manned by about 50 soldiers .
This was a dramatic shift from few - large to many - small , and it soon worked wonders in reducing violence , beginning well before the “ surge ” troops arrived .
In part this happened because the physical network of platoon - sized outposts facilitated social networking with the large numbers of small tribal groups who chose to join the cause , forming the core of the “ Awakening ” movement .
The Pentagon ’s reluctance to see the new possibilities — reflected in the shrilly repeated calls for more troops , first in Iraq , then in Afghanistan — stems in part from the usual generalized fear of change , but also from concern that a many - and - small force would have trouble against a traditional massed army .
Say , like North Korea’s .
Then again , perhaps the best example of a many - and - small military that worked against foes of all sizes was the Roman legion .
For many centuries , legionary maniples ( Latin for “ handfuls ” ) marched out — in their flexible checkerboard formations — and beat the massive , balky phalanxes of traditional foes , while dealing just as skillfully with loose bands of tribal fighters .
Rule 2 : Finding Matters More Than Flanking .
Ever since Theban general Epaminondas overloaded his army ’s left wing to strike at the Spartan right almost 2,400 years ago at Leuctra , hitting the enemy in the flank has been the most reliable maneuver in warfare .
Flank attacks can be seen in Frederick the Great ’s famous “ oblique order ” in his 18th - century battles , in Erwin Rommel ’s repeated “ right hooks ” around the British in North Africa in 1941 , and in Norman Schwarzkopf ’s famous “ left hook ” around the Iraqis in 1991 .
Flanking has quite a pedigree .
Flanking also formed a basis for the march up Mesopotamia by U.S. forces in 2003 .
But something odd happened this time .
In the words of military historian John Keegan , the large Iraqi army of more than 400,000 troops just “ melted away . ”
There were no great battles of encirclement and only a handful of firefights along the way to Baghdad .
Instead , Iraqis largely waited until their country was overrun and then mounted an insurgency based on tip - and - run attacks and bombings .
Thus did war cease to be driven by mass - on - mass confrontation , but rather by a hider - finder dynamic .
In a world of networked war , armies will have to redesign how they fight , keeping in mind that the enemy of the future will have to be found before it can be fought .
To some extent this occurred in the Vietnam War , but that was a conflict during which the enemy obligingly ( and quite regularly ) massed its forces in major offensives : held off in 1965 , defeated in 1968 and 1972 , and finally winning in 1975 .
In Iraq , there were n’t mass assaults , but a new type of irregular warfare in which a series of small attacks no longer signaled buildup toward a major battle .
This is the path being taken by the Taliban in Afghanistan and is clearly the concept of global operations used by al Qaeda .
At the same time , the U.S. military has shown it can adapt to such a fight .
Indeed , when it finally improved its position in Iraq , the change was driven by a vastly enhanced ability to find the enemy .
The physical network of small outposts was linked to and enlivened by a social network of tribal fighters willing to work with U.S. forces .
These elements , taken together , shone a light on al Qaeda in Iraq , and in the glare of this illumination the militants were easy prey for the small percentage of coalition forces actually waging the campaign against them .
Think of this as a new role for the military .
Traditionally , they ’ve seen themselves largely as a “ shooting organization ” ; in this era , they will also have to become a “ sensory organization . ”
This approach can surely work in Afghanistan as well as it has in Iraq — and in counterinsurgency campaigns elsewhere — so long as the key emphasis is placed on creating the system needed for “ finding . ”
In some places , friendly tribal elements might be less important than technological means , most notably in cyberspace , al Qaeda ’s “ virtual safe haven . ”
As war shifts from flanking to finding , the hope is that instead of exhausting one ’s military in massive expeditions against elusive foes , success can be achieved with a small , networked corps of “ finders . ”
So a conflict like the war on terror is not “ led ” by some great power ; rather , many participate in it , with each adding a piece to the mosaic that forms an accurate picture of enemy strength and dispositions .
This second shift — to finding — has the potential to greatly empower those “ many and small ” units made necessary by Rule 1 .
All that is left is to think through the operational concept that will guide them .
Rule 3 : Swarming
Is the New Surging .
Terrorists , knowing they will never have an edge in numbers , have pioneered a way of war that allows them to make the most of their slender resources : swarming .
This is a form of attack undertaken by small units coming from several directions or hitting many targets at the same time .
Since 9/11 , al Qaeda has mounted but a few major stand - alone strikes — in Bali , Madrid , and London — while the network has conducted multiple significant swarming campaigns in Turkey , Tunisia , and Saudi Arabia featuring “ wave attacks ” aimed at overloading their targets ’ response capabilities .
Such attacks have persisted even in post - surge Iraq where , as Gen. David Petraeus noted in a recent speech , the enemy shows a “ sophistication ” among the militants “ in carrying out simultaneous attacks ” against major government targets .
Perhaps the clearest example of a terrorist swarm was the November 2008 attack on Mumbai , apparently mounted by the Lashkar - e - Taiba group .
The assault force consisted of just 10 fighters who broke into five two - man teams and struck simultaneously at several different sites .
It took more than three days to put them down — and cost the lives of more than 160 innocents — as the Indian security forces best suited to deal with this problem had to come from distant New Delhi and were configured to cope with a single threat rather than multiple simultaneous ones .
In another sign of the gathering swarm , the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia , rather than being a blast from the Cold War past , heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack .
In this instance , Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time .
Indeed , the distributed denial of service attack , long a staple of cyberwarriors , is a model form of swarming .
And in this instance , Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers .
Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict , but its lineage is quite old .
Traditional tribal warfare , whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters , always featured some elements of swarms .
The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th - century Mongols , who had a name for this doctrine : “ Crow Swarm . ”
When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen , but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets , the khans called it “ Falling Stars . ”
With such tactics , the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen , and kept it for a few centuries .
But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century , which strongly favored massed volley fire .
Industrial processes encouraged even more massing , and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms .
Now again , in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies , even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption .
There is an old Mongol proverb : “ With 40 men you can shake the world . ”
Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence , a master of the swarm in his own right .
Liddell Hart , writing in 1935 , predicted that at some point “ the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere , yet assailable nowhere . ”
Now , swarming is making a comeback , but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return .
For the implications of this development — most notably , that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing .
The most radical change is this : Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size , if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner .
Instead of continually “ surging ” large numbers of troops to trouble spots , the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly , in small numbers , and strike the attackers at many points .
In the future , it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm .
Almost 20 years ago , I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm .
Art Cebrowski , the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan , the great American apostle of sea power .
He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks , embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “ sensors and shooters . ”
We disagreed , however , about the potential of networks .
Cebrowski thought that “ network - centric warfare ” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools — including aircraft carriers — for some time to come .
I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy , one made up of small , swift vessels , many of them remotely operated .
Cebrowski , who passed away in late 2005 , clearly won this debate , as the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “ few - large ” force — if one that is increasingly networked .
In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt ’s and my ideas , the Navy even has a Netwar Command now .
Swarming has also gained some adherents .
The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper , who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game , “ Millennium Challenge 2002 , ” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict .
But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on , the referees were instructed to “ refloat ” the carriers , and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued .
Van Riper walked out .
Today , some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming , mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat .
But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms .
What if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously ?
If they ever do , it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system .
Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond , less costly but more lethal .
The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it .
Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys , respectively , to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time .
A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower — easily two - thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces .
The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “ horse soldiers ” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001 .
Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally , with ample reserves for relieving “ first waves ” and dealing with other crises .
At sea , instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large , increasingly vulnerable supercarriers , the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons .
Given their stealth and multiple uses , submarines would stay while carriers would go .
And in the air , the “ wings ” would reduce in size but increase in overall number , with mere handfuls of aircraft in each .
Needless to say , networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies , large or small .
Is such a shift feasible ?
Absolutely .
Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new .
The massive demobilization after World War II aside , active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War .
But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking .
But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted ?
Failure awaits , at ruinous cost .
The most likely form catastrophe could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons .
Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden ’s hands would give him great coercive power , as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can .
Deterrence will lie in tatters .
If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon , he will come from a terrorist network .
Within the U.S. military , the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change .
I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s , repeated mantra - like , all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen .
The irony , however , is that the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change .
Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress , and so , whatever the Pentagon asks for , it gets .
As for defense contractors , far from driving the agenda , they are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand ( rather than , perhaps , something better ) .
If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller , smarter weapons and systems to support swarming , they will get them .
Beyond the United States , other countries ’ security forces are beginning to think along the lines of “ many and small , ” are crafting better ways to “ find , ” and are learning to swarm .
Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction .
Russian ground forces are , too .
Needless to say , terrorist networks are still in the lead , and not just al Qaeda .
Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel , a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network — in which the network more than held its own .
For the U.S. military , failing a great leap forward in self - awareness of the need for radical change , a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach — despite President Barack Obama ’s unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security - related expenditures .
This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels , to be followed by several years of , say , 10 percent annual reductions .
To focus the redesign effort , a moratorium would be declared on all legacy - like systems ( think aircraft carriers , other big ships , advanced fighters , tanks , etc. ) while they are subjected to searching review .
It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent .
To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems , this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous .
But being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves .
This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades , whether in farming or in industry .
Why should the military be exempt ?
There ’s real urgency to this debate .
Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce - driven globalization , but conflict and violence have persisted — even grown — into a new postmodern scourge .
Indeed , it is ironic that , in an era in which the attraction to persuasive “ soft power ” has grown dramatically , coercive “ hard power ” continues to dominate in world affairs .
This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security , nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts .
But this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small , most notably the United States , whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy .
From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran , and on to longer - range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security , the United States today is heavily invested in hard - power solutions .
And it will continue to be .
But if the radical adjustments in strategy , organization , and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored , Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense .
Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows .
Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily , and concepts like “ deterrence ” and “ containment ” of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind .
So it has always been .
Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs .
History tells us that these developments were inevitable , but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them — and tragedies upon tragedies ensued .
There is still time to be counted among the exceptions , like the Byzantines who , after the fall of Rome , radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years .
The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who , in their eras , caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it , saving the world from darkness .
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Turkey ’s political and military leaders meet on Thursday as a storm gathers over a coup plot investigation against the armed forces which is threatening stability and investor confidence in the EU - candidate country .
Tension between the ruling AK Party , which has roots in political Islam , and the secular armed forces risks rising yet further during the day when prosecutors question former commanders of the air force and navy , and may charge them .
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah
Gul are due to meet armed forces chief General Ilker Basbug at 11 am ( 0900 GMT ) but room for compromise to prevent the crisis from spinning out of control is limited .
Twelve officers , some of them admirals , have already been charged with plotting in 2003 to overthrow the government which hardline secularists believe harbors a hidden Islamist agenda .
Commanders of the military , whose role as guardian of Turkey ’s secular system has been eroded by European Union - backed reforms , have already warned of a “ serious situation ” after an emergency meeting to discuss the investigation .
The former air force and navy chiefs being questioned on Thursday are merely the most high profile among 50 detained officers .
“ The room for a compromise in the short - term is closing , ” said Eurasia Group analyst Wolfango Piccoli .
“ The most immediate risk is that the military may react stridently in public against the arrests , which could deepen the already tense tussle with the government . ”
Adding to the concerns , Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya said on Wednesday he was looking into statements made by two AK deputies .
But he has not reached the stage of opening a formal investigation against the party .
If he does so , it could prompt a call for snap elections by the AK Party , which narrowly survived a bid by Yalcinkaya to have it banned for anti-secular activities in 2008 .
Parliamentary elections are due in 2011 .
The growing crisis has already taken its toll on Turkey ’s financial markets .
Turkish stocks closed down 3.4 percent and the lira hit a seven - month low on Wednesday .
The AK Party , first elected in 2002 in a landslide victory over established parties blighted by corruption and accusations of misrule , is also embroiled in a dispute with the judiciary -- another pillar of the orthodox establishment .
The military has ousted four governments since 1960 , but has said the days of coups are now over .
( CNN ) --
A leading Republican senator is calling for the ouster of President Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , the latest salvo in a political fight over the handling of the failed Christmas Day bombing suspect .
Sen . Kit Bond , R- Missouri , the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee , said Tuesday that John Brennan , Obama 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism , " needs to go . "
Brennan contends
Republicans are playing politics by criticizing the administration 's decision to charge bombing suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab in criminal court instead of turning him over to military interrogators .
In an opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today , Brennan accused critics of the administration 's handling of AbdulMutallab of " politically motivated criticism and unfounded fear mongering . "
Such behavior " only serves the goals of al Qaeda , " Brennan wrote .
" Terrorists are not 100 - feet tall , " Brennan wrote , adding it was naive to think that putting AbdulMutallab in military custody as opposed to the civilian court system would have made any difference .
" The suspect gets access to a lawyer , and interrogation rules are nearly identical , " Brennan 's commentary said .
Bond responded that Brennan was no longer credible , calling him a " mouthpiece for the political arm " of the White House .
Bond 's response was first reported by the National Review Online , and CNN verified the accuracy of Bond 's comments with his office .
Asked for comment on Bond 's criticism , White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said in an e-mail to CNN : " Through his pathetic attack on a counter - terrorism professional like John Brennan who has spent his lifetime protecting this country under multiple administrations , Sen .
Bond sinks to new depths in his efforts to put politics over our national security . "
The issue has become a leading attack point for the GOP , with other congressional Republicans also criticizing Brennan on Tuesday .
In a statement , House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan said that Brennan 's " cheap , irresponsible political smear does n't help keep the American people safe . "
" This administration has no clear plan to identify , confront and defeat avowed terrorists as terrorists instead of treating them as common criminals , " the lawmakers ' statement said .
AbdulMutallab allegedly attempted to detonate explosive material sewn into his underwear aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day .
Republican criticism focuses on what GOP legislators have called a missed opportunity to interrogate AbdulMutallab instead of providing him with U.S. criminal rights .
These critics contend that AbdulMutallab should be treated as an enemy combatant .
At recent congressional hearings , Rep. Peter King , R - New York , accused Brennan of failing to keep Congress informed of the investigation into the failed Christmas Day plot .
King maintained Brennan " has set up an iron curtain of secrecy in the White House . "
Brennan and Attorney General Eric
Holder argue that charging terror suspects in the United States in criminal court is policy that dates back several administrations and was reaffirmed in the Bush administration .
In addition , Brennan said he has briefed senior Republican leaders about AbdulMutallab 's interrogation and the information the suspect has been providing investigators .
On Sunday , Brennan told NBC's " Meet the Press " that Bond and other top Republicans in Congress were informed AbdulMutallab was in FBI custody hours after his arrest and none asked if he would be transferred to military custody .
" I 'm tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football , " Brennan said on the NBC program , adding : " They 're unknowing of the facts , and they 're making charges and allegations that are not anchored in reality . "
The GOP leaders knew that " FBI custody means there 's a process that you follow as far as Mirandizing and presenting him in front of a magistrate , " Brennan said Sunday .
" None of those individuals raised any concerns with me at that point .
They did n't say , " Is he going into military custody ?
Is he going to be Mirandized ? ' "
Bond later said Brennan never informed him of plans to read AbdulMutallab his Miranda rights , which include the right to remain silent .
" If he had , I would have told him the administration was making a mistake , " Bond said Sunday .
NOEL Edmonds ' wife was being questioned by police last night over why she has failed to smother him in his sleep .
Liz Edmonds admitted during a radio interview that despite the viewing public 's prolonged suffering , she has always resisted the temptation to crush 300 aspirin and mix them into his Cheerios .
She described a pact she made with Edmonds that no matter what quiz show , Christmas surprise show , or demented political platform he attempted to foist on Britain , she would keep her high - earning husband alive .
Detective Superintendent Bill McKay said : " A woman from Gloucestershire is helping us with our enquiries into Mr Edmonds ' continued existence .
" All we can say is that this woman had the opportunity , the means , and like any sentient being with an ounce of decency and respect for her fellow humans , the motive . "
He added : " I have to say that after Edmonds announced his plan for a quiz show starring a monkey , we fully expected her to walk into the station the next morning with the pillow and a signed confession . "
Meanwhile Ignitas , the Swiss euthanasia clinic , has offered to help British television presenters who desperately need to stop existing as soon as possible , including Edmonds , Andrew Marr and that awful Kay Burley from Sky News .
The clinic is also involved in a protracted dispute over what it clams is its legal right to kill Jonathan Ross .

Time Magazine has enthusiastically jumped on the bandwagon to back Microsoft executive Craig Mundie ’s call for Internet licensing , as authorities push for a system even more stifling than in Communist China , where only people with government permission would be allowed to express free speech .
As we reported earlier this week , during a recent conference at the Davos Economic Forum , Craig Mundie , chief research and strategy officer for Microsoft , told fellow globalists at the summit that the Internet needed to be policed by means of introducing licenses similar to drivers licenses – in other words government permission to use the web .
His proposal was almost instantly advocated by Time Magazine , who published an article by Barbara Kiviat – one of Mundie ’s fellow attendees at the elitist confab .
It ’s sadistically ironic that Kiviat ’s columns run under the moniker “ The Curious Capitalist , ” since the ideas expressed in her piece go further than even the free - speech hating Communist Chinese have dared venture in terms of Internet censorship .
“ Now , there are , of course , a number of obstacles to making such a scheme be reality , ” writes Kiviat .
“ Even here in the mountains of Switzerland I can hear the worldwide scream go up : “ But we ’re entitled to anonymity on the Internet ! ” Really ?
Are you ?
Why do you think that ? ”
Kiviat ludicrously compares the necessity to show identification when entering a bank vault to the apparent need for authorities to know who you are when you set up a website to take credit card payments .
“ The truth of the matter is , the Internet is still in its Wild West phase .
To a large extent , the law has n’t yet shown up .
Yet as more and more people move to town , that lawlessness is becoming a bigger and bigger problem .
As human societies grow over time they develop more rigid standards for themselves in order to handle their increased size .
There is no reason to think the Internet should n’t follow the same pattern , ” she writes .
[ efoods ]
“ The people in charge — as much as anyone can be in charge when it comes to the Internet — are thinking about it , ” Kiviat barks in her conclusion , seemingly comfortable with the notion that shadowy individuals and not the Constitution itself are “ in charge ” of deciding who is allowed free speech .
Despite Kiviat ’s mealy - mouthed authoritarianism and feigned reasonableness in advocating such a system , Mundie ’s proposal is little different to a similar system already considered by officials in Communist China to force bloggers to register their identities before they could post .
At the time the idea was attacked by human rights advocates as an obvious ploy “ by which the government could control information ” and crack down on dissent .
Indeed , the proposal was deemed too severe and the Chinese government eventually backed down .
So a system considered too authoritarian and too much of a threat to freedom in Communist China is seemingly just fine and dandy in the “ land of the free , ” according to Kiviat and her ilk .
Unfortunately for her , Kiviat was immediately reminded about what makes the Internet such a threat to the ruling elite for whom she is a well - trained apologist – almost every comment below her article disagreed with her .
“ No .
A thousand times no .
This benefits no one but “ the people in charge , ” wrote one respondent .
“ Drivers ’ licenses ensure a basic level of driving competency , so that 13 - year - olds do n’t get drunk and drive into a schoolbus .
That kind of stupidity does n’t happen on the Internet .
Enough security theater !
Focus on actual security .
Truly awful idea , Barbara . ”
“ I , for one , welcome our new internet overlords .
It will be a comforting time when “ the law ” comes along to protect people from themselves on the net , because gosh darn it , freedom is dangerous , ” quips another .
“ Not to mention , standards only ever come about through coercive government action , and never through private parties responding to their own incentives . ”
I think bloggers ought to be fingerprinted , DNA tested for abnormalities and have the information safely stored in a government vault .
That way when some authoritarian ruler of pit , decides you have broken his self made tyrannic law he can prosecute you , ” jokes another respondent .
“ For being a journalist you sure are s—-d , anonymity protects the right of free speech especially when the scary internet is most dangerous in a nation that prosecutes freedom of speech and opinion .
The biggest thugs and criminals you mentioned are corrupt governments .
I bet you love China ’s safe internet measures huh ?
But there are worse than China . ”
“ The internet is the only thing preventing total tyranny right now , and they are trying everything they can to chill free speech .
There is NO grass roots movement anywhere calling for government intervention in the internet .
It is not broken .
It works too well , that is a problem for tyrants , ” points out another .
Shortly after Time Magazine started peddling the proposal , the New York Times soon followed suit with a blog this morning entitled Driver ’s Licenses for the Internet ?
which merely parrots Kiviat ’s talking points .
Of course there ’s a very good reason for Time Magazine and the New York Times to be pushing for measures that would undoubtedly lead to a chilling effect on free speech which would in turn eviscerate the blogosphere .
Like the rest of the mainstream print dinosaurs , physical sales of Time Magazine have been plummeting , partly as a result of more people getting their news for free on the web from independent sources that do n’t feed at the trough of the military - industrial complex .
Ad sales for the New York Times sunk by no less than 28 per cent last year with subscriptions and street sales also falling .
“ The Internet , where newspapers are generally free , has siphoned off circulation and advertising , ” conceded an October 2009 NY Times article , which is precisely why establishment publications like the Old Gray Lady and Time are pushing proposals that would strangle the blogosphere and in turn eliminate their competition – while devastating free speech all in one foul swoop .

What The Government Can Teach You About Personal Finances
When it comes to the government and money there are a lot of diverse opinions .
No matter what you think about the government ’s fiscal responsibility , one thing is for certain .
Many Americans could learn at least one lesson from the government that will transform their personal finances .
What the Government Knows About Taxes
In the book , The Automatic Millionaire , David Bach spurs the question , How does the government always get their taxes ?
The government takes their tax payments off the top before you even have access to it .
This is true unless you are self employed and the government then requires you to make a quarterly tax payment .
The government wants to have access to the money first .
They do n’t trust you with the money because you might just blow it all before you get it .
So they make you to complete a W - 4 and they take their money before you get your money .
Sometimes we even get generous and pay more income tax than we should .
Do you trust yourself with money ?
If the government takes taxes out as soon as you get paid and you have paid all your taxes , do n’t you think that would be a good strategy for saving ?
Almost every banks and investment broker have some automatic savings features .
6 Advantages of Automatic Savings
Simplicity – Many great financial plans fail because they are too complicated .
It is far better to have a financial plan that works than one that just looks good on paper .
If you are not disciplined enough to maintain the plan , it is too complicated .
As an example , many people fail at budgeting because the budget is too complex .
A simple budget is the solution .
Compensates for a lack of discipline – Many people acknowledge that saving money requires discipline .
Discipline that too many openly admit they do not have .
When it comes to automatic savings you only need to be disciplined enough to initiate the process .
From there , the less attention you pay to your savings the better .
Once you have set up your budget all you need to is cruise .
Emotional benefits – Some people find it emotionally burdensome to save .
They think about how they could have got this or that .
They then feel bad that they are saving so much for tomorrow without the chance to live it up today .
However , when you ‘ forget ’ you are saving money you can mentally disconnect from the process .
In addition , when it comes to saving with the stock market you ’ll have less worrying , analyzing , and fretting about the right time .
When that predetermined day for your deposit arrives , it will be the right time .
Better for smaller accounts –
If you are trying to save into something like a mutual fund or index fund , then smaller frequent payments actually give you access to funds that you might not otherwise have been able to buy .
Many funds decrease their minimum amount required when you set up an automatic purchase plan .
Results – Do n’t argue with results .
This is a proven and effective method for saving money .
Since it has worked for generations there is no reason to think it is going to stop working now .
Time savings – Time is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity .
Automatic savings help you have a larger rate of return and saves you time , energy , and effort in the process .
Just think about it like a ball at the top of the mountain .
You just need to give it a little push and it will do the rest by itself .
All you need to do is organize your finances and then you no longer have any additional time investment .
Do you do automatic saving or investing ?
Why or why not ?
if it ’s catchy , why bother with the science ?
One of the anti-vaxxer 's favorite cliches is that too many vaccines overwhelm growing immune systems .
But that claim falls apart when we look at the contents of the vaccines themselves .
Illustration by Erik Anderson
Too many , too soon is one of the sacred mantras of the anti-vaccination movement and its sympathizers who are looking for any remotely plausible argument which would paint vaccines as some kind of poison turning an entire generation of children autistic .
Ok , so you can show that timerosal used in vaccines had nothing to do with autism and that the type of mercury it contained was n’t a neurotoxin .
You could even tackle the big issue of how autism is diagnosed and whether parental age has something to do with a rise in the number of diagnosed cases over the last decade and have sound science on your side .
But you certainly can’t debate a threefold increase in vaccinations over the last thirty years .
And if you ca n’t debate that , you certainly could n’t say that three times as many vaccines means that kids ’ immune systems are n’t being overwhelmed , right ?
Actually , yes .
You could .
The number of vaccinations is actually a misnomer used to make an argument which firmly casts vaccines as either the villain in today ’s pediatric problems , or at least a suspect cause .
What has been missed by TV personalities promoting this fallacy , like Bill Maher and Joy Behar , is the fact that today ’s vaccines are much more efficient than those given when they were kids .
The initial seven vaccines of the late 1970s have been doubled in the last 30 years but their actual antigen load has been lowered from 3,000 to just about 150 , only 5 % of what the people making this argument were exposed to in their childhoods .
For the too many too soon argument to be true , we ’d need to see the same kinds of pediatric problems a generation ago and with far greater frequency than we do today .
If we were n’t overwhelming immune systems back then , how could we possibly be doing it today with a twentieth of the antigens ?
And yet , this is the argument being made by the alt med and anti-vaccine crowd .
Either someone is trying to apply the homeopathic idea of dilution and potentization to vaccines , or we ’re not being given the relevant fact for the sake of keeping the manufactroversy going .
And even if doctors on TV will keep bringing up the massive drop in antigen loads thanks to modern technology , the anti-vaxers will keep on using it by bringing up their other favorite chant .
They ’ll blame unnamed toxins in vaccines and say that while there are far less antigens , there must be more toxins in the greater number of vaccines .
How do these toxins cause whatever pediatric problems they want to blame on them ?
They do n’t know , but the lack of evidence for their position is n’t going to keep them up at night for the simple reason that they can blame doctors for doing bad research to protect their Big Pharma friends or just demonize those who disagree with their agenda as enablers of infanticide .
Meanwhile , after vilifying well tested , well proven medical technology , putting almost every study of their efficacy into question over the tiniest if or but , they ’ll sprinkle industrial mining chemicals on their autistic kids ’ breakfast after seeing a testimonial on an anti-vax blog and call it battling autism .
Give that a moment to sink in .
Highly refined , thoroughly tested and very successful vaccines that expose kids to around 150 antigens or roughly 5 % of what their parents received in their early childhood are overwhelming immune systems of infants who are exposed to billions of bacteria and viruses from birth .
However , a mining chemical which contains benzene , a known carcinogen , comes with no clinical proof of its safety and efficacy , and is marketed by testimonials is perfectly safe to sprinkle over their gluten - free waffles .
Yes , maybe it ’s not going to actually harm anyone if it ’s extremely diluted or administered in small enough quantities , but maybe , just maybe a group with this kind of approach to medical science has its priorities skewed and is n’t a reliable source of information on immunology .
So rather then simply repeating the chant of too many too soon , some of the aforementioned TV personalities could take a minute to look up a few studies , read a couple of medical blogs and ask a couple of pointed questions once in a while .
Just a thought …
" This was not an easy decision , " he said Tuesday night , reading a brief statement on Tennessee 's campus .
" This is something that happens very quick .
We 've been here 14 months , and the support has been unbelievable here .
I really believe the only place I would have left here to go was ... Southern California . "
The hiring was first reported by ESPN.com .
" We are really excited to welcome Lane Kiffin back to USC , " Garrett said in a statement .
" I was able to watch him closely when he was an assistant with us and what I saw was a bright , creative young coach who I thought would make an excellent head coach here if the opportunity ever arose .
I 'm confident he and his staff will keep USC football performing at the high level that we expect . "
Kiffin , the former Oakland Raiders coach , led the Volunteers for only one season .
Kiffin has been on the move of late .
He was 7 - 6 in his one season at Tennessee and 5 - 15 in one - plus seasons with the Raiders before being fired in September 2008 .
He was a member of the USC coaching staff from 2001 to ' 06 , first as wide receivers coach and then as offensive coordinator under Carroll .
Kiffin 's contract calls for him to pay a $ 800,000 buyout for leaving Tennessee after only one season .
" Those payments shall be made in monthly installments over a 36 - month period , " the contract reads .
It was not immediately clear if USC would pay any of that sum .
Tennessee will now make a run at Texas defensive coordinator Will Muschamp to replace Kiffin , a source close to the situation told ESPN.
com 's Chris Low late Tuesday .
Texas has said that Muschamp will succeed Mack Brown as Longhorns head coach , but no timetable has been set for that transition .
The source says that Muschamp is Tennessee 's No. 1 target .
Meanwhile , a source with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN.
com 's Gene Wojciechowski that several members of Tennessee 's Board of Trustees have contacted former Vols coach Phil Fulmer about the possibility of becoming either athletic director or even football coach , but not both .
The same source says Fulmer was receptive to those inquiries .
Tennessee athletic director Mike Hamilton indicated on Wednesday that Fullmer is not a candidate , and the Board of Trustees issued a statement saying that approaching candidates is the responsibility of the AD .
For now , Tennessee wide receivers coach Kippy Brown , who joined Kiffin 's staff less than four weeks ago , will be named interim coach .
He had been given the opportunity to follow Kiffin to USC as well , sources told Low .
Meanwhile , sources close to the school told ESPN's Shelley Smith on Tuesday night that a deal is being worked on in hopes of bringing longtime offensive coordinator Norm Chow back to USC in the same capacity .
Chow 's agent , Don Yee , said Wednesday afternoon there was contact initiated by a USC representative who expressed serious interest in Chow .
Yee said the conversation was brief but both sides agreed to talk again in the near future .
Yee was adamant there was no prior contact or negotiations with himself , Chow or with Carter Chow , an attorney with Yee 's agency who is the son of the UCLA offensive coordinator .
The current UCLA offensive coordinator held that position with USC from 2001 - 04 .
He was also the coordinator at Brigham Young from 1973 - 99 , at NC State in 2000 and with the Tennessee Titans from 2005 - 07 .
Kiffin will bring his father and defensive coordinator , Monte Kiffin , and assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron to Southern California with him .
Orgeron was with the Trojans for seven seasons before becoming the head coach at Mississippi and then an assistant with the New Orleans Saints .
Lane and Monte Kiffin and Orgeron will hold a news conference on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET in the Heritage Hall Varsity Lounge at USC .
Some USC players were excited about the hiring of Kiffin .
" It 's great news , " starting quarterback Matt Barkley told ESPNLosAngeles.com 's Steve Mason .
" I remember meeting Kiff way back on the recruiting trail when I was a freshman in high school .
I liked him when I met him .
I like that he knows how to live and breathe the Trojan way . "
Barkley , who was tapped by Carroll to start as a true freshman and helped lead the team to a 9 - 4 record and a victory in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26 , also expressed relief that there will be stability in terms of offensive system .
" It 's comforting to know that not a lot is going to change , " Barkley said .
" Kiff will have his own way of doing things , but I 'm glad the offense is n't going to be a whole lot different . "
Running back Marc
Tyler is also on board .
Plastics and the BPA Story
Bisphenol A is a material used in hard , lightweight plastics called polycarbonates .
Some baby bottles and water bottles are made from bisphenol A. Enormous amounts of BPA are produced each year -- about 6 billion pounds .
Although bisphenol A came to fame on the nightly news as a potential poison in our water bottles , our main exposure comes from the linings of canned foods , according to Vandenberg , who studies BPA .
" Over a dozen studies clearly show that BPA is not only leaching from cans , but it reaches the food stored inside , " says Vandenberg .
The BPA we ingest gets into our bloodstream .
Regular monitoring by the CDC shows that more than 90 % of us have detectable levels of bisphenol A in our bodies .
Among all the other plastic substances that get into our food , BPA stands out , according to Vandenberg , for its ability to disrupt the functions of hormones -- especially estrogen .
Hundreds of studies show that high doses of BPA disrupt reproductive development and function in laboratory animals .
Levels in humans were thought to be too low to be of concern , but more recent research has challenged that perception , Vandenberg tells WebMD .
" Several animal studies suggest that BPA has effects at much lower doses than previously believed , " says Vandenberg .
" The levels of BPA in people frequently exceed the levels shown to have effects in rodents in these studies , " she adds .
Chemical industry sources are quick to point out that this " low - dose hypothesis " has not yet been proven .
They cite studies that have not shown harm from BPA at low doses in rodents .
However , a new study in a prestigious journal also shows the low - dose BPA effect not just in rats but in monkeys , whose systems are more like humans .
One large , well - conducted study in humans showed that people who had high levels of BPA in the urine had a higher rate of diabetes , heart disease , and liver toxicity .
Altogether , Vandenberg believes a " fragile consensus " exists among scientists that BPA might be harmful .
" Looking at the data we have , there is no reason to conclude we are all safe from BPA 's effects , " she tells WebMD .
At this point the odds are that in response to the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression , we will do … nothing .
And while there is plenty of blame to spread around , it ’s important not to be too even - handed .
The fact is that the Democrat - controlled House has already passed a pretty good reform bill .
But in the Senate , well , here ’s what the FT reports :
Senate Republicans are resisting a fundamental tenet of the Obama administration ’s financial regulatory reforms in another obstacle for the stalled legislative process .
Several aides from both parties involved in reform negotiations told the Financial Times that Republicans had opposed in private a plan to impose tougher capital and liquidity requirements on companies that posed a risk to the financial system .
That ’s tantamount to opposing any real reform .
You might think that the GOP would pay a political price for this .
But it already has its strategy : insist that black is white .
The right - wing group “ Committee for Truth In Politics ” seems to have taken the advice of the postmodernist Frank Luntz , and cast new regulations on Wall Street , which Wall Street is furiously attempting to kill , as a giant favor to Wall Street .
And they ’ll probably get away with it .

A recent academic study by economists Karl Case , John Quigley , and Robert Shiller of consumer - spending behavior in the U.S. and 13 other developed nations indicates that the wealth effect from housing is twice as great on consumer spending as comparable changes in stock - market wealth .
In the U.S. , for example , they found that a 10 - percent gain in housing prices would provoke an average 0.62 - percent increase in consumption , while a similar jump in stock - market wealth only elicited about a 0.3 - percent to 0.2 - percent increase in spending ( Barron ’s , April 15 , 2002 ) .
What enabled these economists to derive these answers is econometric modeling .
In the natural sciences , a laboratory experiment can isolate various elements and their movements .
There is no equivalent in the discipline of economics .
The employment of econometrics and econometric model - building is an attempt to produce a laboratory where controlled experiments can be conducted .
The idea of having such a laboratory is very appealing to economists and politicians .
Once the model is built and endorsed as a good replica of the economy , politicians can evaluate the outcomes of various policies .
This , it is argued , enhances the efficiency of government policies and thus leads to a better and more prosperous economy .
It is also suggested that the model can serve as a referee in assessing the validity of various economic ideas .
The other purpose of a model is to provide an indication regarding the future .
By means of mathematical and statistical methods , an econometrician establishes functional relationships between various economic variables .
For example , personal consumer outlays are related to personal disposable income and interest rates , while fixed capital spending is explained by the past stock of capital , interest rates , and economic activity .
A collection of such various estimated relations — i.e. , equations — constitutes an econometric model .
A comparison of the goodness of fit of the dynamic simulation versus the actual data is an important criterion in assessing the reliability of a model .
( In a static simulation , the equations of the model are solved using actual lagged variables .
In a dynamic simulation , the equations are solved by employing calculated from the model - lagged variables ) .
The final test of the model is its response to a policy variable change , such as an increase in taxes or a rise in government outlays .
By means of a qualitative assessment , a model builder decides whether the response is reasonable or not .
Once the model is successfully constructed , it is ready to be used .
Despite the aura of importance and mysterious wisdom that econometric modeling projects , it is nevertheless an empty vessel .
The econometric modeling procedure employs an untenable methodology : it tries to capture human behavior by means of mathematical and statistical methods .
Is the mathematical method valid in economics ?
By applying mathematics , mainstream economics is attempting to follow in the footsteps of natural sciences .
In the natural sciences , the employment of mathematics enables scientists to formulate the essential nature of objects .
In short , by means of a mathematical formula , the response of objects to a particular stimulus in a given condition is captured .
Consequently , within these given conditions , the same response will be obtained time and again .
The same approach , however , is not valid in economics .
For economics is supposed to deal with human beings and not objects .
According to Mises ,
The experience with which the sciences of human action have to deal is always an experience of complex phenomena .
No laboratory experiments can be performed with regard to human action .
The main characteristic or nature of human beings is that they are rational animals .
They use their minds to sustain their lives and well - being .
The usage of the mind , however , is not set to follow some kind of automatic procedure , but rather every individual employs his mind in accordance with his own circumstances .
This makes it impossible to capture human nature by means of mathematical formulae , as is done in the natural sciences .
In short , people have the freedom of choice to change their minds and pursue actions that are contrary to what was observed in the past .
As a result of the unique nature of human beings , analyses in economics can only be qualitative .
Furthermore , to pursue quantitative analysis implies the possibility of the assignment of numbers , which can be subjected to all of the operations of arithmetic .
To accomplish this , it is necessary to define an objective fixed unit .
Such an objective unit , however , does n’t exist in the realm of human valuations .
On this Mises wrote , " There are , in the field of economics , no constant relations , and consequently no measurement is possible . "
There are no constant standards for measuring the minds , the values , and the ideas of men .
Valuation is the means by which a conscious purposeful individual assesses the given facts of reality .
In other words once an individual establishes what the facts are , he then assesses which out of these established facts are the most suitable to attain his various ends .
Individual goals or ends set the standard for valuing the facts of reality .
For instance , if the goal of an individual is to improve his health , then he would establish which goods will benefit his health and which will not .
Among those that will benefit him , some will be more effective than others .
There is no way , however , to quantify this effectiveness .
All that one could do is rank these goods in accordance with perceived effectiveness .
The use of mathematics in economics poses another serious problem .
The employment of mathematical functions implies that human actions are set in motion by various factors .
However , this is an erroneous way of thinking .
For instance , contrary to the mathematical way of thinking , individual outlays on goods are not " caused " by real income as such .
In his own context , every individual decides how much of a given amount of income will be used for consumption and how much for savings .
While it is true that people respond to changes in their incomes , the response is not automatic , and it cannot be captured by a mathematical formula .
For instance , an increase in an individual ’s income does n’t automatically imply that his consumption expenditure will follow suit .
In other words , every individual assesses the increase in income against the goals he wants to achieve .
Thus he might decide that it is more beneficial for him to raise his savings rather than raise his consumption .
The validity of probability theory in economics
While mathematics is the key tool of econometric methods , the foundation of econometrics is probability theory .
What is probability ?
The probability of an event is the proportion of times the event occurs out of a large number of trials .
For instance , the probability of obtaining heads when a coin is tossed is 50 percent .
This does not mean that when a coin is tossed 10 times , five heads are always obtained .
However , if the experiment is repeated a large number of times , then it is likely that 50 percent will be obtained .
The greater the number of throws , the nearer the approximation is likely to be .
Alternatively , say it has been established that in a particular area the probability of wooden houses catching fire is .01 .
This means that on the basis of experience , on average , 1 percent of wooden houses will catch fire .
This does not mean that this year or the following year the percentage of houses catching fire will be exactly 1 percent .
The percentage might be 1 percent each year or not .
Over time , however , the average of these percentages will be 1 percent .
This information , in turn , can be converted into the cost of fire damages thereby establishing the case for insuring against the risk of fire .
Owners of wooden houses might decide to pool their risk , i.e. , spread the risk by setting up a fund .
In other words , every owner of a wooden house will contribute according to a certain proportion to the total amount of money that is required in order to cover the damages of those owners whose houses will be damaged by the fire .
Note that insurance against the fire risk can only take place because we know its probability distribution and because there are enough owners of wooden houses to spread the cost of fire damage among them so that the premium will not be excessive .
In this regard , these owners of wooden houses are all members of a particular group or class that will be affected in a similar way by a fire .
We know that , on average , 1 percent of the members of this group will be affected by fire .
However , we do n’t know exactly who it will be .
The important thing for insurance is that members of a group must be homogeneous as far as a particular event is concerned .
In economics , however , we do n’t deal with homogeneous cases .
Each observation is a unique , nonrepeatable event caused by a particular individual response .
Consequently , no probability distribution can be established .
Again , probability distribution rests on the assumption that we are dealing with a nonparticular , and so repeatable , event .
Let us take for instance entrepreneurial activities .
If these activities were repeatable with known probability distributions , then we would not need entrepreneurs .
After all , an entrepreneur is an individual who arranges his activities toward finding out consumers ’ future requirements .
People ’s requirements , however , are never constant with respect to a particular good .
The assumption that econometrics makes -- that probability distribution exists and can be quantified -- leads to absurd results .
For it describes , not a world of human beings who exercise their minds in making choices , but machines .
Human activities , however , cannot be analyzed in the same way that one would analyze objects .
To make sense of historical data , one must scrutinize them not by means of statistical methods but by means of trying to grasp and understand how they emerged .
Econometric models have nothing to do with the reality .
Given the fact that human beings are governed by freedom of choice , the various policy analyses by means of models , known as " what if " or multiplier analyses , are little more than children ’s games and cannot be taken seriously .
After all , to assume that a change in government policy would leave the structure of equations intact would mean that individuals in the economy ceased to be alive and were , in fact , frozen .
Another major problem with most econometric models is that they are designed along the lines of Keynesian economic thinking .
Thus the main variable in these models is gross domestic product , which is explained within the model framework by the interactions between various lumped data known as aggregates .
The interaction between various aggregates in the model framework gives the impression that the economy is about gross domestic product , or about balance of payments , but not about human beings and human life .
Obviously this runs contrary to the fact that everything in the human world is caused by man ’s purposeful conduct .
To improve an econometric model ’s capability as a forecasting tool , econometricians often employ various tricks .
The predictive capability of each equation in the model is checked against actual data , and the difference between the actual data and the data obtained from the equations , also known as the add factor , is extrapolated forward and incorporated into the models equations .
In many instances the forecast produced by an econometric model is heavily influenced by the add factor which allows the model builder to force the outcome of the forecast in line with his " gut feelings . "
Most people are not aware of these tricks and believe that the model alone generated the outcome .
All this casts a shadow on the " scientific " procedures employed by econometric modeling .
Furthermore , one should not forget the suspect quality of the data out of which econometric models are constructed .
In short , econometric models are nothing more than glorified play .
On this Mises said ,
As a method of economic analysis econometrics is a childish play with figures that does not contribute anything to the elucidation of the problems of economic reality .
Conclusion
Rather than viewing econometric models as a sophisticated technique that can discover the hidden truth about the economy , we should regard them as clumsy and expensive extrapolative devices , which have nothing in common with reality .
Anyone who decides to use models as an analytical tool or a forecasting device runs the risk of seriously confusing himself .
Former vice presidential candidate and Facebook fan Sarah Palin has taken to the social networking site again , this time in response to Sunday ’s “ Family Guy ” episode that appeared to mock her developmentally disabled son Trig .
Palin went on Facebook just before 1 a.m. this morning calling out “ Fox Hollywood ” as a “ disappointment ” ( Palin was recently hired as a paid contributor for Fox News ) .
The animated show , which aired Sunday night , included a scene where Chris Griffin goes on a date with a domineering girl with Down Syndrome , who says her dad is an accountant and “ my mom is the former governor of Alaska . ”
The post starts with a message from Sarah Palin , and includes a message from her daughter , Bristol ( in italics ) :
People are asking me to comment on yesterday ’s
Fox show that felt like another kick in the gut .
Bristol was one who asked what I thought of the show that mocked her baby brother , Trig ( and / or others with special needs ) , in an episode yesterday .
Instead of answering , I asked her what she thought .
Here is her conscientious reply , which is a much more restrained and gracious statement than I want to make about an issue that begs the question , “ when is enough , enough ? ” :
“ When you ’re the son or daughter of a public figure , you have to develop thick skin .
My siblings and I all have that , but insults directed at our youngest brother hurt too much for us to remain silent .
People with special needs face challenges that many of us will never confront , and yet they are some of the kindest and most loving people you ’ll ever meet .
Their lives are difficult enough as it is , so why would anyone want to make their lives more difficult by mocking them ?
As a culture , should n’t we be more compassionate to innocent people – especially those who are less fortunate ?
Should n’t we be willing to say that some things just are not funny ?
Are there any limits to what some people will do or say in regards to my little brother or others in the special needs community ?
If the writers of a particularly pathetic cartoon show thought they were being clever in mocking my brother and my family yesterday , they failed .
All they proved is that they ’re heartless jerks .
– Bristol Palin ”
– Sarah Palin
The cartoon aired just days after Palin slammed White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and radio talk host Rush Limbaugh for using the word “ retard . ”
45 seconds of play , ~5 hours of desperate hacking .
A few days ago , my 4 year old daughter was playing with my mobile phone running Android 1.6 .
To let her play with the screen while avoiding any mishap , I locked the phone .
It was obviously not enough , she instantly found the MENU key to unlock it .
So I had the brilliant idea to put on a locking pattern , the pretty method used on Android to really lock the screen .
After 5 unsuccessful tries , which my daughter reached in about 15 seconds , the pattern unlocking incurs a 30 - second guard delay .
I decided that the game was too risky ( I found out later there ’s also a 20 - try hard limit , but we did n’t reach it ) and took my phone back .
There , I had another brilliantly fatal idea : I clicked on the “ forgot the unlock pattern ” button which just appeared , just out of curiosity to see what would happen next .
The phone asked for my Gmail account and password .
I filled the requested information , but it did n’t unlock the phone ; apparently this is a known Android bug that I did n’t know about .
And , contrary to what I naively assumed , there was no way to get back to the unlock pattern screen .
I rebooted the phone .
No change , no escape .
Then it dawned on me that I was 600 kilometers away from home , for almost a full week , without all my computer tools .
And I was locked out of my own phone .
On the plus side , I had another almost usable ( EDGE ) mobile connection , and quickly found out a hack to clear the lock pattern using the Android SDK tools .
I needed a Windows or Linux PC , but I had one at hand .
So I happily began downloading the 23 MB Android SDK zip file .
It stuck at 5 MB .
I tried again .
It stuck again at the same size .
Something crappy , either ( most probably ) in my mobile provider ’s network or Google servers .
Long story short : I ssh‘d at home to get the SDK through wget .
scp ’d it .
Got stuck at 5 MB again .
sftp ‘d it in 5 MB chunks instead .
Finally got it where I needed it .
Installed it , started it .
Discovered that I needed to fetch the USB driver for Android … which is a 6 MB download .
I ’m sure you can guess what happened next ; no ssh fallback this time since this download is integrated within the Android SDK tools 🙁
( apparently there were standalone USB drivers available , but I did n’t find these until it was too late )
That ’s when I fortunately remembered I had installed the JFv1.43 custom recovery code on my phone , which you can activate by pressing the HOME key while powering up the phone .
So I did , I started a single - user mode root shell directly on the phone , mounted the / data and / system partitions , and as described in the fix I referenced above , ran “ update system set value=0 where name=’ lock_pattern_autolock ’ ; ” .
Reboot .
No way .
I was still stuck on the Gmail login form .
After a bit more wrestling with SQL , looking at the system table , I finally found out the cure to my problem :
update system set value=0 where name=’lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently ’;
Reboot .
I got access to my phone , at last , after 5 hours of cursing .
I love Android .
What other phone would let me do this ?
Lessons learned :
do n’t play with or ( worse ) monkey - test security systems , especially when away from home ;
set up a recovery shell for future use , to cater for possible bugs ;
Android is still a bit rough on the edges , to put it nicely ;
it ’s nice to always have a real computer handy ; and possibly a spare IP connection , too ;
I ’m glad Android makes this kind of hacking possible , almost easy and legit .
Things that I think should really be changed in the Android locking pattern behavior :
do n’t count ( or significantly raise ) the number of unlocking failures before asking for the Gmail login ( What if the phone is in my pocket ?
A child plays with it unattended ? ) ;
fix the old bug that prevents unlocking ( at least in my case , but I do n’t seem to be alone ) with the Gmail account : given that it was so fast to reject the password , it clearly did n’t test it to Google over the data connection ; so I wonder if that screen is n’t just a mock - up , which would be perverse but is supported by the name of the variable lockedout permanently ;

It 's been less than a year since the iPhone 3GS launched , and the rumor mill is already churning out speculation about an upcoming iPhone 4G , expected as early as May .
New rumors have been circulating over the past couple of days , saying a new Apple iPhone 4G will be available by June , or even as early as May .
Besides the earlier - than - expected launch date ( new iPhone models traditionally come out in June or July ) , potential new features are in discussion as well , such as a better camera , an OLED screen , a removable battery , and different casing .
A Bloomberg / BusinessWeek report quotes an analyst from the Goldman Sachs Group saying the iPhone 4G would have a better camera than the 3 - megapixel shooter found on the iPhone 3GS .
The iPhone 4 G 's camera could offer up to 5 megapixels , which would put it on the par with the camera in Google 's Nexus One .
The story also speculates that Apple is working on an updated version of the iPhone OS with an overhauled App Store .
The analyst in the Bloomberg story did not identify who gave him the information , but speculates the iPhone 4G will go into production as early as April , with availability expected sometime in June or July .
Derailing from the usual July / July launch timeframe though , is a report originating from a French Web site , which claims we are likely to see the next generation iPhone in May .
The report says Apple targeted May because it thought that 's when Google would release their Nexus One Android smartphone .
Actually , the Nexus One was unveiled earlier this month .
Is it like that Apple would move up the release of a new iPhone to compete with Google ?
Maybe .
But it does n't seem likely that Apple would misjudge Google 's launch date by several months .
Also this week , a report from Korea Times quoted unnamed mobile executives claiming the iPhone 4G will have an OLED screen and support for video chat .
Most surprisingly , it claimed that the upcoming iPhone would feature a removable battery -- though the chances of this happening are slight ( Apple refused to use removable batteries in all three generations of iPhones and its latest laptops also sport non-removable batteries ) .
All in all , some of these rumors are plausible , such as the OLED screen and a better camera , though earlier launch dates as soon as May might seem a bit far - fetched , as Apple usually refreshes products in a yearly cycle .
NASHUA , N.H. 
The Internal Revenue Service and 37 states are cracking down on companies that illegally try to trim payroll costs by changing employees ' status to independent contractors , The Associated Press has learned .
The practice costs governments billions in lost revenue and can leave workers high and dry when they are hurt at work or are left jobless .
Many who 've studied the problem believe it 's worsened during the economic downturn — fueling states to be even more aggressive with their recovery efforts .
By designating workers as independent contractors , businesses can save as much as 30 % of payroll .
They can also avoid unemployment insurance and workers ' compensation payments , as well as the employer 's share of payroll withholding .

On the back of your desktop computer , somewhere on the power supply unit , there might be a little red switch that toggles between 110/115 and 220/230 volts .
You ’ve probably never had to use that little switch , and you ’ve likely avoided flipping it unnecessarily , lest bad things might happen .
In fact , had it not been for the preceding sentences , you might not have even thought of that switch for at least a few more years .
That had certainly been the case for Byron Schield , until he took a new job as an “ IT Generalist ” for a burgeoning logistics provider .
“ Hey , Bryant … err Brandon … Brian ? ”
The IT manager was clearly struggling to remember Byron ’s name .
In fairness , it was Byron ’s first day – his first minute of his first day – and they had only met one time before .
“ Byron !
Yes , Byron .
Can you run to Workstation 306 ?
The PC there is having some issues . ”
Byron had n’t even taken off his jacket , let alone received any introductions , allocated workspace , overview on the network infrastructure , or even any tools for diagnosing and fixing computer problems .
But no matter , after a good thirty minutes of searching , he finally located the 300 block of workstations .
Now had it been a normal office building , it would n’t have taken him half an hour to find a numbered workstation .
But the logistics company had very recently relocated to 500,000 square - foot factory , and the obsolete “ to loading bay ” and “ hardhat required ” signs offered him no navigational help .
Let the diagnosis begin
Having found Workstation 306 amid a grid of other desks , Byron went to diagnose the problem to the best of his abilities .
The first clue that something was amiss was the fact that the computer did n’t have a working power light .
Initially , he assumed it was a hardware problem , but when he plugged in a radio to the outlet , he immediately noticed it did n’t turn on .
Plus , the PC started just fine after plugging in to another outlet .
“ It looks like it ’s an electrical problem , ” Byron proudly told the employee at Workstation 306 , “ the wall outlet does n’t work properly . ”
“ Oooooh of course , ” the worker said , slapping his forehead , “ an executive from the states used my workspace yesterday and I forgot to flip the switch back . ”
“ The switch ? ”
“ Ah yes , the electrical infrastructure is rather weird in this building , ” he explained .
“ Since the executive comes from the US , he can not plug into the 240 volt outlet I normally use .
Because they forget their power adapters so often , we just put in a few switches that allow electric currents to be changed for the entire electrical group . ”
Byron was even more confused .
“ So why can the other people still work if they change this on room level ? ”
“ Well , ” he explained , “ I am one of the few that can not change current on the PC itself .
The others run on 120 v trough a red switch on the back .
Heh , you do n’t know how many representatives used to plug their laptops into a 240 v outlet ! ”
A wiring problem
Having never been trained as an electrician , Bryon ’s knowledge on the topic was limited , but it seemed pretty obvious how things were setup .
The entire factory was capable of handing both the US 120v currents , and the European 240v .
Most of the PC ’s in the building had a little red switch that allowed them to utilize either of the currents , but some users ( such as the one he was helping ) did n’t have such a switch .
So instead , there was a switch at the wall outlet for his .
Electrical current was configured to be different throughout the factory , though .
One of the rooms more often used by US executives ran on 120 v , most of the workgroups ran on 240v , and the large factory hall ran on 120v .
It all struck Byron as rather odd , but since it was his first day , he did n’t really want to complain .
Besides , he knew that the building still needed to complete renovations , and he had assumed that the voltage would be fixed soon .
Well that , and he was still rather baffled about not receiving introductions or even given any “ new employee ” paperwork to fill out .
Over the next few days , Byron quickly learned what being an “ IT Generalist ” was all about .
As it turned out , currents were switched rather often due to the representatives moving around the factory .
Before they plugged in , Byron would have to switch to 120v and , when they left , he ’d switch back to 240v .
One room in particular was pretty obnoxious , since it was a quarter - mile journey from his desk to the electrical safety box outside the room and back .
Having switched that particular room over thirty times in a period of four days , he was growing rather weary of the trip .
Especially after his boss told him to “ swap it back to 120 v ” just after he returned from switching it to “ 240 v . ”
Back and forth , back and forth , ad infinitum
Frustrated over the constant back - and - forth trips , Byron angrily opened the box and angrily slapped the voltage switch into the needed position .
And less than a second later , It happened .
He heard an ear - shattering BANG from the factory floor .
A few seconds later , while he was still recovering from the daze the sound had caused , he heard a lot of screams from the floor .
Running that way , he smelled some foul odor resembling burning rubber .
Arriving at the factory floor , he saw a mess .
Some people sat dazed and stupefied from the blast , a few where running about , and a quite a few were uttering quiet swears at the mess .
It seemed almost not a single of the 50 or so PC ’s worked anymore .
Most had smoke around them and two or three were actually on fire .
After ( literally ) putting out the fires and spending the next week repairing the computers , Byron ’s boss filed his report on what happened .
Apparently , he had accidentally hit two switches in the safety box : in addition to the small room for the executives , he also set the main factory floor to 240v .
Unfortunately , the circuit breakers did n’t quite function correctly and took quite a while to break the circuit .
Fearing that he ’d get fired and possibly even sued for negligence , Byron was surprised when the entire incident was swept under the rug .
Since the factory - turned - office did n’t exactly meet safety guidelines in its current state , it would have been rather “ unfortunate ” for the incident to have been made public .
Even better , Byron was never asked to switch voltages again .
As his boss sarcastically put it , “ having you run around like that was a real blast , but I prefer to keep it at one blast ! ”
NEW YORK – Once again the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is threatening New Yorkers by making draconian cuts to bus and subway service , this time especially for students and seniors .
One loses track of how many times the authority has done this over the past few years .
While the MTA board usually backs down from the most horrific of its planned abuse of New Yorkers , each time there are at least some cuts , either fare increases or service reductions – or both .
This time is both similar to , and different from , the previous go - arounds .
What is different is that the proposed service reductions are even worse than past “ doomsday ” scenarios .
What is the same is that no cuts or fare increases are actually necessary .
Big cuts proposed
New Yorkers are already reeling from fare hikes and service cuts , but now the MTA wants to do more .
In December the board voted to axe the W and Z trains , as well as 21 bus routes .
They ’ve agreed to cut the number of trains per hour on all the other lines .
At night , trains are slotted to run only once every 30 minutes .
But perhaps most egregious of all is the treatment of students and seniors .
Under the new rules , students will no longer get free or reduced fare Metrocards , meaning that New York will become one of the only cities in the country that does n’t bother to give its students a way to get to school .
This undermines the basic democratic right to an equal education for all ( a right that has never been fully realized in this country , and , to the extent that it has been achieved at all , has been severely eroded over the past few decades ) .
Effects on young people
In this city ’s school system , young people apply to high schools .
That is , they try to get into the best high schools in the city , either a “ flagship ” school like Stuyvesant or the Bronx School of Science , or a school that specializes in a certain field .
A lower - income student who excels at his or her coursework in predominantly African American East New York can apply to Stuyvesant , and , if accepted , receive a stellar education .
The questions have to arise :
Why ca n’t all of our city schools be as good as Stuyvesant ?
What about the fact that schools in poorer areas , where students are mainly racially and nationally oppressed , are invariably worse off economically than those in wealthier , whiter neighborhoods ?
Yes there is , at least , the possibility of applying to and getting into a top - notch school .
But getting into a school means nothing if you can’t actually get there .
Without the free Metrocards , that student in East New York , along with his or her family , will have to decide :
Spend the money ( $ 4.50 per day , $ 22.50 per week , about $ 90 per month ) to get to Stuyvesant , or forego the opportunity and go to the local school .
In an area where more than one in five people live in poverty , that extra $ 90 amounts to a significant monthly wage reduction and is simply impossible .
Unequal impact
This will affect all working people , but the racist dimensions cannot be ignored : African Americans and Latinos will be disproportionally affected .
The same goes for seniors , who will have their Access - a - Ride service cut .
Currently , seniors can call Access - a- Ride and get picked up from their home and brought where they need to go .
This system has been riddled with problems – talk to any city senior and listen to the stories of incredibly long wait times – but , once again , we have an “ at least ” situation : at least seniors were able to get around .
Now , Access - a- Ride service will be trimmed , and our older residents will be picked up and brought only to the closest accessible subway station .
Hopefully their destination subway station wo n’t be an inaccessible one ( without an elevator or escalator ) !
Since most stations are non-accessible , areas around these stations will simply become no - go areas for our older population .
What kind of city treats its younger and older generations like this ?
Solutions
The public has learned not to trust the MTA , a shadowy authority known for keeping at least two sets of books .
But even if it is true that there is a $ 383 million deficit in the MTA ’s budget , there are ways to fix the problem without these abominable cuts .
City Council ’s plan
The newly elected City Council , more progressive than the old , has started a campaign against the cuts , and has put forward a realistic plan to alleviate a huge portion of the deficit .
The plan is as follows :
• Reallocate 10 percent of direct stimulus aid to MTA operating expenses ( this should generate about $ 91.5 million )
• Use budgeted PAYGO capital funds for operating ( $ 50 million )
• Reallocate 10 percent of additional stimulus transit aid via state to operating expenses ( $ 30 million ) .
This plan is , of course , not perfect .
Allocating money away from the capital fund , which is used for new projects , such as the Second Avenue subway line , is harmful .
It holds up important projects , and would stop the creation of jobs that such projects bring about .
This is important , and ca n’t be overlooked .
Nonetheless , the situation is extreme .
If the City Council plan is the best we can win for now , it has to be supported .
But we New Yorkers should , while supporting that , be fighting for something more as well .
Giveaways to the rich
As the People ’s World reported earlier , the MTA has made numerous sweetheart deals with developers , most notably around the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn ( itself a miserable debacle pushed by Mayor Bloomberg ) .
That project represents a giveaway of hundreds of millions of dollars to a private developer .
We should demand that this deal be canceled .
Why should some private business be given tens of millions to make hundreds of millions , while our brothers and sisters , especially the oldest and youngest , are made to suffer ?
Put the burden on those who can afford it
We should demand that the Fair Share Tax , won only recently , not be allowed to sunset , and that it be increased .
Instead of essentially taxing students ’ families a huge percentage of their income by cutting the reduced - fare Metrocard , why not tax the wealthiest few , those who can afford it , directly ?
For the same reason , there should be another surcharge on the wealthiest New Yorkers .
The fight is not over .
We have until June before these cuts are scheduled to go into effect .
On our side is the City Council , tens of thousands of students who are organizing , a number of state senators and Assembly members , Transport Workers Union Local 100 ( which itself would share a special pain if these cuts go through ) – in short , the vast majority of New Yorkers .
We can stop these cuts and put the whole progressive movement in a better position .
The question is how big of a victory we can achieve .

A leading medical journal has formally retracted a paper that caused a decade - long battle over links between the three - in - one childhood MMR vaccine and autism .
The paper , published in the journal Lancet in 1998 and written by British doctor Andrew Wakefield , suggested the combined measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) shot might be linked to autism and bowel disease .
His assertion , since widely discredited , caused one of the biggest medical rows in a generation and led to a steep drop in the number of vaccinations in the United States , Britain and other parts of Europe , prompting a rise in cases of measles .
" It has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield ... are incorrect , " said the internationally renowned journal in a statement .
A disciplinary panel of Britain 's General Medical Council ( GMC ) ruled last week that Wakefield had presented his research in an " irresponsible and dishonest " way and shown a " callous disregard " for the suffering of the children he studied .
It also ruled he had brought the medical profession " into disrepute " .
' Proven to be false '
The Lancet said that following the GMC ruling , it was now clear that certain parts of Wakefield 's paper were wrong .
It highlighted claims in the original paper that children investigated for the study " consecutively referred " and that investigations were " approved " by the local ethics committee , and said these had now been " proven to be false " .
" Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record . "
Wakefield , who now lives and works in the United States , has always defended his work and accused those who argued against him of making " unfounded and unjust " allegations .
The GMC is now considering whether Wakefield is guilty of serious professional misconduct , which could lead to him being struck off Britain 's medical register .
Vaccination rates
Dr Adam Finn , professor of paediatrics at Bristol University , welcomed the Lancet 's move but says it had been too long coming .
" This is not before time .
Let 's hope this will do something to re-establish the good reputation of this excellent vaccine , " says Finn .
A rise in parents ' refusal to have their children vaccinated because of fears of links to autism has caused a rise in measles cases in the United States and parts of Europe in recent years .
Data released last February for England and Wales showed a rise in measles cases of more than 70 % in 2008 from the previous year , mostly due to unvaccinated children .
Vaccination rates are now recovering and Wakefield 's research has been discredited worldwide .
Professor Peter McIntyre of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases based at Westmead Hospital , Sydney says the paper has had little to no effect in Australia .
He says approximately 95 % of Australian children receive the MMR vaccine by the age of 2 years .
" There are a few pockets where it is a bit lower , such as the Sunshine Coast and northern New South Wales , " says McIntyre .
" But this is more to do with lifestyle choice . "
Last year a report in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation said that the high take - up rate of the MMR vaccine had led to the elimination of the endemic measles virus in Australia .
WASHINGTON — Kent Conrad vaulted from North Dakota tax commissioner to the U.S. Senate in 1986 on the strength of a startling pledge :
He would quit and go home if the federal deficit was n't " brought under control " during his first six - year term .
The deficit that year hit a record $ 221 billion .
Six years later it topped $ 290 billion .
This year , it 's expected to hit $ 1.6 trillion .

Robert Mugabe mocks a nation facing famine with a birthday feast broadcast on TV
' Senseless ' : Robert Mugabe 's birthday celebration cost £ 330,000
Eight thousand lobsters and 4,000 portions of caviar were eaten last night at a birthday party for Robert Mugabe which was broadcast live to a nation facing famine .
The £ 330,000 televised feast to celebrate the Zimbabwe president 's 86th birthday came as crop failure and drought raised the prospect of widespread hunger in the poverty - stricken country .
Mugabe 's political opponents , the Movement for Democratic Change , said the food served was enough to feed 50 villages .
The MDC branded the 12 - hour all - night gala a ' senseless extravagance ' .
Also on the menu were 200lb of prawns and 500 bottles of whisky .
Guests at the party in Bulawayo were entertained by a Jamaican reggae star flown in specially and more than 30 musicians .
The revelry began at 6 pm and was not due to wind up until 6 am .
The Zimbabwean leader celebrated his birthday last Sunday and has already attended a number of parties , including one at the Chinese embassy in the capital Harare .
Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for 30 years and overseen the country 's economic collapse .
He had expected taxpayers to pay for the party but had to go cap in hand to corporate supporters and friendly embassies when the MDC finance minister refused .
An MDC spokesman said the celebrations were inappropriate as the country braced itself for a tough harvest with an 11 per cent maize crop failure caused by a prolonged dry spell .
He said : ' It is not progressive for any Zimbabwean to join this senseless fray as the country faces imminent drought .
' It is lavish , careless and extravagant on the part of the organisers that they dedicate £ 330,000 to one person , an amount which could feed 50 villages .
' It is absolutely self - centred for someone to try to nationalise a birthday .
MDC members will not be part of this circus . '
Last week the EU voted to continue sanctions on Zimbabwe for another year , citing a ' lack of progress ' in implementing a power - sharing deal .
The sanctions are mainly targeted at senior ZanuPF figures and involve asset freezes as well as arms and travel embargos .
WHEN I was growing up , my parents always bought shrimp in the shell .
Why buy them peeled when the shells , boiled into an intense shrimpy glaze , add such great flavor to risotto and bouillabaisse ?
It was a convergence of their thrifty and epicurean tendencies , falling along the same lines as making pâté out of livers collected from the cavities of chickens ( back when you could still find the giblet pack in there ) and brewing broth from whatever kitchen odds and ends were on hand  lamb necks , pork bones , mushroom trimmings .
Naturally , because of this , as soon as I moved out , I bought only shelled shrimp .
I did n’t want to bother peeling the squishy , damp creatures myself .
Plus , cooking for one meant that I did n’t need to stockpile shrimp glaze in the freezer .
When I wanted shrimp glaze , my parents just brought me some .
I might never have reconsidered my shell - off inclinations if not for Fresh Direct .
Recently , wanting to buy the company ’s most environmentally friendly shrimp  wild - caught , from the Gulf of Mexico  I had no choice but to get them shell and all .
The magnitude - 8.8 earthquake that rocked Chile early this morning was similar to many breaking - news events in that images from the disaster began spreading over social networks at lightning speed .

The other day , I had some guests for dinner .
I had had a long day and was not really upto making anything elaborate .
But one cannot just serve the guests anything now , can we ?
My husband suggested that we can as well go out and eat .
I just went into the fridge to see how well it was stocked .
Umm - carrots , celery and few spring onions - not bad .
Freezer section housed peas , beans and PUFF PASTRY !
Oh yes !
Pot Pies :)
Having Puff pastry is always a boon .
Its so versatile to allow almost any kind of dishes at short notice .
With the menu decided - it took about 1 - 1/ 2 hours total to prepare these .
Most of the time was on the skillet and oven .
Not much work on prep work .
Just because Chicken or Turkey
Pot pies are famous does n't mean that there should n't be a Vegetarian one , now is there ?
Why deprive no -meat eaters a scrumptious treat ?
Any vegetables would work .
Want to add Tofu ?
Seitan ?
What about Tempeh ?
My answer to all of them is YES !
Anything goes .
Try out your favorite mix of vegetables or fillings .
Let your imaginations soar .
I have adapted this recipe from Vegetarian Times Magazine and used ingredients and proportions suited to our needs .
But what are Pot pies ?
Usually
Pot pies are flaky pastry crusts enclosing a savory filling .
There are variations to the effect that the pastry crusts can be used only to cover the top and not the bottom which is what I have done for this recipe .
I have added a mix of legumes namely chickpeas and kidney beans along with vegetables and egg pappardelle pasta .
You can use egg noodles instead .
Since its for a festive occasion , some cheese does n't hurt .
If you are still conscious about keeping it low fat , then use fat free cream cheese and low fat Cheddar .
Now to the recipe
In scholastic philosophy , writing is known as a sign – it is a sign of another sign ( the spoken tongue ) and it was created because man lived in communities and needed a means to provide knowledge to people far away ( in distance and in time ) .
Plotting the evolution of writing is fascinating and curiously virtually all lead back to one all - encompassing alphabet – as you will find out by reading this list !
10 Braille
Braille stands out as being the only tactile writing system on this list .
It was invented in 1821 by a blind Frenchman , Louis Braille , who was inspired by the “ night writing ” code of embossed dots used by the French military .
Up to that point he had been able to read books with raised letters , but this was largely impractical , especially when it came to writing .
Clearly a better system was needed , but as he found night writing to be too complicated ( it could take as many as 12 dots to represent one letter )
Braille invented his own system using a mere six dots .
It never gained much popularity during his lifetime , but since his death Braille ’s system has transformed written communication for the blind and visually impaired .
Today it has been adapted to a vast number of languages around the world .
9 Cyrillic
In the 9th century AD the Greek brothers Saint Methodius and Saint Cyril invented two alphabets , Glagolitic and Cyrillic , as a writing system for the Old Church Slavonic language .
Cyrillic , based on the Glagolitic and Greek alphabets , ultimately became the preferred system for writing the Slavic languages .
It is today used to write many of the Slavic languages ( most notably Russian , Bulgarian , Belarusian , Ukrainian , and Serbian ) as well as a number of non-Slavic languages who fell under the influence of the Soviet Union .
Throughout its history , Cyrillic has been adapted to write over 50 languages .
8 Cuneiform
Cuneiform ’s significance comes from the fact that it ’s the earliest known writing system in the world .
It first appeared in the 34th century BC amongst the Sumerians , located in what is today southern Iraq .
It was adapted to write a number of languages ( including Akkadian , Hittite , and Hurrian ) , and further served as an inspiration for the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets .
For over 3,000 years these scripts had a massive influence in the Near East , but cuneiform was gradually replaced by the Aramaic alphabet until it was extinct by 100 AD .
7 Ancient Egyptian scripts
Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally believed to have come into existence shortly after Sumerian cuneiform , around 3200 BC .
Alongside the well - known hieroglyphs , there existed two other Ancient Egyptian scripts : Hieratic ( used mainly for religious purposes ) and Demotic ( for most other purposes ) .
Outside of their significance as the writing systems for a massively important civilization for thousands of years , Ancient Egyptian ’s most lasting influence was that it served as the inspiration for the first alphabet .
6 Chinese
Chinese script , aside from its immense number of users , is noteworthy for being one of the world ’s oldest continuously used writing systems , having been in use from the 2nd millennium BC up to the present day .
The characters were originally pictographs ( each one bore a resemblance to its meaning ) and represented one monosyllabic word .
Chinese characters were adapted to write other languages due to the enormous influence China had in East Asia , such as Korean and Japanese ( based on the characters ’ meanings ) as well as Vietnamese ( based on either sound or meaning ) .
Korean and Vietnamese have since replaced Chinese with other writing systems , but the characters still exist as a component of written Japanese , kanji .
In the 20th century Chinese branched into two basic forms , traditional and simplified , after the Chinese government simplified many of the characters to promote literacy .
5 Brahmi
The numerous writing systems used in South Asia today can be traced back to the Brahmi script .
This abiguda ( a writing system in which the letters are all consonants and vowels are written as obligatory diacritics ) emerged in the 5th century BC and was used to write Prakrit and Sanskrit .
Over the next thousand years or so , Brahmi developed into dozens of regional scripts , which came to be associated with the languages of their respective region .
These descendants could broadly be classified as Northern and Southern , and with the expansion of Hinduism and Buddhism , the Southern group spread to Southeast Asia while the Northern scripts spread to Tibet .
Today , the Brahmic scripts are used throughout much of Asia ( most notably India ) , and are also used for religious purposes in areas with large Buddhist populations .
4 Arabic
Due to the large number of Arabic speakers and the extensive influence of Islam , the Arabic alphabet is the second - most widely used alphabet in the world , found mostly in Northern Africa and Western and Central Asia .
More technically , it is an abjad , a writing system in which the letters are all consonants ( Arabic script does , however , have optional vowel diacritics ) .
The alphabet arose around 400 AD ( about 200 years before Islam ) , but the rise of Islam and the writing of the Qur’an brought about significant changes for the writing system , such as the vowel diacritics .
The strong association with religion is further evident in the widespread adoption of the Arabic alphabet by non-Arabic speaking Islamic populations , including Farsi , Urdu , Punjabi , Pashto , and Kurdish speakers , along with dozens more in the past and present .
3 Greek
The Greek alphabet marked a huge leap in the development of alphabets , especially since it was the first to include vowels as individual letters .
It has existed from 800 BC through to the present day , and over its long history has been used to write Hebrew , Arabic , Turkish , Gaulish , and Albanian , among other languages .
Written Greek had previously been attempted in Mycenaean Greece , but the alphabet as we know it was the first successful attempt , which was created right before the rise of Ancient Greece .
Besides its obvious significance concerning the literature and records of Ancient Greece , its influence on other writing systems has been immense , most notably because it is the origin of the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets .
The alphabet ’s importance has since diminished — its primary functions are now the writing system for Modern Greek and mathematical symbols — but if it were not for the Greek alphabet , much of the world ’s writing would bear little resemblance to what it is today .
2 Latin
The Latin alphabet is on this list for obvious reasons .
Besides being the alphabet of the global lingua franca , English , it is also the most widely used alphabet in existence .
Derived from a variant of the Greek alphabet around 700 BC , it rapidly spread first throughout Europe , and then throughout the world .
It followed with the expansion of the Roman Empire to Western Europe , and then to Central and Northern Europe with the spread of Christianity in the Middle Ages .
Some Slavic languages also began to use the alphabet as the speakers converted to Catholicism .
European colonization then brought the Latin alphabet to the Americas , Africa , Oceania , and Asia along with the languages of the colonizers .
It became widely adopted and adapted , both among languages using other writing systems and languages that had previously had none .
1 Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician scripts
Proto -Sinaitic script was the first alphabet , and therefore the parent of nearly all the alphabetic writing systems to have existed since its emergence .
It arose in Egypt and Sinai around 1900 BC and , as previously mentioned , was inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphs .
The influence it ’s had is incredible : everything from Hebrew , to runes , the Latin alphabet , Cherokee syllabary , and Ethiopic can trace their origins to this alphabet .
Phoenician script is a direct descendant of Proto - Sinaitic and differs little from it , but , spread by Phoenician merchants throughout the Mediterranean , it became a very widely used alphabet for a number of languages .
Because of this , Phoenician branches off into many of the major families of writing systems .

DENVILLE -- A 400 - pound bear was shot and killed by authorities after it ripped through a man ’s screened porch and devoured his daughter ’s pet rabbit , police said .
The bear intruded on Joe McCabe ’s Old Boonton Road property , near the county ’s Tourne Park , around 5 p.m.
Sunday , attracting the 41 - year - old man ’s attention as it chewed on an object in the backyard .
It had also rummaged through his garbage that had been left outside , he said .
The bear had two tags in its ear , McCabe said , which means it had been observed by a state biologist .
McCabe , a hunter who has had several bear encounters on the property , said he did n’t realize the animal had eaten his 11 - year - old daughter ’s rabbit until he saw a large hole in the porch screen .
The 3 - year - old rabbit , named Blackie , was usually kept on the porch , he said , and pieces of rabbit fur and blood provided hints of its fate .
" She was devastated , " he said of his daughter .
Police found the bear in a tree near McCabe ’s home , where it was shot , Denville Police Lt. Paul Nigro said .
Police considered it a dangerous Category 1 bear , he said .
A state fish and wildlife official was expected to claim the bear ’s carcass Monday .
Darlene Yuhas , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection said she was unaware of the incident and therefore could not comment .
McCabe said he was told by local animal control officer Meredith Petrillo that he faced a $ 1,000 fine for not taking his trash indoors .
" The animal control officer said that because we left the garbage outside , they had to shoot the bear , " he said .
Petrillo deferred questions to Denville police , and Nigro did not confirm if there would be a punishment .
" The case is still under investigation , " Nigro said .
Denville law requires residents to secure their trash and prevents them from feeding wildlife , he said .
If residents want to leave their trash outside , the township sells bear - resistant garbage cans that screw down , he said .
Germany has warned internet giant Google that it might take legal action to prevent Google Street View from offering photos on the country 's cities and streets .
The country 's Consumer Protection Minister Ilse Aigner told Focus magazine that she was considering " legal steps and possible changes to the law , " to prevent Google from publishing photos taken in Germany .
Google 's Street View offers 360 - degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
The service is already available for the US , Britain , France and other countries .
Aigner said she was considering reversing a 2009 settlement whereby individuals would have to object should they not want to have their house or property photographed .
Rather , Aigner suggested , it should be Google who has to seek permission from individuals to put their data online .
Google Street View is already available for the US and several European countries .
Seen here is an image of Paris ' Charles de Gaulle square
' A millionfold violation of privacy '
The minister described the images on Google street view as " a millionfold violation of privacy rights . "
" No secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " Aigner said .
Google rejects the criticism , saying that it had been granted the permission to take the pictures under the 2009 settlement with the German authorities .
The deal included a provision that licence plates and faces would be blurred and that any individual could object to the their photographs appearing online .
Google says only some hundred people so far had objected .
The internet company plans to make the street view service available later this year .

When it ’s said and done , < br /> will she spit it out or swallow ?
I was recently talking to a male friend about sex and what - not — you know , the usual — when he told me that he would never kiss a girl who had just gone down on him .
Really ?
Really ?
I thought that kind of mentality was a thing of the past , along with shoulder pads and MC Hammer pants , but the distaste for cock is quite common .
Apparently , some guys will request the dick - sucker brushes his or her teeth , or at the very least drinks a glass of water to flush the peen - ness out .
Girls will let guys come in their mouth , only to spit it out right away .
Since when is dick so gross ?
I mean , let ’s be quite objective for just a second :
Dick certainly does n’t taste good and jizz does n’t taste like honey , contrary to what guys would love for us to think .
But , as with many things in life , you have to just suck it up and do it , which is why I ’m here to make a case for swallowing spooge .
Some girls will let the guy come in their mouth and then spit it out , but , as anybody who has tried that approach can tell you , it is not very practical .
Taking it in your mouth only to spit it out right after is quite counterproductive :
Trying to find a place to dispose of the evidence is harder than it seems , and you just end up running around with a mouthful of the cream while trying to locate the nearest bathroom .
The fastest ­— not to mention politest — way to get rid of the taste is to swallow .
As another friend puts it , “ It ’s not only good if a girl swallows , it ’s also good manners . ”
I can think of things grosser than jizz , like nacho cheese and ranch dressing ( which make me wish I could douse my salad with spunk and dip my chips in a bowl of baby gravy ) .
Anyway , semen is not some fine wine that ’s meant to be swished around to be fully savored , so the taste , good or bad , is gone as fast as you can swallow .
The one thing spooge and wine do have in common is that they are more of an acquired taste than anything .
Neither tastes pleasant the first time around , of course , but in time you learn to tolerate the taste and even appreciate the nuances and variations in flavor .
And for those of you with dietary concerns , do not fret :
A teaspoon of the good stuff has about five to seven calories and is loaded with protein .
But if you ’re still convinced that swallowing is n’t your thing , let me pose this question :
Is there really anything better than the satisfaction of a job well done ?
The same way a semester ’s worth of hard work is validated by getting an A , a mouthful of cum lets you know that all your hard work has paid off .
( After all , they do n’t call it a job for nothing , do they ? )
Coming in your mouth is like a guy ’s way of high - fiving you , except with his dick instead of his hand , which is better anyway because everybody gets to slap his hand , but not everybody gets to suck his dick .
I hope .
Now that I ’ve got the fellas ’ attention , I will turn my preaching to them for a hot second .
A quick survey confirmed that my male friend was not alone and that more guys than I thought wo n’t touch lips with a girl after getting fellated , especially if they came .
I ca n’t stress this enough :
You need to kiss your partner after getting head .
I do n’t give a shit if you ’re grossed out by it ; I just made a fucking case for girls swallowing your load !
It shows her you are comfortable with your body , and it ’s also a nice way of thanking her for spending some time in your crotch .
( A girl even told me she feels downright insulted when a guy refuses to kiss her after oral . )
Think of it as a Pavlovian experiment :
The more often you kiss her after oral , the more she will feel like it ’s okay to go down on you .
I think everybody wins there .
M. is a junior in Course 10 and , in case it was n’t clear , she swallows .

His non-life - threatening gunshot wound was treated , and he was released .
Police said the man is not planning to press charges .
( CNN ) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has recently been in the hot seat after issuing massive recalls because of problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models .
To date , 8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by the manufacturer , with the possibility of more to come after Thursday 's announcement by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of a formal investigation into brake problems with the 2010 Prius .
As the company 's woes continue to mount , there has been some speculation from critics such as Rep.
Henry Waxman , D - California , as to whether Toyota 's recent problems with sudden unintended acceleration go beyond the problems already identified .
Speaking on Wednesday to CNN's Campbell Brown , Larry Webster of Popular Mechanics magazine spoke at length on the problem , saying that " in the last decade , there have been tens of thousands of reports of sudden unintended acceleration in cars made by all the manufacturers . "
Is this true ?
The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered :
Which other car manufacturers have had a problem with sudden unintended acceleration ?
• Sudden unintended acceleration occurs when a car continues to move forward , often at increasing speeds , without the driver pressing on the accelerator pedal .
• While Toyota is basing its current recall on the possibility of floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator pedals , many factors can contribute to the problem of sudden unintended acceleration in vehicles .
Reports from the NHTSA have blamed it on many other factors , including frayed throttle cables and cracked cruise - control computers .
• The top five manufacturers of cars driven in the United States are General Motors , Toyota , Ford , Honda and Chrysler .
• The NHTSA 's online database indicates that every one of these five has received numerous consumer complaints of sudden unintended acceleration in more than one of its models .
Each manufacturer has faced a formal investigation into these complaints by the NHTSA and as a result has had to recall vehicles to fix various conditions that led to the problem .
• Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers .
According to the NHTSA database , recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan , BMW , Volkswagen , Mitsubishi , Subaru , Mercedes - Benz , Kia , Mazda , Land Rover , Suzuki and Volvo .
• In December 2009 , Consumer Reports published an article that said 41 percent of the sudden acceleration complaints received by the NHTSA in 2008 pertained to Toyota and its luxury brand , Lexus .
Ford came in second behind Toyota with 28 percent of the complaints relating to U.S. models .
• Bottom Line : Sudden unintended acceleration is not a problem limited to Toyota .
Many car manufacturers , including the other four with the largest shares of the U.S. market , have had to recall vehicles because of this issue .

Howard Wooldridge at Citizens Opposing Prohibition reports on a combined effort to lobby for a bill ending federal prohibition .
I received word this week that the major players on the Hill are now united in what direction to take regarding marijuana ; namely push for a bill to repeal federal prohibition .
COPs , MPP , DPA and NORML have all agreed on this strategy .
MPP ’s Aaron Houston produced an excellent one page sheet of FAQs .
( provided below ) .
We believe this bill will also help the ballot initiative in California to legalize adult use and sale .
It certainly seems obvious that something like this is going to have to happen eventually as a continuing ( and partial ) move toward full legalization / regulation .
And now seems to be a very good time to start getting people used to it .
It ’ll be interesting to see the reactions of federal legislators on both sides of the aisle , control freaks all , as they adjust to the notion of letting states make actual decisions without them .
Here ’s the FAQ prepared by Aaron Houston
— Regulating marijuana like alcohol —
Would a federal marijuana - regulation law be similar to the 21st Amendment that deals with alcohol ?
Yes , it would be a nearly identical model of regulation ( the “ three - tiered ” system ) , with few exceptions .
The new federal marijuana law would allow — not require — any state or territory to change its current laws that strictly prohibit marijuana , which would include the possibility of a state creating a legal and regulated market for marijuana .
As with alcohol regulation , federal law would still prohibit the “ transportation or importation into any State … in violation of the laws thereof . ”
Of course , in the case of alcohol , the 21st Amendment lays out only the broadest concepts about the structure of the law .
The Federal Alcohol Administration
Act , subsequently passed by Congress , addresses details of the regulatory system , such as permitting , consumer protection , labeling , and policing of the industry .
Would a federal marijuana - regulation law force the states to make marijuana legal ?
No , the federal law would not force states to change any existing laws or regulations , including those that outright prohibit marijuana possession and sales .
Rather , the new federal law would simply free the states to decide as they so choose .
Most Americans may not realize it today , but decades after the passage of the 21st Amendment ( which repealed the 18th Amendment that codified alcohol prohibition ) alcohol sales remained illegal in many areas of the nation .
Mississippi did not lift its prohibition on alcohol sales until 1966 , and in Kansas , on - premises sale of liquor remained illegal until 1987 .
Which federal agencies would be affected by a new regulatory system ?
The DEA and ATF would be the primary agencies impacted within the Department of Justice .
The law would add new provisions to Title 27 of the U.S. Code , which would be changed from “ Intoxicating liquors ” to “ Intoxicating substances ” and be accompanied by conforming regulations similar to the Federal Alcohol Administration Act .
Notably , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) would become the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Marijuana , Firearms and Explosives ( ATMF ) .
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau within the U.S. Treasury Department would become the Alcohol , Tobacco , and Marijuana Tax and Trade Bureau , which would be responsible for administering the new law .
What differences would there be between alcohol and marijuana regulations ?
While the repeal of alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment , repeal of marijuana prohibition merely requires an act of Congress .
Alcohol transportation and sales were made legal by an amendment to the U.S. Constitution , ratified in 1933 , at the start of FDR ’s first term .
In the following years , the power of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce in all manner of activities grew enormously , with the U.S. Supreme Court specifically affirming Congress ’ authority to prohibit or not prohibit marijuana .
One notable difference between federal alcohol laws and the proposed federal marijuana law is that the importation and exportation of marijuana would remain banned ( which is not the case with alcohol ) .

TROY --
Citing an unsafe road , the city fire department wants the state to shut down an RPI computer center building as uninhabitable .
The engineering department ticketed Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for not building an access road to the Voorhees Computer Center that can handle a fire truck .
RPI constructed a 10 - footwide road with 5 - footwide adjacent grass pavers , which are metal lattice through which grass can grow .
" They deliberately violated the New York state building code , '' which requires a 20 - footwide access road , Fire Chief Thomas Garrett said Tuesday .
" It 's hard to believe they would deliberately jeopardize the students and the faculty and put the responding firefighters ' lives in jeopardy , '' Garrett said .
Claude Rounds , RPI 's vice president for administration , said the university has improved access to the buildings and strengthened the underground support so that fire apparatus can be safely driven .
" We 're not going to tear up all the pavers and build a 20 - foot concrete access road , '' Rounds said .
He said the work was designed with environmentally friendly guidelines .
Garrett ordered firefighters not to enter the building in the event of a blaze , but would fight a fire from outside .
Garrett also wrote to the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control to shut the facility .
" At this time , I am asking and recommending that you declare this building uninhabitable due to these deliberate fire violations , '' Garrett said in a Jan. 12 letter to the state .
The fire department and RPI previously clashed over the safety of firefighters responding to calls at the campus .
A June 30 fire in a third - floor laboratory at the four - story Jonsson - Rowland Science Center left Garrett and firefighters angry when they did not know what potential hazards they faced .
The city engineering office and RPI exchanged memos on the failure to install the asphalt or concrete pavement at the Voorhees Building .
The city engineering office said the installation of this type of paver was not approved .
Rounds said the pavers were clearly shown on the plans submitted to the city .
" The fire chief and I are in agreement that this situation has to be properly dealt with , '' City Engineer Russ Reeves said .
RPI could face a fine of $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 over the incident , Reeves said .
He added that a permit fee may be levied instead .
RPI officials and Reeves met Friday to discuss access and solutions .
Reeves said these included allowing the metal lattice pavers , installing brick pavers or the 20 - foot wide asphalt road .
" It will be done to the satisfaction of the fire department , '' Reeves said .
Rounds said RPI will install concrete next to the computing building in place of the pavers there .
Repaving could not take place until spring , Reeves said .
RPI agreed to plow down to the metal surface and brush away the ice and snow until then .

KABUL , Afghanistan 
For all the fighting that lies ahead over the next several days , no one doubts that the American and Afghan troops swarming into the Taliban redoubt of Marja will ultimately clear it of insurgents .
And that is when the real test will begin .
For much of the past eight years , American and NATO forces have mounted other large military operations to clear towns and cities of Taliban insurgents .
And then , almost invariably , they have cleared out , never leaving behind enough soldiers or police officers to hold the place on their own .
And so , almost always , the Taliban returned  and , after a time , so did the American and NATO troops , to clear the place all over again .
“ Mowing the grass , ” the soldiers and Marines derisively call it .
This time , in Marja , the largest Taliban stronghold , American and Afghan commanders say they will do something they have never done before : bring in an Afghan government and police force behind them .
American and British troops will stay on to support them .
“ We ’ve got a government in a box , ready to roll in , ” said Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top American commander here .
It is probably best to leave the gods out of discussions of economic policy , but this barrier was breached in November when the CEO of Goldman Sachs , Lloyd Blankfein , told an interviewer that Goldman Sachs was doing God 's work .
Most people will never have the opportunity to join Goldman Sachs 's gang of multi-millionaire bankers .
However , by Blankfein 's logic , tens of millions of people will have the opportunity to do something at least as heavenly : walk away from their mortgage .
In Blankfein 's assessment , by aggressively taking advantages of profit - making opportunities given to them by the government and the market , Goldman Sachs is accomplishing great good here on earth .
That 's a questionable view , especially given the extent to which Goldman has been able to use its political power to tilt the playing field to its advantage , but walking away from an underwater mortgage is one way in which normal homeowners may be able to both help themselves and the economy .
The logic is straightforward .
As many as 20 million people owe more than the current value of their homes .
In most cases they have little hope of ever accruing equity in their home .
There continues to be an enormous glut of housing .
Nationwide , vacancy rates are at record highs .
Rents are actually falling for the first time since we have reliable data .
Also , temporary government supports in the form of extraordinarily low interest rates and the first time buyers ' tax credit are about to end .
It is virtually certain that house prices will soon resume their decline and will remain low for many years to come .
This means that people who are underwater today are likely to be even further underwater five or 10 years from now when they plan to sell their homes .
Not only will people end up losing money when they sell their home , but many underwater homeowners are likely to pay far more on their mortgage and other ownership costs than they would to rent the same unit .
We did calculations recently that showed that homeowners who bought near the peak in many bubble markets could easily save themselves more than $ 1,000 a month by renting equivalent units .
This means that these underwater homeowners could be throwing out more than $ 12,000 a year in a desperate effort to keep up on their mortgages .
Since most of these homeowners will never have any equity in their home , the mortgage check they send to the bank is money thrown in the garbage .
Many homeowners are concerned about foreclosure damaging their credit record .
This is a legitimate concern , but credit issuers want to extend credit .
They all know about the growth and collapse of the housing bubble .
It is likely that a foreclosure during this period will be treated less harshly than during more normal times .
Not only would it benefit millions of homeowners to send the keys back to the bank , it would also benefit the economy .
The money that homeowners save by not paying their mortgage is money that could instead be used to support consumption and boost the economy .
If 5 million underwater homeowners saved an average of $ 10,000 each by becoming renters , this would free up $ 50 bn a year for additional spending .
This would have the same impact on the economy as a $ 50 bn tax cut .
If we assume a multiplier of 1.5 on these savings , the 5 million walk - aways will generate close to 750,000 jobs .
Unfortunately , the current policy from the Obama administration goes in the opposite direction .
Rather than realistically assessing what is best for homeowners , the policy seems intended to do everything possible to persuade people to keep sending checks to the banks , even using taxpayer dollars as an inducement .
It would be far better economic policy if they sought to get people out from under their enormous mortgage debt .
This could best be accomplished by granting people facing foreclosure the right to rent their home at the market price for a substantial period of time ( five - 10 years ) following a foreclosure .
Such a measure would immediately provide housing security to the millions of families facing foreclosure .
This policy requires no new bureaucracy and would cost the taxpayers nothing .
Of course , a " right to rent " policy is likely to be costly to the banks .
This may explain why it does not appear to be on the agenda at the moment .
After all , the money saved by homeowners is money lost to banks , and this figure could easily run as high as $ 100 bn a year .
In short , homeowners who are seriously underwater in their mortgages should check the numbers .
Walking away from a home may well be the best economic choice , and in such cases , it is also likely to be the best choice from the standpoint of the economy as a whole .
This may not be advancing God 's work , but if millions of people walked away it might educate Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street bankers about what happens when everyone plays by their rules .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court has handed lobbyists a new weapon .
A lobbyist can now tell any elected official : if you vote wrong , my company , labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election .
“ We have got a million we can spend advertising for you or against you  whichever one you want , ’ ” a lobbyist can tell lawmakers , said Lawrence M. Noble , a lawyer at Skadden Arps in Washington and former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission .
The decision seeks to let voters choose for themselves among a multitude of voices and ideas when they go to the polls , but it will also increase the power of organized interest groups at the expense of candidates and political parties .
It is expected to unleash a torrent of attack advertisements from outside groups aiming to sway voters , without any candidate having to take the criticism for dirty campaigning .
The biggest beneficiaries might be well - placed incumbents whose favor companies and interests groups are eager to court .
It could also have a big impact on state and local governments , where a few million dollars can have more influence on elections .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve announced late Thursday that it was raising its discount rate in order to push banks to borrow from the private market for short - term credit .
In a statement , the Fed said it would raise its discount , or primary credit rate , to 0.75 % from 0.50 % effective on Friday .
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke signaled last week that the Fed was mulling the move .
Fed watchers had expected the move to come at the next Fed meeting in March .
Today 's action shows a sense of urgency on the part of the Fed officials .
The Fed said the move is intended to " normalize " their operations as the financial crisis winds down .
The change is not a tightening and does not signal any change in monetary policy , the Fed said .

How I work

In the average adult are 100 trillion human cells and 1,500 trillion microbes .
At best you are a little more than 10 % you .
We 're all just petri dishes with shoes .
Based on information and a quote by anyletter I keep getting asked how I work , so I thought I 'd post up some rough work here too .
Unusually I knew exactly how I was going to illustrate this quote the second I read it .
Usually though , I begin with a page or three of thumbnail sketches .
I still had to figure out exactly how the figure was going to look though .
Yes , there 's a penis .
I dropped this to make the figure a little more androgynous ( although I think the stance and body - shape is still more typically male ) .
I then looked up some types on google images , and doodled them for an hour or so , pen straight to paper ( they were so quick to draw I was n't worried about making mistakes ) .
Next I scanned the sketches .
I used live trace in illustrator to vectorise the bacteria , and added colour .
I then used a tablet to draw over the figure , fixing the shape as I went .
With those steps done I composed the final image .
I then imported this into Photoshop , and added a little noise .
Job done !
I ’m watching a new video of FOX News ’ Glenn
Beck that ’s going around , and as usual he acts like a bit of a nut .
But what ’s so disturbing is that this video is a perfect example of how Beck , and FOX generally , lie to their audience .
Let me walk you through it .
1. Beck cites CBO ( the Congressional Budget Office , an independent non-partisan congressional agency that is not tainted by politics ) numbers to show that the stimulus cost more than the President Obama thought it would .
On the order of 800 and some billion instead of 780 billion or so .
Okay , fair enough .
2 . Beck goes on to mock the President for mentioning examples of jobs saved by the stimulus .
Beck clearly implies that the stimulus has helped , at most , a handful of people , but otherwise it ’s been pretty useless .
Beck ’s proof ?
A recent CBS poll showing that only 6 % of Americans believe that the stimulus created any jobs .
Beck goes on to compare this to the number of people who think Elvis is alive , or that we never really landed on the moon .
Now , note what Beck did .
He took a survey showing that people did n’t BELIEVE the stimulus created jobs , and used that as proof that the stimulus actually did NOT create any jobs .
In fact , 6 % of the American people may not believe the stimulus created any jobs because they ’re not away of the truth .
It ’s possible .
And in fact , if you look at the independent studies of the stimulus , done by folks like CBO – the folks Glenn Beck quotes a responsible source – you ’ll find that the stimulus has done wonders for employment over the past year .
In fact :
Among people who know what they ’re talking about , the fact that the stimulus has been successful is n’t even controversial anymore .
The leading economic research firms — IHS Global Insight , Macroeconomic Advisers , and Moody ’s Economy.com — estimate that the effort has already created as many as 1.8 million jobs , and will create about 2.5 million jobs when all is said and done .
As far as the independent Congressional Budget Office is concerned , those are conservative estimates — the CBO believes the stimulus is already responsible for as many as 2.4 million jobs .
Or just check out the Wall Street Journal , they reported on the CBO study too .
Watch the video .
Beck is certainly a great entertainer .
But he ’s also one hell of a liar .
He clearly suggests that the fact that the American people do n’t realize the stimulus has worked means that is has NOT worked .
And now we know , from the very people Glenn Beck cites as his money experts , that this is a flat out lie .
The man just lies , so long as it permits him to take a cheap shot at Democrats .
Do your own research on the topic .
He lied .

LeBron James discusses changing his uniform number from 23 to 6 with Plain Dealer reporter Brian Windhorst .
Updated at 1:22 a.m. with audio
Miami --
Basking in the glow of a victory over the Heat , Cavs superstar LeBron James looked over at his idol sitting in the stands at AmericanAirlines Arena on Thursday night and made a command decision .
Out of respect to Michael Jordan , who sat courtside and watched James score 34 points , James said he is planning on switching his number after this season from No. 23 to No. 6 .
It just sort of came out , but it was obvious he 's been thinking about it for a while .
And James wants to lead a movement to get every player who wears No. 23 in the league to give it up as a tribute to Jordan .
" I just think what Michael Jordan has done for the game has to be recognized some way soon , " James said .
" There would be no LeBron James , no Kobe Bryant , no Dwyane Wade if there was n't Michael Jordan first .
" He ca n't get the logo , and if he can't , something has to be done .
I feel like no NBA player should wear 23 .
I 'm starting a petition , and I 've got to get everyone in the NBA to sign it .
Now , if I 'm not going to wear No. 23 , then nobody else should be able to wear it . "
James said his mind was almost made up , but the more he talked , the more he sounded like he was about to make an impromptu marketing shock wave .
" If you see 23 , you think about Michael Jordan , " James said .
" You see game - winning shots , you think about Michael Jordan ; you see guys fly through the air , you think about Michael Jordan ; you see fly kicks , you think about Michael Jordan .
He did so much , it has to be recognized , and not just by putting him in the Hall of Fame . "
Going to No. 6 would be a natural , and James would have to inform the league by March to change jerseys by next year .
Jordan himself changed jerseys briefly during his career , to No. 45 , and several years ago , Kobe Bryant went from No. 8 to No. 24 , so it has been done .
No. 6 is James ' Olympic number , and he has worn it in Cavs practices over the past two years .
But it has other special qualities to him .
" My second - favorite player was Julius Erving , and he wore No. 6 , " James said .
" I wore 32 in high school because Dr. J wore it at first .
My first child was born on Oct. 6 , it 's my Olympic number , my second child was born in June . "

THIS is census year in America , and although we hesitate to pre-empt the results of a mighty exercise that will involve over a million staff and whose calculations will not be complete until late December , we can confidently predict one finding .
America 's Hispanic population , which is expected to come in at almost 16 % of the total , will have overtaken its black population , likely to be put at around 2.5 percentage points less .
In 2000 , the last time this count was performed , 12.5 % of the population was Hispanic , and 12.9 % African - American .
Thanks to rapid immigration , legal and illegal , and a large stock of young people with a high birth - rate , America 's Latino population has grown twice as fast over the past decade as either its white or black population ; and the gap is going to keep on widening .
Half the babies in Texas , for instance , are born to Latina mothers , even though Latinos make up under 40 % of that state 's population .
And this is not only a phenomenon of the border states .
Many new arrivals from Mexico head directly to look for jobs in the big cities of the south - east and north - east ; and second - and third - generation Hispanics , perfectly acculturated by America 's melting pot , are now to be found everywhere .
In Chicago 's public - school district , 41 % of the students are Hispanic .
This steady advance has large consequences .
Most obviously , it is changing the balance of American politics .
The decennial census is the basis on which federal money is disbursed and seats in the House of Representatives , and consequently Electoral College votes , are allocated .
Once the results of this year 's census are known , up to 18 states will see their congressional tallies altered .
The big , mostly white , states of the north - east will be the losers .
The Hispanic - rich border region will gain : Arizona and Nevada will both pick up a seat and booming Texas may get as many as four .
Florida will also gain , though highly taxed California has seen an exodus that has counteracted its Hispanic surge .
America 's Hispanics , unlike its blacks , have traditionally failed to punch at their true weight .
In the current House of Representatives in Washington , dc , there are only 26 Hispanics , about 6 % of the total ; there are 41 African - Americans , much closer to their share of the population .
Hispanic senators have been few and far between , as have Hispanic governors .
Turning out and turning blue
One reason is that Hispanics have at least until recently been poorly organised .
But this is changing ( see article ) .
The Hispanic voter - turnout rate increases at every election .
It hit 50 % in 2008 , up from 47 % in 2004 , though that is still a lot less than the 66 % recorded by non-Hispanic whites or the 65 % by blacks .
In a fair number of keenly contested states , the Hispanic population in effect holds the balance of power ; and as long as they continue to vote solidly Democratic ( as they did in 2008 , by a whopping 67 - 31 % margin ) , that is great news for the blue party .
The big Hispanic vote for Barack Obama in Florida turned that vital state from Republican to Democratic ; the Hispanic vote also proved crucial in Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada .
It is not impossible to imagine that , in time , Texas 's huge Hispanic population could turn America 's second - largest state Democratic .
If the Republicans want to avoid that fearful fate , they need to reconnect with Hispanic voters , and fast .
In principle it ought not to be too hard .
Culturally conservative , strongly religious , family - oriented and with a long and distinguished tradition of service in America 's armed forces , Hispanics are natural Republicans .
But they are also , on the average , poorer than whites , and they are rightly incensed at anything that smacks of xenophobia .
George W. Bush managed to appeal pretty well to Hispanics , scoring an estimated 44 % of the Hispanic vote in 2004 .
But from 2005 onwards , a hysterical Republican reaction to the prospect of immigration reform ( which aimed , among other things , to regularise the position of the 12 m or so illegal immigrants living , for the most part peacefully and industriously , within America 's borders ) undid all that .
As well as the census , 2010 will see another attempt to tackle the immigration dossier .
It would be over - cynical to see this as a Democratic ploy to lure the Republicans into alienating a vital group of voters all over again .
But there is great peril for a party that is in the process of confining itself to white voters and Southern states .
If Republicans could this year once again embrace the opportunity that America 's Hispanics and its proximity to Mexico represents , they could do themselves a power of good .

Mr Walker says lessons must not be disrupted for the well - behaved Detentions where pupils are forced to listen to classical music are an effective deterrent against unruly behaviour , a head teacher has found .
Brian Walker , head at West Park School in Derby , runs the two - hour detentions , featuring Elgar , Mozart , Verdi and Bach , on a Friday after school .
Pupils on their third official warning that week can expect to attend .
As well as listening to classical music for an hour , pupils also have to watch an educational television show .
For example , they have watched the Story of Maths , programmes from the National Geographic Channel , Chinese School and the World 's Strictest Parents .
The detention has an average weekly attendance of 20 out of a total of 1,320 pupils .
Punishment structure
The detentions are meted out as part of a specific formula for behaviour at the school .
The first warning - known as a C1 or Consequence 1 - sees a disruptive pupil receive a special warning from a teacher .
If they misbehave again , pupils are given a C2 , which constitutes writing out the poem , Jerusalem - Mr Walker 's favourite .
It 's both educational and acts as a deterrent
Brian Walker , head teacher A C3 sees pupils told off by the head and an automatic two - hour Friday detention .
Mr Walker says his main aim is to stop disruptive pupils spoiling lessons for the well - behaved majority .
" These are the disrupters of learning , not the smokers , the truants or the people who are late - they are dealt with through other procedures .
" It 's those who have slowed the learning process in class for everyone and I wo n't have that , because it is robbing the rest of opportunities . "
Mr Walker says the detention serves as a positive reminder that an education is something to value .
" It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will enhance their life chances if they become a net contributor , rather than detracting from it .
" When it 's finished , there 's no anger or resentment , because it's not a punishment , but pointing out the consequences of their behaviour .
" Hopefully , I open their ears to an experience they do n't normally have and it seems many of them do n't want to have it again , so it 's both educational and acts as a deterrent . "

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday any country that tried to impose new sanctions on Iran would regret its actions , as the United States and Russia voiced shared concern about Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Ahmadinejad was speaking a day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought oil giant Saudi Arabia ’s support to help win Chinese backing for additional sanctions .
Clinton said a new round of sanctions should target Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
“ Iran will retaliate ... of course , if somebody acts against Iran our response will definitely be firm enough ... ( to ) make them regretful , ” Ahmadinejad told a news conference , without elaborating .
“ Sanctions will not harm Iran . ”
In Washington , the White House on Tuesday would not rule out any options -- including a military option -- for dealing with Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
“ I would n’t rule out anything , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a news briefing , adding that Iran ’s refusal to engage on its nuclear program was proof that the program “ is not of the means and type that they have tried to convince others that it ’s for . ”
A joint letter from the United States , Russia and France expressed concern about Tehran ’s nuclear work and said its decision to escalate uranium enrichment -- rather than implement a nuclear fuel swap -- was unjustified .
Ahmadinejad said talks were still under way on the proposed fuel exchange and the issue was not yet closed .
He did not give details , but Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was visiting Tehran on Tuesday to try to salvage the U.N. - brokered uranium exchange deal amid growing calls for new sanctions against Iran .
“ We have passed our own original proposals .
We have brought up some ideas to unlock the impasse , ” Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin told Reuters in Ankara .

The State Department said it was not aware that any talks were under way , and repeated that any negotiations would have to take place with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which brokered the fuel swap proposal .
“ That is what is on offer .
There are no new offers out there , ” State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid told a news briefing .
Western powers had hoped the IAEA proposal would result in Iran sending most of its low - enriched uranium abroad for processing and ease their concerns that it might build a nuclear bomb .
Iran , the world ’s fifth - largest crude exporter , says its nuclear program is solely to generate electricity so it can export more of its oil and gas .
“ The case is not yet closed ... we have already announced that we are ready for a fuel exchange within a fair framework .
We are still ready for an exchange , even with America , ” Ahmadinejad said .
But he added that such a swap should take place inside Iran , a likely non-starter for the West .
His order last week to start production of higher - grade uranium , rather than agree to the U.N. - brokered swap proposal , exposed Tehran to new calls for U.N. sanctions .
“ WHOLLY UNJUSTIFIED ”
The Kremlin said on Tuesday Iran could face sanctions if it failed to allay international fears about its nuclear program , and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , on a visit to Moscow , called for “ paralyzing sanctions ” on Iran .
The joint letter from the United States , Russia and France , obtained by Reuters on Tuesday , said Iran ’s move to escalate uranium enrichment was unjustified because the draft nuclear fuel deal lists guarantees for Tehran ’s benefit .
“ ( This ) is wholly unjustified ...
If Iran goes forward with this escalation , it would raise new concerns about Iran ’s nuclear intentions , ” the letter to the IAEA said .
It said the plan for Iran to swap enriched uranium for nuclear medicine fuel had legal assurances it would be fulfilled , contrary to Iran ’s assertions .
Ahmadinejad said Iran had been willing to send its uranium abroad rather than enrich it further at home , but that it had “ found that there is no goodwill in this regard . ”
He dismissed Clinton ’s accusations that Iran was moving toward a military dictatorship .
The U.S. military budget was 80 times larger than that of the Islamic Republic , he said .
“ We do n’t take her comments seriously , ” Ahmadinejad said .
He said Iran was not worried about sanctions targeting its gasoline imports as the country could become an exporter of the fuel .
“ There are several refineries under construction ... and as soon as they become operational we can even export gasoline . ”
“ They ( the United States ) imagine that they can prevent Iran ’s oil exports and it is just dreaming .
They are not able to do that , ” he said , saying the United States should instead cooperate constructively with Iran .
“ The only opportunity they have is to use Iran ’s capabilities . ”
If you ’re like most people , you probably do n’t think much about hydrogels .
Even when you encounter them  those Jell - O cubes in the school cafeteria , say , or the Sea Foam Salad you had at Grandma ’s  you probably do n’t give them a second thought .
But some scientists think about hydrogels a lot , and these materials made up of cross-linking compounds and water have come a long way in recent years .
One goal is to develop gels that are stronger and self - healing , with potential applications in tissue replacement and other medical fields .
An advance toward that goal is reported in the journal Nature .
Scientists in Japan have created such a gel , primarily of water and clay .
The key for Takuzo Aida of the University of Tokyo ; Justin L. Mynar , who is now at the University of California , Berkeley ; and colleagues was the development of a binder , a long molecule with extensive “ fingers ” at the ends , that links the clay particles into a network , trapping the water .
The bonds that form the network are relatively weak , which is what makes the material self - healing .

MOSCOW , Feb. 1 ( UPI ) --
For most of the past decade , Russian leaders and their top officials and businessmen have believed that their huge reserves of oil and gas would guarantee them prosperity and global influence for decades to come .
But suddenly some cracks are emerging in that confidence .
As often happens , technology is changing the conventional wisdom .
Over the past five years the combination of two technologies has transformed the energy market in the United States and now threatens to do the same elsewhere in the world .

The first new technology is horizontal drilling , which allows one vertical well to tap widely into a whole layer of oil or gas .
The second is hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " which involves pumping mixtures of water and chemicals into certain rock formations , particularly shale rock .
This breaks up the shale to release the oil and gas that had been trapped in the rock .
This " fracking " is a game - changer , unleashing our access to oil and gas that were hitherto out of reach .
In June 2009 the U.S. Potential Gas Committee reported that advances in extraction technology meant they could estimate U.S. gas reserves as being 35 percent higher than they were in 2007 .
" Our knowledge of the geological endowment of technically recoverable gas continues to improve with each assessment , " commented John Curtis , lead author of the report .
" Furthermore , new and advanced exploration , well drilling and completion technologies are allowing us increasingly better access to domestic gas resources -- especially ' unconventional ' gas -- which , not all that long ago , were considered impractical or uneconomical to pursue . "

Five years ago the United States was planning on building new terminals for importing liquefied natural gas .
But now some industry experts expect the United States to become a natural gas exporter .
The heady predictions that Qatar and Russia would become major exporters to the United States have to be revised .
Russia 's huge investment in the Shtokman field in the Barents Sea was predicated on exporting gas to the United States , and suddenly that market may no longer exist .
" Proven U.S. reserves have risen to 245 trillion cubic feet in 2008 from 177 tcf in 2000 , despite having produced nearly 165 tcf during those years , " says Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
" With more drilling experience , U.S. estimates are likely to rise dramatically in the next few years .
At current levels of demand , the U.S. has about 90 years of proven and potential supply -- a number that is bound to go up as more and more shale gas is found . "
But this technology is not limited to the United States .
Stephen Holditch , professor of petroleum geology at Texas A&M University , told the Groningen ( Netherlands ) Gas Conference in June 2009 that transferring the technology currently used in the United States would increase worldwide available gas reserves nine times .
Based on American experience , Holditch estimated total world shale reserves as being more than 16,000 tcf .
Annual gas consumption of the developed economies is currently around 50 tcf .
Holditch suggested reserves of some 500 tcf in Western Europe , 2,500 tcf in the Middle East and 3,500 tcf in China .

Where does that leave Gazprom , flagship of Russia 's energy industry , which had assumed massive future markets for its gas exports in Europe , China and the United States ?
John Harpole , president of U.S. company Mercator Energy , thinks he knows the answer .
" It is hard to fully appreciate the historical significance of shale gas production , " Harpole told the monthly American Oil & Gas Reporter .
" It may sound overly dramatic , but I think it will do more for freedom than anyone today can imagine . "
What he means is that Europe would no longer be so dependent on Russian gas , and Gazprom would lose much of its pricing power .
" With global shale gas development , it will be very difficult for any one country , cartel or company to force any group of users to accept a gas price , " Harpole said .
" I will go a step further and say that the United States should be exporting gas to Europe . "
The " fracking " revolution carries some further implications .
Most electricity around the world is currently produced by coal .
" Fracking " allows the coal to be replaced by much cleaner natural gas , which releases less than half as much in carbon emissions .
Moreover , gas - fueled power stations are fast and easy to spin up to full power .
This makes them the perfect partner for solar and wind technologies , which need backup power stations to take over the load when the wind drops or the sun goes down .
In short , " fracking " means the world may have much more semi-clean energy available than was assumed when the Kyoto Protocol targets on CO2 emissions were first proposed .
It is not a perfect cure because natural gas is still a fossil fuel and still emits carbon , but it changes the time horizons .

Of course , there is a catch .
Environmentalists worry that hydraulic fracturing can pollute underground water sources , although gas reservoirs tend to be at deeper levels .
There is also concern that breaking the rock structure can result in subsidence or even localized earthquakes .
Nonetheless , the real " fracking " earthquake is the way it shifts the geopolitical thinking in Moscow .
But if it drives the Russians to develop a broad - based modern economy that is not dependent on the export of oil and gas , it may prove to be a blessing in disguise for Russia 's future .

Forging passports is certainly a bad thing – but is it worse than murder ?
To judge by the international reaction to the killing of al - Mabhouh , it is much worse .
Yet it was not all that long ago that it was thought to be , well , indecent for a government to go around assassinating its enemies .
When the Government sent a group of SAS officers to murder suspected members of the IRA on Gibraltar , there was an enormous international outcry .
Britain was hauled before the European Court and severely admonished .
Would there be such a response today ?
Only if the killers forged their travel documents .
Bernard Keane hits back at Broadband Minister Senator Stephen Conroy in their ongoing war over the government 's internet filter and " blacklisted " content .
Just before Christmas , while the rest of us were engaged in hi-jinks and end - of - year japery , Stephen Conroy was a man on a mission , to correct the calumnies heaped upon him by opponents of his internet filtering proposal .
He therefore sent a Crikey a lengthy and detailed rebuttal of points made by myself and the estimable Stilgherrian .
Points to Conroy for engaging with his critics on policy detail , something a few of his ministerial colleagues should think about doing .
Alas , there are some areas in his response where Conroy was n’t , shall we say , entirely correct .
First was his claim — contra my point that his own trial saw 3.4 % of content blocked when it should n’t have been — that the trial of blocking the current ACMA blacklist was 100 % accurate .
We ’ll leave aside the point that , regardless of whether filters blocked it 100 % accurately , ACMA ’s blacklist has some serious problems and no accountability other than via leaking .
That ’s the fault of ACMA , not the Minister .
But we ’ve since learnt that the Minister was not quite correct when he said that the ACMA list had been blocked 100 % accurately in the trial .
The pro-filtering company , Watchdog International , let this slip in a study posted on its website in December and then hastily removed when its import became apparent .
Few things are forever lost to the internet , fortunately , and copies of the report remain available .
The Watchdog International paper candidly admitted that URLs containing a question mark could n’t be blocked by one of the filters being trialed .
Another filter could n’t handle URLs longer than 200 characters .
And there was the by - now well - known problem that blocking one allegedly offensive Youtube page blocked the whole site .
These problems were fixed by the URLs being removed from the trials for the affected filters .
So yes , the Minister was truthful when he boasted of the 100 % accuracy rate .
It was just 100 % after the URLs that did n’t work were taken out .
Still , tom - ay - to , tom - ah - to , surely ?

Except , the Youtube problem is n’t some small issue that can be sorted out with another line of code in the next filter update from parasites such as Watchdog who stand to profit from this .
The filtering of high - traffic sites — and the Government repeatedly emphasises it wants to block pages not sites — is very difficult , as Conroy ’s own trial demonstrated .
The Government ’s response ?
Well , I went to the Department of Broadband website to look in detail at the filtering FAQ , as Conroy had urged me .
It says :
The Government is aware of advice that adding a URL from high traffic sites to the RC Content list may have an impact on internet performance .
Owners of most popular overseas - hosted websites that provide user - generated content already have arrangements in place to take down offensive material ( including that which would reach the RC - rated threshold ) and are keen to remove content such as child s-xual abuse material .
In consultation with owners of popular overseas sites , consideration is being given to exempt high traffic sites from having their material included on the RC Content list if they implement arrangements to either take down identified RC - rated content or to block it from access by internet protocol ( IP ) addresses in Australia .
So the Government is “ considering ” allowing big sites such as Youtube and presumably others such as Wikipedia and Facebook to be exempt from the filter if they either agree to prevent Australians from looking at bad stuff , or take it down themselves .
Well that should be interesting .
Will Youtube — actual owner , Google — agree to be an agent of the Australian Government ’s censorship plans , and block Australian users from accessing Youtube content just because the Australian Government demands it ?
Let ’s take pro-euthanasia material , which under legislation enacted by that blight on Australia public life , Philip Ruddock , is banned online .
There are any number of videos on Youtube about euthanasia and suicide , some offering instructions or recommending it .
There ’s even a detailed ad for , with instructions for where to get , Philip Nitzschke ’s Peaceful Pill Handbook , which is banned in Australia , although those brave and intelligent souls at the Classification Review Board banned it not for breaching the Crimes Act for “ counselling suicide ” , but because it provided instruction in barbiturate use .
Much of that stuff must surely breach the Crimes Act and be candidates for classification as RC material ?
That brings us to another error by the Minister .
I noted that , due to his obsession with having an RC - only filter , we now had multiple enforcement regimes for online content — material was banned under the Crimes Act , material was blocked by ACMA under its flawed and tendentious filtering process , and material was blocked under Conroy ’s new RC - only compulsory filter .
Not so , said Conroy .
Keane is wrong though when he argues that “ www.childpr0n.com would be blocked under both [ the RC content list and the current ACMA blacklist ] , [ whilst ] trying to inform the terminally ill about options for euthanasia online would be blocked under one but not the other ” .
Such content is RC and would therefore be included on both the ACMA blacklist under the existing laws and the RC content list under the new scheme .
This puzzled me .
Content does not naturally become “ RC ” by itself , as if by some rotting process of morally bad material .
To get onto Conroy ’s filter , which is quite separate from ACMA ’s filter of Queensland dentists and tuckshops , the Classification Board has to classify something ( or more strictly not classify something ) RC .
So I asked Conroy ’s office to clarify .
Their response :
You are correct when you say that a URL would be added to the RC - rated content list “ ONLY if the Classification Board classified the material as RC . ”
For instance , a URL containing information that advocated how to take your life would need to be the subject of a complaint and rated RC by the National Classification Board for it to be added to RC - rated content list that will be the basis of mandatory ISP level filtering .
I ’ll take that as “ Keane is right ” , if only because I so rarely get to say that .
The point is not trivial .
Because Conroy is mortified at the idea that the filter will be painted as “ thin end of the wedge ” stuff he has pledged to fight anything that pushes it beyond RC material .
But of course that makes it more limited than ACMA ’s current filter , and means all sorts of things banned under the Howard Government ’s systematic attacks on free speech , including gambling sites , are banned or blocked in some circumstances and not others .
Oh , by the way , did you notice the reference to “ child sexual abuse material ” in the bit I quoted from the FAQ ?
References to child abuse appear something like 20 times in the FAQ .
It appears the Department of Broadband has become infected with the same obsession with kiddie pr0n that Conroy has .
Hell , Conroy probably thinks I ’m a pedophile .
“ Clearly , Keane does n’t think the government should try to limit exposure to RC - rated material online , ” Conroy informed us .
Actually , at the risk of repeating the point from my original article , Minister , I do n’t think governments should pander to voter ignorance by pretending to do something that by their own admission they can’t — like telling parents you can protect kids from “ stumbling upon ” RC material through an easily - bypassed filter .
There ’s also something interesting about what ’s missing from Conroy ’s defence , as well .
Conroy used to refer to Labor ’s election commitment to provide a safer online environment .
But , unnoticed , the phrase dropped out of his speeches and media releases early last year .
For a Government as obsessed with ensuring people knew it was keeping its commitments as this one , it was a tell - tale absence we should have wised up to much earlier : the Government ’s current proposal far , far exceeds the commitment it took to the election , which was to “ offer “ a clean feed internet service , not impose one on every user ( or at least those without the most basic internet savvy to avoid it ) .
To her credit , it took the ALP ’s own Kate Lundy to put this on the record .
Strangely , in other circumstances the Government would be screaming aloud that it had significantly exceeded its election commitment .
Why so quiet on this , Minister ?
Dear Cecil : A recent article on the Straight Dope Web site says that in a famous 1886 case the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations are " persons " having the same rights as human beings based on the 14th Amendment , which was intended to protect the rights of former slaves .
Not to nitpick , but the Supreme Court made no such decision .
If you look at the case in question , Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company , you see that the court itself never rules on personhood .
A court reporter by the name of J.C. Bancroft Davis ( a former railroad president ) snuck that " ruling " into the books .
bex , via the Straight Dope Message Board
Cecil replies :
We ’ve dealt with some weird topics in this column — quantum mechanics , penile lengthening , Circus Peanuts .
But for my money the personhood of corporations proves there ’s nothing so strange as the law .
Most people have a general idea what corporations are .
Some may even know that , for most of U.S. history , corporations have been considered “ artificial persons . ”
The concept is n’t as nutty as it sounds .
From a legal standpoint , corporations can do many of the same things that natural persons do — buy and sell property , hire and fire , sue and be sued , and so on .
What most people do n’t know is that after the above - mentioned 1886 decision , artificial persons were held to have exactly the same legal rights as we natural folk .
( Not to mention the clear advantages corporations enjoy : they can be in several places at once , for instance , and at least in theory they ’re immortal . )
Up until the New Deal , many laws regulating corporations were struck down under the “ equal protection ” clause of the 14th Amendment — in fact , that clause was invoked far more often on behalf of corporations than former slaves .
Although the doctrine of personhood has been weakened since , even now lawyers argue that an attempt to sue a corporation for lying is an unconstitutional infringement on its First Amendment right to free speech .
( This year , for example , we saw Nike v. Kasky . )
You ’re thinking :
By what tortured reasoning did the Supreme Court decide that corporations were protected by the 14th Amendment , which everyone knows was enacted to protect the rights of real people ?
Answer : Apparently it did n’t decide .
As revealed by our friend bex — and detailed by Thom Hartmann in Unequal Protection : The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights ( 2002 ) — the whole thing began as a courtroom comment by a judge , which was elevated to the status of legal precedent by an overreaching court reporter .
Here ’s what happened .
Santa Clara County in California was trying to levy a property tax against the Southern Pacific Railroad .
The railroad gave numerous reasons why it should n’t have to pay , one of which rested on the 14th Amendment ’s equal protection clause : the railroad was being held to a different standard than human taxpayers .
When the case reached the Supreme Court , Chief Justice Morrison Waite supposedly prefaced the proceedings by saying , “ The Court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution which forbids a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws applies to these corporations .
We are all of the opinion that it does . ”
In its published opinion , however , the court ducked the personhood issue , deciding the case on other grounds .
Then the court reporter , J.C. Bancroft Davis , stepped in .
Although the title makes him sound like a mere clerk , the court reporter is an important official who digests dense rulings and summarizes key findings in published “ headnotes . ”
( Davis had already had a long career in public service , and at one point was president of the board of directors for the Newburgh & New York Railroad Company . )
In a letter , Davis asked Waite whether he could include the latter ’s courtroom comment — which would ordinarily never see print — in the headnotes .
Waite gave an ambivalent response that Davis took as a yes .
Eureka , instant landmark ruling .
Does this flaky procedure mean all later cases relying on Santa Clara are null and void ?
Nope — in the world of the law , a precedent is a precedent , even if it ’s a stupid one .
However , Hartmann ’s book has caused a stir in legal circles , and some hope the Supreme Court will take another look at corporate personhood .
A few naifs think a reversal will spell the end of global corporate tyranny .
Ain’t gonna happen — fact is , the courts have been chipping away at corporate personhood for years , and you do n’t exactly see our capitalist overlords suffering from it .
But it ’d be nice to have a clear - cut ruling , say , that limiting campaign contributions by big businesses does n’t mean you ’re restricting their First Amendment rights .
Editor ’s Note :
The issue has been resolved since Cecil ’s column .

Chrome is on a roll .
It 's the fastest - growing browser in terms of market share we 've seen in a long time .
And its rapid growth corresponds with Internet Explorer 's steady decline .
Keeping that in mind though , data from last month shows that IE8 has managed to grab 25 percent of the browser market , beating all versions of Firefox to the punch .
In January 2010 , only Chrome and Safari showed positive growth .
Between December and January , Internet Explorer dropped a significant 0.51 percentage points ( from 62.69 percent to 62.18 percent ) and Firefox slipped 0.20 percentage points ( from 24.61 percent to 24.41 percent ) .
Chrome jumped a sizeable 0.57 percentage points ( from 4.63 percent to 5.20 percent ) while Safari moved up 0.05 percentage points ( from 4.46 percent to 4.51 percent ) .
Opera , on the other hand , dipped 0.02 percentage points ( from 2.40 percent to 2.38 percent ) , though we 're still hoping version 10.5 will turn things around for the little guy .
Data source : Net Applications
As you can see from the chart above , Chrome 's progress is remarkable .
Google released its browser in December 2008 , meaning the above shows you the month after its release to last month .
The month prior to that it passed Safari , taking third place overall in the browser market .
Looking back over this past year , it seems that Chrome is stealing users from Internet Explorer primarily , despite the belief of some that it would convert mainly Firefox users .
This is because Google advertises Chrome on websites that Joe Internet uses : Google.com , YouTube.com , and so on .
Furthermore , Google struck a distribution deal with Sony in September 2009 , and it will likely try to sign similar ones with other OEMs this year .
What 's really interesting is that Chrome 's gains seem to be accelerating , though this is likely because the browser is just starting to mature in terms of features .
Data source : Net Applications
In stark contrast to the success story of Chrome , Internet Explorer 's decline is easily the most noticeable trend .
Nevertheless , IE is still used by more than half of all users and IE8 is now used by one in four users on the Web .
The importance of having a default browser on the dominant operating system is still the biggest factor in browser adoption .
It seems that Firefox has stalled just below the 25 percent mark ( we 're wondering if the release of version 3.6 will make a difference in February ) .
In any case , IE8 finished 2009 by passing IE6 and now it has started 2010 by crossing the 25 percent mark .
Not too shabby .
You can see the market share pie for January 2010 , according to Net Applications , at the top of this post .
The graph just above shows how things at Ars are very different : Firefox continues to dominate , but the default browsers for Windows and Mac OS X still show their strength , and Chrome 's lead over Opera is much more significant at Ars.
Compared to last month , Firefox lost share , as did Safari ever so slightly .
Meanwhile , IE gained , as did Chrome , but Opera fell back a bit .
Once again , Chrome 's gain was the biggest change .
Taking a look at Ars browser trends over the same time period as we did above , there 's a few interesting points .
First off , Chrome started off at a much higher market share , as our readers are much more likely to try out early builds than the general population .
That said though , its huge jump in recent months is a lot more noticeable .
On Ars , Chrome is making gains at the expense of both Firefox and IE , as opposed to just IE on the Internet as a whole , which means that the predictions that Chrome would steal away Firefox users is at least partially true in the tech - savvy world .
Though most users feel anonymous when browsing the Web , their browsers constantly turn over unique information such as a list of installed plugins , screen resolution , and the user agent string .
Taken together , such bits of information can uniquely identify many users even without cookies .
But this is now old tech ; behavioral analytics firms have already moved on .
Cookies , browser signatures , and IP addresses can all help identify particular machines and particular browsers — but how can you tell which human actually sits behind the terminal at a given moment ?
One way is by measuring the " cadence " of their typing .
Scout Analytics has done just that in order to help its 40 paid content clients detect and stop those " sharing " their accounts without permission .
Imagine that you sell access to an expensive database , so expensive that users are routinely tempted to share their " named accounts " with others in the office rather than pay for additional licenses .
You would probably want to " encourage " these users to pay up or stop sharing the account , but it 's difficult to know which logins are legitimate and which are not .
Cookies , browsers , and biometrics
That 's where a company like Scout comes in .
I spoke with Matt Shanahan , VP of Strategy for the company , about a research project that Scout just concluded that tried to figure out exactly when more than one person was using a single named account .
At first , Scout of course tried using cookies to track this information , but this produced terrible data ; it suggested that six or seven different devices were being used to access each account , a number that seemed far too high to be plausible .
So Scout then added browser data , of the kind highlighted by the EFF 's recent Panopticlick project , to prevent problems like cleared cookies .
When applied to a data set of 20 million actual logins to paid content sites , this refined technique identified nearly 600,000 unique devices being used for access .
This produced a more accurate count of " cookied browsers , " but not of " actual users . "
An expensive subscription service might well be accessed by multiple people using the same central office computer , for instance , all using the same login , same browser , and same cookie .
So Scout used some Javascript timing features to watch how users type when they enter their login credentials for various services .
Shanahan says that his algorithms need a minimum of 5 attempts at entering a phrase of at least 12 characters in order to generate a typing " cadence . "
By watching repeated logins , Scout could soon categorize these cadences into a digital pattern , then assign each pattern a serial number .
" As you 're typing , you have a cadence and rhythm , " Shanahan says , a rhythm that includes how long one holds down various keys and how long it takes to move between keys .
Applying the technology to its data set of 20 million logins , Scout pulled out 175,000 unique patterns — thereby identifying 175,000 distinct users , even when they used the same login credentials on the same machine .
But only 130,000 users had subscribed to the services in question , meaning that 45,000 of the 175,000 people using the services were freeriding .
Even if cookie tracking were 100 percent accurate , it would be off by a factor of 2 - 4 x when it comes to tracking individual users of a service .
These typing patterns are n't quite unique — Shanahan estimates that 1 in 20,000 people share the same pattern — but when you combine that with IP addresses and browser information , it 's good enough for its intended purpose .
What companies do with this information is up to them .
Shanahan says some use the soft sell , calling up clients who are allowing multiple users on a single account and reminding them of the terms of service .
The goal is n't to browbeat customers , but to convince them to pay up for the additional licenses they appear to need .
Other companies might choose the " irritate them into submission " approach , perhaps by resetting the account password whenever multiple unique users access an account .
Scout estimates that such information can boost subscription revenues by 10 - 15 percent .
" The amount that can be known from the network is pretty amazing , " Shanahan notes , and he concedes that few users even know that their machines enable tracking of this kind .
But he does point out that the patterns created by Scout 's software do n't identify people ; each cadence pattern identifies someone unique , but the software has no idea who the person is .
That may be cold comfort to groups like the EFF , which have long been wary of online tracking schemes .
While Panopticlick showed just how easy it was to uniquely track browsers , analytics companies like Scout can already pick out a browser 's unique users .
With a bit more work , a court order , and the cooperation of an ISP , the day might not be far off when the old " Hey , that must have been someone else using my computer ! " defense comes to an end .
On the flip side , such technology could provide evidence that it really was someone else at your machine .
The RIAA no doubt wishes it had access to this technology back when it was still suing file - swappers and meeting this very objection in court .

CITIES are often described as being alive .
A nice metaphor , but does it mean anything ?
And , if it does , can town planners and biologists learn from one another ?
Steven Strogatz , a mathematician at Cornell University , wrote last year that Manhattan and a mouse might just be variations on a single structural theme .
His point was that both are , in part , composed of networks for transporting stuff from one place to another .
Roads , railways , water and gas mains , sewage pipes and electricity cables all move things around .
So do the blood vessels of animals and the sap - carrying xylem and phloem of plants .
How far can the analogy be pushed ?
Peter Dodds of the University of Vermont draws a particular analogy between the blood system and a suburban railway network .
The commuter - rail system of a city ramifies from the centre .
The farther out you go , the sparser it is .
By analogy , Dr Dodds predicted , the network of capillaries ( the tiny blood vessels that permeate tissues ) would not be as dense in large animals ( where many of them are far from the centre ) as it is in small ones .
They , too , branch ultimately from a central source — the heart .
Surprisingly , no one had looked for this before , but in a paper published recently in Physical Review Letters Dr Dodds shows that this does indeed turn out to be the case .
Dr Dodds 's calculations overthrow a 70 - year - old rule of thumb which is known as the ¾ law of metabolism .
This suggests energy expenditure is proportional to body mass raised to the power of three - quarters .
That a mouse expends more energy per gram than an elephant does is well known .
But Dr Dodds 's calculations show that metabolic rates must fall off faster than had previously been believed as animals get bigger because less glucose than thought is being transported by the smaller than predicted capillary network .
The law needs to be adjusted to something more like two - thirds .
Two other studies published in the same volume similarly overthrow conventional wisdom about plants .
Traditionally , biologists have celebrated the trunk , branch and twig system of a tree as no accident .
Many mathematical formulas have suggested it is the best , least wasteful way to design a distribution network .
But the very end of such a network , the leaf , has a different architecture .
Unlike the xylem and phloem , the veins in a leaf cross -link and loop .
Francis Corson of Rockefeller University in New York used computer models to examine why these loops exist .
From an evolutionary point of view , loops seem inefficient because of the redundancy inherent in a looped network .
Dr Corson 's models show , however , that this inefficiency is true only if demand for water and the nutrients it contains is constant .
By studying fluctuations in demand he discovered one purpose of the loops : they allow for a more nuanced delivery system .
Flows can be rerouted through the network in response to local pressures in the environment , such as different evaporation rates in different parts of a leaf .
Another group of researchers at Rockefeller , led by Marcelo Magnasco , also examined vein - loops in leaves .
They found that as well as improving efficiency , they also help to ameliorate damage .
They discovered this by injecting fluorescent dye into leaves to see if the vein network could distribute the dye to all parts of a leaf that had been damaged .
They found the loops are structured in such a way that no matter which piece of a leaf 's supply mechanism is disrupted , there is usually enough capacity in the rest to distribute water and nutrients .
“ It was very surprising , ” Dr Magnasco observes .
“ The famous theorems that tell us that the optimal structure is a tree failed in a spectacular fashion . ”
The leaf , then , is a resilient distribution network — one whose principles could be applied to , say , electricity grids .
Next time your power is cut off because a tree has fallen on the cable , remember that .
What constitutes life falling apart ?
The death of a beloved spouse or family member ?
A marriage or relationship that has withered away or perhaps ended abruptly ?
A job loss potentially leading to financial ruin ( or so you might think right now ) ?
Whichever situation is closest to yours , there are some steps that you must go through to come out the other side with your heart — and new life — intact .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Mainstream medicine assures us that their drugs are more effective than nature and that they have been scientifically proven to be both effective and safe .
What mainstream medicine does not tell us is how they have rigged studies , withheld evidence of harm and paid doctors to prescribe their drugs .
The drug industry has been riddled with scandal again and again - including faked studies , rigged studies , hidden evidence of dangers , ghostwritten articles , fake medical journals , sex scandals , and much more .
Merck , Vioxx .
Pfizer , Avantis , GlaxoKilineSmith , Baxter Labs , the list goes on and on and on and leaves virtually no major pharmaceutical company untouched :
All one has to do to get an idea of how riddled with scandal the drug industry has been is to do a simple internet search for " drug company scandals " .
Absolutely shameful !
The latest example : Another problem with mainstream drugs is the influence peddling of the pharmaceutical companies to get doctors to prescribe their medicines .
Many doctors receive incentives for prescribing drugs - such as honorariums , free lunches and other gifts , and even free massages and cruise trips , to name a few .
There have been a number of scandals concerning drug companies essentially bribing doctors to prescribe their drugs , and there have been many cries for reform to insure that drugs are prescribed according to the patient 's best interests and not the financial interests of doctors and drug companies .
Besides all the incentives , some doctors make profits directly from the drugs they prescribe , often with unhealthy consequences for their patients .
In an article that appeared in the New York Times in May 2007 it was revealed that two of the world 's largest drug companies are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors every year in return for giving their patients anemia medicines , which regulators now say may be unsafe at commonly used doses .
The same article noted that : " Federal laws bar drug companies from paying doctors to prescribe medicines that are given in pill form and purchased by patients from pharmacies .
But companies can rebate part of the price that doctors pay for drugs , which they dispense in their offices as part of treatment .
Doctors receive the rebates after they buy the drugs from the companies .
But they also receive reimbursement from Medicare or private insurers for the drugs , often at a markup over the doctors purchase price .
" See : http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/doc...

Stilwell , Oklahoma ( CNN ) --
As a teenager , Ricky Blackman carried an Oklahoma driver 's license with the words " sex offender " stamped in red below his picture .
His crime ?
Having sex with a 13 - year - old girl when he was 16 .
The offense occurred when he lived in Iowa , and the label followed him to Oklahoma .
As a Tier 3 offender on Oklahoma 's sex offender registry , Blackman could not attend high school , visit the town library , or go to his younger brother 's football games .
But the label did more than limit where Blackman could go .
It transformed him from an outgoing , sociable jock into an introvert who has trouble trusting people , his mother says .
" He 's not the same , " said Mary Duval , a straight - talker who has become a full - time activist to reform sex offender legislation since her son 's conviction .
" I used to get a kick out of Ricky , " she added .
" He was so fun -loving and just full of life .
I mean , there 's no other word .
Ricky was full of life and now he 's definitely more cautious , more reserved . "
Now 20 , Blackman tenses up when he sees children at a supermarket and avoids talking to girls his age , even if they initiate contact , his mother says .
" I got a lot more fear in me , I mean , because anything could happen , " Blackman said .
" Say you 're on the registry , and you 're in the mall and a kid comes up missing .
Well , guess what ?
You 're the first person they 're going to because you 're on the sex offender registry . "
Blackman lived with the " sex offender " label for nearly four years , until a law that took effect in Oklahoma in November removed his name from the registry .
His soft - spoken , reserved manner belies Blackman 's hulking physical presence -- a reminder of his days as a high school athlete .
On a sunny afternoon in December , he met a CNN reporter in the parking lot of the Stilwell Public Library , arm - in - arm with his mother , who is blind .
As he told his story , Blackman cast furtive glances at each passing car and sized up every person entering the library as if to ensure no one was after him .
It was his first time at the library since 2006 , when he moved back to his hometown .
Though free of the scarlet letter that changed his life , he still feels the stigma of one of the country 's most reviled labels .
It was all but impossible to independently verify details of Blackman 's case .
Prosecutors did not return repeated phone calls for comment , and efforts to check court files with Iowa 's Fifth Judicial District were also unsuccessful because Blackman 's record has been expunged .
But Blackman tells it this way :
It all began when he met a girl at a teen club in Des Moines .
They hit it off and started dating .
He was 16 and thought she was 15 .
When the girl ran away from home , police came looking for Blackman , who says he admitted to having sex with her twice .
That 's when police told him she was really 13 , he says .
Two weeks later , police returned to his home and arrested him .
Blackman pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse for having sex with the 13 - year - old .
The age of consent in Iowa is 14 .
Taking into account the circumstances of the case , an Iowa judge accepted Blackman 's plea and ordered that his record be expunged if he successfully completed probation and sex offender treatment .
At that time , his name would be removed from Iowa 's sex offender registry .
After his conviction , Blackman 's family moved to Oklahoma to get a fresh start .
He finished his probation and sex offender treatment , and his record in Iowa was expunged in October 2008 , according to court documents .
But the action did not carry over to Oklahoma , where Blackman continued to be listed on that state 's sex offender registry .
The stigma followed him to his new home and the harassment continued , the family said .
A neighbor who found out he was on the registry videotaped him when he went outside , Blackman said .
His picture and address were posted on a vigilante Web site , and a gas station attendant refused to sell him cigarettes , one time taking his license and throwing it across the store .
To comply with state residency restrictions that prevent registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or day care center , the family moved onto a small plot of land in the rural southeastern Oklahoma community of Stilwell , population 3,500 .
The back door of the single - wide trailer faces the forest , a fact that Blackman 's mother finds comforting should her sons ever need to escape a vigilante attack .
" Does it sound crazy ?
Yes .
But knowing that my boys will have a few extra seconds to get out of the house and slip into darkness if someone ever comes provides some measure of comfort , " Duval said .
Having a son on the registry also made a lasting impression on his mother .
She now devotes most of her time to reforming sex offender legislation -- specifically , the registry -- as chief operating officer of Sex Offender Solutions And Education Network .
" What keeps me going ?
My anger , my guilt , " she said .
" My ignorance is why Ricky 's on this registry , or was on this registry .
I did n't know the law .
I did n't know how to protect my son when he talked to those cops .
I just sat there thinking the truth will set him free .
And that 's what got Ricky convicted , the truth . "
Blackman 's story comes at a time of increased push - back against sex offender policies that some see as overly broad .
Many states have been resisting toughening their sex offender policies .
Only one state , Ohio , has complied with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 , which lists sex offenders as young as 14 on a uniform registry .
In Georgia , the Southern Center for Human Rights is challenging a state law prohibiting sex offenders from living and working within 1,000 feet of a school , church or day care .
Georgia 's laws go so far as to ban sex offenders from living near bus stops .
The case is still pending .
Last summer , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Miami - Dade County , alleging the county 's 2,500 - foot residency restriction interfered with Florida 's ability to monitor and supervise released offenders .
With nowhere to live , dozens of homeless sex offenders clustered under the Julia Tuttle Causeway .
The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2009 .
Meanwhile , Blackman was just trying to graduate from high school .
He attempted to enroll but was told that he was considered a danger to the rest of the students .
He could n't take GED classes at the vocational school in town because of an on - campus day care center .
His mother persuaded the school board to provide him with a tutor and private classes at the local police department , under the supervision of an officer .
Finding a job presented its own challenges .
He says he was turned down by Wal - Mart , McDonald 's and another fast food outlet that told him he was considered a liability .
He spent most days at home learning to build Web sites and helping his mother and brother .
Due in large part to the efforts of his mother , the Oklahoma Legislature last year passed the law that makes expungements of certain sex offenses in other jurisdictions applicable in Oklahoma .
Blackman traded in his driver 's license for one that does not label him a sex offender , and has since returned to the mall and a movie theater .
" I know what I did was wrong and I deserved to be punished for it .
But this destroyed my life .
Took it away from me , " he said .
" You never forget about it .
I know I 'm off the registry but it 's taking a long time for it to settle in . "
In November , Blackman received a letter from the Oklahoma Board of Probation and Parole .
It said he had been removed from the state 's sex offender registry , where he had been designated the highest level of risk possible .
His return to a " normal " life has been slow .
He still is reluctant to go to his brother 's football games , and the thought of going to places where children convene makes him nervous .
" I know I 'm off the registry but others may not know , " he said .
" I do n't want to go somewhere and cause a scene ' cause people may not know that I 'm allowed to be there and get upset . "
But he is making progress .
He has opened up to friends and relatives outside his immediate family .
He married a 19 - year - old childhood friend after he completed probation in September .
As a Christmas gift to her , Blackman made his way to the Stilwell High School Fine Arts Winter Celebration , where his wife sang in the choir .
Walking arm - in- arm with his mother into a building from which he once had been banned , he slowly made his way up the gymnasium 's bleachers .
From his seat in the fifth row next to relatives , Blackman trained his eyes on people entering the gymnasium , cautiously returning a wave or smile from an acquaintance .
How did he feel ?
" Nervous , " he said .
" It 's still new to me . "
CNN 's Stephanie Chen contributed to this report .
Dear Iain ,
It 's been 10 years , and I do n't know how much longer I can wait .
The millennium was new , the future seemed boundless and Look to Windward had just been published .
We , your fans , were ecstatic to see a new novel from Iain M Banks .
We had waited patiently as you conquered the world of " mainstream literature " , knowing one day you would return to science fiction .
And while we had read and loved your standalone SF novels , what we really wanted was a new story from the world of the Culture .
You did not disappoint us .
Look to Windward fulfilled our highest expectations of the Culture of Iain M Banks , with its masterly fusion of SF " sense of wonder " , sophisticated literary technique and engaging political commentary .
Set in the aftermath of a futile civil war in a caste - based society , the novel follows Quilan , a veteran soldier whose wife was killed in the conflict .
Traumatised by grief , he is manipulated into undertaking a terrorist attack against the Culture , a more developed society whose interference sparked the war .
Under the pretext of a diplomatic mission to negotiate with composer and political dissident Mahrai Ziller , Quilan confronts the civilisation he holds responsible for the destruction of his society and of his wife .
Look to Windward unfolds much like the symphonic composition at its heart , elements of plot , character and theme orchestrated to climax together at the story 's powerful resolution .
From its opening dedication – " For the Gulf War veterans " – the novel wears its political convictions on its sleeve .
But if the events it describes have parallels with the tragic terrorist attacks of 9/11 , it is only a testament to the intelligent treatment the book gives to the complex political issues it tackles .
This was the kind of sophisticated science fiction we had come to expect from you , since the debut of the Culture in the novel Consider Phlebas .
( Lent to me in the early 1990s by my older sister with the simple recommendation " You will like this " ; still , shamefully , unreturned . )
The Culture is a utopian , post - scarcity society , the ultimate representation of the liberal progressive ideal .
As the story of the Culture unfolds through novels including The Player of Games and Excession , the utopia is tested against a spectrum of totalitarian regimes , corrupt imperial states and corporate hegemonies .
In all cases it proves superior .
At the close of Look to Windward , the Culture is all - powerful , a lone superpower with a galaxy to play in .
But it is suggested that the Culture faces an uncertain future , and the threat of betrayal from within .
We waited eight years for the next volume in the Culture saga , but while Matter teased us with details of other superpower races in the galaxy , it did not bring the story to its resolution .
If the Culture novels have returned to any idea over and again , it is the absolute certainty of change .
The Culture can not last forever , so what will the fate of the ideal , utopian society be ?
Will it ascend to some higher state of being , or will it fall back into the chaos and barbarism it so long resisted ?
So .
It has been 10 years , and we 're still waiting for the third volume of the unofficial trilogy begun with Consider Phlebas and continued in Look to Windward .
Thirteen years have passed between the first two volumes .
With rumours that work on a new Culture novel began in January 2010 , will it be another 13 years before we see the final part ?
Yours ,
Damien G Walter
Only a month after Netflix announced it was giving into Warner Bros . and delaying new releases , DVD rental kiosk company Redbox has decided to do the same .
Warner announced Tuesday that it had entered into a " multi- year distribution agreement " with Redbox that will allow Redbox to officially carry Warner 's DVD and Blu-ray offerings — 28 days after they are released to the retail market .
The agreement will be the end of the lawsuit between the two companies — and marks a short - term victory in Warner 's attempts to prop up the dying DVD market .
The numbers do n't lie : the market for new DVDs has been falling for years now , with the latest data showing that disc sales dropped by a full 13 percent in the US between 2008 and 2009 alone .
Warner made no secret of the reason for the move .
" The 28 - day window enables us to get the most from the sales potential of our titles and maximize VOD usage , " Warner Bros .
Home Entertainment Group president Kevin Tsujihara said in a statement .
Redbox started out by acquiring its major DVD releases from wholesalers that sell to all manner of retail outlets ( Target , Walmart , etc. ) .
To them , Redbox was just another buyer looking to acquire product , and Redbox did not have direct relationships with any of the studios ( save Sony ) .
The studios came to despise Redbox for its business model , however .
The company 's kiosks , which house more than 600 DVDs at a time , rent out movies for $ 1 per day and sell used movies for $ 7 .
Redbox 's
Web - based inventory system makes it possible for consumers to select their movies over the Internet and reserve them in advance at a specified Redbox kiosk .
Ultimately , some of the studios were able to persuade wholesalers to stop selling movies to Redbox .
The DVD - rental outlet got around that limitation by sending staffers out to Target , Walmart , and other retailers armed with corporate credit cards .
The staffers would snap up new releases to be loaded into the ubiquitous kiosks .
Redbox 's determination to stock and rent new releases , according to the major studios , was both an insult and the equivalent of stealing money straight out of their children 's mouths .
" Having our [ movies ] rented at $ 1 in the rental window is grossly undervaluing our products , " News Corp . said when it decided to sue Redbox over its rental kiosks .
Universal also sued Redbox , and Redbox sued everyone back , including Warner Bros .
The latest deal , however , means that the lawsuit against Warner is over and Redbox will have easier access to the studio's offerings .
" This agreement enables redbox to fulfill our commitment to providing consumers affordable and convenient home entertainment , " Redbox president Mitch Lowe said in a statement , probably while nursing his wounds .
" By agreeing to a delayed release date , Redbox can now acquire Warner Home Video titles at a reduced product cost , preserving value for our consumers and increasing customer access to Warner titles at redbox locations nationwide . "
This deal , at least from a consumer perspective , is nearly identical to one that Warner entered into with DVD rental and streaming house Netflix in January .
Again , the companies cheerfully claimed that the agreement would mean easier access to Warner Bros.
movies , as long as Netflix would n't let a single one out of its grasp until 28 days had passed from the time the DVDs hit the market .
Warner 's deals with both Netflix and Redbox show the industry 's commitment to doing everything it can to keep a slowly - dying media form alive as long as possible .
A large part of that fight has been to cripple rental availability , whether through Netflix , Redbox , or others .
It 's a victory for the studios — and a loss for consumers .
The only way this will pay off is if sufficient numbers of movie fans decide they absolutely can't wait an additional four weeks to rent the Hollywood blockbusters they missed in the theater and snap up the new DVDs .

( NaturalNews ) Researchers from Essex University recently concluded a study that evaluated the changing fitness abilities of modern children .
Evaluated a decade apart based on physical strength , the study revealed that 10 - year - olds from 1998 were capable of outrunning 95 percent of 10 - year - olds in 2008 .
While most studies about health focus on obesity , this study aimed to address children 's physical fitness levels aside from their weight .
Researchers purposely conducted the study in an area of town that had generally low obesity rates in order to test their hypothesis that being of a normal weight does not necessarily mean that a person is physically healthy .
Their findings confirmed this to be true .
Comparatively , the participants from both the 1998 group and the 2008 group were of similar weight profiles .
However when tested based on their speed and endurance in a shuttle run , a significant decline in ability over the course of just ten years was obvious and troubling to researchers .
They believe that the results would probably have been even worse had the study been conducted in an area with high obesity rates .
Some experts worry that too much focus on obesity has led to an overall decrease in health among people of more normal weights who assume that they must be in good health because they are not overweight .
All agree that children are spending too little time outdoors engaging in physical activity and too much time indoors in front of the computer and television screens .
Educational facilities are partly to blame as well , they say , citing a lack of organized outdoor activities for kids during the school day .
The British government has begun a campaign designed to encourage healthy lifestyles among all children .
Addressing obesity remains an important issue because overweight people , especially children , are more prone to developing chronic illnesses .
However officials recognize the need to encourage everyone to participate in regular physical activity for their own well - being .
In the United States , the President 's Challenge is a physical fitness testing protocol that schools often use to gauge the fitness levels of their students and spur them towards getting and staying in shape .
Instructors give recognition and awards to children when they achieve the goals and requirements of the program .
When used in conjunction with a complete and regular physical fitness program , including healthy lifestyle and diet recommendations , it can be highly successful at motivating children to stay fit and achieve better health Sources for this story include :

The frog ’s scientific name is Beelzebufo ampinga , which means “ armored devil toad . ”
About 150 schoolchildren from public schools here on Long Island attended the unveiling of the exhibition last week  none of them as small as hatchlings , but small enough to find the frog impressive .

“ Looks like he ate a human , ” said one , pointing at the frog ’s stomach .
The reconstruction of the creature , described as the “ frog from hell ” by the scientists who dug it up in Madagascar , portrays Beelzebufo as a grim - looking amphibian , with a large pink tongue and sand - colored skin to match its desert environment .
It took 15 years and 75 fossils to put together an accurate reconstruction .
The frog lived about 65 million years ago , in a semi-arid environment that experienced sporadic heavy rains , said Dr. Krause , who analyzed sediments to deconstruct the frog ’s living conditions .
Dr. Krause and his colleagues believe that the frog is related to the Pac - Man frog , a modern - day species in South America that is named for the video game character .
Like the Pac - Man , Beelzebufo was probably an ambush predator , meaning it wriggled its rear end into the ground , sticking its head out , in anticipation of the oblivious lizard or snake .
The reconstruction on display is the only one of the devil frog that the researchers know of , and was made by Joe Groenke , a fossil technician , and Luci Betti-Nash , a scientific artist .
Mr. Groenke created a cast of the frog ’s head  essentially an enlarged version of the Pac - Man frog  and Ms. Betti-Nash sculpted the body with clay and painted it with water - based acrylics .
The colors are a guess , based on where Beelzebufo lived and the coloration of modern desert amphibians .

Health officials consider routine checks followed by lifetime course of drugs for everyone with the virus
Health officials are considering a radical shift in the war against HIV and Aids that would see everyone tested for the virus and put on a lifetime course of drugs if they are found to be positive .
The strategy , which would involve testing most of the world 's population for HIV , aims to reduce the transmission of the virus that causes
Aids to a level at which it dies out completely over the next 40 years .
Brian Williams , professor of epidemiology at the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis in Stellenbosch , said that transmission of HIV could effectively be halted within five years with the use of antiretroviral drugs ( ARVs ) .
" The epidemic of HIV is really one of the worst plagues of human history , " Williams told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego .
" I hope we can get to the starting line in one to two years and get complete coverage of patients in five years .
Maybe that 's being optimistic , but we 're facing Armageddon . "
Major trials of the strategy are planned in Africa and the US and will feed into a final decision on whether to adopt the measure as public health policy in the next two years .
The move follows research that shows blanket prescribing of ARVs could stop HIV transmission and halve cases of Aids - related tuberculosis within 10 years .
More than 30 million people are infected with HIV globally and two million die of the disease each year .
While ARVs have been a huge success in preventing the virus from causing full - blown Aids , scientists estimate only 12 % of those living with the infection receive the drugs .
The disease is overwhelmingly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa , which accounts for a quarter of all HIV / Aids cases globally .
Half of these are in South Africa .
In general epidemics , a person with HIV infects between five to 10 others before succumbing to complications of Aids .
Treating patients with ARVs within a year of becoming infected can reduce transmission tenfold , enough to cause the epidemic to die out .
In the trials , people will be offered HIV tests once a year , either as routine when they visit their GP , or through mobile clinics in more remote regions .
Those testing positive will be put on a lifetime course of ARVs .
" Over the past 25 years we have saved the lives of probably two to three million people using antiretroviral drugs , but almost nothing we have done has had any impact on transmission of the disease , " Williams said .
" We have stopped people dying but we have n't stopped the epidemic . "
If patients take ARVs when they should , the amount of virus in their bodies can fall by 10,000 times , to a level at which they are extremely unlikely to pass the virus on .
" The question is , can we use these drugs not only to keep people alive , but also to stop transmission and I believe that we can .
We could effectively stop transmission of HIV in five years . "
Scientists estimate that the cost of implementing the strategy in South Africa alone will be $ 3 bn - $ 4bn a year .
The world currently spends $ 30 bn ( £ 19.4bn ) a year on Aids research and treatment , a figure that some experts believe will double over the next decade .
Sub -Saharan Africa has seen a dramatic rise in cases of tuberculosis among HIV patients , who are also susceptible to other infections because their immune systems are weakened .
" If you factor in all of the costs , in my opinion , doing this would be cost saving from day one , because the cost of the drugs would be more than balanced by the cost of treating people for all of these other diseases and then letting them die , " Williams said .
" We 're killing probably half a million young adults every year in the prime of their life just at the point where they should be contributing to society and the cost of that to society is enormous , " he added .
" The only thing that 's more expensive than doing this is not doing this . "
HIV patients in southern Africa are more likely to take ARVs when they should than people living in developed countries , according to health officials .
The finding gives doctors hope that the blanket administering of drugs might suppress the virus enough that it dies out naturally .
Last year , scientists reported marginal success of a HIV vaccine following a large scale trial in Thailand .
The vaccine benefited only 31 % of those who received it .
A vaccine is generally regarded as worthwhile if it protects more than 70 % of those treated .

The Hill is reporting that 70 percent of our Congressmen ’s Washington offices violate OSHA ’s workplace safety rules .
Of course , if our employers were to be found in violation of OSHA rules we ’d have our places of business closed down and the owners prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
But , you see , Congress does n’t have to abide by the laws everyone else suffers under , now do they ?
Of the 541 offices in Congress , 154 were found to be completely in compliance with OSHA standards — those of 64 senators and 90 House lawmakers — leaving 387 offices that had at least one violation .
This is a marked increase from 2008 , when only 37 offices were found to be in complete accordance , or in 2006 , when only seven offices were in compliance .
Sure some of the OSHA violations were minor infractions , to be sure , but the fact that these violations add up to so many is astounding .
Now , I ’d also like to point out that OSHA only investigated our representative ’s Washington offices .
Let ’s wonder how much worse the number of violations would be if these congressmen ’s home offices back in their home states were investigated .
If they do n’t much care to observe OSHA regulations in Washington D.C. how much less will they care about the conditions back at home ?
The mind boggles at the prospects .
In any case , this is just another example that Congress does n’t think it has to abide by the rules it forces upon the rest of us in fly over country .

And Open Left is the best place for updates on which Senators have signed the Bennet Public option reconciliation letter .
I make you this pledge .
If God forbid health care reform does not pass , I will work day and night , to start a movement to strip every member of Congress and the Senate of their taxpayer subsidized health benefits .
If those we elect to do our business fail on this again , they will have ceded their right to have the health care they deny us .
This is not a threat , this is a promise , which I hope we will not have to execute .
Here 's the press release from Fenton Communications .
It went out this morning and describes this unprecedented coalition of the largest progressive organizations in the country working together to make today a huge success .

The organizations released the following joint statement : " As Washington plays politics as usual instead of fixing our broken system , people are dying .
Americans simply cannot wait for comprehensive health care reform - it 's time for Congress to stand up to Big Insurance and their conservative allies , and get reform done right .
During the Virtual March for Real Health Care Reform , we 'll send a million messages to Congress to make sure they know that voters want them to get to work and get health care done .
Our message is simple :
It 's time for Washington to stop stalling .
Pass real health care reform now . "
Congress will receive messages today via phone , fax , email , Facebook , Twitter and petition .
If your circumstances allow , we welcome your support , there is much work ahead .
And if you have already donated , thank you so very much .
The funds donated to the Progressive Congress Action Fund , a 501 ( C ) 4 not for profit , will be used to advocate on behalf of the progressive agenda , to advance progressive legislation , and may include payments to individuals engaged in fund raising .
WASHINGTON — With an unusually strong bipartisan vote Wednesday , the U.S. Senate approved a $ 15 billion bill lawmakers hope will spur job creation in the flat employment market .
The vote was 70 - to - 28 , with 13 Republicans siding with the Democratic majority to approve the measure .
This was a larger number of minority - party members to side with the Democrats on the legislation than the five who voted on a measure to advance the bill earlier this week .

Back pain is a common problem A form of group " talking therapy " is a cheap , effective way to alleviate low back pain , a UK trial has shown .
The positive effect was still seen a year after the short six-session therapy programme , The Lancet reported .
The 600 patients taking part in the trial were also offered standard GP treatment including pain medication .
The sessions were designed to tackle " unhelpful " beliefs around back pain and physical activity and help patients better manage their condition .
Usually people with low back pain - one of the most common complaints GPs deal with - are advised to keep active , offered pain relief where needed and possibly other treatments such as acupuncture .
In the study , 400 people being treated in general practice were offered the six group therapy sessions and 200 people receiving standard care were monitored for a year .
The sessions - based loosely around a technique called cognitive behaviour therapy - were set up to discuss beliefs around doing physical activity and counter negative thoughts about back pain and its restrictions as well as relaxation techniques .
The one - and - a - half - hour sessions were also designed to help people overcome " fear " of hurting themselves more and how to get active again whilst avoiding flare - ups .
A year later , the people who underwent therapy scored significantly more highly on questionnaires designed to measure pain and disability .
Value for money
When looking at the costs , the team found the therapy was relatively cheap when the improvement in quality of life was taken into account , and better than the value for money offered by treatments such as acupuncture .
The researchers , from the Universities of Warwick and Oxford , said effective treatments that produced long - term results are " elusive " in low back pain .
Study author Zara Hansen , a clinical research fellow at the University of Warwick , said healthcare staff , including physiotherapists , psychotherapists and nurses , could learn how to run the course in a couple of days .
" The exciting bit here is that with a lot of back pain interventions , you 'll get a feel - good factor and patients will feel better while they 're undergoing the treatment but it 's a short - term effect .
" But we showed they improve up to six months and then this is maintained for up to a year as they learn to manage their condition . "
The team is looking at a project to roll out the programme to other areas of the country .
Dr Graham Davenport , clinical champion for musculoskeletal conditions at the Royal College of GPs , said chronic back pain was an extremely common condition and this sort of therapy could prove extremely useful .
" It 's really just about changing people 's beliefs .
" It 's an excellent and very sensible treatment , the problem is the logistics of getting staff trained to deliver it but if we could overcome that it would be great . "

Send David an email or porn ( just straight stuff though , I can get all the gay porn i want from Lucius )
Hello , my name is Chris .
It has been suggested that I never leave the house and spend my life playing World of Warcraft but these photos of me are evidence that I lead an active outdoor lifestyle .
Photographic evidence that I leave the house and do n't spend all day playing World of Warcraft :
Visiting Pakistan .
Experiencing American culture .
Backpacking through England .
Exploring Saudi Arabia .
At the beach with a woman .
We splashed each other and laughed but most of the time we just kissed .
She told me that she would rather have her arms tied to two cars driving in opposite directions , both doing 60 mph , and be ripped in half than live without me .
I told her that she would probably survive this and that it would just rip her arms off and they would stitch them back on at the hospital .
There would probably be some permanent nerve damage though .
Even though she was scared of sharks , she knew that if a shark attacked us , I would fight it and win because I have arms and sharks do n't .

( CNN ) --
Three faculty members were killed and three other school employees were wounded Friday in a shooting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , a school spokesman said .
A female shooting suspect was in custody and a second person was detained , " not arrested , " spokesman Ray Garner told reporters .
Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes left open the possibility that more than one person had been detained .
" We have a suspect and possible persons of interest , " he said late Friday .
" Until we go through everything , we 're not going to say exactly how many or who we have . "
He said police were questioning the suspect , whom he would not identify .
Of the wounded , two were faculty members and the third was a staff member , he said .
Garner said the incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. in Shelby Hall .
Police arrived at 4:01 p.m. ; residence halls were locked down at 4:10 p.m. ; the building was secured by 5:45 p.m. , he said .
The suspect was taken into custody outside the building , said Reyes .
No weapon has been recovered , he said .
The 6 - year - old , $ 60 million facility houses the chemistry department and is named for U.S. Sen.
Richard Shelby of Alabama and his wife , Annette Shelby .
Garner identified the dead as Gopi Podila , chairman of the biological sciences department ; Maria Davis , associate professor of biology ; and Adriel Johnson , associate professor of biology .
He identified the injured as Joseph Leahy , associate professor of biology , in critical condition ; Luis Cruz - Vera , assistant professor of biology , in stable condition ; and Stephanie Monticello , staff assistant , also in stable condition .
The wounded were taken to Huntsville Hospital .
Classes and athletic events are to be canceled February 15 - 19 , he said .
Asked why students had not been alerted for more than an hour after the shootings , Reyes said , " I ca n't comment on that part . "
The history that “ binds ” the US and Haiti
15 January 2010
In his statement on the Haitian earthquake Wednesday , President Barack Obama referred to the “ long history that binds us together . ”
Neither he nor the US media , however , have shown any inclination to probe the history of US - Haiti relations and its bearing on the present catastrophe confronting the Haitian people .
Rather , the backwardness and poverty that have played a substantial role in driving the death toll into the tens , if not hundreds , of thousands are presented as a natural state of affairs , if not the fault of the Haitians themselves .
The United States is portrayed as a selfless benefactor , ready to come to the aid of Haiti with donations , rescue teams , warships and Marines .
In a cynical and dishonest editorial , the New York Times Thursday began , “ Once again the world weeps with Haiti , ” a country which it goes on to describe as characterized by “ poverty , despair and dysfunction that would be a disaster anywhere else but in Haiti are the norm . ”
The editorial continues : “ Look at Haiti and you will see what generations of misrule , poverty and political strife will do to a country . ”
In a background article on the Haitian disaster , the Times adds that the country “ is known for its many man-made woes — its dire poverty , political infighting and proclivity for insurrection . ”
In a shorter and even more dismissive editorial , the Wall Street Journal celebrates the fact that the US military will play the leading role in Washington ’s response to the earthquake as “ a fresh reminder that the reach of America ’s power coincides with the reach of its goodness . ”
It goes on to draw an obscene comparison between the Haitian earthquake and the one that struck southern California in 1994 , in which 72 people died .
“ The difference , ” the Journal declares , “ is a function of a wealth - generating and law - abiding society that can afford , among other things , the expense of proper building codes . ”
The message is clear .
The Haitians have only themselves to blame for the hundreds of thousands of dead and injured , because they failed to create sufficient wealth and lacked respect for law and order .
What is deliberately obscured by this comparison is the real relationship , which has evolved over more than a century , between “ wealth generation ” in the United States and poverty in Haiti .
It is a relationship built on the use of force to pursue US imperialism ’s predatory interests in a historically oppressed country .
If the Obama administration and the Pentagon carry through with reported plans to deploy a Marine expeditionary force in Haiti , it will mark the fourth time in the past 95 years that the US armed forces have occupied the impoverished Caribbean nation .
This time , as in the past , rather than aiding the Haitian people , the essential purpose of such a military action will be to defend US interests and guard against what the Times refers to as the “ proclivity for insurrection . ”
The roots of this relationship go back to the birth of Haiti as the first independent black republic in 1804 , the product of a successful slave revolution led by Toussaint Louverture , and the subsequent defeat of a French army sent by Napoleon .
The ruling classes of the world never forgave Haiti for its revolutionary victory .
It was subjected to a worldwide embargo that was led by the United States , which feared the Haitian example could inspire a similar revolt in the southern slave states .
It was only with southern secession and the outbreak of the Civil War that the North recognized Haiti — nearly 60 years after its independence .
From the dawn of the 20th century , Haiti fell under the domination of Washington and the US banks , whose interests were defended by sending Marines to carry out an occupation that continued for nearly 20 years , maintained through the bloody suppression of Haitian resistance .
The Marines left only after carrying out the “ Haitianization ” — as the New York Times referred to it at the time — of the war against the Haitian people by building an army dedicated to internal repression .
Subsequently , Washington backed the 30 - year dictatorship of the Duvaliers , which began with the coming to power of Papa Doc in 1957 .
While tens of thousands of Haitians died at the hands of the military and the dreaded Tontons Macoute , US imperialism saw the murderous dictatorship as a bulwark against communism and revolution in the Caribbean .
Since the mass upheavals that brought down the Duvaliers in 1986 , successive US governments , Democratic and Republican alike , have sought to reconstruct a reliable client state capable of defending the markets and investments of US firms attracted by starvation wages , as well as the property and wealth of the Haitian ruling elite .
This entails preventing any challenge to a socio-economic order that keeps 80 percent of the population in dire poverty .
This effort continues today under the tutelage of Bill and Hillary Clinton — respectively the UN ’s special representative to Haiti and the US Secretary of State — who together have Haitian blood on their hands .
Washington has backed two coups and sent US troops back into Haiti twice in the past 20 years .
Both coups were organized to overthrow Jean - Bertrand Aristide , the first Haitian president to be elected by popular vote and without Washington ’s approval .
Together , the coups of 1991 and 2004 claimed the lives of at least 13,000 more Haitians .
In the 2004 overthrow , Aristide was forcibly transported out of the country by US operatives .
Needing them in Iraq , the US withdrew its troops in 2004 , contracting the job of repression out to a United Nations peacekeeping force of 9,000 under the leadership of the Brazilian army .
Despite Aristide ’s capitulation to the demands of the International Monetary Fund and his willingness to compromise with Washington , the mass support he attracted with his anti-imperialist rhetoric made him anathema to the ruling elites in both Washington and Port - au - Prince .
On the orders of the Obama administration , he is barred from returning to Haiti and his political party , Fanmi Lavalas , remains effectively outlawed .
This is the real and continuing history that , as Obama put it , binds Haiti to US imperialism , which bears overwhelming responsibility for the desperate conditions that have compounded the carnage inflicted by the earthquake .
There are , however , other ties that bind and are deeply felt , as the immensity of the tragedy in Haiti unfolds .
There are over half a million Haitian Americans officially counted in the US and undoubtedly hundreds of thousands more who are undocumented .
Their presence concretizes the class interests and solidarity that unite Haitian and American workers .
Together , it is their task to sweep away the conditions of poverty and devastation in both countries , along with the capitalist profit system that has created them .

MTV under fire as it pulls South Park episode in Mexico
By Julian Miglierini
BBC News , Mexico City
The decision not to show the episode sparked criticism and derision A last - minute decision by MTV in Mexico not to broadcast an episode of the US cartoon show South Park has caused controversy .
The episode portrays Mexico 's president as a leader who wastes funds and irritates the international community .
MTV Mexico said they did not get a special permit needed to broadcast an image of Mexico 's flag , seen briefly in the same scene as the president .
But Mexican South Park fans reacted with scepticism to that explanation .
The episode was to have been shown in Spanish on Monday night on MTV's Latin American channel .
' Censored ? '
" Has it been censored by the Mexican government ? " wonders a blogger at the popular MexaBlog , while comments on other websites ridiculed MTV 's decision .
The Mexican president in the episode is said to resemble Felipe Calderon A spokesman for MTV Mexico reassured the BBC that the reason the episode was not shown was that the permit required to show the flag did not arrive in time for the scheduled broadcast .
The episode , called " Pinewood Derby " , attracted keen interest from Mexican media when it was first shown in the US in 2009 .
It features the character of a Mexican president with a striking resemblance to the incumbent , Felipe Calderon .
MTV Mexico had extensively publicised the broadcast of the Spanish - language episode .
We decided not to alter the image because the reaction would have been worse
Erick Zermeno
MTV Mexico
But at 2200 local time on Monday night , Mexican TV viewers could only see another episode of the series .
Erick Zermeno , spokesperson for MTV Mexico , said that they had decided to pull the entire episode instead of trying to cover the flag artificially to avoid a possible fine from the government .
" We decided not to alter the image because the reaction would have been worse , " he said .
Mr Zermeno told the BBC that as soon as the permit was ready the episode would be broadcast in its entirety and without alterations .
Mexico has strict regulations regarding the use of its flag and the broadcast of its image .
This is not the first time the use of the flag in the entertainment industry has generated a storm .
In 2008 , Mexican pop singer Paulina Rubio was fined for posing nude wrapped in the Mexican flag in a photo shoot for a Spanish magazine .

Hamas said the Palestinian defendant , Mohammed Abu Muaileq , had made a confession that implicated Mr. Martin in having “ violated Palestinian law and security in Gaza . ”
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman in Jerusalem said Britain was “ concerned about the situation ” and was providing him with consular assistance .
Consular staff members in Gaza had seen Mr. Martin , she said .
Mr. Abu Muaileq used to belong to a squad that fired rockets at Israel on behalf of the Abu Rish Brigades , an unruly offshoot of Fatah , the secularist rival of Hamas .
Palestinians said that more recently he worked in computer maintenance and that he had been in contact with an Israeli who worked for the same company .
Mr. Martin is said to have been a frequent visitor to Gaza , and to have filmed a documentary that featured Mr. Abu Muaileq .

Why Do Some Eggs Float ?
– Fresh Eggs vs. Old Egg
QUESTION :
If you have kept eggs past the use before date , try to boil them , and if most sink to the bottom of the pan and a few float on the water – should you throw out the floating eggs ?
It has been a while since I was taught much about eggs and I do not remember any of my eggs ever floating .
If the floating eggs are not bad then why do they float ?
QUESTION :
I sometimes notice that in a batch of six ( 6 ) or so chicken eggs that have finished hard - boiling , several will barely float to the surface .
All six are known to be average freshness for supermarket supplied eggs .
Upon peeling , careful inspection shows no abnormalities .
When eaten they taste fine .
Any idea what ’s going on ?
A pretty thorough search of the WEB did n’t turn up any answer , so the information is n’t commonly known .
ANSWER : Learn All About Eggs and How To Cook Them .
Egg shells may seem pretty solid , but they are in fact slightly porous .
Old eggs float in fresh cold water because of a large air cell that forms as the egg cools after being laid .
As the egg ages , air enters the egg and the air cell becomes larger and this acts as a buoyancy aid .
Generally , fresh eggs will lie on the bottom of the bowl of water .
Eggs that tilt so that the large end is up are older .
The tilting is caused by air pockets in the eggs that increase in size over time as fluid evaporates through the porous shell and oxygen and gases filter in .
The older an egg gets the more gas builds up inside it .
More gas = more floating !
Eggs that float could be bad .
You might want to break it open and check it for a foul smell , a sure sign that it has rotted .
Carefully lower your eggs into fresh cold water ( do not use salted water ) using a spoon :
If the egg stay at the bottom – it is fresh .
If the egg is at an angle on the bottom – it is still fresh and good to eat .
If the egg stands on its pointed end at the bottom – it is still safe to eat but best used for baking and making hard - cooked eggs .
If the egg float – they ’re stale and best discarded .
The final test :
To make sure the egg is not spoiled , break it into a clean bowl and check to make sure it does n’t have a bad odor or appearance .
Comments from Readers :
Recently I was informed the way to tell if an egg was bad was to place it in water and see if it floats .
Because as the egg aged , gasses were created in the egg causing it to float .
Having more air in the egg makes the egg more buoyant .
I disagreed with this explanation but was pointed to your website which supported this explanation .
On your website under the question : “ Why do some eggs float ? ” you state :
Egg shells may seem pretty solid , but they are in fact slightly porous .
Old eggs float in fresh cold water because of a large air cell that forms as the egg cools after being laid .
As the egg ages , air enters the egg and the air cell becomes larger and this acts as a buoyancy aid .

Eggs that tilt so that the large end is up are older , and eggs that float are rotten .
The tilting is caused by air pockets in the eggs that increase in size over time as fluid evaporates through the porous shell and oxygen and gases filter in .
The older an egg gets the more gas builds up inside it .
More gas = more floating !
I am glad to now know how to determine if an egg is bad or not , but I did want to set you ( and your readers ) straight on why egg floats .
You are partially correct , however , it is not the fact that air is getting into the egg that makes it float .
It is the fact that mass is leaving the egg .
Since the eggshell does not expand or contract , the density of the egg is only dependent on the mass of the egg ( density equals mass divided by volume and the volume of the egg is constant ) .
If the egg weighs less than the amount of water displaced by the egg it will float .
If it weighs more , it will sink .
It does not make a difference if there is more or less air in the egg .
For example , if the inside matter ( yolk and whites ) were replaced with a steel ball of equal weight , there would be a lot of air in the egg .
But the overall weight of the egg would be the same ( actually it would be slightly heavier since air does have a weight associated with it and now you would have more air in the egg ) so the egg would still sink .
The reason why an egg floats is because as it decomposes , water vapor and gases are released through the porous shell .
This is what causes the yolk and whites to shrink which in turn makes the air cell larger .
Some ambient air enters the shell as the water vapor and decomposition gasses leave , but overall the mass of the egg is reduced .
More mass is going out of the shell than coming in through the shell .
More mass leaving = less weight = more floating !
Thank you – Rob Dyer

World premier : Sagem Orga and Telefonica turn the SIM card into a Wi -Fi hotspot
Barcelona , Mobile World Congress 2010
Smart card expert Sagem Orga ( Safran group ) and Telefonica , one of the world 's largest telecommunications companies , are enhancing mobile broadband services by offering " SIMFi , " the first SIM card with integrated Wi -Fi .
Using the SIM as a hotspot is expected to have the potential of becoming the next killer application .
Millions of subscribers are using netbooks and notebooks to surf the Internet while on the move , and this has become a strategic market for mobile operators .
To enable Internet access , all of these mobility devices use the USIM card to authenticate the user on High Speed Packet Access ( HSPA ) networks , but there are some drawbacks that are slowing down market penetration .
These include complex 3G modem and driver set - ups the user must perform , the use of accessories and cables such as USB modems , PCMCIA modems , handsets and certain software , and the complexity of service use .
By turning the SIM card into a Wi -Fi hotspot , Sagem Orga and Telefonica have developed a solution without all these hurdles .
An embedded WLAN modem in the SIM card , driven by the SIM toolkit applets running in the SIM , will enable Telefonica to broadcast High Speed Packet Access ( HSPA ) Internet access through Wi-Fi to notebooks and netbooks .
The new generation USIM card " SIMFi " can be inserted in any type of classic handset to act as a universal and interoperable HSPA / Wi-Fi router for any device .
" We strongly believe that SIMFi , with its unprecedented functionality for wireless access , will significantly improve the user experience , " explained Remy Cricco , Technology Innovation Manager at Sagem Orga .
" If customers can connect their notebooks to the Web anytime and anywhere by simply using what they have with them most of the time and what is the most trusted secure device – the SIM card – adoption can be expected to be enormous . "
We 've spoken to someone who traveled to Haiti on a Scientology plane — and witnessed firsthand the ineptitude , quackery and irresponsibility of the church 's minions in a disaster zone .
Here 's his account .
I arrived at JFK last week , ready to go .
I knew we were traveling with doctors and EMTs , but I did n't expect to see 50 scientologists , in their yellow shirts with Volunteer Minister on them .
They were completely unprepared for going to a third world country , let alone a disaster zone .
One girl was in designer cowboy boots .
I asked her if she 'd brought any sturdier footwear .
" Oh no , these 'll be fine . "
I asked another guy what he'd packed and he said he had n't bothered to bring soap or toilet paper or food , but that he'd just " buy whatever I need at Port - au - Prince airport . "
I could n't break it to him .
They had no place to stay , and no supplies — their idea was to use the ton of money they had to buy food to distribute when they got there .
But there was no food and no water .
That was the point .
By the time we arrived in Haiti , after a stopover in Miami , we had missed three landing slots at the airport .
Aid agencies — genuine aid agencies — from other countries were being turned away , refused permission to land .
But we still got a slot straight away .
The guy who ran our charter seemed to think that the Scientologists had some real influence with the US Government , who were assigning the slots .
The doctors and EMTs in our party headed straight downtown to start working .
The Scientologists had nowhere to go , and nowhere to put up the big yellow tent they 'd brought for touch healing people in .
They went to the UN , and managed to get on to their list of approved NGOs somehow .
That meant they could set up in the UN grounds .
But they had no - one who spoke Creole , and they brought the weirdness of touch healing into a very superstitious society .
They 'd leave the tent and come into the general hospital downtown , and try healing people .
One of the doctors and one of the nurses told me that the wounded started coming to them to tell them they did n't want to be treated by the people in the yellow shirts .
One nurse told me that the Scientologists actually caused harm — they gave food to people who were scheduled to go into surgery .
That then led to complications in the operating theater .
On the way back , the plane stopped in Miami and did not go on to New York , stranding all the doctors and EMTs and journalists who expected to get back .
After much fighting , the Scientologist representative agreed to fly any of the EMTs that " absolutely could n't afford the ticket " on Jet Blue from Fort Lauderdale .
I heard there were complications but had bought my own ticket because I was fed up with their weirdness .
Dogsleds are in the news lately , as several races have recently taken place around the Northern Hemisphere , and as transportation choices for both a meeting of the G - 7 and the start of the 2010 U.S. census .
Mushers brought representatives to Iqaluit , a small village in Nunavut Territory , chosen to host a recent G - 7 meeting , in part so Canada could assert sovereignty over its part of the Arctic .
The 2010 U.S. Census , as per tradition , kicked off its count on January 25th in a rural part of Alaska in the small village of Noorvik , as census takers arrived by dogsled .
And recent dogsled races include Le Grand Odyssee , the Sedivackuv Long , Pirena , the Aviemore Husky Sled Dog Rally and many more smaller regional competitions .
Collected here are a handful of recent photos of sleds , dogs , and their humans .

The House Democratic leadership stopped a vote Thursday night on the $ 50 billion classified intelligence budget after Republicans mounted a campaign against one of its provisions to ban degrading treatment of detainees and some moderate Democrats indicated they would not vote for the bill .
The Republican lawmakers , led by Rep. Pete Hoekstra , Michigan Republican , opposed what they saw as backdoor legislation that would impose fines and prison terms on intelligence officers who abuse captured terrorism suspects .
A Democratic House aide told The Washington Times that the leadership supported the amendment and urged the House Rules Committee to place it in a slate of provisions to the bill known as a managers amendment .
Courtney Littig , a spokeswoman for the House intelligence committee said , “ To my knowledge the first time we learned of the McDermott amendment was when we received copies of the amendments from the Rules Committee [ Wednesday ] afternoon . ”
Rep. Jim McDermott , Washington Democrat , was the original author of the provision , known as the Cruel , Inhuman and Degrading Interrogation Prohibition Act of 2010 .
The amendment would authorize federal sentences of up to life in prison for cruel interrogation if it led to a detainee ’s death or other penalties for lesser offenses .
President Obama has used executive orders to ban all so - called enhanced interrogation techniques covered in the legislation .
However , making the prohibition a law limits presidential authority should Mr. Obama ever seek to use the techniques in a national emergency , such as questioning someone who has information about a pending nuclear or chemical attack .
House lawmakers began debating the provision on the floor Thursday after the Senate extended by voice vote the provisions of the USA Patriot Act that would have expired on Sunday without legislative action .
The provisions include roving wiretaps tapping lines related to an individual without explicit court approval for new phone lines .
Also included are surveillance powers targeting lone - wolf terrorism suspects , and the authority of the federal government to seize assets and records in anti-terrorism probes .
The McDermott amendment would have outlawed measures such as threatening detainees , using prolonged isolation and applying duct tape over a prisoner ’s eyes .
It would also prohibit an interrogator from “ using force or the threat of force to coerce an individual to desecrate the individual ’s religious articles , or to blaspheme his or her religious beliefs , or to otherwise participate in acts intended to violate the individual ’s religious beliefs . ”
Rep . Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said the amendment was far too vague , noting , “ If a woman interviews a Muslim without a head covering , is that blasphemy ? ”
On the House floor , intelligence committee Chairman Rep. Silvestre Reyes , Texas Democrat , said the amendment was only codifying what Mr. Obama already outlawed in his first executive orders after he took office in January 2009 .
His spokeswoman , Ms. Littig , said , “ At the end of the day this chairman believes this vote on the amendment is a vote of conscience . ”
The amendment ’s sponsor , Rep. Jim McDermott , made a protest visit to Iraq in 2002 prior to the U.S. invasion .
In 2008 , a federal indictment against Muthanna Al - Hanooti , the man who arranged Mr. McDermott ’s trip , said then - Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ’s Iraqi intelligence service paid for the trip .
Mr. Hoekstra said he was concerned that the bill would make intelligence officers more risk - averse .
“ In the intelligence community today , these folks already believe they are under attack by this administration , and this just reinforces this , ” Mr. Hoekstra said .
“ This is outrageous .
There has not been one minute of hearings or debates on this amendment , and you are putting something in an [ intelligence ] bill that could put officers in jail for life .
What are you thinking ? ”
Last year , Mr. Obama authorized the disclosure of Justice Department memos that provided a legal rationale for waterboarding , or simulated drowning , and other enhanced interrogation techniques .
He also released to the public a CIA inspector general ’s report on the enhanced interrogation program that was used on avowed terrorist leaders such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
Liz Cheney , daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and the chairman of Keep America Safe , a group that opposes making the enhanced interrogation illegal , said Democrats were threatening intelligence professionals .
“ Democrats in Congress now want to threaten them with criminal prosecutions and deprive them of valuable tactics that protect America , ” she said .

DMs are the unsung heroes of tabletop RPGs .
They get a bad reputation ( sometimes deservingly ) for being a little power hungry , often times controlling , and frequently heartless when it comes to playing games .
But the truth is that every DM has their own style of DMing and their own approach to the game .
Some like the whole edge - of - your - seat - omg - you ’re - all - gonna - die approach ; others want the game to be fun first and foremost .
However , regardless of personality or style , DMs are truly the center of any tabletop RPG .
They ’re the creative force behind adventures and the grand master orchestrators of the game .
As such , they do deserve the respect of their players ( so long as they deserve it ; I ’ve heard of instances where DMs go far beyond the realm of decency ) .
With my last two DMs as models I though I ’d put together a few tips that , hopefully , lead toward peace , respect , and fun at the gaming table .
1 ) “ Tolkien called , he wants his plot back . ”
Do n’t criticize the world .
I have the fortune of being married to one of my DMs , and I know how much work he puts into each and every encounter , not to mention the mountains of research behind every setting ( and we ’re talking almost as much time as a part - time job would require ) .
Saying stuff like , “ Ooooh , a tavern scene .
I ’m soooo surprised ” might be funny to say once or twice , but it ’s important to remember that — especially with some DMs — work on a given session takes hours and hours .
Sometimes they do have to rely on convention ( as is expected ) .
If you ’ve got issues with the storytelling , it ’s better brought up in private and not in front of the rest of the company .
2 ) “ Man , I ’m sick of healing . ”
Do n’t complain about your own character and how it functions in the game .
If you ’re a cleric , do n’t bitch about healing .
If you ’re a cloth - wearer , do n’t gripe that the monsters keep hitting your AC .
If you ’re two good mace bashes from death , do n’t mention how unattached you are to your character .
Consequently , do n’t in - your - face dare the DM to kill off your character .
A successful DM plays a balancing act throughout the entire campaign , and as I once said to my husband , it ’s basically a matter of losing every single time you play ( unless you really are trying to kill the characters ) but losing really well .
Sometimes that makes for a very tense atmosphere .
But do n’t be the tipping point ; antagonizing does n’t make the game fun for anyone .
3 ) “ But I do n’t want to die !
Stop attacking me .
Jeez . ”
Do n’t voice your constant fears that the DM is going to kill your character .
I am guilty of this on occasion .
Our current D&D 4e campaign is very low on healing .
Essentially it ’s up to one very conniving gnome bard ( ahem , me ) to provide what paltry healing he can .
Considering Cullin ( my gnome ) has the lowest AC in the group , he can essentially fall unconscious with about four good hits if he gets on the bad side of an orc ( which I try to avoid , what with all the going invisible ) .
Still , I ’m constantly anxious about dying , especially in situations where I ca n’t get all stealthy .
As our current DM Christian has pointed out to me , over and over again , he ’s not trying to destroy me .
Sometimes the rolls are high ( or low ) and the game mechanics take over .
It ’s about fun , ultimately , and if your DM is a good person like mine , chances are even if the worst thing happens , they ’ll figure out a creative way around it .
4 ) “ We totally wiped within five minutes , and the healer went down … ”
Do n’t leave the DM out of conversation , and do n’t wander too far from the game .
Sure out of game banter is fun , and certainly part of the social aspect of RPGs .
But if you ’re going on and on about your WoW guild ’s last raid , and you look over and spot the DM glaring at your from behind their screen , chances are you ’ve let the conversation go a little too long .
While it ’s part of the DM ’s responsibility to keep the game going , they can be easily outnumbered by chatty players .
That slows down the game , and can lead to DM frustration .
And a frustrated DM might do some rather unkind things to get attention .
Like unleash a displacer beast on you .
Not that that ’s ever happened to us * cough * .
5 ) “ … ” Do n’t forget to thank them .
While I ’ve not encountered it in any recent groups , there have been times when it ’s abundantly clear at the end of each session that the players are grumpy and / or rushed and then simply forget to be courteous .
Remember that time investment thing I talked about earlier ?
DMs often spend a heck of a lot of time –not just world building –but creating dungeons , crafting monsters , and developing overall atmosphere for the campaign .
It takes a special kind of person to dedicate the time and creative energy to a campaign , and an even rarer sort to make it entertaining , surprising , exciting , and fun .
Do n’t feel like you have to go overboard with this ; sometimes a heartfelt thanks , a handshake , or a job - well - done is all you have to do .
In the end , a happy , appreciated DM can make all the difference in the world .
Anyone have any other suggestions to share ?
Any disgruntled DMs with stories to share ?
Let us know !

What child has not sat starry - eyed around the fire , dreaming of the goodies to come on January 1 — Public Domain Day ?
The thought of new books and movies and music coming out from copyright is enough to send sugarplums dancing through heads , unless you live in the US in 2010 .
In which case , you have nothing to celebrate , since nothing is entering the public domain this year .
Thanks to various copyright terms extensions over the last four decades , the US is living in the midst of a public domain " donut hole " under which no important works will come out of copyright protection .
Before the 1976 Copyright
Act reforms , copyright in the US lasted for 28 years , with another 28 if an extension was applied for .
Under the old regime , works from 1953 would have entered the public domain this week , works like C.S. Lewis ' The Silver Chair and Saul Bellow 's The Adventures of Augie March .
But the 1976 copyright reforms extended copyright , and 1998 's so - called " Mickey Mouse " term extension went even further .
Thanks to those laws , much pre-1976 material that is not already in the public domain was granted a 95 - year period of copyright protection ; books published since now have life +70 protection .
The end result is a gap in which no major works will enter the public domain in the US .
Librarian John Mark Ockerbloom calls it a " public domain freeze " and says that " no copyrights of published works will expire here in the US due to age for another nine years , at least . "
Duke University 's Center for the Public Domain also lamented what might have been this week with a long post on how the public domain would have been enriched in 2010 by the addition of Casino Royale and the first issue of Playboy — now locked up for another few decades thanks to retroactive term extensions .
This is n't just about making popular works available for free , either .
The vast majority of creative material has a shelf life of months ( or less ) , and only about 15 percent of all copyrighted works were renewed under the pre-1976 law .
As the Center points out , this means that 85 percent of copyrighted material from 1981 would have entered the public domain on January 1 , 2010 were it not for the rule change .
A staggering amount of " orphaned " content is tied up under copyright law , but freeing it is not simple .
Congress has been taking a whack at it , though orphan works legislation is on the back burner for the moment .
In Europe , despite a set of recent term extensions , material did enter the public domain this week .
A rough list is available from Public Domain Works , based on authors dying in 1939 ( 70 years ago ) .
If any of our European readers ever wanted open access to William Basil Worsfold 's 1893 work A Visit To Java : With An Account Of The Founding Of Singapore ... well , 2010 should be a very good year .
At MODELS 2008 Don Batory gave a talk on how category theory relates to Software Product Lines ( SPL ) and to Model Driven Engineering ( MDE ) .
There 's a good paper covering most of the talk so I wo n't go into much detail here .
But let me try to convey the aspects I found the most interesting .
I do n't want to pretend I know much about category theory but I believe that one does n't need to know much more than that it is a bunch of points and a bunch of arrows between them to dig what Don has on his mind ( let 's see how many categorists read this ) .
MDE is about refinement : going from highly abstract models , one gradually gets to an implementation via models with increasing level of refinement .
Don presented an example of a process which derives Bytecode from a DSL via a more specific DSL and Java code .
So here we got :
DSL 1 → DSL 2 → Java → Bytecode
Now to get a category , consider program representations as points and transformations as arrows between them .
Note that identity transformations and composition of transformations exist .
However non-groundbreaking this might seem at first sight , it is important to realize that such diagram is an important concept in MDE and it might be worth including such as an artifact in software development ( the paper points to relevant work on megamodels and on tool chain diagrams ) .
Ok , MDE development chain is a category , now what about SPL ?
A software product line is a means of developing and maintaining a family of similar software artifacts ( typically programs ) .
As reuse is the key , these family members are compositions of features ( some might want to call them aspects at the software level ) .
So where 's the category hidden in this setup ?
Imagine programs of a product line as points and features as arrows between them .
So a feature is a delta adding functionality to a program which gets us to another program .
As a particular software product line considers only certain compositions of features , a feature model is used to determine which compositions of features , also known as arrows , are valid ( or are considered if you wish ) .
Now this really gets groovy if we combine MDE ( refinement ) and SPL ( program synthesis ) .
Imagine you got a software product line which we want to refine into another product line .
Categorically speaking , we need to transform not only points to points but also arrows to arrows — features of the first product line to the features of the more refined one .
In effect , a product - line is a directed graph ( category ) , and what we are doing in refining a product line is mapping a directed graph ( category ) to another directed graph ( category ) .
So let 's say we have a product line S in which the program s 1 is mapped to the program s 2 by the feature f S .
Further , the product line S is refined to a product line B in which b 1 is mapped to b 2 by f B .
Now if we know that b 1 is a refinement of s 1 and b 2 a refinement of s 2 , we obtain the following arrows :
The cool think is that this should commute :
If I want to get from s 1 to b 2 , I can either go via b 2 and use → f B or , I can go to s 2 via → f S and then refine to b 2 .
If the term commuting diagram popped out in your head , it 's not by accident ( if it has n't , the diagram above is a commuting diagram ) .
How 's that useful ?
Don describes two scenarios , one when testing ( verifying ) this commutativity led to a discovery of bugs in his software and one where taking one route was computationally more efficient than taking the other .
So the morale is : " Look for commuting diagrams . "
To conclude let me advertise my own work ( done with Goetz Botterweck ) , which investigates the refinement of feature models and I think it would be interesting to investigate how it relates to the concepts by Don .
And I encourage anyone who 's dabbling or working with Software Engineering to read this article as it's a fruitful ground for ideas and one does n't need to be scared of math as there 's only little of it .
The question if dogs are colorblind , specifically red - green colorblind or if dogs only see shades of gray is raised among dog owners quite often .
Even on the internet the question concerning dog vision is discussed controversial .
But there is a simple answer to that question which I would like to share with you supported by some scientific resources .
Actually there are two distinct questions which I would like to ask , answer and set in relation hereafter :
Can dogs see colors ? —
Answer : Yes
Are dogs colorblind ? —
Answer : Yes
Let me explain this two answers to you a bit more in detail .
Dogs can see colors
Dogs not only see in shades of gray but also can see distinct colors contrary to what most people belief .
About one hundred years ago some scientific tests were made to find out more about the color vision of dogs .
But these tests were n’t that scientific as they thought and the researchers concluded only that color vision does n’t play a part in the daily life of a dog .
Only about 90 years later distinct researches have shown that dogs can perceive colors .
Neitz , Geist and Jacobs researched in 1989 the color vision of domestic dogs and found the following facts :
Dogs have two different color receptors in their eyes and therefore are dichromats .
One color receptor peaks at the blue - violet range , the other at the yellow - green range .
Conclusion : Dogs are green - blind which is one form of red - green color blindness also called deuteranopia .
This results were support by later researches of Jacobs with colleagues in 1993 and Miller and Murphy in 1995 .
Dogs are colorblind
This directly leads us to the second question concerning the color blindness of dogs .
Colorblind does n’t relate to not see any colors but describes the fact that you ca n’t see the same color range as somebody with normal vision .
Because of that any kind of color vision deficiency is called color blindness .
Therefore dogs are colorblind because of their dichromatic color vision .
Colors dogs ca n’t distinguish
Actually the color spectrum made up of wavelengths of light is the same to all of us .
Only the perception of those colors can be quite different .
As dogs only have two different color receptors in their eyes they have problems to distinguish certain colors :
Red — Orange — Green
Greenish Blue — Gray
Different shades of Purple
The list is not completed and there are a lot of different shades which ca n’t be differentiated if you are colorblind .
And the conclusion is dogs can see colors but are at the same time colorblind .
More facts on the vision of dogs can be found in the book Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training , Vol. 1 : Adaptation and Learning by Steven R. Lindsay .
But we already knew that the Republicans would do whatever they could to blow up the health care reform bill .
Anybody who was shocked by that has apparently gotten their news channel confused with their cartoon channel .
So yeah .
Of course they did .
The more fearful they become that health care reform could actually happen , and weighing the consequences of what such a dramatic achievement could do for the standing of President Barack Obama , they stayed up late nights figuring out where to aim their next shot because they were beginning to run low on bullets .
And that ’s when our resident village idiot from Michigan , Rep. Bart Stupak , came up with the abortion tactic .
He and his crew decided that the best way to peel votes away from this thing in the House was to throw up a smoke screen using the Republicans ’ age - old favorite issue of abortion .
Rather than coming out and saying they simply must derail health care reform and President Obama by any means necessary ( because the polls show Obama ’s popularity is back up again and a majority of Americans are strongly in favor of health care reform ) the decision was made to instead say , “ Hey , I just ca n’t support a bill that might provide federal funds to abortion .
Nothing against health care or that Obama guy , but we simply must stand up for these unborn kids . ”
And 64 so - called Democrats actually fell in line behind that shit .
And that , my friends , is the real and true shocker .
Because it exposes the Achille ’s heel of this supposed Democratic majority on the Hill , namely that it is not a true majority in any shape or form .
The Democratic party is infected by a host of fake Democrats , many of whom are so conservative that one has to wonder why they got on board our boat in the first place .
Or why we welcomed them aboard .
I mean , I ’d rather have 50 team members I knew I could count on than 64 who had knives pulled and aimed at the lower portion of my spine .
That ’s not exactly what you ’d call team comraderie .
And Stupak apparently figured that out and went to work building that revelation into the design of his political grenade , which regrettably forces me to re-evaluate my assessment of him as a village idiot .
Because that was a pretty deft political move , Bart .
Evil as hell , but most definitely the kind of cold hard politics we ’ve all come to love about Washington .
So just to make sure we ’re clear ; this is n’t about saving the unborn at all .
This is n’t even about opposition to health care reform .
Not really .
This is about strangling Obama ’s agenda in its crib before it can get up and walk .
So somebody had better set some traps inside that crib .
Either that or make sure baby is packing heat .

The DNA comes from the skeleton of a male in his twenties Scientists have analysed DNA extracted from the remains of a 30,000 - year - old European hunter - gatherer .
Studying the DNA of long - dead humans can open up a window into the evolution of our species ( Homo sapiens ) .
But previous studies of this kind have been hampered by scientists ' inability to distinguish between the ancient human DNA and modern contamination .
In Current Biology journal , a German - Russian team details how it was possible to overcome this hurdle .
Svante Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and colleagues used the latest DNA sequencing techniques to study genetic information from human remains unearthed in 1954 at Kostenki , Russia .
Excavations at Kostenki , on the banks of the river Don in southern Russia , have yielded large concentrations of archaeological finds from the Palaeolithic ( roughly 40,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago ) .
Some of the finds date back as far as 45,000 years .
The ironic thing is that our group has been one of those that raised this issue
Professor Svante Paabo , Max Planck Institue
The DNA analysed in this study comes from a male aged 20 - 25 who was deliberately buried in an oval pit some 30,000 years ago .
Known as the Markina Gora skeleton , it was found lying in a crouched position with fists reaching upwards and a face orientated down towards the dirt .
The bones were covered in a pigment called red ochre , thought to have been used in prehistoric funeral rites .
The type of DNA extracted and analysed is that stored in mitochondria - the " powerhouses " of cells .
This mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is passed down from a mother to her offspring , providing a unique record of maternal inheritance .
Using technology pioneered in the study of DNA from Neanderthal bones , they were able to distinguish between ancient genetic material from the Kostenki male and contamination from modern people who handled the bones , or whose DNA reached the remains by some other means .
The ancient skeleton was unearthed in 1954 at Kostenki in Russia ( Courtesy of Vladimir Gorodnyanskiy )
The new approach , developed by Professor Paabo and his colleagues , exploits three features which tend to distinguish ancient DNA from modern contamination .
One of these is size ; fragments of ancient DNA are often shorter than those from modern sources .
Previous ancient DNA studies used the widespread polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) technology .
PCR amplifies a few pieces of genetic material , generating thousands to millions of copies of a sequence .
But the researchers found many fragments of ancient DNA were too small to be amplified by PCR .
A second characteristic of ancient DNA was its tendency to show particular changes , or mutations , in the genetic sequence at the ends of DNA molecules .
A third feature was a characteristic breakage of molecules at particular positions in the DNA strand .
Trust issues
The apparent ease with which modern DNA can infiltrate ancient remains has led many researchers to doubt even those studies employing the most rigorous methods to weed out contamination by modern genetic material .
" The ironic thing is that our group has been one of those that raised this issue , " Professor Paabo told BBC News .
" To take animal studies on cave bears , for example , if we use PCR primers specific for human DNA on cave bear bones , we can retrieve modern human DNA on almost every one .
That has made me think : ' how can I trust anything on this ' . "
Large concentrations of Palaeolithic finds have come from Kostenki Using the new techniques , the researchers were able to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome of the Markina Gora individual .
Future studies like the one in Current Biology could help shed light on whether the humans living in Europe 30,000 years ago are the direct ancestors of modern populations or whether they were replaced by immigrants who introduced farming to the continent several thousand years ago .
The modern gene pool contains a wide variety of mtDNA lineages .
Studying these maternal lineages provides scientists with clues to the origins and histories of human populations .
Scientists look for known genetic signatures in order to classify an individual 's mtDNA into different types , or " haplogroups " .
These haplogroups represent major branches on the family tree of Homo sapiens .
Early arrival
The researchers were able to assign the Kostenki individual to haplogroup " U2 " , which is relatively uncommon among modern populations .
U2 appears to be scattered at low frequencies in populations from South and Western Asia , Europe and North Africa .
Despite its rarity , the very presence of this haplogroup in today 's Europeans suggests some continuity between Palaeolithic hunters and the continent 's present - day inhabitants , argue the authors of the latest study .
Distinguishing ancient DNA from modern has been difficult until now U2 , along with closely related haplogroups such as U5 , are among those which could plausibly have arrived in Europe during the Palaeolithic .
Geneticists use well - established techniques to " date " particular genetic events , such as when a haplogroup first diversified .
The " U " branch ( comprising haplogroups U1 , U2 , U3 and so on ) appears to be more ancient than many other genetic lineages found in Europe .
A recent study found a very high percentage of U types in the skeletal remains of ancient hunter - gatherers from Central Europe compared with later farming immigrants and modern people from the region .
Meanwhile , an analysis last year of mtDNA from 28,000 - year - old remains unearthed at Paglicci Cave in Italy showed this individual belonged to haplogroup " H " - the most common type found in modern Europeans .

Harry Potter did not make my list .
There .
I said it .
I read every last one of the wizard ’s adventures , I swear , but now the whole experience is kind of a blur of Quidditch and complicated potions .
And while there is no denying their influence on book publishing , I ca n’t very well list books I can barely remember .
There are , undoubtedly , plenty of other books I have forgotten , or just never got around to reading .
Some I could n’t shoehorn in ; several books of poetry I remembered came just before the new decade , so there ’s no verse on my list .
And , so : no more equivocating , no more excuses .
This is my list of books from the past 10 years – in chronological order – that I can’t forget .
‘ White Teeth ’ Zadie Smith ( 2000 )
An epic novel about race , class , and gender seemed the perfect way to start the decade ( the century even ! ) in publishing .
Despite its astounding geographic , historical , and cultural range this debut novel is most remarkable for the affection with which the author treats all of her characters and which , in turn , makes them so delightfully human .
‘ Interpreter of Maladies ’ Jhumpa Lahiri ( 2000 ) Before American readers were treated to a welcome deluge of Indian and Indian - American fiction , there was Lahiri ’s exquisite collection of stories of immigration and assimilation .
Many of the stories take place in Boston and Cambridge ; after reading Lahiri ’s story “ Sexy ’’ I took my husband to the Mapparium at the Christian Science Center and asked him to whisper to me from across the bridge .
‘ A HeartbreakingWork of Staggering Genius ’ Dave Eggers ( 2001 ) Before James Frey and company sullied the reputation of the whole genre , Eggers strove for painstaking authenticity in his hyperbolically titled memoir .
The book ’s success launched Eggers and his literary magazine McSweeney ’s into a different orbit .
Eggers opened writing and tutoring centers for children around the country , including one here in Boston , started a fantastically imaginative publishing imprint , and just this year two of his screenplays made it to film — “ Away We Go ’ ’ and “ Where the Wild Things Are . ’’
On newsstands now ( if you can find a copy ) : McSweeney ’s version of an old - fashioned broadsheet , the “ San Francisco Panorama . ’’
‘ The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay ’ Michael Chabon ( 2001 )
This big , juicy historical novel has it all — war , romance , magic , superheroes .
Cousins Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay team up to create a comic book hero , the Escapist , who , among other feats , pummels Hitler .
Chabon ’s novel certainly had a hand in lifting comic books and graphic novels out of geekdom and into the realm of literature .
‘ A Problem from Hell : America and the Age of Genocide ’ Samantha Power ( 2002 )
In this powerful call to action , Power examines the history of genocides in the 20th century and condemns the United States for failing to act .
Her stern interventionist talk stirred controversy and led , eventually , to an advisory spot on the Obama campaign .
Her political career was temporarily derailed after she called Hillary Clinton a “ monster . ’’
Power apologized and this year joined the White House , where she now sits on the National Security Council .
‘ My Name is Red ’ Orhan Pamuk , translated by Erdag Goknar ( 2002 ) This murder mystery , set in 16th - century Istanbul and narrated by some unlikely characters – among them a tree , a gold coin , red ink – opened Americans ’ eyes to Turkish luminary Pamuk before he won the Nobel Prize in 2006 .
In 2005 Pamuk emerged as an important political voice after he spoke frankly about the Armenian genocide and subsequently faced criminal charges in Turkey .
‘ The Known World ’ Edward P. Jones ( 2003 )
In the tradition of artists with mind - numbing day jobs ( like Wallace Stevens , the insurance agent - poet ) , Jones was an editor at a tax journal for almost 20 years .
After Jones lost his job in 2002 he began to write this gorgeously stylized novel about slavery full time .
Thank God he was fired .
‘ Gilead ’ Marilynne Robinson ( 2004 )
During the 25 years between the publication of her first luminous novel , “ Housekeeping , ’’ and this , her second novel , the gossip was that Robinson was blocked and obsessively revising her first .
This book , an epistolary novel written from an aging father to his young son , quieted the rumors immediately .
‘ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma : A Natural History of Four Meals ’ Michael Pollan ( 2006 )
Without stunts or scolding Michael Pollan changed the way ( some ) Americans look at frozen dinners and Chicken McNuggets .
At least until their next road trip .
The KDE community has announced the immediate availability of the KDE Software Compilation 4.4.0 ( “ KDE SC ” is the new name of what used to be called just “ KDE “ ) .
In preparation for this event , the kde.org website was re-vamped yesterday to reflect their “ shift in marketing and promotion vocabulary ” .
Looks shiny and new !
Also , I think that the new layout makes it easier for people to find information about the KDE community and the software compilation .
Users of small form - factor laptops will be interested to learn that the new Plasma desktop manager now offers two workspace choices .
One is the usual desktop - oriented workspace .
The interesting addition is a netbook - oriented workspace , with special consideration for the netbook ’s smaller screen and typical mobile usage patterns .
I have not yet installed KDE 4.4 on my own Asus EEE netbook but I will most certainly do so , later this week !
In order to fully appreciate the work that went into KDE SC 4.4 and learn what has changed since KDE 4.3 , you should definitely take the visual tour .
Lots of new functionality and usability improvements are hidden beneath this new desktop workspace and just waiting to be discovered and used to the fullest .
Slackware packages galore !
Like I did with the pre-releases of KDE 4.4 , I have prepared new goodies for all you Slackers .
Get those 32 - bit and 64 - bit packages for Slackware Linux and install them on your computers ( or build them yourself using the accompanying SlackBuild scripts , patches and sources ) .
You will find all of those at http://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/4.4.0/ .
Please take good notice of the fact that these packages are built for Slackware - current .
You can safely install the KDE 4.4.0 packages if you are running a slackware - current from around 01 february 2010 or newer .
Do not try to install these packages on Slackware 13.0 .
Slackware 64 - bit :
Do n’t forget to also install the updated or new dependencies !
These “ deps ” packages can be found in the “ x86_64 / deps ” directory .
The KDE 4.4.0 packages themselves can be found in “ x86_64/kde “
And of course , the localization packages ( non-english language translations of KDE ) are available in “ x86_64/ kdei “ .
Slackware 32 - bit :
Do n’t forget to also install the updated or new dependencies !
These “ deps ” packages can be found in the “ x86 / deps ” directory .
The KDE 4.4.rc2 packages themselves can be found in “ x86/kde “
If you need a language pack , you can grab one from the 64 - bit package tree “ x86_64 / kdei ” since these packages are in fact architecture - independent .
Here are the steps on how you download the packages and install them .
You can have an older version of KDE installed , but that is not required .
You will end up with KDE 4.4.0 installed on your system .
Instructions are for the 64 - bit packages , I think you can figure out how to change them if you want the 32 - bit versions :
Download everything in the directory http://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/4.4.0/x86_64/ :
# lftp -c " open http://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/4.4.0/ ; mirror x86_64 " Change into the directory “ x86_64 ″ which has just been created in your current directory :
# cd x86_64
Remove the no longer required kdelibs - experimental package if you still have that installed .
It is part of KDE 4.3.x ( i.e. Slackware 13.0 did not have this package ) .
If you do not have kdelibs - experimental on your system , you will get a harmless error message that you can ignore :
# removepkg kdelibs - experimental Install / upgrade the KDE 4.4 dependencies :
# upgradepkg -- reinstall -- install - new deps/*.t?z
Install / upgrade KDE4.4.0 packages : # upgradepkg -- reinstall -- install - new kde /*.t?z
Install / upgrade a language package if you prefer to have the KDE interface in your local language ( I used “ nl ” in the example command , you should substitute your own language code there ) :
# upgradepkg -- reinstall -- install - new kdei/kde-l10n-nl-*.t?z
Of course , you should not run those commands while running KDE …!
If you want to compile the packages from source like I did , that is entirely possible using the provided sources and build scripts .
It will take quite a while though …
Have fun , Eric
Note for users of any KDE 4.4 pre-releases :
If you never before installed and used one of the Betas or Release Candidates of KDE 4.4 , then you can safely remove one package , virtuosoconverter .
This package is only needed if you were using “ nepomuk desktop search ” before this final release of KDE 4.4.0 .
# removepkg virtuosoconverter
If you ran any Beta or Release Candidate of KDE 4.4.0 prior to upgrading to 4.4.0 , then you will notice that your nepomuk database will automatically be converted from virtuoso v5 to v6 , the very first time you login to your KDE 4.4 desktop .
This process will take a while ( not too long ) and will temporarily double the size of your nepomuk database ( by default , this database consumes a maximum of 50 MB in your homedirectory below ~/.kde ) .
If this database is not valuable to you , you can also decide to skip this database conversion by just deleting the database before starting KDE :
$ rm -r ~/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository /*
or by following the instructions in Sebastian Trueg ’s tutorial : http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Metadata/Nepomuk/TipsAndTricks#Remove_all_Strigi-indexed_data
If you manually remove the old nepomuk data , you can also remove the virtuosoconverter package of course .
If you do not have any clue about what I am talking about and what you should do , just do n’t do anything … and all will be well .
A final remark about nepomuk and strigi – I think that KDE 4.4 finally has a desktop search which is optimized to a level that it no longer eats all your CPU cycles or claim a large chunk of your harddrive .
Now I just wish that the strigi developer properly fixes the indexing of my PDF files !
The pilot study was the first time a food allergy had been desensitized Doctors in Cambridge believe they may soon have a cure for peanut allergies .
The largest ever trial to find a treatment for potentially fatal peanut allergies is to give sufferers tiny amounts daily to build up tolerance .
The Addenbrookes team will give increasing doses of peanut flour to 104 British children , up to the equivalent of five nuts a day .
Twenty out of 23 sufferers in an earlier study became able to eat more than 30 peanuts safely .
The new £ 1 m three - year trial could lead to a widely available treatment .
About one in 50 young people in the UK suffers from peanut allergies which can cause breathing problems , itching and , in severe cases , a potentially fatal inflammatory reaction called anaphylaxis .
The new trial funded by the Department of Health 's Institute of Health Research will involve more than 100 seven to 17 - year - olds .
They will be given daily doses of peanut flour , starting at about one milligram , added to yoghurt .
" This is going to be the largest trial of its kind in the world and it should give us a definitive idea of whether the approach works and whether it 's safe , " said Dr Andrew Clark .
The pilot study built up sufferers ' tolerance to five nuts , or 800 milligrams , which was then taken as a maintenance treatment for at least six weeks .
A year on from the start of the study , 20 of the patients could eat 32 peanuts safely - meaning they no longer needed to screen food labels and be wary of what they ate .
The researchers believe a treatment could be available within two to three years .
But they warned against people attempting their own trials at home .

NHS manager who bragged ' I am better than a man ' jailed for 12 months over lesbian sex attack
Cottingham was jailed for 12 months after admitting sexual assault
An NHS manager who bragged : ' I 'm better than a man ' during a lesbian attack was jailed for a year yesterday .
Teresa Cottingham , 35 , drunkenly floored another woman with a martial arts move in a hotel room before throttling her and forcing a sex act on her .
Cottingham , who has since married a man , had travelled up from Eastbourne to North London on January 26 last year to attend a conference .
After checking into the Premier Inn hotel in Euston she joined a group in a nearby pub where she became ' almost senseless ' with alcohol , Blackfriars Crown Court heard .
The victim , who was known to her , escorted her back to the hotel in a taxi .
Adam Davis , prosecuting , said : ' In the hotel room the defendant collapsed onto the bed .
She started to get undressed .
Ms Cottingham asked the victim to make a cup of tea .
' The victim had her back to the defendant and it seems the defendant tried to pull her back onto the bed by the waistband of her shorts .
' She refers to the defendant as keeping on trying to pull her onto the bed . '
The young woman warned her : ' Look Teresa , you 'll regret this in the morning ' and finished making the bedtime drink . '
But Cottingham shouted ' You know you want it , you 've been parading your a*** in front of me ' .
' The defendant then pulled her onto the bed and there was a struggle , ' added the prosecutor .
As she tried to subdue her victim , she bragged : ' I know what I 'm doing - I 'm better than a man . '
The victim at first thought Cottingham was joking , but realised she meant business when she tripped her over with the martial arts move , causing her to hit her head on a cupboard .
The attack happened in this Premier Inn hotel in North London after Cottingham was helped home by her victim
The barrister said : ' There was a certain amount of wrestling , with the complainant making it perfectly clear she did n't want to participate .
Cottingham got more aggressive and forceful . '
The woman , who cannot be identified , took advantage of a pause to hoist herself onto the bed and away from Cottingham , who demanded to know : ' What do you want ? ' and was told : ' Get off me . '
' The victim 's shorts and underwear had been taken off by this point , said the prosecutor , who added that the victim was grabbed by the throat .
' She was pushed back and every time she tried to move , her throat was squeezed harder . '
It was then that she performed the sex act on her victim .
The court heard that Cottingham eventually said : ' If you 're not comfortable with this , I 'll stop ' , but the victim told her it was ' too late for that ' .
Cottingham then fell asleep , leaving the woman alone .
When Cottingham was arrested on February 5 she claimed the drunken incident was between ' two consenting adults ' but confessed she had carpet burns on her knees .
She eventually changed her plea to guilty on the first day of her trial on January 4 this year , despite being unable to recall much of what happened .
Sharon Bailey , defending , urged Judge Ian Karsten QC to suspend any prison sentence because Cottingham , who acted ' completely out - of - character ' has already suffered enough .
The court was told the mother - of - one has been sacked from her position with Sussex Partnership , a mental health trust , over the ' devastating ' scandal .
Cottingham , of Lewes , East Sussex who admitted sexual assault , had managed to get a job in a pub but was forced to leave after her secret got out .
' She had a professional position with a good salary , ' said Ms Bailey .
' She is no longer able to keep up with her outgoings and this may result in her being made bankrupt . '
The barrister added that Cottingham had married a man - who wept in the public gallery - just last week .
But the judge said : ' If this had been a man doing this , everyone would say " he has got to go down " . '
He added : ' This was a horrid attack .
' I accept you were drunk and that had you not been , you would not have done anything like that .
' It was a violent assault and humiliating for the victim .
The impact statement shows it 's really had long - term serious effects on her .
' As sex assaults go I have to say it really is a bad case . '

Hops are a key ingredient in beer and as we ’ve discussed before , provide much of the spice and flavor that defines many different styles of beer .
In our previous article we mentioned that there were a number of varieties of hops grown throughout the world , each having a unique bitterness , flavor and aroma .
The bitterness of hops is measured by calculating its alpha acid percentage , a measure of how much bittering chemicals the plant typical carries .
The average range is from 2 % Alpha Acid ( AA ) for aroma hops to 15 % AA for bittering hops .
Here ’s a look at some of the most popular varieties of hops .
Cascade –
This is by far the most popular variety of hops in America .
It ’s used in the majority of American made pale ales and IPAs , especially those from the West Coast .
It ’s noted for its strong aroma of citrus and grapefruit as well as subtle floral elements .
One of the reasons for their popularity is the versatility , as it can be used as a bittering , flavoring or aroma hop .
Lagunitas IPA , Sierra Nevada and Hop Devil are some popular brews which use Cascade in their brews .
6 % AA
Chinook – Another popular American variety .
Primarily used as a bittering agent , due to its high alpha acid rating , usually around 12 - 14 % AA .
It is similar to Cascade , but not as citrusy .
Redhook Copper Hook Spring
Ale makes great use of this type .
Fuggles – Originally British , but has since been grown by American brewers as well .
It has a grassy and somewhat cheesy flavor to it .
5 % AA .
Hallertau – A earthy , spicy hop from Germany .
Mostly used as an aroma hop due to its relativity low AA rating of 4 % .
Used in a number of Pilsners and other German inspired lagers .
Sam Adams Imperial Pilsners uses this extensively
Mt. Hood –
This American hop is very floral in both flavor and aroma , and used accordingly as a flavor and aroma hop .
6 % AA .
Spalt – German , fresh smelling and a bit grassy , used as a aroma and flavoring hop 5 % AA .
Target – From the UK , strongly herbal and floral .
Used as a bittering hop in many lagers and lighter ales .
11 % AA .
Tettnang – German , floral and spicy .
Used mostly as flavoring and aroma .
Anderson Valley ESB , Red Hook ESB and Sam Adams Oktoberfest .
4.5 % AA
Kent Goldings – Classic British hop .
Mild , but very Earthy , or grassy , with notes of blue cheese .
It ’s used in many English ales including Fuller ’s ESB , Samuel Smith Pale Ale and Young ’s London Ale .
5 % AA
Norther Brewer – From UK , but adapted grown elsewhere now .
It has a clean , grassy flavor .
Used as a bittering hop in Anchor Steam .
8 % AA
Magnum –
As the name might suggest , Magnum is extremely strong bittering hop .
Like most bittering hops it ’s not very well known for its taste , but it does have a lighter , piney quality .
12 % AA
Saaz – Fom the Czech Republic .
Like many European hops it tends to be clean and spicy rather than the floral and citrusy American hops .
It ’s primarily used as an aroma hop and can be found in Czech beers such as Pilsner Urquell .
3 % AA
Amarillo – Popular flavoring hop from US .
Similar to Cascade , but Earthier , and not as citrusy .
Used primarily as a bittering and flavoring hop .
9 % AA
Centennial – Moderately popular bittering hop .
Similar to Cascade , but stronger .
Sometimes known as “ Super Cascade ” .
Used in Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine , and Sierra Nevada Celebration .
10 % AA
Simcoe – Popular US bittering hop .
Has a spicy , piney aroma .
13 %AA .

This recipe has now featured on boards .ie ’s cooking club !
“ Igor ? Igor ! IGOR ! ”
“ Yeth mather ? ”
“ Bring forth the beef .
Bring forth the unsmoked bacon .
Bring forth the onions , the spices , the fresh chillies and the holy smoked new mexico reds .
Bring froth the salt and the cumin seed , the paprika and the uncouth star anise .
Make ready the Grand Pot , heat the Great Iron Skillet , and put the beer in the fridge , for Tonight !
TONIGHT , IGOR ! ”
“ Yeth mather ? ”
“ TONIGHT WE MAKE CHILLI ! ”
Every so often , you just have to fire up the pot and make a batch of chilli .
There ’s no other way around it .
Okay , first off , chilli is like religion in some parts .
Lots of different views on it and some people get very irate when you even mention that there are alternatives to their take on it .
Add beans to a texan ’s chilli and you apparently risk a punch - up .
And do n’t ever mention the origins of the dish , because nobody knows exactly where it came from and it seems everyone claims it bar the mexicans , who think it ’s a wierd kind of stew and that they have far better food at home .
But at it ’s basic core , chilli is just a braised beef stew , flavoured with chillis , chilli powder , cumin and thyme .
Everything else is an optional extra , but miss any of those core bits and you do n’t have chilli .
Please note – tomatoes are not on that list .
Chilli is a beef stew , not beef in tomato sauce …
This recipe is more or less my basic workaday chilli recipe .
It takes about two hours in total to make , but three quarters of that is cooking time , no stirring or checking required .
Like any stew , it freezes reasonably well , and keeps in the fridge for a week – so long as you do n’t make three kilos of the stuff you ’ll probably eat your way through it before that .
It does have beans , I like them .
If you do n’t , just do n’t add them , it ’ll work just as well .
Maybe a little less liquid if you do n’t add the beans , or a little more masa at the end .
Also , there are two specialist ingredients in here .
The first is chipotle chillis in adobo sauce .
I get mine from Fallon & Byrnes because it ’s close to hand , but there are other sources and you can find it easily enough on the net ( if you buy from a uk website , the shipping ’s cheap ) .
It ’s about a fiver for a jar from F&B and that one jar will do several pots of chilli .
And yes , it ’s worth it – it utterly changes the taste of the final chilli , and frankly , it lets you get away with cheaper meat , so it ’s worth it even on a penny - counting basis .
The second ingredient is masa harina .
I got some in a Texas chilli - kit some friends in the US sent me as a birthday gift a while back and I ’ve loved it ever since .
You can get it in F&B ’s as well , or on the net .
But , it ’s a bit of a luxury .
If you ca n’t find it , do n’t worry .
Ordinary plain flour works just as well ( you could smash some tortilla chips to pieces and add them in instead of flour , that works too , but you need to let it cook a bit longer so they fall apart in the liquid at the end ) .
And there ’s a pressure cooker in the recipe .
If you have one , brilliant .
If you do n’t , use the biggest heaviest pot you have and cook for about 4 to 6 hours , depending on the toughness of the meat , and you have to check every hour or so to ensure the liquid has n’t evaporated away .
On to the ingredients !
( Pardon the background mess , maid ’s day off dontcha know .
And that wonderful chopping board was € 20 at TK Maxx .
You have to love that place )
The ingredients .
Back row , left to right : spice grind ( more on that in a second ) , chopped fresh chillis , rehydrated dried new mexico red chillis , chopped onions , chopped sirloin tossed in olive oil and sea salt .
Front row , left to right : smashed and chopped garlic , diced choritzo , diced garlic , trimmed and cubed unsmoked back bacon , rib steak mince .
On the meat – you can use a wide range of meats for chilli .
But the key thing is , do n’t buy expensive meat .
Chilli started off as a poor man ’s dish and good chilli remains a cheap dish .
You probably do n’t want to use anything in it that costs much more than rump steak ( if you ’re using beef ) .
Stewing beef is perfect ( chuck steaks , if your butcher knows what they are , are excellent for this too and you at least know what cut you ’re getting ) .
It looks less than appetising , but the fact is , that connective tissue in there is going to break down to gelatin during cooking , and that gives an incredible texture to the end chilli .
This photos for this recipe show sirloin because it was on special at the butchers , and it ’s okayish , but it ’s just not as good as the cheaper cuts and I ’ve never used it for chilli since .
Also , the meat should be cubed , at least for the bulk of it .
I always add in a little mince ( I ’ll use lamb mince if I can find it ) to give the gravy a lot of body , but the bulk of the meat should be chunky .
So take your stewing beef chunks or rump steak and cut them down to small cubes , nothing larger than an inch to a side .
You should generally have one part mince to two parts cubed – the photos do show slightly more mince than that , but I ’ve since found it ’s better to ease back on the mince if you can .
The back bacon is just the cut they slice rashers from , but instead of cutting it into rashers , I bought a chunk about an inch wide and cubed it into small quarter - inch cubes , minus most of the fat .
Like chunky lardons .
You can find the bacon in a lot more shops now that we have a lot of polish folks living here , or your butcher will cut off a chunk for you .
If you ca n’t find it , just take four or five rashers and chop them up to small pieces , but the bacon ’s nicer if it ’s in chunks .
The choritzo you can leave out if you do n’t like it , but nearly every shop carries it these days ( hooray for immigrants ! ) .
If you put it in , just cut about an inch of choritzo sausage and cut it down to small cubes , around 4 - 5 mm per side .
You do n’t want too much , it ’s strongly flavoured stuff .
The beans are a religious thing .
Some people love them in chilli , some hate them .
Some will cook the beans and serve them seperately so that the lovers wo n’t have a punchup with the haters .
And then there ’s the types of beans .
Personally , I love black beans and pinto beans in my chilli , texas be damned .
Ordinary haricot or navy beans ( the kind Heinz use in tins ) are too flavourless , red kidney beans are n’t much better despite the tradition of using them , broad beans just fall apart to mush , and aduki beans get lost .
I have done chillis with up to seven different kinds of beans in the past , but mostly these days I just stick to black and pinto beans .
There should be about as many beans as mince , by weight , so about a pound of black or pinto beans in this recipe ( it ’s black beans in the photos ) .
If you even think of putting sweetcorn in this dish , by the way , you ’re an abomination unto dog and man alike .
And that just leaves the chillis – I like to use a mix of dried and fresh in my chilli if I can .
Variety is good .
If you get the dried chillis , it ’s easier to have that variety – I prefer to use a mix of ancho and new mexican red chillis if I can find them ( again , Fallon and Byrnes or the ‘ net , and you can buy tins of dried ancho chillis which will last several batches of chilli for under a tenner ) .
Rehydrate the dried chillis in plain tap water for a while , then drain them and squeeze them a bit to get rid of most of the water before you add them in .
Leave the seeds out of the fresh chillis if you ’re not a fan of chemical burns , and stick to ordinary jalapeno chillis ( I tried this with a scotch bonnet pepper before and had to dump the entire batch as inedible ) .
The amount you put in here is going to go up if you keep cooking this dish – but if you ’re just starting , try about two fresh chillis and four dried ones to start with .
If you like chillis , go wild .
Oh , and if you ’re working with chillis and like your eyes , spend € 20 in Boots ( or €9 online ) and buy a box of latex exam gloves to wear while prepping the chillis .
Cheapest effective solution ever .
On to the rest of the ingredients :
More ingredients .
Back row , left to right : Worcestershire sauce , ordinary beer , Nam Pla .
Front Row , left to right : tomato puree , dried thyme , paprika , jalapeno chilli flakes , chipotle chillies in adobo sauce , star anise .
No , Nam Pla is n’t a speciality ingredient , honest !
And yes , it seems a tad odd , but it and the star anise do the same thing – boost the savory taste of the meat .
If you ca n’t find one or the other , it ’s not a huge loss , but try for at least one .
BTW , I prefer to put the star anise in these small cotton spice bags , belt it with a mallet to smash it , and dump the bag into the pot – it ’s easier to retrieve it before serving that way .
The bags are cheap ( €3 for a pack of six if I remember right ) and I got mine from the kitchen shop off Grafton Street , but you can find them on any cooking shop website , or make one from cheesecloth .
The beer should be any ordinary beer .
Not stout or weisbier , and not lager if you can help it .
The former are too heavy and get horrible with cooking , the latter are too light .
And you only need two bottles .
One goes in the pot , one goes in the cook .
( Yes , you can use water if you want to skip the small amount of alcohol that will remain after cooking , but it ’ll be less tasty ) .
And the spices .
Cumin seeds , fennel seeds , black peppercorns , sea salt , chilli powder , all ground in the mortar .
The spice mix can be a bit personal , vary it to your tastes if you wish .
In this case , it ’s 1tsp cumin seeds , 0.5tsp fennel seeds , 0.5tsp black peppercorns , 1tsp sea salt and 1tsp chilli powder , all ground in the mortar ( though I ’ve been known to just cheat and use an electric blade coffee grinder of late , though I skip the peppercorns when I do as it does n’t do them quite so well for some reason ) .
Cumin , salt and chilli powder are pretty much required , they form the basis of the spices for the dish ; the fennel is there to try to cut down a bit on gaseous emissions caused by legume consumption and are optional , and the pepper is there to give a little kick at a different point on the tongue .
The one other thing about the spices is that they ’re ground from fresh because this is a poor man ’s dish .
It ’s far cheaper ( and far tastier ) to grind spices from seed because the spices last longer on the shelf ( 2 years - v- 3 months ) when whole than when preground like you get in tesco .
Oh , and you could add two bay leaves to the pot during cooking if you want .
I ’ve been trying that in the last batch or two , but I ’m not fully sold on the idea yet .
And the Great Chilli Pot , also known as a pressure cooker .
This one ’s a wee bit old , inherited from family , but modern ones are even better .
Since it ’s so heavy , we can sear in this as well as braise .
Step one : trim the sirloin , cube it , toss in salt and olive oil , then brown in batches in the Great Chilli
Pot on very high heat , with one teaspoon of adobo sauce added to each batch as it finishes up .
Then remove to a mixing bowl .
Step two : trim , cube and brown the bacon along with the diced choritzo , then remove to the mixing bowl with the beef .
Step three : brown the mince , then remove to the mixing bowl .
Make sure to brown the mince properly , stirring thoroughly and energetically to keep it moving and break it up until it is almost dry and crumbly .
Step four : sweat the onions down with one whole star anise , remove to bowl ( discarding the star anise ) , then fry the spices with the chopped fresh chillis and the chopped rehydrated dried chillis and the tomato puree and the garlic and the ginger .
Step five : deglaze the pot with beer , then add the liquid ingredients ( Nam Pla and Worcestershire ) and get that boiling .
Then add the dry black beans ( no presoak needed ) and dried thyme , and then all the previously cooked ingredients .
Bring back up to the boil , clamp on the lid of the pressure cooker , build up to pressure then back off to a simmer and leave it there for an hour .
Step six : take lid off pressure cooker , get faceful of steam and burn your hand on the lid , then stir the chilli .
Step seven : add a tablespoon of flour ( because you ca n’t find masa harina in Ireland – well , you can , in about three places in the entire country , but you can always go online … ) and then stir it in and leave it cook out , covered , for ten minutes .
If the gravy is still not thick enough , add more masa in teaspoon amounts , stirring and cooking for a few minutes each time , until the gravy is as thick as you want it .
( Hint – do n’t get it too thick , you want it to be just a little more watery than you think you do , because it will keep thickening for the next hour or so as the masa and beans continue to hydrate ) .
Step eight : admire the glory that is your chilli , then take a ladle and a bowl …
Step nine : put ladle of chilli in bowl , add a dollop of sour cream because you ’re caucasian , then using spoon , eat the delicious chilli 🙂

Here 's a nice little introductory article on TOR , The Onion Router , a privacy - enhancing technology that helps you to circumvent national , corporate and school firewalls and enhance your anonymity .
Originally developed by the US military to help communications get in and out of countries that heavily filter their networks , TOR is free / open software and is maintained by many volunteers around the world , including the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
TOR works by passing your traffic through several ( theoretically ) unrelated computers all over the Internet , using cryptography to keep the origin , destination , and intermediary steps secret from each computer it passes through .
You can run TOR on your own computers and they 'll become part of this array of intermediary hosts all over the net , making your network connection into a tool for privacy and free access to information .
Bill McGonigle , of Lebanon , New Hampshire , decided to become a Tor volunteer when he learned that people in Iran were protesting the results of their June Presidential election .
They were using the Internet to organize their meetings .
The Iranian government was trying to censor their messages to one another .
" I have a soft - spot for people trying to gain liberty for themselves , " he wrote in an email , " especially against tyrannical regimes .
It became known that they were using Tor to get around the censorship , so at that point I put up a relay … .
The people I 'd like to help are those living under violence - based oppression , most commonly orchestrated by dangerous and corrupt individuals posing as legitimate governments .
I 'd like to see an end to oppression wherever it exists . "

Back in 1991 , when yours truly was a starving comedian down and out in Los Angeles , he went to his local art house movie theatre and saw what ’s since been hailed as the cinematic anthem of Generation X — Richard Linklater ’s Slacker .
This week , almost 20 years later , he had the distinct pleasure of downloading and watching The Lionshare , which could arguably be called Slacker for the file - sharing generation … except that it ’s a much better film .
The Lionshare gets its title from a fictitious P2P network that becomes a backdrop for a peek into the lives of a group of modern - day twenty - somethings .
Like Slacker , The Lionshare is naturalistic , and the acting entirely believable to the point of being painful — in as much as unrequited crushes and such tend to be .
And very much unlike Slacker , The Lionshare has a point .
Though critics on IMDb call it file - sharing propaganda , I think the film is both subtle and effective at showing the stake we all have in the media we consume , whether it ’s paid for or not .
There ’s no finger - wagging here , as the sharing ( or piracy , as per your point of view ) is n’t put in any kind of judgmental light .
It ’s just there , in the background , but as pervasive as the media on real P2P networks tends to be .
As with Nasty Old People and Ink , the other BitTorrent breakout hits of 2009 , The Lionshare can be downloaded and enjoyed free of charge .
I went a step further and made a small donation via a PayPal link on the film ’s site .
After watching it you may feel compelled to do the same .
But definitely watch it , at the very least …
Neurons are core components of the brain , transmitting and processing data US scientists believe they have uncovered one of the mechanisms that enables the brain to form memories .
Synapses - where brain cells connect with each other - have long been known to be the key site of information exchange and storage in the brain .
But researchers say they have now learnt how molecules at the site of the synapse behave to cement a memory .
It is hoped the research , published in Neuron , could aid the development of drugs for diseases like Alzheimer's .
The deteriorating health of the synapses is increasingly thought to be a feature of Alzheimer 's , a disease in which short - term memory suffers before long - term recollections are affected .
Scientists have been perplexed for some time as to why , when synapses are strengthened , you have the degradation of proteins going on side by side with the synthesis of new proteins
Kenneth Kosik
University of California Santa Barbara
A strong synapse is needed for cementing a memory , and this process involves making new proteins .
But how exactly the body controls this process has not been clear .
Now scientists at the University of California Santa Barbara say their laboratory work on rats shows the production of proteins needed to cement memories can only happen when the RNA - the collection of molecules that take genetic messages from the nucleus to the rest of the cell - is switched on .
Until it is required , the RNA is paralysed by a " silencing " molecule - which itself contains proteins .
When an external signal comes in - for example when one sees something interesting or has an unusual experience - the silencing molecule fragments and the RNA is released .
This interesting development could give a greater understanding of the memory loss experienced by people with Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia and lead to new treatments
Rebecca Wood
Alzheimer 's Research Trust Kenneth Kosik of the university 's neuroscience research institute said : " One reason why this is interesting is that scientists have been perplexed for some time as to why , when synapses are strengthened , you have the degradation of proteins going on side by side with the synthesis of new proteins .
" So we have now resolved this paradox .
We show that protein degradation and synthesis go hand in hand .
The degradation permits the synthesis . "
Identifying the proteins the brain needs in order to cement the memory could ultimately have benefits for those suffering from memory disorders .
Rebecca Wood , head of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " Scientists say they have studied nerve cells in the laboratory and learnt more about how specific proteins may have a role in areas of the brain that transmit messages and help us store memories .
The health of synapses and their activity levels is becoming an important and interesting focus of research
Professor Julie Williams
" This interesting development could give a greater understanding of the memory loss experienced by people with Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia and lead to new treatments . "
The most recent projections suggest 115 million people across the globe will suffer from dementia by 2050 .
Julie Williams , professor of psychological medicine at Cardiff University , said : " Our increasing understanding of genetic risk factors in Alzheimer 's is pointing to the synapses so any new study in this area is welcome .
" Alzheimer 's is a complicated disease and it is early days , but the health of synapses and their activity levels is becoming an important and interesting focus of research . "

Duplicate
Ctrl +D duplicate selection
New object (s ) are placed exactly over the original (s ) and selected .
Clone
Alt +D clone object
A clone can be moved / scaled / rotated / skewed independently , but it updates the path , fill , and stroke from its original .
The clone is placed exactly over the original object and is selected .
You can only clone one object at a time ; if you want to clone several objects together , group them and clone the group .
Shift + Alt +D unlink clone
Unlinking a clone cuts the link to the original , turning the clone into a plain copy .
Shift +D select original
To find out which object this is a clone of , select the clone and give this command .
The original will be selected .
Bitmaps

This converts the selection to a rectangle with tiled pattern fill .
Shift + Alt +I pattern to object (s )
Each selected object with pattern fill is broken into the same object without fill and a single pattern object .
Group
Shift + Ctrl+U , Ctrl +G group selected objects
Use Ctrl+click to select objects within group .
Shift + Ctrl+G , Ctrl+U ungroup selected group(s )
This removes only one level of grouping ; press Ctrl + U repeatedly to ungroup nested groups .
Home raise selection to top
End lower selection to bottom
PgUp raise selection one step
PgDn lower selection one step
Path
Convert to path
Shift + Ctrl+C convert selected object (s ) to path
Ctrl +Alt+C convert stroke to path
Boolean operations
Ctrl ++ union
Union combines any number of objects into a single path , removing overlaps .
Ctrl +- difference
Difference works on 2 objects , extracting the top from the bottom .
Ctrl +* intersection
Intersection creates a path representing the common ( overlapping ) area of all selected objects .
Ctrl+^ exclusive OR ( XOR )
XOR is similar to Union , except that it works on 2 objects and removes areas where the objects overlap .
Ctrl+/ division ( cut )
Division cuts the bottom object into pieces by the top object , preserving the fill and stroke of the bottom .
Ctrl + Alt +/ cut path
Cut Path cuts the bottom object 's stroke only where it is intersected by the top path , removing any fill from the result .
The result of Union , Difference , Intersection , and XOR inherits the id= attribute and therefore the clones of the bottom object .
Division and Cut path normally produce several objects ; of them , a random one inherits the id= of the bottom source object .
Offsets
Ctrl + ( inset path ( towards center )
Ctrl+ ) outset path ( away from center )
The default offset distance is 2 px ( SVG pixel units , not screen pixels ) .
Alt + ( inset path by 1 pixel
Alt + ) outset path by 1 pixel
Shift + Alt +( inset path by 10 pixels
Shift + Alt+ ) outset path by 10 pixels
The actual distance for pixel offsets depends on zoom level .
Zoom in for finer adjustment .
All the ( , ) commands convert the object to path , if necessary , and produce regular path .
Ctrl +J create dynamic offset
Ctrl + Alt +J create linked offset
These commands produce an offset object , editable by the node tool , standalone or linked to the original .
Shift +D select source
Selecting a linked offset and giving this command will select the source path of the linked offset .
Combine
Ctrl +K combine paths
This is different from grouping in that combined paths create one object .
This is different from Union in that overlapping areas are not affected .
Whether overlapping areas are filled is controlled by the Fill : winding / alternating switch on the Fill & Stroke dialog .
Shift + Ctrl +K break paths apart
This attempts to break an object into constituent paths ; it will fail if the object is one solid path .
Simplify
Ctrl +L simplify
This command attempts to simplify selected path (s ) by removing extra nodes .
It converts all objects to paths first .
If you invoke this command several times in quick succession , it will act more and more aggressively .
Invoking Simplify again after a pause restores the default threshold ( settable in the Inkscape Preferences dialog ) .
Selector
Select ( mouse )
click select an object
When you left - click on an object , previous selection is deselected .
Shift +click toggle selection
Shift + click adds an object to the current selection if it was not selected , or deselects it otherwise .
clickclick edit the object
For paths , double clicking switches to Node tool ; for shapes , to corresponding shape tool ; for text , to Text tool .
For groups , double clicking performs the " Enter group " command ( the group becomes temporary layer ) .
Double clicking in empty space swithes to the parent layer in the hierarchy , if any .
Rubberband , touch selection
mouse drag select by rubberband
Dragging around objects does " rubberband " selection ; previous selection is deselected .
Shift + mouse drag add objects to selection

However , if you press
Shift before dragging , Inkscape will do rubberband selection even if you start from an object .
Alt +mouse drag , Shift +
Alt + mouse drag select by touch
Alt +dragging over objects selects those objects that are touched by the path .
To start touch selection with Alt , you must have nothing selected ; otherwise use Shift +
Alt .
You can switch rubberband selection to touch selection and back while dragging by pressing / releasing Alt .
Select ( keyboard )
Tab select next object
Shift + Tab select previous object
These keys pick objects in their z - order ( Tab cycles from bottom to top , Shift + Tab cycles from top to bottom ) .
Unless you did manual rearrangements , the last object you created is always on top .
As a result , if nothing is selected , pressing Shift + Tab once conveniently selects the object you created last .
This works on objects within the current layer ( unless you change that in preferences ) .
Ctrl +A select all ( current layer )
This works on objects within the current layer ( unless you change that in preferences ) .
Ctrl + Alt +A select all ( all layers )
This works on objects in all visible and unlocked layers .
! invert selection ( current layer )
This inverts selection ( deselects what was selected and vice versa ) in the current layer .
Alt +! invert selection ( all layers )
This inverts selection ( deselects what was selected and vice versa ) in visible and unlocked layers .
Esc deselect
Backspace , Del delete selection
Select within group , select under
Ctrl+click select within group
Ctrl+click selects the object at click point disregarding any levels of grouping that this object might belong to .
Ctrl + Shift +click toggle selection within group
Alt +click select under
Alt +click selects the object at click point which is beneath ( in z - order ) the lowest selected object at click point .
If the bottom object is reached , Alt +click again selects the top object .
So , several Alt+clicks cycle through z - order stack at point .
On Linux , Alt+click and Alt+drag may be reserved by the window manager .
If you reconfigure your window manager
to not map Alt+click , then it will be free for Inkscape to use .
If your keyboard has a Meta key , you may wish to set your " Modifier key " to use it instead of Alt .
( Sometimes you can also use Ctrl + Alt+click ( select under in groups ) with the same effect as Alt+click . )
Shift + Alt +click toggle under
Ctrl +Alt+click select under , in groups
Shift + Ctrl +Alt+click toggle under , in groups

Top 5 reasons why Russia failed at WJC ( Photo © Reuters )
Team Russia ‘s sixth place at the last WJC in Saskatchewan , Canada , was nothing short of a failure .
It was the worst result of the team since 2001 , when the team lead by Petr Vorobiev could n’t get any better than the seventh place on the home soil .
That team , just like this one , was n’t short of talent , considering that the team ’s front men were the likes of Ilya Kovalchuk , Anton Volchenkov and Denis Grebeshkov .
This year ’s roster included many talented players as well , like Nikita Filatov , Vladimir Tarasenko , Dmitri Orlov and others , but the tournament did n’t really finish like expected and team Russia was left out of the medal round after five straight apparitions .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you top five reasons why Russia failed at WJC 2010 .
Reason 5 : Underestimation of the opponents
It ’s not the first time a top team gets upset by the likes of Team Switzerland or any other underdog , just let ’s remember how 2002 Olympics ended for the Swedes at the quarterfinals against team Belarus .
Team Russia was guilty of underrating the opponents already before the tournament ’s start .
Plyuschev got a warning when Russia lost to Latvia in the first and only test match heading to the WJC .
But the 3 - 2 loss did n’t work as warning sign .
It continued in the very first group stage game , against Team Austria .
That game was won , but team Russia did n’t put on a good performance and despite winning by a four - goals margin it was closer than one would expect .
Talent mattered at the end , but it really looked like team Russia was lacking the right inspiration to play at the next level .
It was early , but it was a first indication about how things were starting .
It was really surprising to see the Russians being dominated that way in the round robin match against Finland , a “ W ” nevertheless as the goals by Khokhryakov and Filatov were unanswered , but that was yet another poor display , probably due to the fact that the players thought to easily skate past the opponents .
In the quarters against team Switzerland , team Russia was guilty of the same sin , but it was a much more dangerous situation .
It started as the game approached , with the players not forechecking hard enough and thinking that probably just a couple of rushes would have switched the moment in their favor .
It did happen , but it was n’t enough .
While they were thinking that the game was already conquered the Swiss did work hard to get back on track and it worked .
In the overtime probably it was the same as one could have spotted some conceit and the result was a deserved defeat against the tournament ’s underdogs .
Reason 4 : Some puzzling roster decisions
Maybe it would n’t have changed too much , but Vladimir Plyuschev made some roster decisions that seemed a bit hard to decipher .
The first one was leaving home Dynamo Moscow ’s Alexander Avtsin .
The Habs draftee was in good shape right before the WJC start as he had just scored three points in two games , including a game winning goal .
Maybe this team Russia had enough talent in the top - 6 , but why leaving out a skilled player with great skating and a not bad physical presence ?
All the more , in good shape .
Other two players were surprisingly left out the WJC roster : Alexander Pechursky and Dmitry Kugryshev .
If Pechursky ’s selection probably would have made much of a difference since the designated goalie was Igor Bobkov anyway , but why leaving out a talented , gritty player with much experience on the small ice surface like Quebec Remparts ’ , Washington Capitals prospect Dmitry Kugryshev ?
Throughout the whole tournament most of Russian players displayed lack of small ice practice , plus the presence of two talented players like Kugryshev and Avtsin instead of journeymen like Dedunov and Gimbatov surely would n’t have hurt the team .
Reason 3 : Lack of attention
This point is n’t strictly connected with this year ’s situation but surely played his role in the 2010 fiasco .
One of the biggest differences between North American and European hockey ( probably Sweden is an exception here , but only in the last few years ) is surely the attention paid on the respective junior programs .
For example , if team USA and team Canada – these year ’s finalists – can always count on pro coaches like Willie Desjardins , who won a Memorial Cup in 2003 and was honored with CHL Coach of the Year award .
Last year team Canada coach was Olympic champion and multiple times Stanley Cup finalist Pat Quinn .
Team Russia could never count on such characters .
If Vladimir Plyuschev did won a WJC back in the times , in the 2002 , most of the latest coaches were inexperienced like Sergei Nemchinov or not well fitting in the team , like Plyuschev himself .
It also speaks a lot the fact that the federation has n’t really said anything , was this a bad result or if Plyuschev is still entrusted as coach .
The Olympics are approaching , but a strong program emphasizes not only the senior team , but also the junior one , trying to get the best coach possible and definitely more attentions .
Reason 2 : Lack of spirit among the players
This point might be tied with the underestimation of the opponents as it usually leads to lack of spirit .
Determination is much more important in junior hockey and it looked like players did n’t have any throughout the whole tournament .
Simply there was n’t leadership and the top players underperformed .
Especially Nikita Filatov , who scored only one goal and had a particularly poor performance against team Switzerland , despite assisting on Kirill Petrov ’s goal .
But giving all the fault to one player is surely wrong as the whole team did n’t look a true team during the tournament .
But not only they did n’t show any particularly good combination , team play or joint effort , they also showed no spirit .
In the infamous match against the Swiss , they never looked in control of the game , not even during the third period when the team was up on the scoreboard .
Arguably the coaching was poor , but if that ’s the case the leaders should step up on ice and fight hard .
Russia really liked this approach to the game , especially in the medal round .
Reason 1 : Poor coaching by Vladimir Plyuschev
As already hinted in the third and in the second point WJC team Russia once again lacked good coaching .
In junior hockey the leadership must come from the training staff and Vladimir Plyuschev did n’t really have a good job in this department , nor in the tactical area too .
There was no team game and all this joined with the players ’ lack of winning spirit meant the overall , disappointing , sixth place .
But not only Plyuschev did n’t manage to inject the right spirit into players , he also heat a conflict with team ’s captain Nikita Filatov , guilty – according to the same Plyuschev – of not playing like a captain and thus being stripped off the “ C ” on the chest for the fifth place match .
This was a true locker room war and Plyuschev did n’t always played it clean , mostly back talking with Filatov ’s partners , probably not increasing his popularity among the team .
It was obvious that Plyuschev lost the hand on the team and without it a short tournament like the WJC can only end with a failure .
WINDSOR - Google has apologized for a shocking image that turned up on its first week of showing Street View maps of Windsor , Ont .
A team was in the southwestern Ontario city last summer to snap photos of every address for Google ’s Street View map .
But a quick scan past a strip club on Wyandotte Street showed a bloody scene where a murder had taken place hours earlier .
An employee of the company that owns Leopard ’s was appalled to hear the image was online .
After being informed of the image , Google removed it .
A black square shows where the picture of the bar ’s parking lot used to be .
Google said it sometimes captures sensitive images , but apologizes if it caused any distress .

Readers may recall yesterday where I posted this stunning image of cold for Europe and Russia for mid December 2009 from the NASA NEO MODIS satellite imager .
Deadly Cold Across Europe and Russia Click image above to enlarge or download large image ( 3 MB , JPEG ) acquired December 11 – 18 , 2009
In that story were links to additional images , and I ’d planned to return to them for a comparison .
Inspired by my posting , METSUL ’s Alexandre Aguiar saved me the trouble .
There ’s an interesting comparison here between the surface anomaly done by weather stations ( NASA GISS ) and that of satellite measurement ( NASA NEO MODIS ) – Anthony Guest post by Alexandre Aguiar , METSUL , Brazil COMPARE THE TWO MAPS NASA GISS on the left , NASA MODIS on the right
Here ’s the same images but larger – click either image for full size :
South America :
The vast majority of the continent is near average or below average in the NEO map , but according to GISS only the southern tip of the region is colder .
The most striking difference is Northeast Brazil : colder in the NEO map and warmer at the GISS .
Africa :
Most of the continent is colder than average in the NEO map , but in the GISS most of Africa is warmer than average .
Australia : The Western part of the country is colder than average in the NEO map , but the entire country is warmer in the GISS map .
Russia :
Most of the country is colder than average in the NEO map , a much larger area of colder anomalies that presented in the GISS map .
India : Colder than average at NASA ’s NEO website and warmer at NASA ’s GISS map .
Middle East : Huge areas of the region ( Israel , Jordan , Turkey , Iraq , Syria ) are colder than average in the NEO map and average / warmer in the GISS map .
Europe : Near average or slightly above average in the NEO map and much above average in the GISS map .
Greenland : Entire region colder than average at NEO and much of the area warmer at GISS .
Same source ( NASA ) , but very different maps !!!
Why :
At NEO , land surface maps show where Earth ’s surface was warmer or cooler in the daytime than the average temperatures for the same week or month from 2000 - 2008 .
So , a land surface temperature anomaly map for November 2009 shows how that month ’s average temperature was different from the average temperature for all Novembers between 2000 and 2008 .
Conclusion
Despite being very warm compared to the long term averages ( GISS , UAH , etc ) , November 2009 was colder in large areas of the planet if compared to this decade average .

May a Libertarian Occupy a Rent - Controlled Apartment ?
by Walter Block by Walter Block Recently by Walter Block : Repeal Rent Control , and Sow Salt Where Once ItStood
Now that I ’m one of the Austro - libertarian elders at age 68 ( where has the time gone ?
I remember distinctly when I was an enfant terrible ; that must have been in the 1960s )
I get lots of letters from Austro - libertarians from all over the world , many of them readers of LewRockwell.com .
Most of them I answer individually , but every once in a while I receive one that , I think , will be of general interest to our entire community .
Here is another in the series of such letters and my responses to them .
First , see the letter ( which I have very slightly edited to retain the anonymity of the writer ; when you read it , you ’ll see why I did that ) .
Then , second , see my response , afterward .
I . The letter
2/23/10
Dear Professor Block ,
I wanted to thank you for holding speeches in New York this February .
I attended your talk on Austrian Economics and libertarianism which was held on the Columbia University campus .
I was the person who asked for your signature on the single sheet of paper containing your article on rent control in New York City that appeared in the New York Post .
It was a great honor to see you speak and to shake your hand .
I was introduced to the message of freedom during Ron Paul ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
My life changed since then .
I have read Mises ’ Human Action , am currently reading Rothbard ’s Man , Economy , and State , and have finished a number of books and articles on Austrian Economics and libertarianism .
Now , I have had the honor of meeting you in one of your lectures .
I did have questions I wanted to ask but did not get the chance since we ran out of time and I did not want to keep you from meeting other people after your lecture .
I hope you do not mind that I ask them through this medium and that it wo n’t be too much of a bother .
I currently rent an apartment in Manhattan right now which is not rent controlled .
Would I be selling out on my free market ideals if I move to a cheaper rent - controlled apartment in the city ?
I would think that it is similar to being opposed to forced social security contributions , but since one is forced to contribute , one is entitled to get one ’s benefits eventually .
In the case of renting , by having too much price controls in the city , one is forced to look into cheaper housing since all the rest that are not subject to control has inflated prices due to this policy .
Another question on the idea of “ selling - out ” : I am a citizen ( of a foreign country ) who has a permanent resident status .
I will be eligible for naturalization next year .
Normally , the naturalization process is simple — one just needs to pass an exam and answer some questions both on a form and during an interview .
I found out that one of the questions to be asked is whether one will consider serving the government when called upon .
As a libertarian , I know that any service should only be voluntary and no one should be coerced to serve since that is already considered slavery .
In the form , one can answer “ no ” granted you have an explanation .
I do not know if by answering “ no ” and having my lengthy discussion on my answer will jeopardize my naturalization process .
With this , would I be selling out on my libertarian ideals if I just answered “ yes ” just to make the process easier and continue fighting the ideological fight outside of filling up this form ?
Lastly , in response to a question during your speech , you mentioned something about “ intrinsic ____ ” and “ extrinsic ____ . "
That the reason why not a lot of people are receptive to the message of freedom and individual responsibility is that it is a fairly new concept .
I would like to ask for the word that comes after the “ intrinsic ” and “ extrinsic ” concepts you mentioned in your talk and if you can point me to any literature regarding the subject as I wish to add it to my extensive reading list .
Again , it was an honor meeting such a heavyweight in the libertarian movement Professor Block .
I hope I will have more opportunities to hear you speak .
I appreciate everything you are doing for the cause of freedom .
Best Regards
Dear Professor Block ,
I just wanted to give you an update on realizations regarding my previous email to you .
I have concluded that I do not wish to move to a rent - controlled / stabilized apartment since I am opposed to it .
I would like to “ do ” as I “ say . "
How will I spread the message to other people if I do not “ practice what I preach ” ?
Besides , if I could not afford rent that is not price controlled , I can always move in with my parents , rent outside of Manhattan where is cheaper , or get a roommate .
Besides , I can still comfortably afford rent prices in some areas of Manhattan that are not under price controls .
I would still appreciate hearing your thoughts about this , only if you have the time though .
I know you are very busy .
Again , thank you so much for everything Professor Block !
Best Regards , ( A Student )

My response
Dear Student :
You are a rotten kid .
You should have asked me your question when it first arose during that talk of mine .
The rest of the audience would very much have appreciated your question , and , hopefully , my answer .
Well , maybe it is n’t so bad that you are now raising this issue .
An even wider audience will now see it , including , I presume , many who were in attendance at my speech at Columbia University .
Let me start off by first congratulating you not only on the succinct way you put the matter , but , even more , for your obvious concerns with ethics , with doing the right thing , with not being a hypocrite , and for your determination to promote liberty .
Very few non-libertarians are even concerned with such matters .
Most conservatives ( and left liberals too ) hate the government , except when it is bombing innocents abroad .
Most western socialist intellectuals decry income inequality , as they drive their Mercedes , vacation abroad and swill down expensive wines .
And then there are the environmental watermelons ( red on the inside , green on the outside ) who whine about the plight of the planet while jetting from one conference to another , which they should not do , if their own analysis of the problem is correct .
Now for my substantive answer to your query .
I oppose fiat currency , and yet have some in my wallet ( heck , I never leave home without any ; I might want to buy something ) .
I favor the complete privatization of the post office , and , yet , snail - mail letters from time to time .
I think that all libraries should be run on a profit and loss basis , not by the government , and yet borrow books from them .
I favor the gold standard , but do not limit my purchases and sales to this medium .
I oppose public education , and yet was a student at Madison High School , Brooklyn College , and City University of New York ; I also taught at the State University of Stony Brook , Baruch College , Rutgers and the University of Central Arkansas , all of them in the so - called public sector .
I oppose government roads ( heck , my most recent book makes the case for complete privatization ) and yet , you ’ll never guess how I travel around ; yes , on statist streets and roads .
Am I a hypocrite ?
Am I acting incompatibly with libertarianism ?
I do n’t think so .
As usual , Murray Rothbard best answers the sort of question you raise .
See here .
Murray warns of two very different dangers .
He says : " It seems to me that the most important concern is to avoid the twin , and equally destructive , traps : of ultra-purist sectarianism , where indeed we would not permit ourselves to walk on government - owned streets ; and sellout opportunism , in which we could become supervisors of concentration camps while still claiming we were u2018libertarians ’ in some far off , ideal world . "
Student , I urge you to carefully peruse this essay .
It was first published in 1987 , but reads as if Murray wrote this yesterday , it is so fresh and relevant to our present concerns ( come to think about it , this applies to pretty much everything he ever wrote ) .
As it happens , I have also written on this issue , you may be interested in my own relatively feeble efforts in this regard .
See here , here , here , here , here , here , and here .
The points I make in defense of libertarians such as you and I who " take advantage " of government programs while opposing them on philosophical grounds is this .
First , they steal from us the money necessary to build these institutions , and then they accuse us of acting incompatibly with our principles for treating them as the thieves they are .
The state is not the proper owner of schools , roads , currency , libraries , museums , ball fields , parks , etc .
In using them , we are thus not violating our non-aggression principles .
Take rent control as an example .
The municipality , in its infinite wisdom , declares that an apartment shall rent for far less than what it could earn on the free marketplace .
Suppose a libertarian becomes a tenant , and offers to pay the full amount .
First problem : there is no way of determining contrary to fact conditionals ; we simply do not know what the free market rent would have been .
Second problem , an even more serious one : such payments are against the law .
Those who engage in such acts open themselves up to severe penalties ( far more harsh for the landlord than for the tenant ) .
Any reasonable landlord would refuse such a payment , perhaps out of fear that you are a shill for the rent control commission .
But , the property owner is happy to make his apartment available to you at the controlled rent .
It is not your fault that he cannot capture the full value of it .
I urge you to ignore rent control legislation , and occupy whatever dwelling you would , just as if you were not a libertarian , and thus were not concerned with such issues .
Now consider naturalization .
It is illegal for me to counsel you to lie to the authorities about whether or not you support the government , and I do not do so .
However , libertarian theory , as least as I understand it ( see here , here , here , and here ) , is compatible , only , with free and open immigration .
That is , if you want to live here , they have no right to stop you .
Last point .
I do n’t think I mentioned “ intrinsic ____ ” and “ extrinsic ____ . "
At least , I did n’t intend to do so ( who knows what comes out when you speak extemporaneously ) .
What I meant to discuss was implicit and explicit cooperation .
My point was that libertarianism is such a hard sell because we human beings are hard wired for explicit cooperation ( benevolence , charity , being nice ) but not for implicit cooperation ( markets , the free enterprise system , profit and loss ) .
My favorite story in this regard is when , in the aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans , someone from out of state was selling water at very high prices compared to when there was no emergency situation , the people on line who more than willing to conduct business with this " gouger , " nevertheless called the police to stop him , and applauded the cops when they did so .
Where do I get this insight from ?
It is based upon my reading of the sociobiologists ( sometimes called evolutionary psychologists ) , authors such as R. Axelrod , David Barash , J.H. Barkow , D. M. Buss , Leda Cosmides , M. Daly , Richard Dawkins , R. H. Frank , Kalman Glantz David Jessel , Anne Moir , John Pearce , Steven Pinker , Mark Ridley , B. Skyrms , Maynard J. Smith , D. Symons , R.L. Trivers , John Tooby , E. O. Wilson , M. Wilson , R. Wright .
I hope and trust I have responded on point to your very good questions .
Best of luck in your future career of promoting liberty .
Best regards , Walter

The software , which was running on a Windows 7 HP Pavilion laptop , had a nice looking UI and the home page is a grid of all the books or other reading materials you 've bought ( Blio will have access to 1.2 million titles at launch ) .
The real beauty of the application comes though when you select a book and start to page through it .
The 3D mode is pretty snazzy and as you slide through the pages it simulates real page turns .
If that sort of thing is n't your cup of tea , you can use the regular mode to move to the next page .
Blio has other neat tricks up its sleeve , like a read - aloud feature ; content providers could preload books with different audio associated with specific text in a book .
You can imagine the applications for a children 's book or novel .
Blio says its working on software for other platforms , and we did get a sneak peak at its iPhone application , which works very similarly with a full book reading experience .
The software will be available for download in February for that very sweet price of free .

CEO Ray Kurzweil Unveils Game - Changing eReader That Delivers Full Color , Multimedia Functionality Across Various Platforms
Blio to offer more than 1.2 million titles , including current best sellers for the most comprehensive selection in the eReader market
LAS VEGAS , Jan. 6 / PRNewswire / --
Digital book technology took a major leap forward today at the Consumer Electronics Show when knfb Reading Technology Inc. unveiled Blio , the free eReader that promises to transform the consumption of printed media while delivering access to the most comprehensive selection of eBook titles to date .
Blio is the first eReader to preserve the image - rich format of books and magazines , including their layout , typesetting , images , color and graphics , while also supporting full media functionality , including video , graphics , and web links .
The Blio software application will be available for desktop and tablet PCs , netbooks , and mobile devices , including iPhones and iPods .
Blio will be available for download at blioreader.com in late January 2010 .
" Blio is without peer when it comes to the reader experience , " said knfb Founder and voice - recognition inventor Ray Kurzweil .
" eBooks should be more than digital copies of a printed page .
But the e-readers on the market today have been stuck in neutral and do n't offer the reader or the publisher what they want or need .
So we moved the experience from the boring 16 shades of grey text to an exciting level .
And we do it without adding another costly piece of hardware to lug around . "
A read - aloud feature provides further distinction from other eReaders .
A synthesized voice synchronizes with follow - along word highlighting , so the consumer can look and listen in tandem , an important consideration and attractive feature for travelers , language learners , young children and the vision impaired .
Downloading and syncing books
Through a partnership with Baker & Taylor , the world 's largest distributor of physical and digital books , Blio offers a library of more than 1.2 million titles across genres .
Blio's full - color , graphical book display technology -- a watershed in the eReader industry -- allows for a comprehensive catalog of image - rich titles , unparalleled in today 's market .
Purchased books are stored in a personal virtual library , giving consumers limitless access to their downloaded content .
This library seamlessly migrates from one device to another , allowing readers to begin a book on a home PC , then pick up where they left off on a mobile device .
" With our cutting - edge , 3D book technology , Baker & Taylor 's market leadership and the vast collection of online books that we have jointly collected from the world 's leading publishers , we believe we have the key to transform the book industry , " Kurzweil said .
Blio offers a large selection of books that otherwise do n't translate well into eContent : including cookbooks , travel guides , how - to books , schoolbooks and children 's stories .
Blio 's capabilities have captured the interest of hundreds of top publishers , who are partnering with Blio to dramatically grow the consumer 's choice of titles .
" knfb Reading Technology 's innovative approach is second to none , and Blio certainly will make waves in the industry .
We 're thrilled to help make that happen , " said Tom Morgan , Chairman and CEO of Baker & Taylor .
Interactive reading tools
Blio 's active reading tools deepen comprehension , adding dimensionality to a user 's reading .
Highlighting , underlining and annotating help emphasize information and let the user review important points later .
Blio's rich feature set allows the consumer to :
* Create a personalized list of reference websites , for one - touch look - up of highlighted phrases
* Adjust reading speed , and font size
* Translate to or from English in an embedded translation window
* Insert and save text , drawing , voice , image or video notes directly into your content , and then export to create lists or study materials

A Colorado Department of Transportation employee is under investigation for e-mailing an image of President Obama polishing former lawmaker Sarah Palin ’s shoes .
The individual , who was not named , faces disciplinary action up to and including being fired .
The image was forwarded to four people , at least one of whom was outside the department , and it was quickly reported as “ offensive . ”

“ The original sender of the e-mail , who is n’t a state employee , wrote ‘ It appears he ( Obama ) has found his niche , ' ” the Associated Press reported .
“ It ’s certainly an inappropriate email to begin with , but its the fact too that it ’s being sent on state time and using state resources and for that we find that very unacceptable , ” a department spokeswoman told Colorado ’s NBC 9 News .
The sender of the e-mail was identified only as a 73 - year - old woman and a registered Democrat , 9 News added .
According to The Denver Post , Colorado ’s Democratic Governor Bill Ritter called the e-mail “ very distasteful . ”

THE CASH -AND - TRASH HUMILIATION WORSENS ….
It ’s often called the “ cash - and - trash ” strategy — Republicans hate the stimulus package and “ trash ” it at every available opportunity , but love the stimulus package and grab the “ cash ” when it comes to creating jobs in their own states / districts .
It ’s been going on for a year , but the phenomenon keeps spreading .
Last week , the Washington Times found that “ more than a dozen Republican lawmakers , ” all of whom insisted that the stimulus package was an awful idea that could n’t possibly help the economy , privately urged the Department of Agriculture to send stimulus money to their states and districts , touting the investments ’ economic benefits .
Today , the Wall Street Journal moves the ball forward with still more GOP lawmakers who say they oppose the very idea of the stimulus package , but who nevertheless believe the stimulus will help improve the economy in their areas .
More than a dozen Republican lawmakers supported stimulus - funding requests submitted to the Department of Labor , the Environmental Protection Agency and the Forest Service , in letters obtained by The Wall Street Journal through the Freedom of Information Act .
It ’s quite a motley crew .
Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - Wis. ) said the stimulus “ misses the mark on all counts , ” but encouraged the Labor Department to invest stimulus money in his district , highlighting a project he said would create 1,000 jobs .
Reps. Sue Myrick ( R - N.C. ) and Jean Schmidt ( R - Ohio ) , both right - wing opponents of the recovery efforts , did the same thing .
It ’s not just House Republicans , either .
Sens. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) , and Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) all told the Obama administration that the stimulus would improve the economy in their states by directing funds in their direction .
The takeaway here should be pretty obvious , and it goes beyond just the impressive levels of hypocrisy .
When push comes to shove , and it ’s their constituents on the line , Republicans know that the stimulus works .
For all their palaver about how government spending is simply incapable of creating jobs and generating economic growth , we know they do n’t mean it — we have the written requests for stimulus funds to prove it .
Also note , the WSJ report only covers Labor , EPA , and Forest Service .
It ’s very likely that many more Republican lawmakers who opposed the stimulus also reached out to other agencies , convinced that the money would do wonders in their state / district .
Expect the Democratic campaign committees to emphasize this heavily as the election season nears .
winnie the pooh quotes
Pooh is , of course , the star of the show , and here are his best quotes .
" Is n't that fine ? " shouted Winnie the Pooh down to you .
" What do I look like ? " " You look like a bear holding on to a balloon , " you said .
" Not , " said Pooh anxiously , " not like a small black cloud in a blue sky ? "
" Not very much . "
" Have you got your gun ? " " Of course I have , " you said .
" But if I do that , it will spoil the balloon . "
" But if you do n't , " said Pooh , " I shall have to let go , and that would spoil me . "
" Then would you read a Sustaining Book , such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness ? "
" This ... whatever -it - was ... has now been joined by another ... whatever - it - is ... and they are now proceeding in company .
Would you mind coming with me , Piglet , in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals ? "
" Yes , " said Winnie the Pooh .
" I see now , " said Winnie the Pooh .
" I have been Foolish and Deluded , " said he , " and I am a Bear of No Brain at All . "
" For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain , and long words Bother me . "
" I saw one once , " said Piglet .
" At least , I think I did , " he said .
" Only perhaps it was n't . "
" So did I , " said Pooh , wondering what a Heffalump was like .
" You do n't often see them , " said Christopher Robin carelessly .
" Not now , " said Piglet .
" Not at this time of the year , " said Pooh .
For some minutes he lay there miserably , but when the five hundred and eight - seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws , and saying to itself " Very good honey this , I do n't know when I 've tasted better , " Pooh could bear it no longer .
" Oh bear ! " said Christopher Robin .
" How I do love you ! " " So do I , " said Pooh .
" Aha ! " said Pooh , practising .
" Aha !
Aha !... Of course , " he went on , " we could say ' Aha ! ' even if we had n't stolen Baby Roo . "
" Pooh , " said Rabbit kindly , " you have n't any brain . "
" I know , " said Pooh humbly .
For a little while Pooh and The Floating Bear were uncertain as to which of them was meant to be on the top , but after trying one or two different positions , they settled down with The Floating Bear underneath and Pooh triumphantly astride it , paddling vigorously with his feet .
" I ought to say , " explained Pooh as they walked down to the shore of the island , " that it is n't just an ordinary sort of boat .
Sometimes it's a Boat , and sometimes it 's more of an Accident .
It all depends . "
" Depends on what ? "
" On whether I 'm on the top of it or underneath it . "
Pooh got in .
He was just beginning to say that it was all right now , when he found that it was n't , so after a short drink , which he did n't really want , he waded back to Christopher Robin .
" What 's Eeyore talking about ? " Piglet whispered to Pooh .
" I do n't know , " said Pooh rather dolefully .
" I thought this was your party . "
" I thought it was once .
But I suppose it is n't . "
" I 'd sooner it was yours than Eeyore 's , " said Piglet .
" So would I , " said Pooh .
" When you wake up in the morning , Pooh , " said Piglet at last , " what 's the first thing you say to yourself ? "
" What 's for breakfast ? " said Pooh .
" What do you say , Piglet ? "
" I say , I wonder what 's going to happen exciting today ? " said Piglet .
Pooh nodded thoughtfully .
" It 's the same thing , " he said .
" Hallo , Piglet , " he said .
" I thought you were out . "
" No , " said Piglet , " it 's you who were out , Pooh . "
" So it was , " said Pooh .
" I knew one of us was . "
As soon as Rabbit was out of sight , Pooh remembered that he had forgotten to ask who Small was , and whether he was the sort of friend - and - relation who settled on one 's nose , or the sort who got trodden on by mistake , and as it was Too Late Now , he thought he would begin the Hunt by looking for Piglet , and asking him what they were looking for before he looked for it .
" Rabbit , " said Pooh to himself .
" I like talking to Rabbit .
He talks about sensible things .
He does n't use long , difficult words , like Owl .
He uses short , easy words , like ' What about lunch ? ' and ' Help yourself , Pooh ' . "
" Perhaps he 's looking for something . "
" What ? " asked Rabbit .
" That 's just what I was going to say , " said Pooh .
And then he added , " Perhaps he 's looking for a - for a -" " A Spotted or Herbaceous Backson ? "
" Yes , " said Pooh .
" One of those .
In case it is n't . "
Rabbit looked at him severely .
" I do n't think you 're helping , " he said .
" No , " said Pooh .
" I do try , " he added humbly .
" Tigger is all right , really , " said Pooh lazily .
" Of course he is , " said Christopher Robin .
" Everybody is really , " said Pooh .
" That 's what I think , " said Pooh .
" But I do n't suppose I 'm right , " he said .
" Of course you are , " said Christopher Robin .
" Rabbit 's clever , " said Pooh thoughtfully .
" Yes , " said Piglet , " Rabbit 's clever . "
" And he has Brain . "
" Yes , " said Piglet , " Rabbit has Brain . "
There was a long silence .
" I suppose , " said Pooh , " that that 's why he never understands anything . "
" Pooh , " said Piglet nervously .
" Yes ? " said one of the chairs .
" Where are we ? " " I 'm not quite sure , " said the chair .
" Are we - are we in Owl 's House ? "
" I think so , because we were just going to have tea , and we had n't had it . "
" Oh ! " said Piglet .
" Well , did Owl always have a letter - box in his ceiling ? "
" Has he ? "
" Yes , look . "
" I can't , " said Pooh .
" I 'm face downwards under something , and that , Piglet , is a very bad position for looking at ceilings . "
Trying to go leaf peeping in the city ?
Here 's the best time to do it .
Oxygen shortage makes strength training more effective Weight training in an oxygen deprived environment probably results in more muscle mass over time than training where there 's plenty of oxygen in the air , write sports scientists from the Japan Institute of Sports Sciences in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise .
The combination of strength training and little oxygen results in an increase in growth hormone production .
For years Japanese scientists have been studying the effects of cutting off the oxygen supply to the muscles by reducing the circulation of the blood .
It 's called Kaatsu .
According to the studies , Kaatsu training produces a higher anabolic stimulus than normal .
The effect of Kaatsu training is so great that using weights at 30 percent of your 1RM creates an anabolic hormonal stimulus that 's comparable to that of a serious training at 80 percent of your 1 RM .
The researchers wanted to know whether they could create a similar effect by getting their subjects to train in a room where an oxygen reducing machine had been placed .
They used a Hypoxico Hyp - 100 , pictured in the photo above .
The 12 test subjects were healthy men aged about 30 , all of whom did regular weight training .
The researchers got them to do 5 sets of bench presses and 5 sets of leg presses at 70 percent of their 1RM .
On one occasion the test subjects trained under normal atmospheric conditions [ NR ] , and on one occasion in an oxygen deprived atmosphere [ HR ] .
Under HR conditions the subjects produced more lactic acid and growth hormone , as shown below .
The grey area represents the strength training .
The researchers also measured the subject ' cortisol , IGF - 1 and testosterone .
HR or NR atmosphere , it had no effect on hormone production .
Training under low oxygen conditions may also lead to faster weight loss .
At least , the effect on the stimulatory hormones adrenalin and noradrenalin would suggest this .
These hormones force fat cells to release their contents into the bloodstream .
" Resistance exercise in acute systemic hypoxia caused greater accumulation of lactate , and greater response in growth hormone , adrenalin , and nor - adrenalin to a bout of resistance exercise " , the researchers conclude .
" Our data suggest that hypoxia is a potent factor for the enhancements of anabolic hormone response to resistance exercise . "

InfoGraphic Designs : Overview , Examples and Best Practices
Information graphics or infographics are visual representations of information , data or knowledge .
These graphics are used where complex information needs to be explained quickly and clearly , such as in signs , maps , journalism , technical writing , and education .
They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists , mathematicians , and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information .
They can present a rich amount of information without intimidating you .
Or sometimes they intimidate you , but make the digesting of the information much more bearable .
Here in this article below , we are going to discuss best practices for designing infographics followed by some examples which might help you learn a thing or two .
You may be interested in the following related articles as well .

What is InfoGraphics ?
Infographics are traditionally viewed as visual elements such as signs , charts , maps , or diagrams that aid comprehension of a given text - based content .
Often more powerful than words or imagery alone , infographics utilize visual elements of design and words to convey a message in such a way that context , meaning and understanding are transcended to the observer in a manner not previously experienced .
However , visual representation of information can be more than just the manner in which we are able to record what has been discovered by other means .
It is not easier than buying tadalafil .
They have the potential to become the process by which we can discern new meaning and discover new knowledge .
The observer becomes enlighten , having learned from the visual feast and is motivated to seek out more knowledge in this medium .
Since the days of the fire evolution , we ’ve been using infographics , as visual shorthand to convey information to the viewer or readers that might take paragraphs or pages to explain in words .
It ’s not easy to represent the whole story in one single page or paragraph but it ’s far more effective then reading entire book .
There are number of infographics out there on every street .
Infect , we interact with infographics on a daily basis , from the stick figure telling us when to cross the street , to icons in a web navigation designs .
Little History of InfoGraphics !
In prehistory , early humans created the first information graphics : cave paintings , later maps and now charts .
Throughout most of this history , image and text have remained inextricably mixed .
Later map - making began several millennia before writing , and the map from around 7500 BCE .
After that icons were used to keep records of cattle and stock .
The Indians of Mesoamerica used imagery to depict the journeys of past generations .
Illegible on their own , they served as a supportive element to memory and storytelling .
Wow …
That ’s enough for history unless you really want to get die with boredom .
Let ’s move further .
Why Using InfoGraphics ?
Because “ A picture is worth a thousand words ” .
Information graphics can be done for several reasons .
Along with them we can highlight the following important ones to enlighten the mystery .
To transmit or communicate a message .
To present large amounts of information in a compact and easy to understand way .
To reveal the data .
Discovering cause - effect relations , knowing what ’s happening .
To periodically monitor the evolution of certain parameters .
Elements of Information Graphics
There are many theories available by which you can identify number of entities that can be considered as the elements of infographics but the basic and key material of an information graphic is the data , information , or knowledge that the graphic presents with limited resources .
However ,
In the case of data , the creator may make use of automated tools such as graphing software to represent the data in the form of lines , boxes , arrows , and various symbols and pictograms .
The information graphic might also feature a key which defines the visual elements in plain English .
A scale and labels are also common .
Type of InfoGraphics
There are many types of InfoGraphics available out there .
Many information graphics are specialized forms of depiction that represent their content in sophisticated and often abstract ways .
In order to interpret the meaning of these graphics appropriately , the viewer requires a suitable level of understanding .
In many cases , the required understanding involves comprehension skills that are learned rather than innate .
At a fundamental level , the skills of decoding individual graphic signs and symbols must be acquired before sense can be made of information graphic as a whole .
However , knowledge of the conventions for distributing and arranging these individual components is also necessary for the building of understanding .
Here we are conceding some major type of InfoGraphics to understand its usability .
01 . Statistical Based InfoGraphics
Information graphics are visual devices intended to communicate complex information quickly and clearly .
The devices include charts , diagrams , graphs , tables , maps and lists .
Among the most common devices are horizontal bar charts , vertical column charts , and round or oval pie charts , that can summarize a lot of statistical information .
Diagrams can be used to show how a system works , and may be an organizational chart that shows lines of authority , or a systems flowchart that shows sequential movement .
Illustrated graphics use images to related data .
The snapshots features used every day by USA Today are good examples of this technique .
Tables are commonly used and may contain lots of numbers .
Modern interactive maps and bulleted numbers are also infographics devices .
02 . TimeLine Based InfoGraphics
Timelines are another type of infographics uses where visual representation of information and events that happen over time .
A timeline is the presentation of a chronological sequence of events along a drawn line that enables a viewer to understand temporal relationships quickly .
Sometimes it is also referred to chronology that is in tabular , year - by - year paragraphs , or other form .
03 . Process Based InfoGraphics
These types usually can be seen in workspaces of factory or offices .
You can also catch them in cooking magazines which shows their recipes using graphics .
Have you ever wonder why most of the food products have InfoGraphics instead of detailed procedure at the back side of their cover or box .
Out of many there is one important reason is to give you understanding about its uses in limited space .
Using images to related data it can produce a good example of particular process so it ’s easy to understand .
04 . Location or Geography Based InfoGraphics
It ’s the most common type of infographics which you can find everywhere starting from your school map to complicated astronomical graphs .
City and country maps can also consider as a good example of geography based infographics .
These types of graphics include symbols , icons , diagrams , graphs , tables , arrows and bullets .
You must be remember that there are many types lines ( parallel , dotted , straight ) used in maps to define subways , streets , highways , and railway tracks .
Also many symbols and icons used for specific landmark like school , church , hospital , bank etc. scale is the important parameter here as everything marked according to particular scale or ratio .
How to Create InfoGraphics ?
Three main Questions needs to be answered before start making any information graphics which is Why ? , How ? , Does it Work ?
Making good information graphic consist of facilitating the understanding of complexity , instead of complicating what is simple .
And this cannot be achieved without the clear understanding of what goal we pursue , who our audience is and a good deal of work and reflection .
Question 1 : Why ?
It ’s the most important question out of three that why you want to create InfoGraphics ?
What is it for ?
What is the goal ?
Is it for research , for discovery , Or for monitoring the data ?
If you can able of answer these queries then only you can able to collect the relevant data .
This determines the type of relative data to gather and about which we have to ask what type it has to be ( quantitative , sequential , categorical , analytical etc. ) and more importantly : are they relevant for what we want ?
Question 2 : How ?
If you done with “ why ? ” part then you need to think about How you going to refine your data and in what way we will represent the data .
A fundamental aspect of this section is that information graphics are interesting because they reveal differences .
For this reason refining them and representing the data derived from their statistical treatment often reveals aspects that otherwise would result confusing which often leads to wrong conclusions .
Once data is refined now you have to choose the most effective visual metaphor .
Mostly , for a little data , a table or even a sentence can be clearer that a chart .
In certain occasions changing the color palette or the type of chart can clarify the situation enormously .
Question 2 : Does it work ?
Now this is a critical section where you have to identify if the outcome is fit the goal or not .
if it does n’t fit the goal that we have defined in the first step , we will have failed and again start with first step .
There is no documented rule which says how to verify your results but after thoroughly answering all three questions you must able to judge if the result is favorable or not .
The key resides in revising and experimenting with what we have done until we find an improvement .
Selection of Colors , Typography
A perfect layout , a good selection and nice resource can produce a creative output .
Layout , textures and typography are used more often than one may think but the outcome of different combination can result verity of designs .
Professionalism is built upon knowledge and experience .
Typography is one of the most important key aspects of any design project .
Among other things , effective typography always manages to achieve some of the important objectives of projects like corporate identity , attractiveness of the project , enrichment of visual appearance , trust and interest of viewers etc .
Also it ’s helps you to represent the bound emotions of your graphics .
Varying the colors , reducing the saturation of what is less important and increasing it for the most relevant data , modifying the typography , the size of fonts , eliminating everything that does n’t contribute to showing and clarifying the data ( irrelevant grids , redundant data , and unnecessary labels ) without losing relevant information sometimes provides surprisingly improved results .

The Dow Jones closed down 2 % , its worst fall since October , while Japan 's Nikkei closed at a three - week low .
Shares in major US banks Goldman Sachs and Bank of America all fell .
Mr Obama - who said he was " ready for a fight " with banks - plans to limit the size of banks and impose restrictions on risky trading .
" Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by banks that are too big to fail , " Mr Obama said .
Limiting risk taking " While the financial system is far stronger today than it was one year ago , it is still operating under the exact same rules that led to its near collapse , " he said .
His proposals may mean that some of the biggest US banks have to be broken up .

They also include a ban on retail banks using their own money in investments - known as proprietary trading .
Instead , banks would be limited to investing their customers ' funds .
That attitude brought an immediate reaction from the markets .
Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs lost more than 4 % despite announcing a sharp increase in profits .
Bank of America fell 6.2 % and shares in JP Morgan Chase were down 6.6 % .
" Banking reforms do not come bigger than those proposed by President Obama , " the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said .
Fighting talk Mr Obama 's move is his first proposal since Republican Scott Brown 's shock victory in Massachusetts to win a Senate seat .
The Republican victory may make it harder to get Mr Obama 's proposals passed in the Senate , as they are more likely to get held up in political wrangling .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The president knows getting this through Congress will be hard .
But this is n't a messy vote - loser in the country .
This is a populist clarion call
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Send us your comments " This is a political effort because of what happened in Massachusetts , " said economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland .
Banks have also been lobbying against more stringent regulation .
" If these folks want a fight , it 's a fight I 'm ready to have , " Mr Obama vowed .
The president dubbed his proposals on limiting bank risk the Volcker rule - after Paul Volcker , one of his economic advisors and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve central bank .
The moves follow popular anger at financial institutions , who have been paying large bonuses to staff even as they accepted government bail - outs to keep them going .
Mr Obama 's proposals appear to be a return to the principles underlying the Glass - Steagall Act .
That law - from the 1930s in the aftermath of the Great Depression - separated commercial and investment banking and was eventually abolished in 1999 under President Bill Clinton .
Mr Clinton 's financial secretary at the time , Robert Rubin , previously worked at Goldman Sachs and went on to be an adviser to Citigroup until last year .
The latest proposals follow a $ 117bn ( £ 72 bn ) levy on banks to recoup money US taxpayers spent bailing out the banks .
The tax will claw back some of the losses from a $ 700 bn taxpayer bail - out of US banks known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
It was drawn up in the midst of the financial crisis in 2008 , following the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers and rescue of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) .
The industry lobby group for banks suggested Mr Obama was trying to return the US to the past .
" The better answer is to modernise the regulatory framework and not take the industry and the economy back to the 1930s , " said the Financial Services Roundtable , an industry group that represents large Wall Street institutions .
In the UK , City Minister Lord Myners said the US proposals were " very much in accordance with the direction we have been setting " .
While shadow chancellor George Osborne said that if the Conservatives won the next general election , they would impose an identical dismantling of UK banks to those suggested by the US president .

Der Schleswig- Holsteinische Zeitungsverlag ( sh:z ) fÃ¼hlt sich von der Piratenpartei an den digitalen Pranger gestellt .
Es geht um das Ignorieren der Piratenpartei und der Freien WÃ¤hler vor der Landtagswahl im September 2009 .
Seinerzeit gab es auch eine gemeinsame Pressemitteilung .
Nun hat der sh:z dieses
Thema noch einmal aufgegriffen und sieht sich vÃ¶llig zu Unrecht der Stallorder und Zensur bezichtigt :
Ausgangspunkt der plebiszitÃ¤ren Internet - EmpÃ¶rung war die Berichterstattung zur Landtags - und Bundestagswahl .
Unsere Redaktion verfuhr wie praktisch alle anderen Medien auch .
Keine Partei – bis auf die links - und rechtsextremistischen – wurde von der Wahlkampf - Berichterstattung ausgenommen .
Auf den Lokalseiten der einzelnen Ausgaben wurden einzelne Kandidaten vorgestellt , wurde Ã¼ber deren Programme oder Aktionen berichtet .
Dabei wurden die Freien WÃ¤hler selbstverstÃ¤ndlich ebenso wenig ausgeklammert wie die Piratenpartei .
Der sh:z regt dann auch an , „ per E - Paper oder durch eine Suche auf dem Internetportal shz.de “ nachzuprÃ¼fen , ob das stimmt .
Nun , das kann ich viel einfacher machen , ich habe nÃ¤mlich als Direktkandidat der Piratenpartei zur Landtagswahl im Wahlkreis 7 keine einzige Anfrage der Schleswiger Nachrichten erhalten , weder in Form eines Fragebogens , noch als Interviewanfrage .
Wie also die „ einzelnen Kandidaten “ , die in den „ einzelnen Ausgaben “ vorgestellt wurden , ausgewÃ¤hlt wurden , bleibt ein Verlags - Interna .
Wer auf shz.de Ã¼brigens nach „ Michael Schmidt Piratenpartei “ sucht , der erhÃ¤lt Ã¼brigens die RÃ¼ckmeldung „ Leider keine Treffer “ .
Beim sh:z vergiÃŸt sogar das Internet . 😉
Growing threat for snow , high winds Thursday
By Ian Livingston
Will it be a near miss or significant hit ?
* Winter Storm Watch for metro area Wed. night - Thur . ( map ) *
* February climate facts and near feats | Weather Wall | Get There *
Today 's rather benign weather behind us , we 're back into a hectic period with the potential for a close call or even a substantial snowstorm starting tomorrow night and lasting into Thursday .
Under mostly cloudy skies today , we 've seen the melt down continue as highs rise into the low - and - mid 40s this afternoon .
But enough about that , what about the snow chances ?
Through Tonight :
We 'll stay mostly cloudy overnight with lows ranging from the upper 20s in the coldest suburban spots to possibly as high as the mid-30s downtown .
Breezes from the northwest should be around 10 mph or so , maybe a little higher at times .
Tomorrow ( Wednesday ) :
There may be some breaks in the clouds early before we trend back cloudy as the storm approaches -- highs reach the low - to - mid 40s most spots .
By late afternoon or evening , precipitation in the form of rain or snow should begin to advance from the south .
The bulk of any activity should hold off until the overnight or Thursday .
Tomorrow Night : Much uncertainty still exists regarding the storm system that will develop off the coast .
Right now we sit on a border between little to perhaps no snow accumulation to the west , and potentially significant snowfall to the east .
Uncertainty aside , the odds of snow increase overnight , especially over eastern sections of the area .
Lows should fall to the mid-20s to near 30 .
Thursday : A chance of snow , possibly significant , may continue into much of Thursday .
While we can't yet say with certainty how much falls , we do know one thing : it will be very windy as the storm strengthens rapidly off the coast .
Highs could range from near freezing if we see more snow to the upper 30s if less .
Winds from the west / northwest will increase to at least 25 mph sustained , with gusts to 50 mph or higher , as the day progresses .

LAST
October a discovery was made that brought hope to millions of sufferers from chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) .
A group of researchers found a bug with the long - winded name of xenotropic murine leukaemia virus - related virus ( XMRV ) in 67 % of American patients with CFS ( as opposed to 4 % of healthy controls ) .
This figure increased dramatically when the patients were retested .
The news was exciting for patients because CFS is a debilitating disorder of long - term tiredness for which there is no simple explanation , and certainly no sniff of a cure .
It has even attracted a certain degree of media scepticism — being dubbed , at one time , “ yuppie flu ” .
XMRV is certainly a reasonable candidate to cause CFS .
It has also been implicated in prostate cancer , breast cancer and lymphoma .
Last year 's study , published in Science by Judy Mikovits of the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno , Nevada , and her colleagues , caused such excitement that it quickly led to commercial testing for XMRV infection .
Furthermore , because XMRV is a retrovirus , like HIV , several preclinical studies have been looking at whether antiretroviral drugs might have an effect on it .
One of these studies has found that of the ten licensed compounds tested , only AZT inhibited replication of XMRV .
The new year , though , has brought new complications , in the form of a study that has been unable to replicate Dr Mikovits 's work .
Writing in the Public Library of Science , Otto Erlwein of Imperial College , London , and his colleagues report that they are unable to find XMRV in any of almost 200 CFS patients in Britain .
One possible explanation is that one of the two groups of scientists made a mistake in their testing , something that both are adamant is not the case .
As scientific punch - ups go , this is shaping up to be a good one , with blows ( albeit polite ones ) being thrown across the Atlantic .
The Americans say that the British were not looking for DNA directly in white blood cells , and by using whole blood they diluted their samples too much .
Kerpow !
They add that the design of the British experiment did not prove that it could actually pick up XMRV in patients .
Zapp !
Finally , they say the British must prove they can actually detect XMRV in one of the American samples , something that they would have been delighted to provide had they been asked .
Biff !
For their part , the British insist their controls are just fine and hint that the American laboratory may have had contamination problems .
Blam !
They also add that a number of other labs are about to publish results of similar studies looking for XMRV and say they are “ very confident ” about their findings .
Splat !
Frustrating though this may be for sufferers from CFS , it is discussions like these , as one group of researchers tries to replicate the results of another , that lead to scientific progress .
In the meantime , one of the companies licensed to do the American XMRV test claims that of the 300 patients , including some from Britain , who have sent samples in for testing , 36 % have tested positive for XMRV .
It seems likely that the causes of CFS will continue to be a subject of controversy for a while yet .
Kovalchuk To Jersey Might Be The Stupidest Hockey Trade Ever - Habs Eyes On The Prize How it looks , is that Devils GM Lou Lamoriello has paid the rental player rate for a player who essentially becomes just that .
He 's also gone out and gotten the most ill fitting player his team could have in terms of system adherence .
The always defensively conscious Devils have now a player who rarely commits himself to his own end .
Sounds like a topic for a poll to me .
We have one nomination , Kovalchuk to New Jersey .

Here 's a summary of findings from the February 2010 Franklin & Marshall College poll .
The MOE is 3.5 % .
The full pdf is here .
The poll was conducted February 2 – 8 , 2010 -- well after the Virginia governor 's race proved " the honeymoon is over " , well after the New Jersey governor 's race proved " Americans are rejecting Obama 's socialist agenda " , well after the Massachusetts Senate special election proved " the American people just do n't want Obamacare " .
82 % -- Requiring insurance companies to sell health
coverage to people , even if they have preexisting
medical conditions ( 62 % strongly , 20 % somewhat )
68 % -- Expanding Medicaid to provide insurance coverage to more low income citizens ( 42 % strongly , 26 % somewhat )
62 % -- Requiring all businesses to provide health insurance to their employees or pay money into a government fund that pays to cover those without insurance ( 41 % strongly , 21 % somewhat )
62 % -- Expanding Medicare to cover MORE Americans ( 39 % strongly , 23 % somewhat )
62 % -- Requiring that all Americans have health insurance , with the government providing financial help for those who ca n’t afford it
( 38 % strongly , 24 % somewhat )
50 % -- Expanding Medicare to cover everyone who does not have health insurance ( 32 % strongly , 18 % somewhat )
55 % -- Creating a government health insurance plan similar to Medicare that provides an alternative to private health insurance plans ( 29 % strongly , 26 % somewhat )
There is absolutely no reason to delay on passing health care reform .
It is still as popular today as it was the day the the American people overwhelmingly elected a Democratic majority to do just that .
No matter what the purveyors of conventional wisdom say , no matter what the freaks and loons say , no matter what the Republicans say , we need a bill on the president 's desk and we need it now .

Three successful authors tell Suvudu that D&D gave them the experience points to write decent novels and stories .

Wizards Of The Coast is putting out a new " red box " edition of the D&D starter set , and Suvudu celebrated by asking a few authors what the game had meant to them , and they all said it improved their storytelling in some way .
Green author Jay Lake says " Those three years playing D&D at boarding school did more to ground me in storytelling , plot construction , and sheer , raw imaginative throughput than any other single activity of my life . "
Paul Jessup adds that being the Dungeon Master " helped me sharpen my improvisational skills , which of course helped my writing skills quite a bit . "

Also , says Candy In Action author Matthue Roth : " On a base level - and I 'm saying this as a professional educator & curriculum designer - it 's great for getting kids to realize there 's a world beyond their own , and to put yourself in another world or make yourself think like somebody you 'd never be . "

[ Suvudu ]
Following a breath - taking electoral surge , Scott Brown took the seat formerly held by liberal patron saint Ted Kennedy , handily defeating Democrat Martha Coakley in the Massachusetts senate election .
Although the national press spun the contest as a referendum on Obamacare , another powder - keg issue lurked behind the headlines : Martha Coakley 's prominent role in prosecuting a child abuse case and her contended culpability of the " primary male offender . "
It was back in 1984 when Violet Amirault , son Gerald , and daughter Cheryl , operators of the Fells Acre Day School in Malden , found themselves accused of child molestation .
The charges were lurid as they were absurd : plunging a butcher knife into a 4 - year - old boy 's rectum ( which miraculously left no mark of injury ) and tying a naked child to a tree in front of the school to be anally impaled with a " magic wand " ( an incident to which there were no witnesses ) .
The children also accused two make - believe persons , " Mr. Gatt " and " Al , " as well as the child therapist investigating the case , of molesting them as well .
Bugs Bunny , Mickey Mouse , and Mr. Greenjeans reportedly escaped legal scrutiny .
Following a sham trial , Violet and her daughter were handed an 8 - 20 year sentence , while Gerald was sent to the slammer for a 30 - 40 year stint .
Based on accumulating evidence of perjury and fraud , the case was reopened eight years later .
Following widely - publicized hearings , Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein sadly concluded , " Every trick in the book had been used to get the children to say what the investigators wanted . "
The Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly similarly editorialized the prosecutors " seemed unwilling to admit they might have sent innocent people to jail for crimes that never occurred . "
Enter Martha Coakley , who took over as the local district attorney in 1999 .
By that time , public opinion was running sharply in favor of the defendants .
( Violet had recently died of cancer , left penniless and broken by the accusations . )
Coakley was willing to allow Cheryl to go free .
But as far as Gerald , that was a different matter .
After all , he was a man , the " primary male offender , " as Coakley put it .
( She never explained how it is possible to have a " primary offender " for a crime that never took place . )
So when the Massachusetts Governor 's Board of Pardons voted 5 - 0 to release Gerald Amirault in 2000 , prosecutor Martha Coakley channeled her inner community organizer and media maven .
She unearthed sympathetic parents to lobby the Massachusetts governor to overturn the Board 's recommendation .
Then she organized media events where persons spoke movingly of their fear of Gerald 's planned release .
These maneuvers kept Gerald behind bars for two more years .
Even afterwards , he was forced to wear an electronic tracking device , to report every time he left his house , to obey a curfew , and to avoid certain parts of town .
This precluded him from finding regular employment .
This legal travesty did not attract national attention until last Fall .
At that point , Coakley held a nearly insurmountable 30 - point lead over her Republican challenger .
Then Ann Coulter devoted her December 9 column to the case , calling it the " second - most notorious witch trial in Massachusetts history " and charging Coakley had " kept a clearly innocent man in prison in order to advance her political career . "
A month later , Dorothy Rabinowitz delivered the coup de grace .
Recounting in the Wall Street Journal how prosecutors cast Gerald as the chief predator , " his gender qualifying him , in their view , as the best choice for the role , " Rabinowitz adjudged the superfluous prosecution was " powerful testimony to the mind and capacities of this aspirant to a Senate seat . "
The Rabinowitz editorial was published on January 14 .
The same day a Suffolk University poll spotted Brown a 4 - point lead over Martha Coakley .
And when the ballots were tallied nearly a week later , Scott Brown had defeated Coakley by a resounding five - point margin .
Four years ago prosecutor Michael Nifong 's political aspirations came to an abrupt halt for prosecuting the three Duke lacrosse players .
And now Martha Coakley has lost her bid for the United States Senate .
Prosecuting innocent men for crimes they did n't commit is no longer the sure - fire formula to electoral success it once appeared to be .

Presenter Rickie Haywood - Williams attempts to find out the true impact of the UK 's skunk - smoking habit and accompanies Avon and Somerset police on raids on homes and warehouses .
In 2002 , Britain produced 15 per cent of its own cannabis .
In 2010 that figure is 90 per cent , and police around the country raid at least three factories every day .
Organised gangs are cashing in on widespread demand for cannabis among Britain 's youth by setting up sophisticated factories in suburban homes and disused warehouses .
Research shows a third of the UK 's 15 - year - olds have tried cannabis and a quarter of young people aged 16 - 24 smoke it regularly .
Presenter Rickie Haywood - Williams journeys beyond the scaremongering headlines to find out the true impact of the UK 's skunk - smoking habit .
Rickie accompanies Avon and Somerset police on raids , and rides in a heat - seeking helicopter as it uncovers cannabis farms with hi-tech thermal imaging equipment .
He also meets a landlord who was horrified to find his tenant was in fact part of an organised gang who were farming cannabis in every bedroom of his house .
Rickie 's journey also includes a trip to Amsterdam and meetings with some of the UK's three million smokers , from those who fiercely defend their habit to others who regret the effect it has had on their lives .
NOW ZAD , Afghanistan | Zarmina and Sharifa have very big dreams for very little girls .
One of the sisters from the Now Zad district of Helmand province wants to be a teacher ; the other wants to be a doctor .
And thats understandable .
Both saw their first teacher and doctor only recently , and neither had ever imagined before then any kind of life beyond farming , child - rearing , cooking and menial labor .
“ Our mother and father told us to come , ” said Zarmina , who thinks she is about 11 years old .
“ We didnt go to school before , because there was no school .
“ We like this .
We are learning things .
Its safe , and were not afraid to come here , ” she said .
The two are among the 100 to 200 children attending classes every day in a school started in an abandoned building by U.S. Marines and their interpreters after Taliban gunmen were expelled from the town in early December .
On the first day , only about 80 children showed up .
Five of them were girls , whom the Taliban had forbidden to get an education .
On the second day , attendance was nearly 200 children younger than 13 and just two girls .
Now the number , although it fluctuates each day , averages more than 100 boys and 20 girls who walk to class from villages as far as four miles away .
“ It was chaos on the first day , ” said Master Sgt. Julia Watson , who handles female engagement for the civil affairs team working with the 3rd Battalion , 4th Marines .
“ The building was packed with yelling and talking kids .
So the first day was instilling discipline and order . ”
She added , “ They are all excited about learning to read and write , and many want to learn English also . ”
The classroom at Now Zads school is just a large room in what was once the district government center on the edge of town .
The school has no chairs for the children , just frayed rugs on the damp and dusty concrete floor .
It has no lighting or heat .
The children are divided into four groups .
The girls make up their own group in one corner of the building .
“ We divided it because we only have four teachers , ” said Mansur , the newly hired school principal .
“ The girls are separate because in our culture , we dont do coed activities . ”
Mansur , like many other people in this northern area of Helmand province , uses only a single name .
Mansur said children are taught first - grade - level reading , writing and arithmetic , but he hopes that in time theyll be able to complete lessons up to a fourth - grade level .
The few books that the school has came from the United Nations via the Marines .
The Marines , with the help of troops ’ care packages from the United States , provide supplies such as pencils and notebooks as well as bags filled with games and candy .
Teddy bears and other stuffed animals sent to troops from U.S. schoolchildren were given to Zarmina , Sharifa and other girls .
Basic toiletries such as soap , toothbrushes and skin moisturizer are periodically sent home with the children as well .
The Marines interpreters taught the classes at first .
Within two weeks , however , four men in the district with teaching experience were located , were convinced that Now Zad was safe and were hired at $ 6 per day .
“ There was no school in Now Zad for four years , ” Mansur said .
“ There was no school because there werent even humans here . ”
Now Zad , Helmands second - largest town , was deserted from 2006 until last month .
British troops , and later Americans , held an outpost on one edge of town while an estimated 100 to 200 Taliban gunmen at any given time controlled all surrounding areas , U.S. Marines said .
Now Zads residential neighborhoods and bazaars were abandoned by Taliban decree , and people moved to surrounding villages .
Since the Marines retook the town in Operation Cobras Anger , people are returning , albeit slowly .
The Taliban booby - trapped many homes and seeded improvised explosive devices throughout the area .
Although resettlement progress will be slow , Now Zads school is now the fixture in many lives .
According to a report by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , an estimated 63 percent of rural Afghan men and 90 percent of rural Afghan women are illiterate .
In Now Zad , those illiterates are sending their children to school in defiance of threats from Taliban operatives .

Cultures of constraint ; Islam , India and Marxism Cultures of constraint ; Islam , India and Marxism
Pew has a new report ,
There are the set of countries which have been shaped by Marxism in the recent past , or still are officially Marxist , which have strong legal sanctions against organized religion .
China , Eritrea and Uzbekistan fall into this camp .
But look at Russia .
Perhaps Russian intolerance is a function of its Eastern Orthodoxy , but it seems plausible that Communist era elites have simply continued the tendency to control " subversive " religious groups that they had honed during the Soviet period ( most Western nations were very restrictive of minority religions when the Russian Revolution occurred , but during the Soviet period many evolved toward a more tolerant state ) .
Then there are the Muslim countries .
While China has official atheism , religious groups can flourish ( at least within the natural bounds of the religiosity of the Chinese people , which seems to be set rather low ) so long as they keep a low profile and do n't get on the wrong side of the state .
But in many Muslim countries hostility toward non-mainstream religious movements runs very deep .
I do n't need to elaborate on this , Muslims are the modern apotheosis of the Abrahamists of old , atheists toward other gods and promoters of their own ( listening to the radio recently I noticed how talk show hosts given Muslims a pass when they get all effusive about how incredible their religion is .
If a white Christian did this it would seem gauche ) .
This probably explains on some level the extreme outrage in Muslim majority countries when Muslim expression in the non-Muslim majority countries is restrained .
This response is totally not dampened by the strong tendency for Muslims to severely constrain the rights of non-Muslims when they themselves are in the majority .
The Single Truth needs no apology , and why would one want to be fair and balanced between Truth and delusion ?
( I think back here to debates between pagans and Christians in Late Antiquity , as the latter brushed aside the pleas from the former for tolerance of belief and practice by arguing in effect that freedom of religion would only give succor to delusion and was therefore ultimately an obscenity .
This stance remained dominant in the West down to the Enlightenment )
Finally , there 's India .
By India , I do n't mean the nation of India .
I mean the civilization , which includes Bangladesh , Nepal , Sri Lanka and yes , Pakistan .
Poking through survey data it seems that Hindus are quite religious , like Muslims , but they are far less atheistic , as one would expect .
The philosophical aspects of Hinduism which tend toward universalism and cultural parallelism seem to percolate down rather far ( though the survey data I see probably excludes the illiterate masses ) .
On the other hand , like Muslims Hindus seem to have really strong attitudes when it comes to religious defection or switching .
India has laws discouraging or banning conversion which might be appropriate in the Muslim or ( post - ) Marxist world .
When looking at survey data on South Asians from India in the UK or USA it is interesting to me that though the Hindus are only moderately religious in their self - conception , very few avow that they have " No Religion . "
This is in strong contrast with East Asia , and among East Asian immigrants , who routinely assert that they have no religious affiliation .
While Indian Hindus by and large have no need to convert the world in totality to their religion , as Muslims and Marxists must in regards to their faiths , they are strong believers in the necessity of some religious identity .
Additionally , they have an attachment to the idea that people should not defect or switch between identities , lest inter-communal harmony be disrupted .
In the report they express some surprise that Africa is relatively tolerant .
I am not .
From what I have read religious conversion and switching is very common in Africa , from Protestantism to Catholicism to Islam and back .
Even heads of state have switched religions without extreme controversy .
Perhaps this has something to do with the sheer fragmentation and diversity of most African nations , which are cleaved along many dimensions besides religion .
Additionally , the roots of any given organized religion are generally rather shallow in most of these nations .
So unlike Indian civilization switching religion does n't carry a lot of historical baggage .
The best analogy to Africa seems like the United States , which also have a huge diversity of religious sects , and where switching is generally not particularly surprising or controversial .
Individual preference is balanced with communal identification .
Finally , I want to note the distinction between some European nations which are secular ( France ) and East Asian ones ( Korea , Japan ) .
Without the totalist influence of Marxism East Asian nations tend to take a relatively muted stance toward religion .
Just as Sri Lankan Buddhists show that the identitarian reflex of Indians is not a function of Hinduism , Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong all illustrate that without official Marxism there is relatively robust tolerance of religious sectarianism .
The power of one organized religion in East Asia was always much less than it was in Europe .
Talking to many Europeans who are secular , though they themselves are not believers , they often find " non-traditional " religions rather weird .
There is clearly a particular favoritism toward the traditional religion of a society , and a suspicion of new religions .
This in some ways resembles the Indian attitude , except it is much more stripped of any supernatural content in terms of belief .
Here are two maps which illustrate the axes above :
Pew has a new report , Global Restrictions on Religion ( HT JohnPI ) .
It illustrates rather clearly some general trends which I 've been mulling over for several years looking at cross-cultural data .
Here 's a 2 - dimensional chart which plots the 50 most populous nations in their data set along an axis of governmental vs. social restrictions on religion .
There are the set of countries which have been shaped by Marxism in the recent past , or still are officially Marxist , which have strong legal sanctions against organized religion .
China , Eritrea and Uzbekistan fall into this camp .
But look at Russia .
Perhaps Russian intolerance is a function of its Eastern Orthodoxy , but it seems plausible that Communist era elites have simply continued the tendency to control " subversive " religious groups that they had honed during the Soviet period ( most Western nations were very restrictive of minority religions when the Russian Revolution occurred , but during the Soviet period many evolved toward a more tolerant state ) .
Then there are the Muslim countries .
While China has official atheism , religious groups can flourish ( at least within the natural bounds of the religiosity of the Chinese people , which seems to be set rather low ) so long as they keep a low profile and do n't get on the wrong side of the state .
But in many Muslim countries hostility toward non-mainstream religious movements runs very deep .
I do n't need to elaborate on this , Muslims are the modern apotheosis of the Abrahamists of old , atheists toward other gods and promoters of their own ( listening to the radio recently I noticed how talk show hosts given Muslims a pass when they get all effusive about how incredible their religion is .
If a white Christian did this it would seem gauche ) .
This probably explains on some level the extreme outrage in Muslim majority countries when Muslim expression in the non-Muslim majority countries is restrained .
This response is totally not dampened by the strong tendency for Muslims to severely constrain the rights of non-Muslims when they themselves are in the majority .
The Single Truth needs no apology , and why would one want to be fair and balanced between Truth and delusion ?
( I think back here to debates between pagans and Christians in Late Antiquity , as the latter brushed aside the pleas from the former for tolerance of belief and practice by arguing in effect that freedom of religion would only give succor to delusion and was therefore ultimately an obscenity .
This stance remained dominant in the West down to the Enlightenment ) Finally , there 's India .
By India , I do n't mean the nation of India .
I mean the civilization , which includes Bangladesh , Nepal , Sri Lanka and yes , Pakistan .
Poking through survey data it seems that Hindus are quite religious , like Muslims , but they are far less atheistic , as one would expect .
The philosophical aspects of Hinduism which tend toward universalism and cultural parallelism seem to percolate down rather far ( though the survey data I see probably excludes the illiterate masses ) .
On the other hand , like Muslims Hindus seem to have really strong attitudes when it comes to religious defection or switching .
India has laws discouraging or banning conversion which might be appropriate in the Muslim or ( post - ) Marxist world .
When looking at survey data on South Asians from India in the UK or USA it is interesting to me that though the Hindus are only moderately religious in their self - conception , very few avow that they have " No Religion . "
This is in strong contrast with East Asia , and among East Asian immigrants , who routinely assert that they have no religious affiliation .
While Indian Hindus by and large have no need to convert the world in totality to their religion , as Muslims and Marxists must in regards to their faiths , they are strong believers in the necessity of some religious identity .
Additionally , they have an attachment to the idea that people should not defect or switch between identities , lest inter-communal harmony be disrupted .
In the report they express some surprise that Africa is relatively tolerant .
I am not .
From what I have read religious conversion and switching is very common in Africa , from Protestantism to Catholicism to Islam and back .
Even heads of state have switched religions without extreme controversy .
Perhaps this has something to do with the sheer fragmentation and diversity of most African nations , which are cleaved along many dimensions besides religion .
Additionally , the roots of any given organized religion are generally rather shallow in most of these nations .
So unlike Indian civilization switching religion does n't carry a lot of historical baggage .
The best analogy to Africa seems like the United States , which also have a huge diversity of religious sects , and where switching is generally not particularly surprising or controversial .
Individual preference is balanced with communal identification .
Finally , I want to note the distinction between some European nations which are secular ( France ) and East Asian ones ( Korea , Japan ) .
Without the totalist influence of Marxism East Asian nations tend to take a relatively muted stance toward religion .
Just as Sri Lankan Buddhists show that the identitarian reflex of Indians is not a function of Hinduism , Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong all illustrate that without official Marxism there is relatively robust tolerance of religious sectarianism .
The power oforganized religion in East Asia was always much less than it was in Europe .
Talking to many Europeans who are secular , though they themselves are not believers , they often find " non-traditional " religions rather weird .
There is clearly a particular favoritism toward the traditional religion of a society , and a suspicion of new religions .
This in some ways resembles the Indian attitude , except it is much more stripped of any supernatural content in terms of belief .
Here are two maps which illustrate the axes above : Labels : culture , Religion

Can you imagine your soul laid bare , every sin and broken promise shown in grim detail to the one you love above all others ?
" You do n't know what it was like ! "
Dante screams , anguished , as his beloved witnesses a particularly heinous act from his past .
" Yes , she does , " Satan replies .
" I have shown her . "
Dante 's Inferno is not for the faint of heart .
It 's also not exactly true to the source material , using names and ideas more as a jumping off point than as straight inspiration .
The story follows Dante , who fans of the original work may be amused to find is a powerful soldier , as he fights to save the soul of a woman .
As he travels through the circles of hell , we witness the immoral acts he took part in during his time with the crusades , through both computer - generated and traditional animation .
This is a beautiful game , both during gameplay and during the story sections , with a strong sense of both purpose and design .
Title Dante's Inferno Developer Visceral Games Publisher EA Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 ( reviewed ) , PSP
But how does it play ?
After playing the demo , we said that this felt exactly like God of War , and that opinion has n't been changed after playing through the full game .
The two games share almost every mechanic : the same combo-heavy gameplay , the same collection of orbs from dead enemies to upgrade attacks , the same items to find in out - of - the - way places .
After doing enough damage to enemies , you can choose to either absolve them of their sins or punish them , and the decision you makes determines whether or not you level up on other the holy or unholy side of things .
To gain the most attacks , you 'll want to balance your decisions here .
Just in case you 're interested in more than melee combat , you can also find a cross that you can use to blast baddies with holy light .
Leveled up , it becomes quite the helpful ally in the game .
In addition , there are certain souls in the underworld that offer bonuses if you put them out of their misery , and these may allow you to play a rhythm game where you push buttons as dark spheres — sins — move towards the center of a cross .
It looks like a gothic Guitar Hero , and plays similarly .
The fixed camera , the avenging hero , the button presses and rhythm needed to hit the high combos ... you 've seen all this before in God of War .
The epic boss battles are also usually ended by quick - time events , but they 're so bloody and satisfying that you wo n't mind the old and hoary trick used to make to a game more cinematic .
You 'll unlock magic as you go , and using said magic does add another layer of tactics to the battles , but this is a pure , balls - out action game .
All of the action requires tight control and a solid frame rate , and luckily the game provides both .
We keep bringing up how much of the gameplay mechanics are ripped directly from God of War , but if you 're going to rip off a game , rip off a great game and do justice to the ideas that made it so much fun .
Dante 's Inferno is a joy to play , front to back .
It earns the M-rating
It 's rare for us to talk about how a game earns its rating , but Dante 's Inferno deals with sin as its main topic , and is loosely based on one of the most popular treatises on the failing of human morality ever written .
It gets creative when it deals with these topics .
You 'll fight unbaptized babies in Limbo , there were scenes in the Lust section that made me gag in revulsion , and nudity and sexual topics are common .
The game 's marketing department were creative in getting the game discussed in the press , but the game 's designers were even more creative in showing each of the discrete sections of hell in order to make a point .
The game uses its setting and source material with creativity , and may not be the dumbed - down version of the original text that we first anticipated .
This is n't high art , by any stretch , but the story and voice acting are much better than expected .
In conclusion
The game was a pleasant surprise , and it matches its high graphical polish with responsive controls and familiar — if well - worn — gameplay .
A few battles felt cheap in places , and some of the swinging puzzles were a little touchy , but those are our only complaints .
There is even an online co-op mode with user - created content called the Trials of St. Lucia coming in April ... the game will be getting more content and modes to keep you interested after launch .
EA will be forgiven for " borrowing " with such heavy hands due to the quality and polish on Dante 's Inferno .
If you 're in the mood for an action game , and do n't mind some rough subject matter , this is a trip to hell you 'll want to sign up for .
On the other hand , most people wo n't care enough about future content to want to hold onto the game until April , and you 'll be able to beat the game in under 10 hours or so if you do n't mind not finding everything .
This is n't an automatic buy , but it 's much better than it has any right to be .
If you do drop the $ 60 , we wo n't blame you .
Verdict : Rent
Either Apple is n't operating on the Gregorian calender , or these updates are just straight - up late .
Either way , we 're pretty stoked to see the suits in Cupertino finally wise up and allow Microsoft 's best OS ever to work on its machines , as it has today issued new Boot Camp software ( v3.1 ) for both 32 - bit and 64 - bit users of Windows 7 .
The updates add native support for Win7 Home Premium , Professional and Ultimate , and in case that was n't enough , they also fix " issues " with the Apple trackpad and add support for Apple 's wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse .
You 'll also find model - specific drivers floating around to add even more support , and the Boot Camp Utility for Windows 7 Upgrade is said to " safely unmount the read - only Macintosh volume on Windows Vista " when upgrading from Vista to Windows 7 .
Hit those links below for all the bits and bytes that you 've been so desperately waiting for .
we 're hearing reports that the 27 - inch iMac is responding to Windows 7 with the Black Screen of Death , so make sure you use this tool from Apple before installing Windows 7 .
Too late ?
Then you 'll have to manually remove the offending default ATI drivers by starting from point 4 on this page ( hold down Option key while booting up to select the Windows install disc , by the way ) , and then try the Boot Camp update again .

Fifty - five nations met a deadline on spelling out their emissions cuts plans Industrialised nations have set " pathetic " targets to reduce carbon emissions , says one of India 's senior negotiators at the Copenhagen summit .
One of the summit 's requirements was for countries to spell out by 31 January how they would cut emissions .
But industrialised nations had failed to set the " truly ambitious " targets needed , Chandrashekhar Dasgupta said .
Britain 's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the commitments made in Copenhagen were an important step forward .
Fifty - five countries met the deadline set in the Copenhagen Accord to spell out their plans to cut carbon emissions , although some had already announced their targets ahead of the December climate change summit .
Australia , for example , said it would cut emissions by 5 % of its 2000 levels .
Others like Japan and New Zealand said their commitments were dependent on a global deal .
' Lectured and hectored ' But Mr Dasgupta told The Report programme on BBC Radio 4 : " We need truly ambitious emission reduction commitments from industrialised countries .
" If you see figures that industrialised countries have submitted in response to the Copenhagen Accord , these are truly pathetic . "

He added : " The European Union had envisaged a reduction of from 25 % to 30 % from developed countries , they 're nowhere near this . "
Mr Dasgupta said developing countries were calling for industrialised nations to adopt a 40 % target across a 30 - year period .
He said developing nations had found themselves " lectured and hectored " by industrialised countries at the summit .
" We can do so much consistent with maintaining our development priorities .
Beyond this , it is going to cost tens of billions of dollars , " he added .
" If you can help out with this , that is well and good , we can do more - but otherwise we cannot pick up the tab , it is simply too heavy . "
' Important step ' However , Britain 's Mr Miliband said the commitments made by countries would produce progress .
" The upper end of the commitments will take us to a peaking of global emissions by about 2020 , maybe a bit later , " he said .
He said ambitious targets were needed , but added : " I do think the commitments made in the accord are an important step forward and I do n't think they should be dismissed .
" The key is to get developed countries to drive up to the upper end of their commitments because that is what the world needs . "

THQ will release an extensive demo for Darksiders on February 25 .
The 90 - minute demo features the first dungeon in the game , which should provide enough puzzle - solving and combat to either convince you the game is worth buying , or that it ’s too much of a copycat .
We enjoyed the game , for what it ’s worth .
The demo features the entire Twilight Cathedral level , which includes new weapons to discover and two bosses .
The demo will be available for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 .
“ We are really pumped to be bringing a playable demo for Darksiders to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , ” said David Adams , general manager of Vigil Games .
“ We really wanted to give gamers a true idea of the variety of gameplay that the game offers and so rather than just making a standard 20 - minute - demo version of the first few levels , we decided to give away this massive level and reveal the true essence of the game . ”

Conclusion
Let 's begin with a story .
Mallory the Mythical Developer and two of her good buddies are fans of , a FPS loosely based on the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 .
The game incorporates modern weaponry in a historical , beautiful , and immersive environment .
October Industries , the developers of the game , had no idea it would be such a great success upon release .
Its servers are , unfortunately , completely unable to handle the huge number of new users , and the game has n't stayed up for more than thre consecutive hours since launch .
So Mallory and her friends decide to host a private server where they can play the game with a handful of their other friends across the globe .
This means no more worrying about the server shutting down .
To do this , they will have to use reverse engineering to translate the game 's network protocol so their game clients can communicate with the new server .
Mallory , being an experienced and business - savvy developer , immediately recognizes that there may be some legal problems here .
And Mallory is right : Reverse engineering can be a risky endeavor and should n't be attempted without first consulting an attorney .
Below , I 'll discuss what reverse engineering is , how it 's accomplished , and , more importantly , when reverse engineering will put you and your development team at risk .
Reverse engineering of computer software is any method of studying a program for the purpose of obtaining useful and detailed information about the functional components and mechanisms of the program in question .
The Supreme Court defines it as a " fair and honest means ... [ of ] starting with the known product and working backward to divine the process which aided in its development or manufacture .
" This can be as simple as observing gameplay to determine the functional elements of the game 's rule set or as complex as decompiling a file and analyzing its components to learn how ads are displayed across the game server .
Tools used to reverse engineer a game include debuggers , disassemblers , and network protocol analyzers ( packet sniffers ) .
The essential function of these tools is to give the programmer access to data revealing the precise functions and mechanics of a program so those functions and mechanics can be reproduced with minimal or no use of the original source or binary code .
This method of learning functions and processes has historically been viewed as fair game by most developers .
Indeed , to some extent it is still protected under the legal doctrine of " fair use . "
As a result , inventors in the field of technology and software have relied on reverse engineering for decades .
For example , while the Copyright Act protects the three - dimensional patterns and designs of a microchip , it expressly allows the reverse engineering of those patterns and designs ( referred to by the Act as a " mask work " ) to analyze the concepts or techniques embodied in the chip .
Using similar logic , courts have found that analyzing a computer program for the sole purpose of learning and reproducing its precise functions ( provided those functions are not otherwise protected under patent law ) is typically fair use .
This does not , however , mean that all reverse engineering is treated equally under the law .
In software development , the practice of reverse engineering has come under assault over the past several years .
Machine code and source code are protected as literary works under the Copyright Act .
The copying of software code without permission is copyright infringement .
Using any part of someone else 's unique code in your own project , particularly non-functional code , without permission can give rise to an infringement claim .
Sometimes during the process of reverse engineering , the programmer may want to copy a data file or the entire program .
Typically that type of copying is not permitted under the Copyright Act , although there are a few , very limited , exceptions .
For example , backup files are allowed for a legal purpose such as repairing or debugging a lawfully - owned program .
Yet the Copyright Act 's protection of computer software goes well beyond the question of whether you 've copied anything .
In fact , you do n't need to copy any code at all to run afoul of U.S. copyright law .
The anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA , 17 U.S.C. 1201 , prohibits the circumvention of any technological measures that control access to any part of the work .
It also prevents the distribution of software that enables circumvention of an access control .
Circumvention under the Act means descrambling or decrypting a work , or otherwise bypassing , removing , deactivating or impairing any technological measure without permission .
There are a few classic examples of such technological measures :
Remember those old Sierra games that required you to input a word from a specific paragraph on a specific page of the user manual before you could play the game ?
That 's an access control .
Data file encryption is a more specific application of an access control .
CD key and license key encryption are other commonly - used methods .
Circumventing any of these methods to access the content is probably illegal under the DMCA -- but that is n't the only scenario where a programmer could find him or herself in hot water .
This is relevant to Mallory the Developer 's case too .
If Mallory 's new server does n't provide the same safeguards that control access to the original game servers ( like a CD key or a version verification protocol ) , then her own server is circumventing access controls to the online component of the game .
Therefore , by distributing the program , means ( such as DIY instructions ) , or code to access servers that do n't use the game 's original access controls , she would be violating the anti-circumvention provision .
According to at least one court decision , this is sufficient to constitute a breach of 17 U.S.C.
1201 and thereby give rise to a statutory damages claim in the range of $ 2,500 to $ 25,000 .
This does not mean that all aspects of reverse engineering are prohibited under the DMCA .
For instance , analyzing unencrypted machine code in order to translate those processes and functions to source code is generally permissible .
But because the statutory definition of " circumvention " is so broad under the act , you should be mindful of any encrypted or otherwise protected data contained in a program file if you attempt to lawfully reverse engineer a process or function .
There is one major exception to the DMCA : Bypassing or decrypting encrypted data files of a legally owned copy of a program for the sole purpose of making that program interoperable with other legal software ( for instance , a different operating system ) is expressly permitted under the DMCA .
However , this right is personal .
You can't distribute a way to bypass a CD key or other cracking or decrypting software to make that software playable .
This is why most interoperability projects , such as the adventure game virtual machine ScummVM , require end users to legally own the games they make playable .
They cannot legally provide a means of playing cracked games , even if the primary purpose of the project is interoperability .
This is key : interoperability must be the only purpose .
It is important to note here that this exception can be waived if you agree to a license that prohibits reverse engineering .
A less confusing but no less treacherous risk comes from contracts -- EULAs , NDAs , and other agreements -- that a programmer might subject him or herself to when licensing software .
For years , courts have upheld contract provisions that limit the end user 's right to reverse engineer a program for any purpose .
Any form of agreement to a contract will suffice : click - wrap and shrink - wrap agreements are generally considered enforceable .
For example , ifincludes an EULA that expressly prohibits reverse engineering , and Mallory clicked the " I Accept " button when installing the program , then Mallory should probably abandon hopes of creating a private server by reverse engineering the client .
A programmer can be liable for breach of contract and other causes of action for violating a EULA , including misappropriation of trade secrets , in addition to the possible copyright claims ..
Pay close attention to the EULA of any game or program you want to reverse engineer .
Even if you hope to reverse engineer the program for legal purposes , you would still be prohibited if you 've accepted the EULA 's terms in any manner .
This includes purchasing a product with a shrink wrap license or clicking the " I Accept " button during the installation process .
A final consideration to bear in mind is data privacy .
In most situations involving reverse engineering of a game , developers like Mallory and her friends would only want to monitor her client 's network communications with the game server .
However , if you 're working on the kind of project where you inspect network packets that are n't yours , then you should be aware of certain privacy laws .
The first is the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) , part of the Wiretap Act , ( 18 U.S.C. 2510 et. Seq. ) .
Under the ECPA you can't intercept electronic communications , including data packets or any transfer of information between a client and a network provider , while that data is en route on a network unless you are the network provider ( or a duly authorized government official authorized to access that information for investigative purposes ) .
Violation of the ECPA could subject you to both civil and criminal liability .
The second law is the Stored Communications Act ( 18 U.S.C. 2701 et. Seq. ) .
This act is designed to prevent unauthorized access to network service providers that allow the transfer of private electronic communications .
You can be criminally liable for accessing data temporarily stored at those points without authorization .
You can also be liable for exceeding your authorization and obtaining data to which you should n't have access unless that access is expressly permitted under the statute .
Both of these laws are designed to prevent you from accessing private communications , including data packets sent over a network or temporarily stored on a network .
For this reason alone , you should avoid reverse engineering projects that require monitoring communications you do n't have permission to observe .
Reverse engineering is n't inherently illegal .
As we 've seen , though , it can involve a variety of legal issues .
If Mallory and her friends move forward with their private server project they will need to determine their risk exposure and take steps to ensure that all aspects of the reverse engineering process is legally compliant .
This is n't the type of project you want to pursue if you 're risk averse ; after all , reverse engineering is traditionally done for the purpose of recreating the useful functions of someone else 's work .
That alone can be enough to draw unwanted attention from content owners .
If you still want to engage in a reverse - engineering project , you can mitigate your risk by contacting an attorney to learn steps you should take to protect yourself and your project .
Over the past year or so , I 've been working on a project called Cil .
It 's a distributed issue tracker and if you do n't know what that means , let me explain .
Cil is currently a command line tool .
It saves it 's issues , comments and attachments as plain text files inside your project in an issues / directory .
Some settings are read from .cil and also you may set some personal preferences in ~/.cilrc .
Due to the fact that all data associated with issues ( bugs , feature requests , tasks ) are saved as text files , it 's really easy to check them in to Git and , if required , fix conflicts .
Aha , conflicts , that 's gotta be painful .
Well , it 's not and here 's why .
Each issue , any comments and all attachments are assigned a random set of hex chars for it 's identity .
Since this space is so big , the chances of two people adding an issue at the same time with the same identity is minuscule .
Hence , conflicts are rarely encountered .
Adding a comment to the same issue at the same time might cause a conflict ( in the parent issue ) but resolving that is simple .
And remember , all issues are saved in Git which gives you two advantages .
Firstly it 's
Git which gives the issue tracker it 's inherent distributed nature .
Secondly , and this is just as good , you have a full history of all of your issues .
Sweet aye ?
Release Early , Release Often
Using cil has completely changed how I create and manage my software releases .
Why ?
Because Cil let 's me label issues .
This of itself is n't amazing but think about how you can figure out when you 're ready to release the next version of the software .
Think about the following Makefile :
next - milestone : cil summary -- is- open --label=Milestone-v0.01
So if at one stage you say make next - milestone , you might end up with list of many issues .
$ make next - milestone cil summary -- is - open --label=Milestone -v0.05 ===========================================================================
0085f7a8 New
Add ability to edit comments 2b4647f8 New Change name of page attributes 2f37e17a InProgress Allow Section Properties 65d73568 New
Add new section layouts - Featured Node ( or equivalent ) 713f4705 New Using |cfg is bad , it 's not a filter anymore , needs changing 7bc0d655 New Add a SPAM question thing so we do n't get all the spam a4c0e80 f New Add a ' FlickrImage ' node type ac70e68c New Add new ways to render each node ===========================================================================
But one day , after developing day and night , you type make next - milestone and voila , no issues are returned !
$ make next - milestone cil summary -- is - open --label=Milestone-v0.05 $
Joy fills your heart because you know what this means .
It means you can release your next version .
Too many times I have delayed releasing something but following this procedure means I know when I 'm done :)
Getting Things Done
Lately I have also been using Cil as a ToDo list .
I know a few other people who do this too and we have yet to compare notes , but here is my latest thoughts on doing it .
With GTD , one of the things they tell you about is contexts .
You might be at home or work or somewhere else entirely .
In most cases , you can only perform a particular task within a known environment .
If you 're down the park or at a football match , you 'd rarely tick something off your ToDo list .
So I have been labeling my issues with Label : Content - Home and Label : Content - Work .
In my Makefile in my ToDo directory , I have the following make targets set up :
home : cil summary -- is- open -- label =Context - Home work : cil summary -- is- open -- label =Context - Work
By using these targets ( along with some other helper targets ) , I can get Cil to read all the issues , filter on Status ( show only the open ones ) and filter on issues that have that particular label .
Again , this has been a revelation to me recently .
I find I am getting more things done , which I figure is the point of the whole thing :)
Getting Cil
Go to your usual checkout dir and type :
git clone git://github.com/andychilton/cil.git
In my $ PATH I usually have ~/ bin , in which I place a cil script which I make executable :
$ cat ~/ bin/cil #!/bin/bash export PERL5LIB=/home/andy/src/github/cil/lib
/home/andy/src/github/cil/bin/cil " $ @ "
Replace the paths for your checkout .
Doing it this way means when you fetch newer versions of cil , you get the updated copy in use immediately .
Have fun and let me know how you get on .
By the way , it 's written in Perl :)
Le président de la Commission européenne , José Manuel Barroso , veut relancer le processus d'autorisation de la culture de deux OGM controversés très vite après la prise de fonctions de sa nouvelle équipe , la semaine prochaine , ont assuré à l'AFP plusieurs sources européennes .
" L'autorisation de la culture du maïs MON810 et de la pomme de terre Amflora est une de ses priorités " , a confié une source au sein de l'exécutif bruxellois , sous couvert de l'anonymat .
" Il veut aller vite pour se débarrasser de ce problème qui lui a pourri son premier mandat " , a confirmé un responsable européen .
Mais la Commission a démenti cette assertion .
" Le président Barroso n'a aucune intention d'imposer la culture des OGM " , a affirmé lundi soir à l'AFP sa porte - parole Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen .
" Aucune décision n'a été prise concernant ces deux produits " , a - t - elle assuré .
La première réunion de la nouvelle Commission est prévue le 17 février , " mais le programme de travail est encore en cours d'élaboration " , a précisé la porte - parole , Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen .
Monsanto attend le renouvellement de l'autorisation pour la culture du MON810 , seul OGM cultivé à ce jour dans l'UE , et la société BASF bataille pour sa pomme de terre .
D'énormes intérêts financiers sont en jeu .
BASF estime entre 30 et 40 millions d'euros par an les revenus dégagés par Amflora , si sa culture est autorisée .
" Barroso ne raisonne qu'en termes de marchés et de relations commerciales " , a souligné le responsable européen .
" Il se fonde sur les avis scientifiques qui disent que ces OGM ne présentent pas de risques pour la santé , mais ne se préoccupe pas des possibles conséquences à long terme sur l'environnement " , a déploré la source au sein de la Commission .
Le départ de Stavros Dimas , commissaire à l'environnement opposé à la culture des OGM , facilite la tâche à M. Barroso .
Mais il doit tenir compte des réticences des Etats .
Six pays , dont la France et l'Allemagne , ont interdit la culture du MON810 , et onze Etats ont demandé à pouvoir interdire toutes les cultures d'OGM .
M. Barroso a subi un revers politique l'an dernier lorsque vingt - deux pays ont voté contre sa demande de faire lever les interdictions , et les gouvernements européens sont aujourd ' hui très réticents à autoriser les produits OGM en raison de l'opposition de l'opinion , inquiète de leur possible toxicité .
" Nous attendons de voir comment il compte s'y prendre " , a commenté un diplomate .

A Jordanian legal center plans to file a lawsuit against Israel for damage caused to the environment and residents of south Jordan by radiation emitted from the nuclear facility in Dimona , a Saudi news agency reported on Tuesday .
According to the report , the al - Jisr al - Arabi human rights center located in Amman , has begun the necessary groundwork ahead of filing a legal claim in the coming month .
According to the center , Israel is causing cases of death , cancer , and other afflictions among the Jordanians that live in the area adjacent to the reactor , due to the toxic gases and radiation it emits .
The center also claims that the facility causes environmental damage in Jordan .
Legal preparations began after representatives of the center met with a number of the reactor 's " victims " in Jordan , and " collected evidence and proof that attest to a rise in the number of cancer cases , especially among residents of the southern region , which is adjacent to the reactor . "
The center 's general manager Attorney Amjad Shammout expressed optimism that this complaint , which will is expected to be filed with Jordanian legal bodies against Israel , will be accepted in accordance with the constitution and international treaties on human rights , which Jordan has recently adopted .
He noted that " This is an ongoing and deliberate crime on Israel 's part , which still causes cases of death and injury in large numbers among the Jordanians . "

Optimizing for Fan Noise
The first money I ever earned , outside of getting an allowance , was writing assembly language games for an 8 - bit home computer magazine called ANALOG Computing .
Those games ended up as pages of printed listings of lines like this :
1050 DATA 4CBC08A6A4BC7D09A20986B7B980 0995E895D4B99E099DC91C9DB51CA90095C0C8
CA10E8A20086A88E7D1D8E7E,608
A typical game could be 75 to 125 + of those lines ( and those " three " lines above count as one ; it 's word - wrapped for a 40 - column display ) .
On the printed page they were a wall of hex digits .
And people typed them in by hand -- I typed them in by hand -- in what can only be described as a painstaking process .
Just try reading that data to yourself and typing it into a text editor .
Go ahead : 4C - BC -08 - A6 ...
Typos were easy to make .
That 's the purpose of the " 608 " at the end of the line .
It 's a checksum verified by a separate " correctness checker " utility .
There was a strong incentive for the authors of these games to optimize their code .
Not for speed , but to minimize the number of characters that people who bought the magazine had to type .
Warning , 6502 code ahead !
This :
LDA #0 TAY
was two fewer printed digits than this :
LDA #0 LDY #0
Across a 4 K or 6 K game , those savings mattered .
Two characters here , four characters there , maybe the total line count could be reduced by four lines , six lines , ten lines .
This had nothing to do with actual code performance .
Even on a sub - 2MHz processor those scattered few cycles were noise .
But finding your place in the current line , saying " A6 , " then typing " A " and " 6 " took time .
Measurable time .
Time that was worth optimizing .
Most of the discussions I see about optimization are less concrete .
It 's always " speed " and " memory , " but in the way someone with a big house and a good job says " I need more money . "
Optimization only matters if you 're optimizing something where you can feel the difference , and you can't feel even thousands of bytes or nanoseconds .
Optimizing for program understandability ... I 'll buy that , but it 's more of an internal thing .
There 's one concern that really does matter these days , and it's not abstract in the least : power consumption .
It 's more than just battery life .
If a running program means I get an hour less work done before looking for a place to plug in , that 's not horrible .
The experience is the same , just shorter .
But power consumption equals heat and that 's what really matters to me : if the CPU load in my MacBook cranks up then it gets hot , and that causes the fan to spin up like a jet on the runway , which defeats the purpose of having a nice little notebook that I can bring places .
I can't edit music tracks with a roaring fan like that , and it's not something I 'd want next to me on the plane or one table over at the coffee shop .
Of course it does n't loudly whine like that most of the time , only when doing something that pushes the system hard .
What matters in 2010 is optimizing for fan noise .
If you 're not buying this , take a look at Apple 's stats about power consumption and thermal output of iMacs ( which , remember , are systems where the CPU and fan are right there on your desk in the same enclosure as the monitor ) .
There 's a big difference in power consumption , and corresponding heat generated , between a CPU idling and at max load .
That means it 's the programs you are running which are directly responsible for both length of battery charge and how loudly the fan spins .
Obvious ?
Perhaps , but this is something that did n't occur with most popular 8 - bit and 16 - bit processors , because those chips never idled .
They always ran flat - out all the time , even if just in a busy loop waiting for interrupts to hit .
With the iMacs , there 's a trend toward the difference between idle and max load increasing as the clock speed of the processor increases .
The worst case is the early 2009 24 - inch iMac : 387.3 BTU /h at idle , 710.3 BTU / h at max load , for a difference of 323 BTU /h.
( For comparison , that difference is larger than the entire maximum thermal output of the 20 - inch iMac CPU : 298.5 BTU /h. )
The utmost in processing speed , which once was the goal , now has a price associated with it .
At the same time that manufacturers cite impressive benchmark numbers , there 's also the implicit assumption that you do n't really want to hit those numbers in the everyday use of a mobile computer .
Get all those cores going all the time , including the vector floating point units , and you get rewarded with forty minutes of use on a full battery charge with the fan whooshing the whole time .
And if you optimize your code purely for speed , you 're getting what you asked for .
Realistically , is there anything you can do ?
Yes , but it means you have to break free from the mindset that all of a computer 's power is there for the taking .
Doubling the speed of a program by moving from one to four cores is a win if you 're looking at the raw benchmark numbers , but an overall loss in terms of computation per watt .
Ideas that sounded good in the days of CPU cycles being a free resource , such as anticipating a time - consuming task that the user might request and starting it in the background , are now questionable features .
Ditto for persistent unnecessary animations .
Nanoseconds are abstract .
The sound waves generated by poorly designed applications are not .

The plucky master of Mars , the Spirit Rover , is hopelessly stuck in a sand trap .
NASA scientists made the announcement in Washington , but made sure to say that the mission is still not over .
“ Spirit is not dead ; it has just entered another phase of its long life , ” said Doug McCuistion , director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ We told the world last year that attempts to set the beloved robot free may not be successful .
It looks like Spirit ’s current location on Mars will be its final resting place . ”
Designed for a 90 - day mission , the Spirit Rover has been on borrowed time for more than five years already .
And still , the rover keeps on working .
Now the Spirit will study how Martian winds affect sand particles and study nearby soil , giving clues to Mar ’s past and the future of mars missions .

BBC Persian Television is one of the channels being jammed by Iran Three major international broadcasters have strongly condemned Iran for its " deliberate electronic interference " in their broadcasts .
The BBC , Deutsche Welle and Voice of America said the jamming began on Thursday as Iran marked the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution .
They said Iran was broadcasting freely around the world while denying its own people programmes coming from outside .
Earlier , the US accused Iran of using a " near - total information blockade " .
A state department spokesman said there were strong indications that the telephone network had been taken down , SMS messages blocked , and internet communication " throttled " .
" Iran has attempted a near total information blockade , " PJ Crowley said .
We will not stop broadcasting accurate and impartial news and current affairs into Iran
Joint statement by the BBC , Deutsche Welle and Voice of America
In pictures : Iran revolution rallies Iran claims uranium 20 % milestone John Leyne on cyber wars " It is clear that the Iranian government fears its own people . "
White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs meanwhile said that the web giant , Google , and other internet service providers had been " unplugged " in Iran .
Reporters Without Borders says the blocking of Google 's Gmail e-mail system takes the drive to control cyber - space to a new stage .
But the organisation claims that most Iranian internet users know how to sidestep censorship and access blocked websites .
Correspondents say a number of governments - notably China and Burma , as well as Iran - make strenuous efforts to block modern internet communications among their opponents .
' Accurate and impartial '
The BBC , Deutsche Welle and Voice of America said the Iranian authorities ' jamming was affecting services on the Hotbird satellite , which covers audiences across Europe and the Middle East .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a rally Iran was now a " nuclear state "
These include BBC Persian Television , the Voice of America Television Channel in Persian and Radio Farda ; and Deutsche Welle 's Television and Radio services .
BBC World News - the English - language channel - was also jammed .
" We condemn any jamming of these channels .
It contravenes international agreements and is interfering with the free and open flow of international transmissions that are protected by international treaties , " the broadcasters said in a joint statement .
" The Iranian authorities are using the same satellite services to broadcast freely around the world including broadcasts in English and Arabic ; at the same time they are denying their own people programmes coming from the same satellites from the rest of the world , " they added .

On Thursday , a day - long security clampdown in the Iranian capital Tehran succeeded in preventing large - scale opposition protests as the nation commemorated the Islamic Revolution .
The opposition turnout was dwarfed by huge crowds at the state - run celebrations in the centre of Tehran .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed the rally , saying Iran was now a " nuclear state " and had produced its first stock of 20 % enriched uranium .
But the White House said the assertion was based more on politics than science .

The Bank said further cash injections could lead to asset bubbles The Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted unanimously not to pump more money into the economy this month , meeting notes have shown .
The decision brought to an end , for now at least , the Bank's £ 200 bn quantitative easing ( QE ) programme designed to stimulate the economy .
MPC members felt that further cash injections could lead to asset bubbles .
The committee members were also unanimous in their decision to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5 % .
" All members felt that the arguments in favour of leaving the size of the asset purchase programme unchanged at this meeting were more persuasive .
But for some members , the arguments were finely balanced , " the meeting 's minutes said .
Inflation forecasts
The Bank has said that it could restart the programme should economic conditions not improve sufficiently .
Under QE , the Bank pumped new money into the economy by buying assets , such as government bonds , in an attempt to boost lending by commercial banks .
The arguments in favour of continuing the QE programme included February 's Inflation Report projection which indicated that consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation was " more likely " to be below its 2 % target for much of the three - year forecast period .
However , the argument cited in the minutes for leaving the QE programme on pause also used the Inflation Report , saying said that the projection " did not imply an overwhelming risk " of inflation being below the target for the next three years .
Figures released on Tuesday showed UK CPI inflation rose to an annual rate of 3.5 % in January , up from 2.9 % the month before .
As the figure was more than one percentage point above the 2 % target , this triggered a letter of explanation from Bank of England governor Mervyn King to the chancellor .

HP Labs researcher Peter Hartwell holds a prototype vibration and movement sensor , a super - sensitive inertial accelerometer .
The first to be deployed as part of HP Labs ’ Central Nervous System for Earth ( CeNSE ) , it is about 1,000 times more sensitive than today ’s mass - produced devices .

Just days after Cisco signaled it will horn into IBM ’s turf by rewiring an aging city in Massachusetts , Hewlett Packard announced this morning the first commercial application of its own holistic blueprint –the torturously acronymed “ CeNSE ” ( short for Central Nervous System for the Earth ) .
Much like IBM ’s “ Smarter Planet ” campaign , HP proposes sticking billions of sensors on everything in sight and boiling down the resulting flood of data into insights for making the world a better , greener place .
But what sets HP apart from its rivals is its determination to create a smarter planet almost entirely within house , from sensors of its own design and manufacture to servers to software to the consultants who will tie it all together .
And its first customer could not be less green : Shell Oil .
The world ’s best seller of PCs and its biggest oil company will collaborate on a wireless sensor network to aid in oil exploration .
In the system they imagine , sensors like the one seen above will be laid on the ground at regular intervals across hundreds of square miles , listening for sound waves bounced through miles of sub-strata and hopefully pockets of oil .
This seismic data will be uploaded to HP - supplied servers and processed by Shell ’s proprietary software to map the subterranean lay of the land .
“ The current state of the art is n’t good enough , and certainly is not what we want it to be , ” said Wim Walk , manager of novel geophysical technologies for Shell .
“ We hope to really make a leap forward in quality .
This project is designed to gain a competitive advantage for us onshore . ”
Walk declined to quantify what that advantage will be ( and financial terms were not disclosed ) , although HP Labs director Prith Bannerjee boasted that his team ’s sensors , unveiled in November , “ are a thousand times more sensitive ” than the accelerometers in current models .
Better instruments equals better images , which translates to drilling fewer exploratory wells and recovering every last drop from existing ones , thus driving down the cost of production .
Building a better sensor is one thing ; building one that ’s good enough and cheap enough at scale is another .
So - cheap - as - to - be - free sensors are at the heart of every vision for smarter cities , which also go by the names of “ ubiquitous computing ” or “ the Internet of Things . ”
While Moore ’s Law has been doing its thing for more than a decade now , shrinking both the size of sensors and their cost , they have yet to reach the tipping point of mass adoption .
HP is taking the matter into its own hands with plans to embed up to a trillion tiny sensors worldwide over the next decade .
It has one advantage its rivals do not : it is already the world ’s largest producer and consumer of micro-electro - mechanical systems ( MEMS ) , which are embedded in millions of its inkjet printers .
For Shell , HP will produce its own MEMS sensors at the Corvallis , Oregon plant of its Imaging and Printing Group .
One of the project ’s goals is to achieve the economies of scale which have so far eluded other manufacturers like Texas Instruments .
Unlike IBM , which has positioned itself as primarily a smarter city integrator , or Cisco , which has teamed up with 3 M and United Technologies to handle nitty - gritty tasks while it focuses on the network , HP appears determined to fulfill its CeNSE vision from soup - to - nuts .
The Shell deal not only includes sensors designed by HP Labs and fabricated by its printing group , but also HP ’s own networking , storage , servers , and software products , overseen by consultants from its Enterprise Services arm ( formerly EDS ) .
“ The whole world of IT is shifting into a world of plants , pipettes , and forests , and not just the back office , ” said Jeff Wacker , the leader of services innovation at HP and the head of its efforts to commercialize CeNSE .
A simple question posed to Norweigan skiier Odd- Bjørn Hjelmeset about his silver medal in the men's 4x10 relay somehow led to a spectacular response , covering porn , Tiger woods , and brutal honesty .

VANOC 's media relations people have been releasing a torrent of quotes throughout the games .
Most are banal .
Some are colorful .
Then there 's this one , buried far too low in Sports Illustrated 's daily briefing , excerpted in its entirety .
My name is Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset .
I skied the second lap and I fucked up today .
I think I have seen too much porn in the last 14 days .
I have the room next to Petter Northug and every day there is noise in there .
So I think that is the reason I fucked up .
By the way , Tiger Woods is a really good man .

I think we have our indelible image of the games : a Norweigan cross country skiier , watching Tiger Woods - themed porn while his neighbor makes a racket .
Let us begin composing poems and building statues to the glory that is Odd- Bjørn Hjelmeset .
First , I will show you the screen shot
The screen of vim is divide into two sub windows , the top one can display the code and the bottom one shows the variable you want to watch .
Well , this can be changed by you , you can split the window any way you like .
You can use C - B to make a break , and press R to run your program , and press S to step , and C - J to add the variable you want to watch .
You can download clewn here :
How to install : first of all , you should have your gvim installed ,
sudo apt - get install vim- gnome
as well as gdb
And then download the source file of clewn ; note here , not vimgdb .
And extract the file , then use your terminal to enter the clewn folder
. / configure make sudo make install
Note here , may be some one will be suffered from the dependency problem during their installing .
If your machine tell you that you need readline , then install libreadline5 - dev
sudo apt - get install libreadline5- dev
And then , copy some files to ~/.vim you can refer my folder :
cp /usr/local/ share/vim/vimfiles/clewn.vim ~/.vim/plugin/ cp /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles/doc/clewn.txt
~/.vim/doc / cp /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles/macros/clewn_mappings.vim ~/.vim/ macros/ cp /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles/syntax/gdbvar.vim
~/.vim/syntax /
Then , every thing is done .
You can write a small program to test .
# include int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int i ; int s ; s = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i ) { s = s + 1 ; } }
Save it as test .c , for example .
And then ,
gcc - g -o test test.c
If everything is right during compiling , then
clewn - va test.c
Then , gdb is opened on your terminal , and your gvim is opened at the same time Cool down now ; input the following on your terminal ( gdb ) :
file test
Now , you can debug your program on gvim .
For example , you can click the line you want to set break point .
And then press CTRL+B , then , break point is set .
SHIFT+r （that is capital R）It will run and stop at your break point SHIFT+s （that is capital S）It will step
And watch your variable , input following on gvim
: split
Then the window will be split , and then click the variable you want to watch , and press C+J , then you can see the variable appears in another window .
To do this , you also can input the following on your terminal ( gdb )
createvar yourvar
“ youvar ” represents the variable you want to watch .
Following is the default shortcuts
List of default key mappings :
CTRL-Z send an interrupt to GDB and the program it is running B info breakpoints L info locals A info args S step I stepi CTRL - N next : next source line , skipping all function calls X nexti F finish R run Q quit C continue W where CTRL - U up : go up one frame CTRL - D down : go down one frame cursor position : ~ CTRL - B set a breakpoint on the line where the cursor is located CTRL - E clear all breakpoints on the line where the cursor is located mouse pointer position : ~ CTRL - P print the value of the variable defined by the mouse pointer position CTRL - X print the value that is referenced by the address whose value is that of the variable defined by the mouse pointer position CTRL -K set a breakpoint at assembly address shown by mouse position CTRL - H clear a breakpoint at assembly address shown by mouse position CTRL - J add the selected variable at mouse position to the watched variables window
This is referred the official document , which is available here
Hope this will help you somewhat .

Both Barack Obama and I are Chicago boys , schooled in the tough - minded , arm - twisting do n't - mess - with - me attitude of crushing rather than compromising with your unforgiving enemies .
We are both products of machine politics , I from the west side 's " rotten borough " 24th ward loyally turning out Democratic party majorities of almost , and sometimes exceeding , 100 % ( " Vote early , vote often ! " ) , and Barack from a south side community - organising operation that got things done door - to - door , block by block .
In the 2008 election campaign President Obama 's most important strategist was the Chicago fixer David Axelrod , a master of hard - knuckle progressive neighbourhood politics who had masterminded the re-election campaign of Chicago 's first African American mayor Harold Washington .
But after Obama 's inauguration the new president appears to have muzzled Axelrod in favour of Rahm Emanuel , a ferociously combative , rightwing Democratic political assassin .
The enforcer Emanuel has so far failed to enforce much of anything for Obama by way of decent legislation , and Axelrod is sidelined except as a mouthpiece .
No wonder that at home on my desk is a manila folder file labelled OBAMA BETRAYALS OF CAMPAIGN PLEDGES , so full it 's bursting apart .
I was about to start a fresh new file of his latest missteps when suddenly I caught myself .
Hey , wait a minute , I 'm falling into the same old tired habit of reflexive negativity honed in the Bush years .
Howard Zinn , the historian - activist who before his recent death was probably the wisest mind on the US left , told us he was not disappointed in Obama because he never expected much in the absence of a national movement to push him in a good direction .
Zinn – a lifelong student of the American abolitionist , labour , civil rights , feminist and gay rights movements – preached that real change " will have to work its way from the bottom up " .
Alas , we at the " bottom " have not really been there for Obama to fight for his ear , which currently belongs to Wall Street .
Franklin Roosevelt , the president we hoped that Obama would be like , had a huge advantage over our new president .
At FDR 's disposal were powerful mass movements – Huey Long 's " Share the Wealth " , Father Coughlin 's radical racist anti-capitalist broadcasts , the elderly Townsend Clubs , the veterans ' bonus marchers and militant labour unions with their sit - down strikes – that were an effective threat , a countervailing force to rich rightwingers eager to destroy the New Deal .
FDR 's good angel , his wife Eleanor , constantly reported to him about just how bad it was in the real world of the Great Depression .
But Roosevelt told Eleanor and anyone else who came to him with demands for progressive change : " OK , you 've convinced me .
Now go out and put pressure on me . "
That 's where we 've let Obama down .
We on the American left – in a dysfunctional marriage with a bought - and - paid - for Democratic party , tamed by leechlike dependence on " non-profit " liberal foundations themselves funded by corporations , a women 's movement obsessed by the abortion issue , a gay movement fixed on gay marriage – simply are n't up to the job .
We have not backed up Obama with a serious antiwar movement ( there is n't any ) , and our Big Labour is too weak to fight for itself , let alone for the rest of us .
Grassroots activism still exists , but during the 2008 presidential campaign we slipped into the habit of allowing ourselves to be used purely as fundraising vehicles .
Fundraising is no substitute for hell raising , as the Palin- loving Tea Baggers and Town Hallers are teaching us .
Obama came into office with a mandate for change .
That should have been our signal not to sit back and wait for him to deliver but to mobilise to make sure he followed through .
Instead , we relaxed our " Chicago muscle " , the hard volunteer work that elected him .
And I started my self - satisfying , ultimately pointless OBAMA BETRAYAL file .
Last week in America 's northwest , Oregon voters , who are traditionally anti-tax - increase , showed how Chicago muscle works .
Against fierce opposition led by Nike and other big businesses , they delivered a huge progressive victory by approving tax - raising measures on the wealthy and corporations .
They did it the low - tech way , slogging door to door , volunteers from an improvised coalition of unions , community groups and small businesses , working together to overcome a well - funded rightwing scare campaign .
Sooner or later we on the American left will rise again and look beyond single - issue obsessions , sever our dependence on corporate charity , and – as FDR and Howard Zinn advised – relearn the lesson of how to apply pressure on a president who needs us more than we need him .
Barack Obama speaks at the health care summit .
The summit stalemate
President Barack Obama called on Democrats and Republicans to find a health care compromise in the next few weeks that has eluded them for a year — but made it clear that he ’s prepared to short - circuit Senate rules to get reform passed if they fail .
“ The question that I ’m going to ask myself , and I ’m going to ask of all of you , is , is there enough serious effort that in a month ’s time , or in a few weeks time , or six weeks time , we could actually resolve something , ” Obama said to close the seven - hour health care summit .
“ And if we ca n’t then I think we ’ve got to go ahead and make some decisions . ”

But within minutes of Obama ’s remark , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear that he did n’t envision negotiations with the Republicans that could stretch well into April .
" That 's the president 's timeline , not mine , " Reid told POLITICO .
Still , the president ’s comments seemed to suggest he was open to yet another new timetable for health care after a year of fits and starts among the Democrats party that left them short of final votes in the House and Senate .
And in fact , his remark threatened to throw off what had been an unofficial Democratic timetable to move ahead with the reconciliation process as early as next week – an effort that needs only 51 votes to pass health reform in the Senate .
Beyond a sometimes emotional closing statement from the president on the need for reform . , Obama also made clear he could n’t sign on to the Republican plan for reform , would n’t abandon reconciliation and had no intention of scrapping his plan – capping the seven - plus - hour session with a dig at Republicans for pitching a bill that covers just a fraction of the uninsured .
Republicans said the same thing in their closing comments that they said at 10 a.m. – start over .
Obama wo n’t .
So the parties walked out of Blair House almost exactly the way they walked in – completely at odds over the best way to fix the health insurance system .
There were modest efforts around the edges to find common ground – on reining in waste and fraud and keeping the deficit in check – but no broad agreements on the shape of reform .
The day - long session had flashes of gripping political theater , rival parties laying bare their philosophical differences on a critical issue with TV cameras rolling .
At one point , Obama sparred with his ex-presidential rival John McCain .
“ We ’re not campaigning anymore , John , ” Obama said .
“ The election is over now . ”
“ I ’m reminded of that every day , ” McCain replied .
Obama replied , “ We can spend the remainder of the time with our respective talking points , but we ’re supposed to be talking about insurance . ”
Other times , it had all the excitement of a legislative markup – 40 politicians in a room , all who had to have their turn to talk , on a topic where the fierceness of the exchanges was muted by the hyper - technical nature of the debate .
Obama and House Republicans leader John Boehner sparred near the end of the event , as Boehner offered an impassioned defense of the House Republican plan , which would cover 3 million of the uninsured .
Pushing the president to start over on health care , Boehner tried to pin Obama down :
" Why ca n't we agree on those insurance reforms that we 've talked about ?
Why can't we come to an agreement on purchasing across state lines ?
Why can't we do something about the biggest cost driver , which is medical malpractice and the defensive medicine that doctors practice ?
Let 's start with a clean sheet of paper where we can actually get somewhere and we can get it into law here in the next several months , " Boehner said .
Obama shot back that the Democratic bill covers more than 30 million Americans .
" John , you know , the challenge I have here , and this has happened eriodically , is every so often we have a pretty good conversation trying to get on some specifics and then we go back to the standard talking points that Democrats and Republicans have had for the last year and that does n't drive us to an agreement on issues . "
By day ’s end , both sides were using closing remarks to reinforce the points they started out with .
“ They have rendered a judgment about what we have intended to do so far , the solution to that is to put that on the shelf and start over with a blank piece of paper to see what we could agree on , ” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used her closing comments to say that the bill does n’t provide federal funding for abortions .
“ The misrepresentation campaign that ’s gone on about the bill , it ’s amazing that anyone would support it , ” Pelosi said .
But even as early as the lunch break , it was growing clearer that the pre-summit pessimism on both sides – that there was little to no hope of grand bipartisan compromise – was on target .
In fact , both sides spent part of the first three hours of the session trying to score tactical points , rarely veering from their scripts to extend a hand to the other side .
By the afternoon , however , both sides took a more substantive approach that played to the Republicans ’ benefit , given Democratic attempts to portray them as unreasonable and partisan .
The turn left Democrats anxious for the more McCain - Obama moments .
Obama , who called the summit as a last - ditch effort to resuscitate his stalled reform effort , left no illusion that bipartisan comity would be easy to come by , after a year of bitter sparring between the parties on the Democratic plan .
“ I do n’t know that these gaps can be bridged , ” he said , echoing the feeling of most people on both sides of the issue .
Yet Democrats struggled to do what they were succeeding at what they set out to do --
Obama did on several occasions argue that his bill included a variety of provisions that Republicans should be eager to endorse , saying he adopted the Republican plan to cut waste and fraud in the Medicare system in whole .
“ Every idea about fraud and abuse , we ’ve adopted in our legislation , ” Obama said .
But he also tried to call out the Republicans when they fell back on their usual tactics , noting at one point that Minority Whip Eric Cantor had a six - inch - high stack of papers in front of him .
“ Let me just guess , that ’s the 2400 page Democratic bill , ” Obama said before Cantor started speaking .
“ These are the kinds of political things we do that prevent us from actually having a conversation . ”
Still , it took less than an hour for Democrats and Republicans to spar , clashing over who had the better ideas for reform and how it should be sent through the Congress .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , in the Republican opening remarks , urged Obama and congressional Democrats to reject using reconciliation to pass part of the health care reform bill , arguing it is a rarely - used process that ’s inappropriate for such sweeping legislation .
“ We will have to renounce jamming this through in a partisan way , ” Alexander said .
“ If we do n’t , the rest of what we will do today will not be relevant . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gave a combative retort , saying Republicans talk about reconciliation as if it ’s unusual , when in fact GOP majorities have used it more often than Democrats .
“ It ’s as if there is a different mindset , a different set of facts than reality , ” Reid said .
Obama was more measured , but the message was clear – he has no intention of taking reconciliation off the table .
“ Rather than start at the outset talking about legislative process , what I suggest is we talk about the substance and how we might help the American people deal with costs , coverage , insurance , these other issues , ” Obama said .
“ We might surprise ourselves and find out that we agree more than we disagree and that may help dictate how we move forward .
It might turn out that we have too big of a gulf . ”
After the contentious opening remarks , the conversation settled largely into a more wonky debate over controlling health care costs .
Democrats offered anecdotes on why health care reform is needed now , while Republicans pointed out critical statements by the Congressional Budget Office and others on the Democratic health care plan .
By an hour into the summit , only six out of the more than 40 lawmakers and top administration officials present had spoken .
And in fact , even the time allocation gave the two parties something to disagree on , with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) pointing out at around 11:45 a.m. that Republicans has 24 minutes to talk , while Democrats had 52 minutes .
“ We ’re going to have to be a little more disciplined in our time , ” Obama nudged lawmakers from both parties , each of whom spoke for about 10 minutes .
Obama acknowledged being guilty himself , but added light - heartedly that he could do it “ because I am the president . ”
Democrats went into the summit wanting to show that there were many areas of agreement with Republicans – a target that congressional aides said they felt satisfied the president was hitting .
Republican aides , however , said the focus on policy agreements reinforced their goal of showing the GOP is reasonable and open to reform .
But with the large number of people around the table in Blair House , the summit lacked the kind of free - wielding exchange that would allow both parties to score more rhetorical points .
Each lawmaker tried to give what amounted to an opening statement on their first go - around , usually speaking for more than 10 minutes a piece .
Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) spoke for the first time at 3:45 p.m .
In an another testy exchange , Obama disagreed with Alexander ’s statement that the CBO had concluded that Democratic reforms will raise premiums , saying that " is just not the case . "
" No , no , no , no , no , " Obama responded .
" This is an example of where we 've got to get our facts straight .
Let me respond to what you just said .
Because it 's not factually accurate . "
He said costs for families would go down , and that the CBO says families might choose to buy better coverage that would be more expensive .
" They did n't say the actual premiums would be going up , " he said .
“ With respect , you ’re wrong , ” Alexander said .
Obama replies : " I 'm pretty certain I 'm not wrong .
... I promise you we 'll get this settled before the day 's out . "
The CBO found that premiums would be reduced for some policyholders , while others would see increases , depending on whether they buy insurance on the individual or group market .
But the reason why some people would see their costs rise is because they would choose to buy more comprehensive insurance plans that would inevitably be more expensive .
Right from the start , Republicans hammered their central theme : the president and lawmakers have to start over .
“ We have to start by putting the current bill on the shelf and starting with a clean sheet of paper , ” Alexander said , as Obama looked on and jotted down some notes .
He also pushed back on the White House notion of a comprehensive bill – “ we do n’t do comprehensive well .
Our country is too big , too complicated for Washington to write all the rules . ”
The American people “ have tried to say in every way they know how , that they opposed the health care that passed the senate on Christmas Eve , and more important , we want to talk about , we think we have a better idea , and that is to take many of the examples you ’ve just mentioned about reducing health care costs , . . . and start over , and let ’s go step by step through that goal , ” Alexander said .
Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) was the first Democrat to reject the call .
Struggling families , she said , " do n’t have time for us to start over .
Many of them are at the end of the line with their insurance . ”

The Pole ’s helmet is now painted in yellow and black colours to match Renault ’s livery .
New team mate Vitaly Petrov also showed off his helmet design at Renault ’s launch today .
He will use a design much the same as the one he had in GP2 last year , with ‘ Russia ’ emblazoned across the top of his visor .

Preface for Naked Capitalism readers :
This is on - topic because torture is bad for the economy .
As I have pointed out periodically since 2005 :
As Robert Parry – the reporter who broke the Iran - Contra story for the Associated Press and Newsweek – pointed out last week :
Cheney pronounced himself “ a big supporter of waterboarding , ” a near - drowning technique that has been regarded as torture back to the Spanish Inquisition and that has long been treated by U.S. authorities as a serious war crime , such as when Japanese commanders were prosecuted for using it on American prisoners during World War II …
He answered with an emphatic “ yes ” when asked if he had opposed the Bush administration ’s decision to suspend the use of waterboarding – after it was employed against three “ high - value detainees ” sometimes in repetitive sequences .
He added that waterboarding should still be “ on the table ” today …
Speaking with a sense of impunity , he casually negated a key line of defense that senior Bush officials had hidden behind for years – that the brutal interrogations were approved by independent Justice Department legal experts who thus gave the administration a legitimate reason to believe the actions were within the law .
However , on Sunday , Cheney acknowledged that the White House had told the Justice Department lawyers what legal opinions to render .
In other words , the opinions amounted to ordered - up lawyering to permit the administration to do whatever it wanted .
This is not entirely surprising .
In 2005 , e-mails revealed that Cheney pressured the U.S. Department of Justice to approve torture :
Dick Cheney and his lawyer , David Addington , pressured the Department of Justice in 2005 to quickly approve a torture memo that authorized CIA interrogators to use a combination of barbaric techniques during interrogations of “ high - value ” detainees , despite protests from former Deputy Attorney General James Comey , according to several of his e-mails released over the weekend .
Indeed , Cheney is the main guy who pushed for torture in the first place .
Cheney is also the guy who made the pitch to Congress justifying torture .
A former director of the CIA accused Cheney of overseeing American torture policies .
And Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff stated that Dick Cheney is guilty of war crimes for his role in facilitating torture .
Under any definition , Cheney ordered torture , knew about it , and failed to take steps to stop it .
Therefore , beyond any shadow of a doubt , Cheney has violated The War Crimes Act of 1996 .
Cheney is a Fugitive
As I wrote in 2005 :
18 U.S.C. § 2441 has no statute of limitations , which means that a war crimes complaint can be filed at any time .
The penalty may be life imprisonment or — if a single prisoner dies due to torture — death .
Given that there are numerous , documented cases of prisoners being tortured to death by U.S. soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan ( see for example this report ) , that means that the death penalty would be appropriate for anyone found guilty of carrying out , ordering , or sanctioning such conduct .
That means that Cheney could be rounded up as a fugitive as long as he is alive , just like those old Nazis you see on the news .
Meanwhile , Back In The Real World …
The mainstream media has repeatedly interviewed Cheney and let him say that torture works without challenging him with tough questions .
That ’s no different than interviewing Charles Manson and letting him argue – without challenge – that murder is a great thing .
In the real world – unlike in Cheney ’s bizarro parallel universe :
Torture actually reduces our national security
Most of those tortured were innocent
Torture has been used throughout history as a form of intimidation , to terrorize people into obedience , not for gathering information
The type of torture used by the U.S. in the last 10 years is of a special type .
Senator Levin revealed that the U.S. used torture techniques aimed at extracting false confessions ( see this , this , this , this .
and this )
The United States of Torture
Unfortunately , Cheney is not alone .
An FBI email declassified in December 2004 states that Bush signed an Executive Order authorizing torture ( here is the list of documents obtained through a freedom of information act request , and take a close look , for example , at this one , which mentions the “ executive order ” ) .
An expert on Constitutional law said that only Bush could have authorized the torture which has occurred .
The general in charge of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq said that Donald Rumsfeld and other top administration officials ordered that inhuman treatment and torture be conducted as part of a deliberate strategy .
Pulitzer prize - winning Seymour Hersch agrees .
And torture is apparently still continuing under Obama .
By failing to demand that torture stop and those who ordered it – like Cheney – be held to account , Americans are complicit in war crimes , just like the Germans who failed to stand up to Hitler were complicit in crimes against humanity .

Exchange rate indexation of loans is illegal in Iceland and this also applies to domestic loans , according to a new court ruling that could have major consequences .
Exchange rate indexation of loans means that the total amount owed in Icelandic kronur varies according to its exchange rate against the currencies in which the loan was issued .
Such loans were aggressively promoted by the Icelandic banks in previous years and have now left many diligent car and home owners with bigger debts than the original amount – despite paying their bills every month .
Now the Reykjavik District Court has ruled that such loans are illegal – a ruling which directly contradicts a ruling in the same court in December , RUV reported .
According to the legal precedent , courts may now start ordering that exchange rate indexed loans be turned into regular inflation indexed loans denominated in Icelandic kronur .
The whole issue rests on a slight loophole , as exchange rate indexation is indeed illegal ; but it is not illegal to lend in foreign currencies and then secure repayments in those currencies or in Icelandic kronur .
But it is illegal to lend in Icelandic kronur and secure repayments pegged to the exchange rate of foreign currencies .
Customers taking out ‘ foreign currency loans ’ in Icelandic banks to buy homes and cars in Iceland were given their money in Icelandic kronur .
The court has now ruled that this was illegal .

That 's it !
Cheer !!
By Robert Barr Smith
It was May 1940 , and the German officer ’s unit was attacking toward a village called l’Epinette , near Bethune , France .
Five of his soldiers took cover behind a farmyard wall , sheltered from the fire of British rearguards covering the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force to the English Channel .
Without warning , one German crumpled , the feathered tip of an arrow sticking out of his chest .
From a small farm building on their flank , rifle - fire tore into the others .
While he may have known that his enemy was soldiers of the Manchester Regiment , the German leader could not have known that they were led by the formidable Captain “ Mad ” Jack Churchill .
It was Churchill ’s own arrow that skewered the luckless German , while his men ’s rifles accounted for the rest .
However deadly , bows and arrows were surely anachronisms in modern war .
They were formidable soldiers and always had been , precisely the sort of men Jack Churchill was cut out to lead .
But then , so was the bowman .
John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill — known as “ Jack Churchill ” to his friends , and later “ Mad Jack Churchill ” or “ Fighting Jack ” — was a professional soldier , son of an old Oxfordshire family .
Born in Hong Kong , Churchill graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in 1926 and was commissioned in the Manchesters , a storied regiment with battle honors dating back to the 18th century .
The regiment had been raised as the 63rd and 96th Regiments of Foot and had shed their blood for Britain all across the world .
Forty - two battalions of Manchesters served in World War I alone .
Jack Churchill ’s younger brother , Tom , also became a Manchesters officer , and in time would rise to major general , retiring in 1962 .
His younger brother , called Buster , opted for the Royal Navy ’s Fleet Air Arm and died for his country off Malta during the fierce fighting of Operation Pedestal .
That Churchill was a free spirit was obvious from the beginning of his service , even in an army rich in such men .
For example , while serving in Burma before the outbreak of World War II , he attended a course in signals at Poona in India .
It might appear odd to some that Churchill took his motorcycle all the way from Rangoon to Poona , but it did not seem at all remarkable , at least to Churchill , to return the 1,500 miles from Poona to Calcutta — whence he was to take a ship for Rangoon — riding his bike .
Along the way he lost a contest with a large and hostile water buffalo but returned to his unit in time to serve in the Burma Rebellion of 1930 - 32 .
“ Mad Jack Churchill ” Was Always the Daredevil
Unusual hazards and difficulties never meant much to Jack Churchill .
On the same motorcycle he had traveled the 500 miles through Burma from Maymyo to Rangoon , a trip substantially complicated by an absence of roads .
He therefore followed the railroad line , crossing the dozens of watercourses by pushing the bike along a rail while he walked on the crossties .
Everything in life was a challenge to him .
Included in the challenges to which he rose was mastering the bagpipe , a peculiar attachment for an Englishman .
His love affair with the pipes seems to have originated in Maymyo , where he studied under the pipe major of the Cameron Highlanders .
Back in England in 1932 , Churchill kept on studying the pipes , but the peacetime army had begun to pale .
Churchill was one of those unusual men designed to lead others in combat , and such men are often restless in time of peace .
And perhaps , as his biographer commented , “ certain eccentricities — brought on no doubt through frustration — such as piping the orderly officer to the Guard Room at three o’clock of a morning , and studying the wrong pre-set campaign in preparation for his promotion exam , precluded any chance of promotion for the time being and made the break , after a chat with his commanding officer , inevitable . ”
When Churchill managed to get himself reprimanded for using a hot water bottle , a distinctly non-military piece of equipment , he circumvented this nicety of military protocol by substituting a piece of rubber tubing , which he filled from the nearest hot water tap .
And then there was the day on which he appeared on parade carrying an umbrella , a mortal sin in any army .
When asked by the battalion adjutant what he meant by such outlandish behavior , Churchill replied “ because it ’s raining , sir , ” an answer not calculated to endear him to the frozen soul of any battalion adjutant .
Whatever the reason , after 10 years of service , Churchill resigned his commission and turned to commercial ventures .
A job on the editorial staff of a Nairobi paper did not please him , and so he turned to other tasks .
Among other things , he worked as a model in magazine ads and as a movie extra .
He appeared in The Drum , a movie of fighting on the Northwest Frontier in which he could play the bagpipes .
And because he had rowed on the River Isis , he won a cameo in A Yank At Oxford , in which he pulled the bow oar in the Oxford shell , with movie star Robert Taylor at stroke .
Meanwhile , he continued his piping and in the summer of 1938 placed second in the officers ’ class of the piping championships at Aldershot .
It was an extraordinary feat , since he was the only Englishman among the seventy or so competitors .
During these years out of harness , Churchill practiced another skill as well — archery .
He had first tried it only after returning to Britain from Burma .
His expertise with the bow got him work in Sabu and The Thief of Baghdad .
And with typical “ Mad Jack ” determination , he became so good with the bow that he shot for Britain at the world championships in Oslo in 1939 .
“ Back in my Red Coat ” : Churchill Volunteers to Join the Finns
By then , however , the long ugly shadows of war were stretching across Europe .
As the German Army smashed into Poland , Jack Churchill returned to the British Army and the Manchester Regiment , and was shipped off to France .
“ I was , ” he said later , “ back in my red coat ; the country having got into a jam in my absence . ”
He was obviously happy to be soldiering again .
Patrolling a quiet stretch of France during the pre-blitz “ sitzkrieg ” of late 1939 and early 1940 did not suit a man of Churchill ’s warlike temperament .
And so , along with a bevy of other free spirits , including the fabulous Mike Calvert , he volunteered for the force assembling to help the Finnish Army , then under attack by the Soviet Red Army .
That expedition was canceled before it could leave for Finland , and Churchill returned to the Manchesters in time to meet the German juggernaut as it crashed into Holland , Belgium , and France in May 1940 .
By that time , Churchill was second in command of an infantry company in the regiment ’s second battalion .
During the BEF ’s fighting retreat , Churchill remained aggressive , unwilling to give up a yard of ground while extracting the maximum cost from the enemy .
He was especially fond of raids and counterattacks , leading small groups of picked soldiers against the advancing Germans .
He presented a strange , almost medieval figure at the head of his men , carrying not only his war bow and arrows , but his sword as well .
Jack Churchill : World War II Warrior
As befitted his love of things Scottish , Jack Churchill carried the basket - hilted claymore ( technically a claybeg , the true claymore being an enormous two - handed sword ) .
Later on , asked by a general who awarded him a decoration why he carried a sword in action , Churchill is said to have answered : “ In my opinion , sir , any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed . ”
The war - diary of 4th Infantry Brigade , to which Churchill ’s battalion belonged , commented on this extraordinary figure .
“ One of the most reassuring sights of the embarkation [ from Dunkirk ] was the sight of Captain Churchill passing down the beach with his bows and arrows .
His high example and his great work … were a great help to the 4th Infantry Brigade . ”
During the retreat , Churchill took command of his company when his company commander was wounded , and it was during this fighting that he spitted his hapless German soldier with , as the chronicles of Henry V’s wars would put it , “ a cloth - yard shaft . ”
One of his brother officers , an old friend , saw him about that time chugging across the Flanders plain on a small motorcycle , his bow tied to the frame , arrows sticking out of one of the panniers on the back , a German officer ’s cap hanging on the headlight .
“ Ah ! ” said Churchill , spotting his friend , “ Hullo Clark !
Got anything to drink ? ”
Once Churchill had dismounted , his friend noticed dried blood smeared across one ear and asked Churchill about the injury .
German machine gun , said Churchill casually .
His men had shouted at him to run but , he said , he was simply too tired .
He won his first Military Cross during the retreat to the Channel , when he hitched six trucks together to salvage a disabled British tank ; although in the end he could not save the tank , he did rescue a wounded British officer .
His close call did not seem to impress Churchill in the least .
Then and afterward , he seemed to be one of those extraordinary men who thrive on danger and fear it not at all .
Some fellow soldiers are said to have called him “ Mad Jack , ” and the nickname was not altogether undeserved .
Becoming a Commando
Churchill made it to Dunkirk , allegedly by bicycle , his bow and arrows hanging from the frame .
From that terrible beach he was lifted back to England — so was his Manchester friend — courtesy of the gallantry of the Royal Navy and a horde of civilian boats and ships , and it was there he heard of a new organization being formed .
It sounded like precisely the sort of outfit Churchill was cut out for .
Requests for volunteers for this new duty were somewhat vague , but they promised aggressive service at least , and that was good enough for Churchill .
Whatever a commando was , he would be one .
His training in Scotland produced an unexpected dividend for Churchill .
There he met Rosamund Denny , the daughter of a Scottish ship building baronet .
They were married in Dumbarton in the spring of 1941 , a happy marriage that would produce two children and last until Churchill ’s death 55 years later .
Churchill took to Commando operations like a duck to water , including the icy water of Scottish lochs .
He was at home on the steep hills , in the rain and the mud .
He lived and breathed training , leading , driving , setting the example , praising excellence , and damning sloth and carelessness .
His ad hoc lectures to his soldiers were couched in the plain language his men understood and liked , for instance : “ There ’s nothing worse than sitting on your bum bottom doing nothing just because the enemy happens to leave you alone for a moment while he has a go at the unit on your flank .
Pitch in and support your neighbor any way you can . … ”
Sword and Pipes Always At - Hand
There was also a bit of a downside to Jack Churchill .
On those happy occasions when the Commandos were not in the field at night , he was sometimes given to awakening everybody in the billet hotel at Largs , Scotland , shattering the night with pipe music .
No piper could possibly understand why some of the world would rather sleep than listen to martial piping however expert , and he was no exception .
His comrades could only grit their teeth and hope that he would soon tire or think of something else quieter to do .
The Commandos ’ eternal training ended on December 27 , 1941 , with the brilliantly successful assault on the German garrison at Vaagso , the Norwegian town on Nord Fiord .
Churchill commanded two companies in the attack , charged with taking out the German shore batteries on Maaloy Island , which lay in the fiord opposite Vaagso town .
In vintage Mad Jack fashion , he stood in the lead landing craft as it forged in toward the shore , his pipes screaming The March of the Cameron Men .
He then waded ashore at the head of his men , sword in hand , and charged ahead , as one account put it , “ into the thick smoke , uttering warlike cries . ”
Maaloy and its battery fell quickly .
Churchill and his men killed or took prisoner the garrison , including two women who , as one account of the raid genteelly put it , “ might be described as camp followers . ”
While heavy fighting continued for a while in Vaagso itself , the landing force would not be troubled by the cannon of Maaloy .
Jack Churchill ’s signal to the raid commander was terse : “ Maaloy battery and island captured .
Casualties slight .
Demolitions in progress .
Churchill . ”
Earning His Second Military Cross
The Commandos had stung the Germans badly .
In time the Norwegian garrisons would be heavily reinforced with troops critically required elsewhere .
The German garrison at Vaagso had ceased to exist , and the raiders took back with them some 100 prisoners and about 70 volunteers for the free Norwegian forces .
The expedition had also sunk about 15,000 tons of shipping and destroyed not only docks and warehouses but the vital fish oil plants so important to German ammunition production and to dietary supplements for the German armed forces .
And German troops near any coastline would not sleep quite as well as they had before Vaagso .
As the raiders prepared to leave Vaagso and Maaloy , a British demolition charge exploded so close to Churchill that it “ blew him up , ” in the words of one account .
Another story says that a demolitions man “ thoughtlessly blew down a wall he happened to be leaning against . ”
Still another version , which sounds eminently Churchillian , relates he was celebrating the raid ’s success with a bit of liberated Moselle wine when the charge went off and a chunk of broken bottle slashed into Churchill ’s forehead .
Whatever happened , Churchill had another wound — or at least a sort of wound — to show for his successful leadership at Maaloy .
As he himself joked later , “ I had to touch it up from time to time with Rosamund ’s lipstick to keep the wounded hero story going . ”
He also had his second Military Cross .
“ Commando ! ”
Commanding Number 2 Commando in the autumn of 1943 , Jack Churchill won the Distinguished Service Order for an astonishing exploit during the Salerno landings .
Ashore in command of No. 2 Commando ( also present were some other Churchills — his brother Tom and Captain Randolph , son of the Prime Minister ) , Churchill led his men in heavy and confused fighting around the town of Marina .
Their mission was to destroy German ability to place artillery fire on the western half of the Bay of Salerno .
Churchill directed the final counterattack , which broke the last German attempt to destroy the Commando beachhead .
During the ferocious Salerno fighting , Number 2 Commando found itself fighting as line infantry , as did its American counterparts , the Rangers , in a role for which neither Commandos nor Rangers were designed .
Casualties were heavy , but the Commandos beat back every German attack .
For Churchill , the high point of the fighting was the night attack on a town called Piegoletti ( sometimes Piegolelli ) .
He organized his men into six parallel columns and , since the heavy undergrowth ruled out any chance of a silent advance , sent them charging through the darkness shouting “ commando ! ”
The yelling not only minimized the risk of Commandos shooting each other in the gloom , but also confused the German defenders , to whom this fierce shouting seemed to come from all directions in the blackness of the night .
The attack carried all its objectives and bagged 136 prisoners .
“ A Bit Errol Flynn-ish ”
Churchill himself was far in front of his troopers .
Sword in hand , accompanied only by a corporal named Ruffell , he advanced into the town itself .
Undiscovered by the enemy , he and Ruffell heard German soldiers digging in all around them in the gloom .
The glow of a cigarette in the darkness told them the location of a German sentry post .
What followed , even Churchill later admitted , was “ a bit Errol Flynn-ish . ”
The first German sentry post , manned by two men , was taken in silence .
Jack Churchill , his sword blade gleaming in the night , appeared like a demon from the darkness , ordered “ Haende hoch ! ” and got results .
He gave one German prisoner to Ruffell , then slipped his revolver lanyard around the second sentry ’s neck and led him off to make the rounds of the other guards .
Each post , lulled into a sense of security by the voice of their captive comrade , surrendered to this fearsome apparition with the ferocious mustache and the naked sword .
Altogether , Churchill and Corporal Ruffell collected 42 prisoners , complete with their personal weapons and a mortar they were manning in the village .
Churchill and his claymore took the surrender of ten men in a bunch around the mortar .
He and his NCO then marched the whole lot back into the British lines .
Mad Jack to the Adriatic
As Churchill himself described the event , it all sounded rather routine : “ I always bring my prisoners back with their weapons ; it weighs them down .
I just took their rifle bolts out and put them in a sack , which one of the prisoners carried .
[ They ] also carried the mortar and all the bombs they could carry and also pulled a farm cart with five wounded in it ….
I maintain that , as long as you tell a German loudly and clearly what to do , if you are senior to him he will cry ‘ Jawohl ’ and get on with it enthusiastically and efficiently whatever the … situation .
That ’s why they make such marvelous soldiers … ”
Churchill ’s next assignment took him to the Adriatic , where British units and Tito ’s Yugoslav partisan forces struck at the German garrisons along the Dalmatian coast .
In January 1944 , Churchill , leading No. 2 Commando , about 1,000 Yugoslav partisans , and some antiaircraft and machine gun attachments became commandant of the island of Vis , the last Dalmation island not in German hands .
From Vis , the campaign against the German - held Adriatic islands was carried on at sea by the Royal Air Force and by small boats of the Royal Navy .
Ever ready for raids and excursions , Churchill sent some of his Commandos along with the Navy as boarding parties , to swarm over the side of any ship carrying supplies to the enemy .
Small groups of Commandos also landed by night to harass the German garrisons on other Dalmatian islands .
The commander of one such party , Lieutenant B.J. Barton , discovered that the German commandant on the island of Brac was much given to mistreatment of the island population .
Barton , disguised as a Yugoslav shepherd , hid his Sten gun in pieces inside a load of wood on a donkey , slipped into the German headquarters village , erased the commandant , and got away clean .
Churchill ’s Luck at Last Run Out
A series of successful raids by Commandos and partisans hurt the Germans , and in May 1944 , a more ambitious attack by British and Yugoslav personnel was planned on the German - held Yugoslav island of Brac .
It was here that Jack Churchill ’s amazing luck at last ran out .
The operation required attacks on three separate hilltop positions , dug in , mutually supporting , protected by wire and mines , and covered by artillery .
Several Allied forces would have to work in cooperation .
One of these , a reinforced Commando unit plus a large contingent of partisans , Jack Churchill would lead himself .
While partisan attacks on the main German position got nowhere , 43 ( Royal Marine ) Commando went to the attack on the vital hill called Point 622 .
Pushing ahead in clear moonlight through wire and minefields , 43 Commando carried the hilltop but was forced to fall back with heavy casualties .
Churchill now sent 40 Commando — also Royal Marines — in against the hill , and led them himself , playing the pipes .
The leading troop went in yelling , shooting from the hip , and overran the German positions on 622 .
But between casualties on the way up the hill and more casualties from very heavy German fire on the top , Churchill quickly found himself isolated with only a handful of defenders around him .
There were only six Commandos on the hilltop , and three of those were wounded , two of them very badly .
“ I was distressed , ” said Churchill with memorable understatement , “ to find that everyone was armed with revolvers except myself , who had an American carbine . ”
Still , the little party fought on until the revolver ammunition was gone and Churchill was down to a single magazine for his carbine .
A German mortar round killed three of his little party and wounded still another , leaving Churchill as the only unwounded defender on the hilltop .
It was the end .
Churchill turned to his pipes , playing “ Will ye no come back again ” until German grenades burst in his position and he was stunned by a fragment from one of them .
He regained consciousness to discover German soldiers “ prodding us , apparently to discover who was alive . ”
Long after the end of the war , Churchill was pleased to hear that the German account of the fighting for the hill described his lonely piping as “ the doleful sound of an unknown musical instrument . ”
Narrowly Escaping the Gestapo
Jack Churchill would play his pipes one more time , at the funeral of 14 Commandos who died on the slopes of Hill 622 .
He and his surviving men escaped killing by the Gestapo under Hitler ’s foul “ commando order ” through the chivalry of one Captain Thuener of the Wehrmacht .
“ You are a soldier , as I am , ” the captain told Churchill .
“ I refuse to allow these civilian butchers to deal with you .
I shall say nothing of having received this order . ”
After the war , Churchill was able to personally thank Thuener for his decency and to help him stay out of the merciless hands of the Russians .
Churchill was flown to Sarajevo and then on to Berlin , there apparently being some thought that he was a relative of Winston Churchill .
There is also a story that on leaving the aircraft , he left behind a burning match or candle in a pile of paper , producing a fire and considerable confusion .
During the inquiry that followed , Churchill innocently told a furious Luftwaffe officer that the army officer escorting Churchill had been smoking and reading the paper on board the aircraft .
Churchill spent some time in solitary confinement , and in time he ended up in Sachsenhausen concentration camp .
That infamous prison was only one more challenge to Churchill , however , and in September 1944 , he and an RAF officer crawled under the wire through an abandoned drain and set out to walk to the Baltic coast .
Their luck was not in , however , and they were recaptured near the coastal city of Rostock , only a few miles from the sea .
In time , they were moved to a camp at Niederdorf , Austria .
Here , Churchill watched for another opportunity to escape , keeping a small rusty can and some onions hidden in his jacket in case a sudden opportunity should present itself .
On an April night in 1945 , it did .
The chance came when the camp ’s lighting system failed .
Churchill seized the moment and walked away from a work detail , disappearing into the darkness and heading for the Alps and the Italian frontier .
Liberating vegetables from Austrian gardens and cooking them in his tin can , he walked steadily south .
Keeping off the roads , he crossed the Brenner Pass into Italy and headed for Verona , some 150 miles away .
Hitching a Ride With the Americans
On the eighth day of his escape , hobbling along on a sprained ankle , Churchill caught sight of a column of armored vehicles .
To his delight , their hulls carried the unmistakable white star of the United States Army .
He managed to flag down one vehicle and persuade the crew that in spite of his scruffy appearance he was indeed a British colonel .
As he later told his old friend and biographer , Rex King - Clark , “ I could n’t walk very well and was so out of breath I could scarcely talk , but I still managed a credible Sandhurst salute , which may have done the trick . ”
Churchill was free but frustrated .
The European war was almost over , and he had missed much of it , including the chance for further promotion and perhaps the opportunity to lead a Commando brigade .
Nevertheless , hope sprang eternal .
“ However , ” he said to friends , “ there are still the Nips , are n’t there ? ”
There were .
And so Churchill was off to Burma , where the largest land war against Japan was still raging .
Here , too , however , he met frustration , for by the time he reached India , Hiroshima and Nagasaki had disappeared in mushroom clouds , and the war abruptly ended .
For a warrior like Churchill , the end of the fighting was bittersweet .
“ You know , ” he said to a friend only half joking , “ if it had n’t been for those damned Yanks we could have kept the war going for another 10 years . ”

The abrupt departure of Japan from the war was a distinct disappointment to Churchill , especially since he had risen to command of a Commando brigade in the Far East .
Still , there were other brushfire wars still smoldering , and in November 1945 , he reported home from Hong Kong , “ As the Nips have double - crossed me by packing up , I ’m about to join the team v the Indonesians , ” who were by then casting covetous eyes on Sarawak , Borneo , and Brunei .
British and Commonwealth troops killed or expelled the invaders , but Jack missed this little war as well .
By the next year , he had transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders and was looking forward to jump school , where , at 40 , he qualified as a paratrooper .
He took a little time off in 1946 , this time for the movies .
Twentieth Century Fox was making Ivanhoe with Churchill ’s old rowing companion Robert Taylor and wanted him to appear as an archer , firing from the wall of Warwick Castle .
Churchill took the assignment , flown off to the job in an aircraft provided by the movie company .
Through With War ?
… Not for Mad Jack
Though Jack Churchill might have thought that he was through with war , he was not .
After World War II ended , he qualified as a parachutist , transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders , and later ended up in Palestine as second - in - command of 1st Battalion , the Highland Light Infantry .
And it was there , in the spring of 1948 , just before the end of the British mandate over that troubled land , that he again risked his life for other people .
Those were dangerous days , with much blood — Jewish , Arab and British — shed by Arab terrorists and by Jewish radicals , notably the so - called Stern Gang .
On a day in May a Jewish medical convoy — ambulances , trucks , and buses — was ambushed by Arabs on a narrow street in Jerusalem , not far from a small HLI detachment at a place called Tony ’s Post .
Churchill rushed to the site in a Dingo , a small armored car .
This one had its turret removed for repair , but it gave him a semblance of protection at least .
Accurately assessing the potential for mass murder by the Arab terrorists , he radioed for two Staghounds , heavy cannon - armed armored cars , and these were diverted from convoy protection and dispatched to him .
It would take time for the armored cars to reach him , however , and while they were on their way , Churchill acted .
He drove down to the beleaguered convoy in a large armored personnel carrier covered by the only escort available , an open - topped Bren gun carrier and a small police armored car armed with a machine gun .
Leaving his tiny convoy and swinging a walking stick , he walked calmly into the open and down the road to the convoy .
Marching into the teeth of the battle around the convoy , he must have been quite a sight .
Since he had just come from a battalion parade , he was resplendent in full dress : kilt , glengarry bonnet , red- and - white diced stockings , Sam Browne belt , and white spats .
And as usual he later made light of this extraordinary cold courage : “ I grinned like mad from side to side , ” he said afterward , “ as people are less likely to shoot at you if you smile at them … [ that ] outfit in the middle of the battle , together with my grinning at them , may have made the Arabs laugh because most of them have a sense of humor .
Anyway , they did n’t shoot me ! ”
Churchill spoke to the occupants of one bus and offered to drive his big armored personnel carrier down to the convoy and make as many trips as necessary to evacuate the patients and their medical personnel .
He warned those at the convoy that there might be casualties when they moved to the British vehicle , and one of the Jews asked whether he would not first drive off the Arabs .
He patiently explained that he could not ; there were hundreds of Arabs and he had only 12 men .
After a discussion with one of the doctors , as Churchill stood in the open , his offer was refused .
“ Thank you very much but we do not want your help .
The Haganah ( the Jewish defense force ) will save us . ”
Churchill walked down the convoy repeating his offer , but was uniformly refused .
By now one of Churchill ’s men had been mortally wounded , and he ran back to his vehicles and sent them out of harm ’s way .
Returning to Tony ’s Post , he supported the Jewish convoy with small arms fire until Arab gasoline bombs and rifle fire destroyed the Jewish vehicles and most of their passengers .
The Haganah had not arrived to save them after all , and 77 Jews died in the narrow street .
Evacuating 700 Jews from Jerusalem
Later , Churchill engineered the evacuation of some 700 Jews — patients , staff , and students — from the university and hospital atop Jerusalem ’s Mount Scopus .
Churchill made an early run up Scopus in his jeep accompanied by Eli Davis , the deputy medical director of the hospital .
Here is how Davis later told the story : “ Major Churchill told me there was slight chance of getting through … because the Arabs saw the British meant business .
He agreed to make the trip up to Scopus and invited me along .
The Major took a Jeep and his driver .
I sat while he stood in the Jeep twirling his stick .
He looked as though he were on parade in London … ”
Jack Churchill never changed , never lost his flair for the unusual , not to say the flamboyant .
In his later years , passengers on a London commuter train were often startled by seeing an older male passenger rise , open a window , and hurl his briefcase out into the night .
The passenger would then leave the car and wait by the train ’s door until it stopped at the next station .
It was Churchill , of course , enjoying his little gesture and reasonably sure that his fellow passengers could not know he had thrown the case into the garden of his house .
It saved him carrying it home from the station .
Mad Jack Finally Retires
In later years , Churchill served as an instructor at the land - air warfare school in Australia , where he became a passionate devotee of the surfboard .
Back in England , he was the first man to ride the Severn River ’s five - foot tidal bore and designed his own board .
He finally retired from the army , with two awards of the Distinguished Service Order , in 1959 .
He went right on working , now as a Ministry of Defense civilian overseeing the training of Cadet Force youngsters in the London District .
One of his old friends wrote later that Churchill liked the job not only because of his association with the enthusiastic cadets , but also because the job gave him an office in Horse Guards at Whitehall , and a window from which he could watch troopers of the Household Cavalry mounting guard in a courtyard below him .
He was older now , but still the warrior .
Churchill and his wife Rosamund could spend more time together now , and they used part of it sailing coal - fired steam launches on the Thames River between Oxford and Richmond , Churchill decked out in an impeccable yachting cap and Rosamund giving appropriate sailing orders to her husband .
Churchill was also well known for his intricate and accurate radio - controlled models of ships , mostly warships of course , all so carefully engineered and built that they were much sought after by collectors .
Churchill passed away peacefully at his home in Surrey in the spring of 1996 , but he left a legacy of daring that survives to this day .
One respected publication dealing with the Commandos features large color drawings of Commando uniforms , insignia , and weaponry — and one of the illustrations is of Mad Jack Churchill , complete with claymore .
“ Mad ” Jack Churchill was one of that rare and happy breed for whom war is their element .
That does not mean that he did not hate the suffering that war caused ; it was simply that he thrived on the excitement and relished the chance to achieve and excel .
His whole philosophy was pretty well summed up by a couplet he scribbled on a postcard he sent to a friend , a card whose face bore the regimental colors : “ No Prince or Lord has tomb so proud / As he whose flag becomes his shroud . ”
He might have been describing himself .
A provocative essay has been pulled from servers by Newcastle University authorities following complaints from vegetarians .
Nikolas Lloyd , who was granted IT services as a visiting fellow in evolutionary psychology , has had all his pages taken down and his email access rescinded .
Forum members on a vegetarian dating site took exception to the title of the piece “ Why vegetarians should be force fed with lard ” .
It was one of a series of deliberately incendiary treatises , which included “ Why banning hunting is wrong ” , and “ A woman 's place ” .
In his vegetarianism article , Lloyd argues against pro-veggie reasoning in tongue - in - cheek style .
A typical passage reads :
Most vegetarians are women .
In Britain , a person is doubly likely to suffer from vegetarianism if he is female ... when men split up from their veggie girlfriends , they near invariably start enjoying meat again .
This goes to prove amongst other things that men really will do ANYTHING for sex .
The full tirade has been rescued from Google 's cache and is available here .
Not seeing the funny side , tofu fanciers on veggieromance.com fired off complaints to university postmaster Quentin Campbell .
He temporarily suspended Lloyd 's access while the gripes were investigated under the university 's usage policies .
Campbell then replied in an email : “ I am mindful of the obligation of the University , under section 43 of the Education ( No 2 ) Act 1986 , to protect the freedom of speech of its staff . ”
The section of the Act he refers to says :
Take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members , students and employees of the establishment and for visiting speakers .
He concluded : “ You may not agree with the personal opinions that Nikolas Lloyd publishes on our staff website here , but as his views do not appear to break the law of the UK , the university cannot without proper cause prevent him from expressing them . ”
In a later , more detailed official statement , he told the vegetarians the pages would stand , since the Education Act trumps the institution 's own rules regarding material “ intended to annoy ” .
The email dialogue is in the veggieromance .com thread here .
That was back in January , and seemed to put an end to the bean curd - induced humour vacuum .
Last week though , a letter dropped on Lloyd 's doormat from university Registrar John Hogan telling him that all his IT privileges , conferred a decade ago , were to be removed with immediate effect .
According to university authorities , Lloyd 's downfall was that , as a visiting fellow , he was not an official member of staff and so lacked the protection of the legislation .
They contend their own regulations meant the university was obliged to crumble under the weight of complaints from the offended cabbage regarders .
The decision was taken at the very highest level of the university administration .
Lloyd 's access via the Department of Psychology was sponsored by evolutionary psychiatry academic Dr Bruce Charlton , who uses some of Lloyd 's respected work on evolutionary debates in his teaching .
Charlton says the suspension of IT services is a big blow to Lloyd , who pursued his interest in the field on a low income , and a “ malicious , frivolous ” attack should have been resisted by authorities .
He added that it is an “ ominous ” sign that people with “ hurt feelings ” can bring about a crisis meeting in the upper echelons of management .
He also pointed out that the action sets a worrying precedent for the institution ; people can take offence at anything , so the regulations offer no protection to anything on the site .
Some of the meat - shy posters had the mettle to stand up for Lloyd 's rights of free speech , however .
In the spirit of the debate , one joked : “ Personally , I believe that nobody should be allowed to publish or say anything that offends me , and I will always campaign to get it removed so that no one else is allowed to read it ... I plan to go over to Nikolas Lloyd 's house and set fire to it . ” ®
