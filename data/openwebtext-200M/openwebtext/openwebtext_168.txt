Rachel Carson , Mass Murderer ?
The creation of an anti-environmental myth
By Aaron Swartz
Sometimes you find mass murderers in the most unlikely places .
Take Rachel Carson .
She was , by all accounts , a mild - mannered writer for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - - hardly a sociopath 's breeding ground .
And yet , according to many in the media , Carson has more blood on her hands than Hitler .
The problems started in the 1940s , when Carson left the Service to begin writing full - time .
In 1962 , she published a series of articles in the New Yorker , resulting in the book Silent Spring -- widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement .
The book discussed how pesticides and pollutants moved up the food chain , threatening the ecosystems for many animals , especially birds .
Without them , it warned , we might face the title 's silent spring .
Farmers used vast quantities of DDT to protect their crops against insects -- 80 million pounds were sprayed in 1959 alone -- but from there it quickly climbed up the food chain .
Bald eagles , eating fish that had concentrated DDT in their tissues , headed toward extinction .
Humans , likewise accumulating DDT in our systems , appeared to get cancer as a result .
Mothers passed the chemical on to their children through breast milk .
Silent Spring drew attention to these concerns and , in 1972 , the resulting movement succeeded in getting DDT banned in the U.S. - - a ban that later spread to other nations .
And that , according to Carson 's critics , is where the trouble started .
DDT had been sprayed heavily on houses in developing countries to protect against malaria - carrying mosquitoes .
Without it , malaria rates in developing countries skyrocketed .
Over 1 million people die from it each year .
To the critics , the solution seems simple : Forget Carson 's emotional arguments about dead birds and start spraying DDT again so we can save human lives .
Worse than Hitler ?
" What the World Needs Now Is DDT " asserted the headline of a lengthy feature in the New York Times Magazine ( 4/11/04 ) .
" No one concerned about the environmental damage of DDT set out to kill African children , " reporter Tina Rosenberg generously allowed .
Nonetheless , " Silent Spring is now killing African children because of its persistence in the public mind . "
It 's a common theme -- echoed by two more articles in the Times by the same author ( 3/29/06 , 10/05/06 ) , and by Times columnists Nicholas Kristof ( 3/12/05 ) and John Tierney ( 6/05/07 ) .
The same refrain appears in a Washington Post op - ed by columnist Sebastian Mallaby , gleefully headlined " Look Who 's Ignoring Science Now " ( 10/09/05 ) .
And again in the Baltimore Sun ( " Ms. Carson 's views [ came ] at a cost of many thousands of lives worldwide " --5/27/07 ) , New York Sun ( " millions of Africans died ... thanks to Rachel Carson 's junk science classic " --4/21/06 ) , the Hill ( " millions die on the altar of politically correct ideologies " - - 11/2/05 ) , San Francisco Examiner ( " Carson was wrong , and millions of people continue to pay the price " --5/28/07 ) and Wall Street Journal ( " environmental controls were more important than the lives of human beings " - -2/21/07 ) .
Even novelists have gotten in on the game .
" Banning DDT killed more people than Hitler , Ted , " explains a character in Michael Crichton 's 2004 bestseller , State of Fear ( p. 487 ) . " [ DDT ] was so safe you could eat it . "
That fictional comment not only inspired a column on the same theme in Australia 's Sydney Morning Herald ( 6/18/05 ) , it led Senator James Inhofe ( R - Ok. ) to invite Crichton and Dr. Donald R. Roberts , a longtime pro-DDT activist , to testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works .
But other attacks only seem like fiction .
A web page on junkscience.com features a live Malaria Death Clock next to a photo of Rachel Carson , holding her responsible for more deaths than malaria has caused in total .
( " DDT allows [ Africans to ] climb out of the poverty / subsistence hole in which ' caring greens ' apparently wish to keep them trapped , " it helpfully explains . )
And a new website from the Competitive Enterprise Institute , RachelWasWrong.org , features photos of deceased African children along the side of every page .
Developing resistance
At one level , these articles send a comforting message to the developed world : Saving African children is easy .
We do n't need to build large aid programs or fund major health initiatives , let alone develop Third - World infrastructure or think about larger issues of fairness .
No , to save African lives from malaria , we just need to put our wallets away and work to stop the evil environmentalists .
Unfortunately , it 's not so easy .
For one thing , there is no global DDT ban .
DDT is indeed banned in the U.S. , but malaria is n't exactly a pressing issue here .
If it ever were , the ban contains an exception for matters of public health .
Meanwhile , it 's perfectly legal -- and indeed , used -- in many other countries : 10 out of the 17 African nations that currently conduct indoor spraying use DDT ( New York Times , 9/16/06 ) .
DDT use has decreased enormously , but not because of a ban .
The real reason is simple , although not one conservatives are particularly fond of : evolution .
Mosquito populations rapidly develop resistance to DDT , creating enzymes to detoxify it , modifying their nervous systems to avoid its effects , and avoiding areas where DDT is sprayed -- and recent research finds that that resistance continues to spread even after DDT spraying has stopped , lowering the effectiveness not only of DDT but also other pesticides ( Current Biology , 8/9/05 ) .
" No responsible person contends that insect - borne disease should be ignored , " Carson wrote in Silent Spring .
" The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse .... Resistance to insecticides by mosquitoes ... has surged upwards at an astounding rate . "
Unfortunately , her words were ignored .
Africa did n't cut back on pesticides because , through a system called the " Industry Cooperative Program , " the pesticide companies themselves got to participate in the United Nations agency that provided advice on pest control .
Not surprisingly , it continued to recommend significant pesticide usage .
When Silent Spring came out in 1962 , it seemed as if this strategy was working .
To take the most extreme case , Sri Lanka counted only 17 cases of malaria in 1963 .
But by 1969 , things had once again gotten out of hand : 537,700 cases were counted .
Naturally , the rise had many causes : Political and financial pressure led to cutbacks on spraying , stockpiles of supplies had been used up , low rainfall and high temperatures encouraged mosquitoes , a backlog of diagnostic tests to detect malaria was processed and testing standards became more stringent .
But even with renewed effort , the problem did not go away .
Records uncovered by entomologist Andrew Spielman hint at why ( Mosquito , p. 177 ) .
For years , Sri Lanka had run test programs to verify DDT 's effectiveness at killing mosquitoes .
But halfway through the program , their standards were dramatically lowered .
" Though the reason was not recorded , " Spielman writes , " it was obvious that some mosquitoes were developing resistance and the change was made to justify continued spraying . "
But further spraying led only to further resistance , and the problem became much harder to control .
DDT use was scaled back and other pesticides were introduced -- more cautiously this time -- but the epidemic was never again brought under control , with the deadly legacy that continues to this day .
Instead of apologizing , the chemical companies went on the attack .
They funded front groups and think tanks to claim the epidemic started because countries " stopped " using their products .
In their version of the story , environmentalists forced Africans to stop using DDT , causing the increase in malaria .
" It 's like a hit - and - run driver who , instead of admitting responsibility for the accident , frames the person who tried to prevent the accident , " complains Tim Lambert , whose weblog , Deltoid , tracks the DDT myth and other scientific misinformation in the media .
Front and center
Perhaps the most vocal group spreading this story is Africa Fighting Malaria ( AFM ) .
Founded in 2000 by Roger Bate , an economist at various right - wing think tanks , AFM has run a major PR campaign to push the pro-DDT story , publishing scores of op - eds and appearing in dozens of articles each year .
Bate and his partner Richard Tren even published a book laying out their alternate history of DDT : When Politics Kills : Malaria and the DDT Story .
A funding pitch uncovered by blogger Eli Rabbett shows Bate 's thinking when he first started the project .
" The environmental movement has been successful in most of its campaigns as it has been ' politically correct , ' " he explained ( Tobacco Archives , 09/98 ) .
What the anti-environmental movement needs is something with " the correct blend of political correctness ( ...oppressed blacks ) and arguments ( eco-imperialism [ is ] undermining their future ) . "
That something , Bate proposed , was DDT .
In an interview , Bate said that his motivation had changed after years of working on the issue of malaria .
" I think my position has mellowed , perhaps with age , " he told Extra !. " [ I have ] gone from being probably historically anti-environmental to being very much pro-combating malaria now . "
He pointed to the work he'd done making sure money to fight malaria was spent properly , including a study he co-authored in the respected medical journal the Lancet ( 7/15/06 ) on dishonest accounting at the World Bank .
He insisted that he was n't simply pro-DDT , but instead was willing to support whatever the evidence showed worked .
And he flatly denied that AFM had ever received money from tobacco , pharmaceutical or chemical companies .
Still , AFM has very much followed the plan Bate laid out in his original funding pitch to corporations :
First , create " the intellectual arguments to make our case , " then " disseminate these arguments to people in [ developing countries ] " who can make convincing spokespeople , and then " promote these arguments ... in the West . "
The penultimate page gives another hint that stopping malaria is n't the primary goal : " Is the DDT problem still relevant ? " is listed as an " intellectual issue to be resolved " -- once they got funding .
( When asked for comment on this , Bate became upset and changed the subject . )
Bate continues to insist that resistance is n't much of an issue , because its primary effect is to keep mosquitoes away from DDT - covered areas altogether .
Instead he claims " resistance was a useful device by which it was easy to pull the plug " on an anti-malaria campaign that was failing because of administrative incompetence .
" You 're not likely to see an aid agency [ admit this ] , " he said when asked for evidence .
" I 'm not sure what you want me to say .
If you read enough of the literature , you get that strong impression . "
But few experts aside from those affiliated with AFM seem to have gotten the same impression .
DDT 's dangers
These myths can have serious consequences .
For one thing , despite what is claimed by the right , DDT itself is quite harmful .
Studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to DDT leads to significant decreases in mental and physical functioning among young children , with the problems becoming more severe when the exposure is more serious ( American Journal of Epidemiology , 9/12/06 ; Pediatrics , 7/1/06 ) , while the EPA classifies it as a probable human carcinogen .
For another , resistance is deadly .
Not only has DDT 's overuse made it ineffective , but , as noted , it has led mosquitoes to evolve " cross- resistance " : resistance not only to DDT but also to other insecticides , including those with less dangerous environmental effects .
And perhaps most importantly , the pro-DDT line is a vast distraction .
There are numerous other techniques for dealing with malaria : alternative insecticides , bed nets and a combination of drugs called artemisinin - based combination therapy , or ACT .
ACT actually kills the malaria parasite fast , allowing the patient a quick recovery , and has a success rate of 95 percent ( World Health Organization , 2001 ) .
Rollouts of ACT in other countries have slashed malaria rates by 80 to 97 percent ( Washington Monthly , 7/06 ) .
But such techniques require money and wealthy nations are hesitant to give it , especially when they think they can just avoid the whole problem by unbanning DDT .
" DDT has become a fetish , " says Allan Schapira , a former senior member of the malaria team at the World Health Organization ( Washington Monthly , 7/06 ) .
" You have people advocating DDT as if it 's the only insecticide that works against malaria , as if DDT would solve all problems , which is obviously absolutely unrealistic . "
As a result , senators and their staff insist that DDT is all that 's necessary .
And the new director of WHO 's malaria program , Arata Kochi , kicked off his tenure by telling the malaria team that they were " stupid " and issuing an announcement that " forcefully endorsed wider use of the insecticide DDT " while a representative of the Bush administration stood by his side .
Half his staff resigned in response ( New York Times , 9/16/06 ) .
There are genuine issues with current malaria control programs : incompetent administration , misuse of funds , outdated techniques , a lack of funding and concern .
And , much to their credit , many on the right have drawn attention to these problems .
Africa Fighting Malaria has frequently called for more effective monitoring , and conservative Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Ok. ) has used his influence to fight corruption in anti-malaria programs .
But the same Tom Coburn recently held up a bill honoring the 100th anniversary of Rachel Carson 's birth on the grounds that " millions of people ... died because governments bought into Carson 's junk science claims about DDT " ( Raw Story , 5/22/07 ) .
Even AFM's
Bate was quoted as finding this a bit too much , pointing out that Carson died in 1964 , just two years after Silent Spring was published ( Washington Post , 5/23/07 ) .
But apparently getting a few digs in at the environmental movement is just too hard for conservatives to resist .
THE HOUSING BUBBLE … .
The New York Times reports that the median home price is going to fall this year for the first time since the end of World War II :
Economists say the decline , which could be foreshadowed in a widely followed government price index to be released this week , will probably be modest — from 1 percent to 2 percent — but could continue in 2008 and 2009 .
….
Unless the real estate downturn is much worse than economists are expecting , the declines will not come close to erasing the increases of the last decade .
I dunno .
The article is accompanied by the chart below ( with some additions in red ) and it ’s sure hard to believe that the downturn is going to be as small as the chart suggests .
Housing prices are a full third higher than historical trendlines predict , and I still have n’t heard any compelling reason why the housing market should have changed drastically and permanently starting in 1996 .
Sure , in a few big cities like Los Angeles you can argue that there ’s just no more room to build and that ’s driving a long - term change , but what about the rest of the country ?
It ’s all very mysterious to me .
I tend to believe in long - term trends unless there ’s a really compelling reason to think that fundamentals have changed .
But while housing fundamentals might have changed a little bit ( buyers are obviously willing to spend a bigger percent of their income on housing than we once thought ) , it sure seems like prices were propped up mostly by falling interest rates , a credit bubble that ’s bursting as we speak , and the same kind of hysterical buying and selling we saw in the dotcom boom .
Housing may be inherently more stable than the stock market , but even so , it sure seems like we ’re due for a correction of more than few percent .
Stay tuned .
IRAQ has failed to meet all but three of 18 benchmarks for political and military progress , says a leaked report being prepared for the US Congress .
The draft is strikingly negative , and raises questions about statements by the President , George Bush , last month , when he offered a much more positive assessment .
The Government Accountability Office report is to be presented to Congress on Tuesday .
A separate report due late next month based on the White House 's own new benchmarks and congressional testimony from General David Petraeus , the commander in Iraq , and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker , is expected to be more positive .
The conflicting views of the war in Washington came as Moqtada al - Sadr , the influential Iraqi Shiite preacher , ordered his Mahdi Army gunmen to halt all hostilities for six months , including attacks on coalition troops .
Observing President Bush in action lately , we have to wonder if he actually watched the election returns in November , or if he was just rerunning the 2002 vote on his TiVo .
That year , the White House used the fear of terrorism to scare American voters into cementing the Republican domination of Congress .
Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney then embarked on an expansion of presidential power chilling both in its sweep and in the damage it did to the constitutional system of checks and balances .
In 2006 , the voters sent Mr. Bush a powerful message that it was time to rein in his imperial ambitions .
But we have yet to see any sign that Mr. Bush understands that — or even realizes that the Democrats are now in control of the Congress .
Indeed , he seems to have interpreted his party ’s drubbing as a mandate to keep pursuing his fantasy of victory in Iraq and to press ahead undaunted with his assault on civil liberties and the judicial system .
Just before the Christmas break , the Justice Department served notice to Senator Patrick Leahy — the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee — that it intended to keep stonewalling Congressional inquiries into Mr. Bush ’s inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of prisoners taken in anti-terrorist campaigns .
It refused to hand over two documents , including one in which Mr. Bush authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to establish secret prisons beyond the reach of American law or international treaties .
The other set forth the interrogation methods authorized in these prisons — which we now know ranged from abuse to outright torture .
Also last month , Mr. Bush issued another of his infamous “ presidential signing statements , ” which he has used scores of times to make clear he does not intend to respect the requirements of a particular law — in this case a little - noticed Postal Service bill .
The statement suggested that Mr. Bush does not believe the government must obtain a court order before opening Americans ’ first - class mail .
It said the administration had the right to “ conduct searches in exigent circumstances , ” which include not only protecting lives , but also unspecified “ foreign intelligence collection . ”

Productivity gradually slows down over the course of a couple hours , and then by 3 PM it hits a brick wall .
Pretty soon you ’re happily chatting away with colleagues that you deliberately avoided all week long .
But that ’s okay , because you can almost taste the 48 hours of freedom that lay ahead .

As long as you are not an addict , there is nothing wrong with having a couple alcoholic beverages in your off - time .
And when the events leading up to this breath of freedom are hectic , that first sip is sheer bliss !

Sleeping
In – Whether you can admit it or not , sleeping in is a celebration of vast proportions .
People usually feel guilty for sleeping in because they think they should be out conquering some vital chore .
But , you know what ?
Sometimes it just makes sense to stop and relax .
And there is no better feeling of relaxation than sleeping until your eyes just pop open on their own .

How does this make sense ?
Quite simply , we are always in a rush to socialize , and we celebrate the act of doing so , yet we are not necessarily conscious of its fundamental importance .
Friendship is always celebrated ; consciously when we are aware of its importance , and subconsciously when we are not .

Despite the popular notion that antioxidants , such as vitamins C and E , offer health - promoting benefits by protecting against damaging free radicals , a new study in the August 10 issue of the journal Cell reveals that , in fact , balance is the key .
The researchers show in mice that an overload of natural antioxidants can actually lead the heart to failure .
There is plenty of evidence about the damaging effects of oxidative stress , but “ there is another side to the coin , ” said Ivor Benjamin of the University of Utah , Salt Lake City .
“ There has been so much emphasis on free radicals to the exclusion of the potential consequences of reductants .
Our study provides the first bona fide example of the role that reductive stress can play in disease . ”
Reductants , sometimes referred to as antioxidants , are elements or compounds that easily give up an electron to become “ oxidized , ” while oxidizing agents readily accept electrons .
In the body , such oxidation - reduction ( redox ) reactions are integral to the release and storage of energy .
Many cellular pathways are also sensitive to the prevailing redox condition .
Oxidative stress , which consumes reducing equivalents , has been often implicated in numerous cardiac and other diseases , Benjamin noted .
However , the possibility remained that an inverse imbalance could provoke reductive stress , with the potential for similar deleterious effects .
Indeed , reductive stress had been demonstrated in simpler organisms but not in mammals and / or disease states , he said .
In the current study , the researchers examined mice carrying a human mutation earlier linked to so - called protein aggregation skeletal myopathies and cardiomyopathies , in which weakening skeletal and heart muscle contain clumps of proteins .
Although the genetic basis for the disease had been linked to mutations in one of two genes , the mechanism responsible remained mysterious .
The researchers now show that mice with one of the mutant genes , áB- crystallin , specifically in the heart develop the same symptoms seen in human patients , including heart enlargement , progressive heart failure , and an early death .
They further show that the animals ’ hearts are under reductive stress .
The find initially took Benjamin by surprise , he said .
They had conducted a test traditionally used to measure the level of oxidative stress in the animals , expecting they might see higher than normal levels .
Instead , they found the mice had “ markedly reduced ” oxidative stress levels due to an abundance of a natural antioxidant known as glutathione .
The mutant mouse hearts exhibited a heightened stress response , including higher activity of heat shock proteins that have been documented in human heart failure , Benjamin explained .
Such stress responses yield reactive oxygen species , triggering antioxidative pathways to kick in .
In the diseased animals , however , that pathway — in which oxidized glutathione is recycled to its reduced , antioxidant form — soon got out of hand , producing excess levels of the reduced glutathione and a condition of reductive stress .
Moreover , they showed that the offspring of the heart - diseased animals and mice with lower levels of one of the antioxidant enzymes , glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) , were relieved of their symptoms .
That finding suggests that drugs or other treatments targeting the antioxidant pathway through G6PD “ might modify the phenotype and the natural history of this inherited disorder in humans , ” according to the researchers .
The results found in the heart suggest that reductive stress might underlie other diseases , as well .
“ Our findings open up a whole new line of investigation in protein aggregation diseases , ” including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Huntington ’s disease , Benjamin said .

Bush administration responds to request for info on Gonzales testimony Nick Juliano

The Bush administration has responded to a Republican senator 's request for information about Alberto Gonzales 's conflicting testimony on a secret surveillance program hours after a 12 p.m.
Tuesday deadline , a senior GOP senator said Tuesday .
Sen . Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , still is waiting for a requested response from Gonzales himself , which had yet to be delivered Tuesday night , he told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in an interview Tuesday afternoon .
The letter Specter received from Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell seeks to clarify earlier testimony from Gonzales in which he said there was not " serious disagreement " among administration officials over a classified National Security Agency surveillance program .
The letter seems to back up a report in the New York Times over the weekend that said Gonzales ' responses to Congress are technically correct because only " one particular aspect " of a secret program was acknowledged by President Bush -- the warrantless wiretapping program -- and it was n't that particular aspect Gonzales was referring to in testimony that has come under question , according to parts of the letter reported earlier Tuesday by CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux .
ThinkProgress has video of Malveaux 's report .
Specter refused to comment on details of McConnell 's letter before he received a response from Gonzales that would " interpret " the first letter .
The Pennsylvania Republican also said going into detail about the letter would involve revealing classified information .
Specter said yesterday that he requested from the Bush administration a " letter addressing that question [ of Gonzales ' veracity ] from the administration " by noon Tuesday , according to The Hill .
He promised to release the letter to the media , but so far the letter has not done so , presumably waiting for Gonzales ' response .
CNN reported McConnell 's letter declared that NSA programs other than the wiretapping program acknowledged by Bush are classified and cannot be discussed .
" So what they re saying is everything else is secret but what he was talking about specifically was the Terrorist Surveillance Program , " Malveaux said Tuesday .
A spokeswoman for Sen. Patrick Leahy , the committee chairman who also is expected to receive the administration 's response , told RAW STORY Tuesday afternoon that he had not seen the letter .
Specter has been critical of Gonzales 's performance and lack of credibility in his past testimony , but so far Specter has not signed on to a Democratic proposal for a special counsel to investigate whether the attorney general perjured himself .
Blitzer asked Specter whether his conclusion to an unsatisfactory response from Gonzales would " be like other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee : He did lie . "
" Well , if he does n't have a plausible explanation , then he has n't leveled with the committee , " Specter said .
" That 's right . "
Earlier in the interview , Specter said Gonzales " did not tell us the whole story " regarding his involvement in the US Attorney - firing scandal .
But the attorney general 's critic demurred when asked if he would support the Democrats perjury investigation , citing a Ruth Marcus column printed Tuesday in the Washington Post .
" We 're in the business of finding out the facts and legislating , " Specter said .
" Right now , we 're facing a very serious situation on a terrorist threat .
...
We can take care of Gonzales later . "
Millions of Americans spend their lives semi-conscious , unable to awaken from the darker version of the American Dream â€ “ an endless parade of office buildings , meetings , shopping malls , and television commercials .
Instead of pursuing purpose , we pursue material things : plasma televisions , new cars , and granite countertops .
We work at jobs we hate so we can buy things we do not need .
We exchange our souls for empty production and consumption .
When I think of popular American culture , I am reminded of two quotes from George Romeroâ€™s 1978 zombie movie , Dawn of the Dead :
Dr. Millard Rousch , Scientist : â€ œThese creatures are nothing but pure , motorized instinct.â€ 
â€ œThese creatures are nothing but pure , motorized instinct.â€ 
Flyboy : â€œThey donâ€™t know [ why the zombies keep coming to the mall ] â€ ¦
All they know is that it used to be a very important part of their lives.â€ 
Romeroâ€™s classic horror movie was a social commentary on American consumerism .
Personally , I find it impossible to watch a zombie movie without relating to the zombies .
There we are , still wearing our Sunday suits , shambling toward the shopping mall , shuffling toward office buildings , a massive army of the undead , casting a million shadows at sundown as we head home from work .
We can neither understand nor articulate the longing inside us , so we moan , and perhaps we find comfort in the fact that so many others moan with us .
The tragic irony is that zombies do not know they are zombies .
Master of the Zombies
According to Haitian tradition , a bokor , or Voodoo sorcerer can resurrect a zombie .
The sorcerer controls the zombie , since the zombie has no will of his own .
The media controls the modern American zombie .
We come home to our nice warm houses and plop down on our comfortable sofas , where the single eye of the television flickers in the darkness .
Our electronic sorceress orders us out into the world to bring back more of everything : cosmetic surgery , shiny appliances , expensive meals , weight - loss pills , hardwood floors .
The messages sent are simple and menacing :
You are not pretty enough .
You are not good enough .
You do not own enough .
We slowly rise from our comfortable sofas and leave the flickering darkness , stumbling into the streets to satiate our hunger .
We shamble through the isles of Home Depot and Lowes because our 3 - bedroom homes ( quite large by global standards ) just arenâ€™t nice enough .
In the harsh lighting of the Gap and Aeropostale , we search for clothing to make us feel better .
We shuffle mindlessly through car lots searching for a vehicle to reflect our identity .
Are we Ford tough ?
Are we Lexus smooth ?
But the zombie has no identity , for the zombie is a shell , identical to all the other shells in Sunday suits with wallets thrust forward , mouths hanging open .
When my grandfather was in his prime , consumption was an unpleasant word associated with disease .
Every person throughout history has had to consume to survive , but to consume more than we need has traditionally been considered vulgar .
We have forgotten what our grandparents knew : Beyond a certain point , possessions do not increase happiness .
Of course , it is better that we should live in a land of plenty than in a hovel ; abundance is good .
Excess ( not abundance ) is the true evil , since excess eschews purpose .
Zombie University
At campuses everywhere , we can easily imagine two long lines of students — the inbound line is scattered and disorganized , the outbound line , single file .
Kids in the inbound line wear loud colored shirts and messy haircuts , adults in the outbound line wear identical blue suits and matching black briefcases .
You can see the beginning stages of the disease in the graduates â€ “ dark eyes , shaking hands .
Their first few years on the job will destroy what little soul they have left .
College can be wonderful , enlightening .
It can help us find satisfying jobs .
But all too often , college is a means to an unfulfilling end .
This is not because college is bad ( it is not ) , but rather because we are focused on material wealth at the expense of deeper meaning .
If you let it , college will process you to death ( or undeath ) , and a million corporations will eat whatâ€™s left of you .
The Working Dead
We work in tiny , climate controlled cubicles , sacrificing human contact in exchange for electronic communication , real smiles for emoticons , humility for rudeness .
Our only purpose in the belly of the beast is maximizing profit , increasing GDP .
Forty , fifty , sixty , seventy hours a week , we work .
Working in such antagonistic environments removes our soul , leaving us to fill the void with possessions .
Because the zombie has no soul , he cannot comprehend any fulfillment beyond his own terrible hunger .
The Zombie might say , â€ œI donâ€™t need to buy a Lexus , but I want one .
Thatâ€™s why I work so hard .â€ 
But he has not fully considered the meaning of his words .
He spends the vast majority of his waking life doing work that does not fulfill him so he can afford things previous generations would have considered extravagant .
The Protestant work ethic is no longer ideal ( if it ever was ) , but it does prove people can exist without devoting themselves to material wealth .
This is important because material wealth is no more the answer today than it was yesterday .
The modern world presents us with a million choices ; to maximizeÂ personal fulfillment , we mustÂ navigateÂ those choices with intention , willfulness , and purpose .
Zombie Medications
Wade Davis , author of the Serpent and the Rainbow ( 1985 ) , claims that a person can be turned into a zombie by administering two powders ( detrototoxin and datura ) into the bloodstream .
For the modern American zombie , we have Paxil , Prozac , Zoloft , and benzodiazepines .
We are quick to recognize the benefits of such drugs ( benefits which do exist ) , but seldom speak of the way they perpetuate meaninglessness .
Why does it not occur to us that our ever - increasing anxiety and depression might actually be trying to tell us something ?
Many people have a legitimate need for medication , but many others ( myself included at one point ) seek medication when they should be balancing their lives .
What better way to embrace American consumer zombification than to detach from our feelings ?
Destroying the Zombie Within
The modern American zombieâ€™s greatest victim is himself ; therefore , the zombie is responsible for his own awakening .
Have you become a zombie ?
If youâ€™re not sure , ask yourself these questions :
Does your job fulfill you ?
Do you understand and approve of the reasons you live your life the way you do ?
Do you find yourself on a quest for more material things even after achieving a comfortable lifestyle ?
If you answered no to the first two questions and yes to the last one , you may have joined the ranks of the undead .
The only way to reclaim your humanity is to begin living your life with purpose .
You can start by reading my six part series of articles on living a synergistic life .
If you disagree with my methodology for finding purpose , pioneer your own .
The clock is ticking , my friend .
Every day we spend undead brings us one day closer to a real death from which our present form will never awaken .
I do n’t know about you , but every company I ’ve ever worked at had a Fort Knox like system in place for deploying code to the production server .
Typically , deployment looks something like this ( some with more steps , some with less ) :
Grab the labeled ( tagged ) code from the version control system .
Obviously , ensure that the application must compile .
Another developer other than the author must review the code on some level and sign off on it .
Automated unit tests must pass .
If they exist , the automated system and integration tests must pass .
The QA team tests the application and approves it .
The deployment engineer ( typically a developer or QA person ) very carefully deploys the application attempting to avoid any downtime .
Interestingly enough , many of these companies did n’t have the same procedures for other documents and systems used to run the business .
For example , one could in theory login to their CMS system and change the home page of the site to contain every expletive in the book just for fun and it would show up immediately .
There are a lot of people who want to make it so that the business user can write code by connecting legos .
The typical examples include dynamic rules engines and their ilk .
Yeah , let ’s let Joe the finance guy tweak the rules on the rules engine on the fly by drawing lines and connecting boxes .
The problem with approaches like this is that it ignores the fact that the effect of these changes is no different than writing code , but often with much fewer checks on quality before it gets deployed to where it can do damage .
These systems often are lacking :
Version Control
Backup and Restore procedures
Quality Assurance testing
Formal Deployment procedures
A recent report ( via Reddit ) illustrates this point with a list of news stories on how errors in spreadsheets have cost businesses millions of dollars .
A couple of telling snippets ( emphasis mine ) .
This one on the lack of version control and auditing :
http://www.namibian.com.na/2005/October/national/05E0F49179.html
The Agricultural Bank of Namibia ( Agribank ) is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy .
“ There is no system of control on which the auditors can rely nor were there satisfactory auditing procedures that could be performed to obtain reasonable assurance that the provision for doubtful debts is adequate and valid , ” note the auditors .
Auditors found that its loan amount to the now defunct !
Uri !
Khubis abattoir changed from N$ 59,5 million on one spreadsheet to N$ 50,4 million on another , while the total arrears was decreased from a whopping N$ 9,8 million to only N$ 710 000 .
And this one on the lack of training and Quality Assurance .
Only a matter of time before the spreadsheets hit the fan Telegraph ( UK ) , 30 June 2005
In his paper “ The importance and criticality of spreadsheets in the City of London ” presented to Eusprig 2005 , Grenville Croll of Frontline Systems ( UK ) Ltd. reported on a survey of 23 professionals in the £ 13 Bn financial services sector .
The interviewees said that spreadsheets were pervasive , and many were key and critical .
There is almost no spreadsheet software quality assurance and people who create or modify spreadsheets are almost entirely self - taught .
Two each disclosed a recent instance where material spreadsheet error had led to adverse effects involving many tens of millions of pounds .
The solution is not to make programming more like the way business users work now .
The solution is to apply the lessons learned from software development into other business processes .
In the same way that companies rely on heavily trained developers and rigid deployment procedures in place for code , companies should make sure their business people are just as heavily trained in the software they use on a day to day basis .
After all , million dollar decisions are based on the content of these systems daily .
For example , spreadsheets should be version controlled .
Changes to rules within a rules engine should have to pass some automated tests and manual QA before being deployed .
All of these should be peer reviewed .
" I believe I crossed the lines , but I did n’t mean to , " Monica Goodling told the House Judiciary Committee .
Remember that ?
That was Monica 's half - assed nonsense , designed to weasel out of actually admitting out loud what she did -- i.e. , that she broke the law .
Crossed the line , but did n't mean to .
Well , that 's not what this e-mail ( h/t : Think Progress ) says to me :
" [ S ] end directly up to me , outside of system . "
Send what ?
Send the secret directive , revealed only last month by Murray Waas of the National Journal , directly delegating unprecedented and virtually unchecked hiring and firing authority over non-civil service DoJ employees .
That 's what .
Crossed the line , but did n't mean to .
Did n't mean to specifically ask that the directive be sent up to you outside of the system ?
Or did n't mean to ... get caught doing it ?
Our own Dave the Rave puts it this way :
Reporter Amir Taheri told the prime minister 's spokeswoman that an interview with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert published under his name on German magazine Focus ' website Saturday had not been written by him .
Interview Missile raid would hit Iran nuclear plans - Olmert Gil Yaron Prime minister tells Germany ’s Focus magazine Islamic Republic ’s disputed nuclear program could be severely damaged by firing 1,000 cruise missiles in 10 - day attack ; ‘ nobody ruling military action out , ’ he says ; PM's Office : Interview never took place Missile raid would hit Iran nuclear plans - Olmert
Taheri said that the material published was not what he had passed to the magazine , and that he had asked the editors to remove the story from the site .
" I apologize to you , " he told the spokeswoman , Miri Eisin .
Earlier , the magazine quoted Olmert as saying that Iran 's disputed nuclear program could be severely hit by firing 1,000 cruise missiles in a 10 - day attack .
The magazine later changed the story 's aggressive headline , " Israel threaten Iran , " to " Israel toughens its tone against Iran . "
Focus officials have also admitted that " the impression that was created as if Olmert said that there was an operative plan to strike was exaggerated , and it is now clear that Olmert 's statements were not aimed as a threat on Iran . "
However , in a conversation with Ynet the editors stood by their initial reports and insisted that the text of the interview circulated in the media was correct and will be published tomorrow .
Taken out of context
An examination of the transcript of Olmert 's conversation with the reporter revealed that the PM 's perceived aggressiveness in the interview resulted from the fact that fine nuances of his English statements were " lost in translation . "
In the original version of the interview in English , Olmert did mention – albeit in passing - the option of striking Iran , claiming that " no one has ever ruled it out . "
However , he stressed that the international community should focus on sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The prime minister also referred to the dangers of an attack on Iran , and stated that he would not want to turn the whole Iranian people into Israel 's enemy .
" Such an operation would turn other Muslim countries against us and cause even bigger problems , " Olmert added and explained that Israel had no plans to attack .
The Prime Minister 's Office said Saturday that the interview with Focus never took place .
" The statements published are an utter lie and were never said …
This cynical abuse of an invitation for a background conversation , which led to the publication of a false report , " the office stated .
However , sources at the magazine insisted that their reporter had met with Olmert for an hour and - a - half last Wednesday .

Why You Should Work Smart , Not Hard
How much harder would you have to work to earn an extra $ 50 a day ?
How about $ 100 or $ 500 more ?
Why is this an important question to ask ?
Because there are only 24 hours in a day and we do n’t want to spend them all working !
Your Precious Time
Your time is valuable .
Once it ’s used up , you ’ll never get it back .
In today ’s world , we spend a lot of time working to provide for ourselves and our families .
If we can find ways to earn more money in smaller amounts of time then we can have more time to live .
We can often accomplish the same end result with much less work if we work smart instead of working hard .
Smart Questions
Working smart is often the result of asking yourself the appropriate questions .
Should I be working on this in the first place ?
What value do you get from the task you ’re working on ?
If you ’re working your fingers to the bone for a measly outcome , should you even be spending your time on it ?
What are your other options ?
If you decide you ’re not working smart then make some changes .
Is there a better way to do it ?
Could you change the process you use for the things you ’re working on ?
What takes the longest or is the most frustrating about your task ?
What is one thing you could change to make it go more quickly , easily , or profitably ?
How are other people doing the same thing ?
Find people that are doing the same type of thing faster and better .
Do they use a whole different strategy ?
What about their approach is “ smart ” ?
What allows them to get the same thing done with higher quality in less time ?
Hard Work is Good For You
Hard work is not a bad thing .
Most successful people work very hard for their achievements .
Hard work is the driving force behind most success and helps you appreciate that success when it comes .
However , if you have the option of working hard or smart , which would you rather do ?
Hard Work as a Substitute
I am a hard worker .
I often fall asleep at the keyboard in the middle of the night because there is always one more thing I want to do .
This work ethic has gotten me far in life but I wonder if it has also held me back .
Often times I find myself working hard because I do n’t know exactly what I ’m doing , the best way to do it , or what I ’m trying to accomplish .
I throw myself into something head first and after enough work , success comes out the other end .
Although I get positive results , I find myself working most of the time with this approach .
So I ask myself , am working hard because I ’m not working smart ?
If I was smart about my decisions , could I accomplish the same result with less work ?
Smart Resources
Here are some books that can help us examine why and how we work .
These books look at ways to become more strategic about how we select work and more efficient in getting things done :
– 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey [ Audio ]
– Getting Things Done by David Allen [ Audio ]
– 4 - Hour Workweek : Escape 9 - 5 , Live Anywhere , and Join the New Rich by Timothy Ferriss [ Audio ]

Parents urged to not use Covid tests ' inappropriately '
Thousands of letters have been sent to parents in our region asking them to only book a coronavirus test if their child displays specific symptoms .
Helene Cooper in the New York Times :
Mr. Cheney and hawks in his office , however , have become increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of progress in curbing Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Allies of Mr. Cheney continue to say publicly that the United States should include a change in Iran ’s leadership as a viable policy option , and have argued , privately , that the United States should encourage Israel to consider a military strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Julian Borger and Ian Black in the Guardian :
The US has called a meeting of major powers in Washington next Friday to discuss Iran 's defiance of UN resolutions calling for its suspension of uranium enrichment .
It comes amid signs that the Bush administration is running out of patience with diplomatic efforts to curb the nuclear programme .
Hawks led by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , are intensifying their push for military action , with support from Israel and privately from some Sunni Gulf states .
" Washington is seriously reviewing plans to bomb not just nuclear sites , but oil sites , military sites and even leadership targets .
The talk is of multiple targets , " said Mr Cronin .
" In Washington there is very serious discussion that this is a window that has to be looked at seriously because there is only six months to ' do something about Iran ' before it will be looked at as a purely political issue . "
Philip Sherwell and Tim Shipman in the U.K.
Telegraph :
Now it has emerged that Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , who has been pushing for a diplomatic solution , is prepared to settle her differences with Vice - President Dick Cheney and sanction military action .
In a chilling scenario of how war might come , a senior intelligence officer warned that public denunciation of Iranian meddling in Iraq - arming and training militants - would lead to cross border raids on Iranian training camps and bomb factories .
Not convinced ?
How about this ?
Wesley Clark in the Washington Post :
Think another war can't happen ?
Think again .
Unchastened by the Iraq fiasco , hawks in Vice President Cheney 's office have been pushing the use of force .
There is still a possibility that this is all part of a game to pressure Iran to do anything from backing off in Iraq to abandoning their civilian nuclear power research .
But with rhetoric this heated , things can quickly spiral out of control .
Consider this :
Iran 's leaders have so far shown every sign of relishing the confrontation .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , declared yesterday that American policies had failed in the Middle East and warned : " I am certain that one day Bush and senior American officials will be tried in an international court for the tragedies they have created in Iraq . "
That does n't sound like a man that is thinking about backing down .
The U.K. Telegraph article has some alleged inside baseball .
Miss Rice 's bottom line is that if the administration is to go to war again it must build the case over a period of months and win sufficient support on Capitol Hill .
The Sunday Telegraph has been told that Mr Bush has privately promised her that he would consult " meaningfully " with Congressional leaders of both parties before any military action against Iran on the understanding that Miss Rice would resign if this did not happen .
If you read through the publicly available evidence against Iran ( varying from their nuclear ambitions and capabilities to their malevolent role in Iraq ) the evidence is as weak or weaker than the case that was made against Iraq .
These articles attempt to address this problem , but they really just show that Bush and Cheney hope to instigate a war .
Philip Sherwell and Tim Shipman in the U.K.
Telegraph :
In a chilling scenario of how war might come , a senior intelligence officer warned that public denunciation of Iranian meddling in Iraq - arming and training militants - would lead to cross border raids on Iranian training camps and bomb factories .
A prime target would be the Fajr base run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force in southern Iran , where Western intelligence agencies say armour - piercing projectiles used against British and US troops are manufactured .
Under the theory - which is gaining credence in Washington security circles - US action would provoke a major Iranian response , perhaps in the form of moves to cut off Gulf oil supplies , providing a trigger for air strikes against Iran 's nuclear facilities and even its armed forces .
Julian Borger and Ian Black in the Guardian :
Vincent Cannistraro , a former CIA counter - terrorism chief who is now a security analyst , said : " The decision to attack was made some time ago .
It will be in two stages .
If a smoking gun is found in terms of Iranian interference in Iraq , the US will retaliate on a tactical level , and they will strike against military targets .
The second part of this is : Bush has made the decision to launch a strategic attack against Iranian nuclear facilities , although not before next year .
He has been lining up some Sunni countries for tacit support for his actions . "
Evidence of Sunni backing ?
But a belief has been growing in Iran , which administration officials have pointedly not tried to stem , that the Bush administration was considering military strikes against Iran .
An Israeli airstrike in Syria last week kicked up speculation in the Iranian press that Israel , in alliance with the United States , was really trying to send a message to Iran that it could strike Iranian nuclear facilities if it chose to .
" If I were the Iranians , what I ’d be freaked out about is that the other Arab states did n’t protest " the airstrike , said George Perkovich , vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
" The Arab world nonreaction is a signal to Iran , that Arabs are n’t happy with Iran ’s power and influence , so if the Israelis want to go and intimidate and violate the airspace of another Arab state that ’s an ally of Iran , the other Arab states are n’t going to do anything . "
George Perkovich might be freaked out , but the Iranians might be something else :
The Iranians also have reason to be sceptical .
They hear some of the rhetoric coming out of Washington and conclude that , whatever they do , they will be attacked .
So they may conclude that the only course of action is full acceleration towards a nuclear deterrent .
Considering how far Iran is away from actually having a nuclear bomb and how close we are to having a new administration , we cannot allow this attack on Iran to go on in the next 16 months .
We can't hope that Condi Rice will resign , or that her resignation will prevent an attack .
We have to impeach , convict , and remove this administration .
Do n't say it can't be done .
It has to be done .
Or it 's Armageddon .
Helio Ocean
UPDATE 5/11/2007 :
First things first : sod the iPhone .
Yeah , you read right , forget about it .
Stop saving 10 - percent of your pay - packet every month , do n’t sign 18 to 24 months of your life away to Cingular , think laterally , not with the crowd .
Helio have just blown everyone out of the water , and ironically they ’ve done it with the Ocean .
Dual - slide for both number pad and full QWERTY .
3G for screaming downloads .
Two - megapixel camera with flash , GPS , full HTML browser , 2.4 - inch 260 k colour QVGA display , on - board stereo speakers , 200MB of internal memory and microSD for more than 2GB more , USB Mass Storage Mode with PC and Mac compatibility …
I ’m throwing all this out in one fat chunk because if I were to talk you through it we ’d be here all day .
And a fat chunk it certainly is n’t : at 4.33 x 2.2 x .86 inches it ’s smaller in all dimensions than the Sidekick 3 , as well as being lighter at just 5.61 oz .
It takes all the usual Helio goodies like instant messaging from Windows Live , Yahoo ! and AIM , made super - simple thanks to the full keyboard , then adds out - of - the - box support for AOL , Hotmail , Gmail , EarthLink and Yahoo !
Mail , Helio ’s own email service of course , and Microsoft Exchange for push - email .
Extra accounts can be added thanks to custom POP and IMAP profiles .
GPS - reliant features like Buddy Beacon and Google Maps are joined by the new Helio UP service , a way of easily tagging photos with title , description , keywords and geographical location before uploading them to the online Helio Album .
Alternatively Helio ’s tight MySpace integration means adding pictures to your profile is as straightforward as navigating those of your friends in either the browser , thanks to the Mini Map and page optimisation , or the MySpace on Helio v2 app .
A dedicated chip for handling music playback means you can eke fifteen hours of continuous audio from the media player , and of course there ’s support for your own tunes and those bought from Helio Music .
If you ’re already signed up to an all - you - can - eat PlaysForSure subscription service like Yahoo !
or Napster then you ’ll be pleased to hear Ocean can play those tracks too .
Stereo Bluetooth means you can cut the cord and enjoy your music wirelessly , and downloading fresh material is fast thanks to Ev-do .
So far , so awesome ; but all those features are n’t worth a soapy trout if the interface is n’t up to scratch .
Thankfully Helio have completely rejigged the UI to suit both portrait and landscape orientations of the new display , and preliminary feedback from our oh - so - fussy sources tell us that it ’s every bit as user - friendly as you ’d hope .
Integration between apps is tighter than the North Korean border , with contact lists tied into each of the IM services for “ presence detection ” and instant address book search direct from the idle screen .
Traditionally convoluted web - searching is made indecently simple ; flick out the keyboard and start typing , direct from the idle screen .
Ocean automatically searches Yahoo ! , Google , Wikipedia and any other provider you choose , serving results up in a tabbed interface together with local results tied into your GPS location .
Meanwhile , the single messaging hub brings together email , SMS , MMS and IM in one dashboard , and Ocean is clever enough to automatically decide on message format depending on recipient and whether pictures or video are attached .
Support for multi-tasking means you can still browse the net while listening to music , and with up to 5.1 hrs talk - time it does n’t fall short when it comes to basic phone duties either .
It ’s an awesome handset , and you can well believe it when Helio say that not only is Ocean the device the company was born to offer , but that it was in development even before the company was founded .
If there ’s still a part of you hankering after the iPhone , then maybe the price will convince you otherwise ; Ocean will drop this coming Spring with a MRSP of $ 295 .
Honestly , I ’m considering emigrating to the US just to sign a cellphone contract .
Rest assured that SlashGear will bring you a full hands - on report just as soon as demo models are available .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. laws informing communities where former sexual offenders live do little to protect children , but can lead to harassment and violence against the offenders , a Human Rights Watch report said on Wednesday .
The laws are ill conceived because children are more at risk of sexual abuse from a family member or trusted friend of the family than from a former sexual offender , Jamie Fellner , director of the U.S. program of Human Rights Watch , told reporters on a conference call .
“ Stranger danger is not the norm , ” Fellner said about community fears of repeat attacks by sexual offenders .
Government studies show that 90 percent of sexual attacks are committed by family members or trusted friends , he said .
All U.S. states have publicly accessible online sex registries that provide photographs and current addresses of former sex offenders .
HRW said the so - called Adam Walsh Act , signed last year by U.S. President George W. Bush , will increase the scope and duration of registration and community notification restrictions .
Some 22 states also have laws restricting where offenders can live , and hundreds of communities have broadened exclusion zones from 1,000 feet to 2,500 feet .
The laws can violate basic human rights of former offenders by making it difficult for them to find work and a place to live , the report said
In many states , anyone can access online registries that list where sex offenders live , which can lead to harassment by community members .
In at least one case , a former offender was killed by community members , said the report titled “ No Easy Answers : Sex Offender Laws in the United States . ”
When the offenders can’t find a place to live , they can be forced to move to obscure places far from family , therapy and police surveillance , said Fellner .
Sometimes registration covers everyone convicted of a sexual crime , including people unlikely to attack children such as those convicted of consensual sex with a teenager , it said .
More than 600,000 people are registered , including those convicted of nonviolent crimes , it said .
Human Rights
Watch urged reform of state and federal registration laws as well as community notification laws , and the elimination of residency restrictions , saying they violate basic rights of former offenders .
“ We have let politicians get away with focusing on these laws as the only way to stop the problem , ” said Fellner , who said public attention should be shifted to “ where sexual violence is happening .
Often it ’s happening in the home . ”
But cases such as the 2005 rape and murder of 9 - year - old Jessica Lunsford , who was snatched from her Florida home and buried alive in a garbage bag , have grabbed headlines .
John Evander Couey , who had been required to register as a sex offender before the crime , confessed to the killing and a Florida judge in August sentenced him to death .
Steve Roddel , the creator of a sex offender registry called www.familywatchdog.us, said the laws should not be changed exactly because of the high potential of sexual abuse in the home .
“ Some women have found through these registries that their husbands or fiancees are sex offenders , ” he said .
Kucinich working on ' renewed efforts ' for Cheney impeachment
With his resolution calling for the ouster of Dick Cheney , Rep. Dennis Kuchinich on Wednesday announced renewed efforts to impeach the vice president .
The Ohio Democrat said his resolution calling for Cheney 's impeachment now has eight co-sponsors .
Kucinich appeared with Rep. Maxine Waters , D - Calif. , Wednesday at a press conference announcing the stepped - up efforts .
Kucinich announced the impeachment resolution a month ago on Capitol Hill and gathered reporters at the same spot Wednesday .
" Now since we gathered over a month ago , the Vice President has continued along the path of conduct that led me to file the articles of Impeachment , " Kucinich said , according to a transcript of his remarks .
Fifteen state Democratic parties and 11 state legislatures have passed resolutions calling for President Bush or Cheney to be impeached , according to pro-impeachment Web site AfterDowningStreet.org .
Waters ' addition as co-sponsor of Kucinich 's measure comes after she voiced support for Cheney 's removal last month .
Waters has advocated impeachment for Bush and Cheney since at least summer 2005 , AfterDowning Street notes .
Other co-sponsors of Kucinich 's impeachment resolution are California Democrats Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee , who co-chair the House progressive caucus , along with Al Wynn , D - Md. ; Yvette Clark , D - N.Y. ; Jan Schakowsky , D - Il. ; and William Lacy Clay , D - Mo .
" I believe this is another milestone , " Kucinich said .
" With the support of the leaders of the Progressive Caucus and the leader of the Out of Iraq Caucus we will see more and more Members of Congress signing on in this effort to save our Constitution and protect the very values that bind us as a nation . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this article indicated Rep .
Wynn attended the press conference .
He cosponsored the legislation but did not appear at the press conference .
When the videogames = violent kids debate rages , Nintendo is usually far from the fray , but as CVG reports , some parents have big problems with the soon - to - be- released Wii Zapper .
Here 's a sampling of the comments sent in to the Parental Guidance blog at the New Jersey Star Ledger :
Great , this is what we need .
Children with guns learning how to aim and shoot .
Then we can sit back and wonder what is happening to our country with kids killing kids ...... what 's next ?
Could we make it squirt blood , too ?
That 's a hack just begging to be made , now is n't it ?
Keep reading for more .
The gun like remote will get someone killed .... unless it 's pink with a flag in the muzzel [ sic ] .
Toys guns of yesteryear were red , blue and whatever ... no ligitimate reason to risk anyones life .
The idiot that made the remote should have his / her brain checked .... if they have one .
Yes , it 's easy to see how the pearly whiteness of the Zapper could easily be confused with , say , a Glock .
To be fair , however , the wording of the question these folks are answering does n't paint an entirely accurate picture of what the Zapper is :
Wii announced over the summer that it 's coming out the a gun- like remote , so kids can play shooter games , with , well , a shooter .
What do you think about making a wand in the shape of a weapon so play is more realistic ?
Is it harmful ?
Will you buy one for your kids ?
That said , here 's my personal nominee for the Forehead Slap of the Day Award .
I think it 's irresponsible for Wii to come out with a controller that looks like a gun so kids can play games simulating shooting .
What kind of message are we sending as parents when we buy these things for our kids ?
Great question .
What message , indeed , are you sending as a parent when you buy something for your child that you 're morally opposed to ?
Clearly , the irresponsibility here rests squarely at Nintendo 's doorstep .
What do we think of Wii ? [ Parental Guidance , via CVG ]
I was in the middle of putting the finishing touches on an short piece about Iraqi Sunni politics due out later today when I got an urgent flash that Abd al - Sattar Abu Risha had been murdered in Anbar .
Nothing could have been more predictable than the murder of Abu Risha , the man most closely identified with America 's Anbar strategy .
He was the public face of the turn against al - Qaeda , and Petraeus immediately said that " it shows Al Qaeda in Iraq remains a very dangerous and barbaric enemy . "
But there 's no reason to assume that al - Qaeda killed him - I 'd guess that one of the nationalist insurgency groups , the ones which current American rhetoric pretends do n't exist - is a more likely suspect .
Other tribes deeply resented him .
The major nationalist insurgency groups had recently issued a series of statements denouncing people who would illegitimately seize the fruits of their victorious jihad - of whom he was the prime example .
All those photographs which swamped the Arab media showing him shaking hands with President Bush made him even more a marked man than before .
His murder graphically demonstrates that the other groups threatened by the American Anbar strategy were never going to just sit back passively and allow it to succeed - an obvious strategic point which has always seemed to elude surge advocates .
The Sunni strategy as presented by surge advocates has always rested not only on a whole series of dubious claims about Iraqi Sunni politics , but also relies on a whole series of best - case scenarios in which nothing could go wrong .
In Iraq , something always goes wrong .
It 's a major setback for the strategy , particularly at the symbolic level .
Even if Abu Risha was a poor choice to " lead " the strategy , he was in fact elevated to that symbolic position by American propaganda and practice ( that meeting with the President , for instance ) .
His murder demonstrates that even America 's closest friends are not untouchable - not even on the day of a Presidential address expected to rely heavily on progress in Anbar .
The political fallout of the murder inside of Iraq may well exceed Abu Risha 's actual role in Sunni politics .
More later .
UPDATE : Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the assassination .
According to an Iraqi blogger , Abu Risha 's tribal rival Ali Hatem Sulayman blamed al - Qaeda for the assassination during an al - Arabiya interview ( I did n't see it ) .
The insurgency 's forums are joyous , with " Allahu Akbars " everywhere .
Virtually every story , whether in sympathetic or hostile Iraqi outlets , features the same pictures of Abu Risha with Bush .
The al - Boraq forum , which runs statements from all factions but is currently hosted on the server of the Islamic Army of Iraq , features a post which praises God for the killing : " the mujahideen promised and they delivered . "
One posting on the al - Falojah forum asks " what has happened to us Iraqis , that we celebrate the killing of one of our brothers ? " - but receives little sympathy in the comments which follow .
The most telling reaction : the Anbar Salvation Council itself is publicly pointing the finger at the Maliki government .
So much for " bottom - up reconciliation " : the first instinct of America 's chosen Sunni interlocutors , and the core of " bottom up reconciliation " , is to blame the Shia - led national government for the murder of their leader .
Humans come back to Navassa now and then .
In 1917 , a 162 - foot lighthouse was built there , in part to light the approach to Panama and the new canal .
A lighthouse keeper lived there until 1929 , when an automatic beacon was installed .
During World War II , an observation post was erected by the Navy .
No Nazis were ever sighted .
Responsibility for Navassa has shifted from one government agency to another , each uncertain of who should be in charge of our giant guano lump .
For a while Navassa was considered part of the Guantánamo naval base .
Then it was part of the Coast Guard .
Since 1976 , it has been lodged in the Department of the Interior , an unlikely destination for an island that could not be less internal .
There the story would appear to end , the forlorn tale of the little island that could n’t .
But just as Navassa survived war , piracy and the rise and fall of empires , so it appears perfectly able to survive bureaucracy .
Now new explorers are visiting .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has undertaken a “ remote sensing experiment ” to create a detailed topographical map of Navassa that will help monitor the island ’s reaction to climate change , hurricanes and the rise of water levels around the world .
This seems a fitting result for a place that was never all that comfortably on the map in the first place .
This island , so inhospitable to humans , is in its own way a natural paradise .
Navassa may offer the most pristine Caribbean environment left , and in 1999 it was declared a National Wildlife Refuge .
A huge number of plant and animal species can be found within its three square miles .
Recent investigations have shown the number of known species , once thought to be 150 , is closer to 650 .
Many of these species — lizards , insects and trees — exist nowhere else .
One solitary palm , thought to have disappeared in 1928 , appears to be the last of its kind .
A lonely predicament ; but like Navassa , it survives .
These efforts to learn more about Navassa ’s environment are not universally appreciated .
Many Haitians , resentful of the American interest in Navassa , believe that the science is simply a cover for the same old greed .
A lively topic of conversation in Haiti is that the United States has discovered gold on Navassa , or perhaps uranium , or even the gateway to Atlantis , the legendary lost civilization .
In 1989 , some Haitians occupied Navassa , albeit very briefly .
After a couple of hours , they left it to the lizards .
What lies ahead for this remote outpost of American sovereignty ?
On the 150th anniversary of the year Navassa came into American possession , it feels a bit unseemly to see the world ’s richest nation entangled in a dispute with the poorest nation in our hemisphere over a remote rock that no one can live on .
It 's been rumored before , now Sony 's marketing manager for Computer Entertainment in New Zealand has apparently , and likely pre-emptively , unveiled Sony 's intentions to turn the PS3 into a digital video recorder .
Sony 's Warwick Light is quoted in an interview with New Zealand 's The Press as saying , " We 're also hoping next year – about the same time that Freeview launches its terrestrial broadcasting service ( expected to be in March ) – to release a digital tuner for the PS3 , turning it into a programmable TV recorder . "
Sure , why not , but we 're going to need a hell of a lot more than 80 GB or 120 GB of storage to make that thing useful for HD recordings .

A new study ( PDF ) in Environmental Health Perspectives addresses claims that some individuals are sensitive to radio - frequency radiation ( rf - emf ) , in this case to the area of the spectrum used by cell phones .
Reading it gave me a strange sense of déjà vu , as the methodology of the study closely followed the approach used to explore similar claims in regards to WiFi radiation .
In both studies , individuals who claimed to be sensitive were unable to accurately identify when they were being exposed to radiation .
The study was conducted in Britain , where its authors noted that up to four percent of the population claims to be subject to what is known as " electromagnetic hypersensitivity " ( the World Health Organization has recently given it the catchy name " idiopathic environmental intolerance with attribution to electromagnetic fields , " or IEI - EMF ) .
But the authors point out that experimental evidence for this disorder is completely lacking :
A systematic review of 31 blind and double - blind provocation studies yielded no evidence that IEI - EMF individuals could detect the presence of rf-emf , and only seven studies indicated that exposure to rf -emf did affect health indices ( Rubin et al. 2005 ) .
In two of these , however , the authors failed to replicate their own findings .
Another four studies involved inappropriate use of statistics , while one reported improved mood in the active exposure condition .
Despite the absence of any evidence that IEI - EMF exists , the authors explored whether cell phone radiation might trigger physiological responses .
56 individuals who claimed to be rf-emf sensitive , along with 120 controls , were recruited ; 12 test subjects and 6 controls dropped out during the study .
The subjects were asked to rate their status in terms of a number of measures ( " anxious " , " tense " , " agitated " , " relaxed " , " discomfort " , and " tired " ) while pulse , heart rate , and skin conductance were measured .
During an initial session , test subjects were informed of sequential exposures to cellular transmission equipment for both the GSM and UMTS protocols .
After that , all exposures in that and three further sessions were performed in a double - blind manner .
During these sessions , individuals were asked to determine whether they felt they were being exposed at any particular moment .
The results were pretty clear .
As the authors put it , " sensitive participants reported more symptoms than controls , but this was not related to exposure . "
GSM use did not correlate with symptoms , and an apparent difference in response to UMTS went away once the fact that it was over - represented in the first double - blind test was accounted for .
Heart and blood flow measures were normal , and all sensitive individuals had high levels of skin conductance during all double - blind trials , regardless of exposure .
Individuals claiming to be sensitive were unable to detect exposure at rates that were significantly different from random .
So , with both WiFi and cell phone sensitivity apparently eliminated , will this finally lay the issue to rest ?
Do n't count on it .
The BBC is reporting that an activist group is already focusing on the individuals that withdrew following the first session , claiming that these represented the most sensitive individuals , and that the exposure during the test made them too ill to continue .
The continuing controversy suggests that further studies that also give me a sense of déjà vu may be needed .

My father once told me , " Never start a fight you do n't intend to finish . "
Master Chief 's pappy must have said something similar to him long before John - 117 became a Spartan , because in Halo 3 , the iconic action hero does indeed finish the fight .
There is no cliffhanger ending that will have you screaming at your television , no doubting that this is Chief 's tale and everyone else is along for the ride , and no question that it is a worthy conclusion to the most successful trilogy in videogame history .
But just like that girl you dated in college , Halo 3 has some issues .
Do n't ' worry ; the good far outweighs the bad .
This is Halo 3 , and it is indeed the game you 've been waiting for the past three years .
You +can+rip+a+turret+from+its+mounting+and+take+it+with+you .
When last we left Master Chief , he was headed towards Earth , determined to stop the Prophet of Truth and his cadre of Brutes from destroying the universe in a blaze of zealotry .
Cortana had been captured by the Gravemind , a disgusting creature intimately tied to the Flood .
The Arbiter and his Elites , once bitter enemies of humankind had made an uneasy truce in order to conquer a greater evil .
Frankly , things did n't look so hot for Earth and its inhabitants .
For three years fans have been waiting to find out what comes next .
Most wo n't be disappointed , as the story eschews some of the ambiguity of Halo 2 and tells a more straightforward narrative .
Events play out like a sci-fi action blockbuster .
Lost , though , is the intriguing side - story of the Arbiter and his Elites .
The focus is clearly ( and perhaps deservedly ) on Master Chief .
That means in the single - player campaign you will be Chief and Chief only .
The Arbiter is just a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword .
While keeping players locked in as Master Chief is a wise decision on Bungie 's part , it 's a shame that the Arbiter 's story fades so far into the background .
That 's not to say I want to spend half the adventure following the Arbiter and leaving Chief to twiddle his thumbs , but it would have been nice to see such a prominent storyline from Halo 2 have more weight in the cinematic telling of Halo 3 .
Clearly Bungie was listening to the criticisms of Halo 2 .
Not only is Chief in the driver 's seat once more , but the environments are varied enough that each level feels distinct .
Though you will still need to backtrack in a few areas , it 's not as tedious as in previous iterations .
The levels in Halo 3 lend to spectacular pacing that weaves from close - quarters , intense battles with Chief and a few soldiers , to more epic arenas .
It does feel as if the marine presence is lighter than it should be , but there 's enough chaos in the field to at least make it appear as if Master Chief is part of something grander .
Most of the nine levels are hunky - dory , but the penultimate chapter is so bad , just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth .
It 's the kind of level where , if playing through Halo 3 again , I might just stop once I reached it and not bother finishing the skirmish , much less the fight .
It should be noted that the difficulty level is a bit out of whack , though done purposefully .
Bungie has to service an enormous casual crowd who ( let 's face it ) suck at games .
There are millions who will play Halo 3 and only Halo 3 this year .
All they want is to finish the fight and take a nap on the couch .
But at the same time , there are an equal number of hardcore gamers who have become immensely skilled at Halo over the past six years .
For these folks , the single - player version of Heroic and Legendary difficulties has been ratcheted up just a tad .
Many will immediately jump into Normal difficulty , and never see the more aggressive AI that calls in reinforcements and makes better use of its weapons and equipment .
Frankly , Normal on Halo 3 is too easy for the average gamer and that lack of challenge may actually bore some .
Although we would n't expect to find the latest release of Photoshop on your neighborhood ATM , it 's not so far fetched to think that Paint would be left on a Windows - based ATM .
We 've seen a recent boost in cash machine hacking of late , and while this latest attempt does n't siphon illegal coinage out of the slot , it does make for quite a laugh .
Joining the pitiful array of other Windows - powered mishaps , a sharp cameraphone - toting individual spotted a local ATM that had a beautifully hand - crafted Paint message on the front screen in place of the typical " Insert your card to begin transaction , " and while we 've already said too much about a picture that speaks a million words , be sure to click on through to see how accessing an ATM 's start menu can lead to all sorts of mischievous mayhem .

Top officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency knew about reports of possible health problems from formaldehyde in trailers provided to Hurricane Katrina victims , according to documents released Thursday by a House committee .
The warnings from Gulf Coast field workers were brushed aside because “ senior FEMA officials in Washington ... did n’t want the moral and legal responsibility to do what they knew had to be done , ” said Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , as he opened a hearing into the agency ’s response .
Documents from the agency ’s general counsel advised FEMA officials against agreeing to testing because of the fear of liability for health problems among the 120,000 families who were temporarily housed in the trailers .
“ Do not initiate any testing until we give the OK , ” one FEMA attorney wrote on June 15 , 2006 , three months after the first news reports appeared about possible formaldehyde - related problems .
“ Once you get results and should they indicate some problem , the clock is running on our duty to respond to them . ”
Advertisement
Waxman ’s frustration with FEMA was shared by the committee ’s top Republican , Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia , who said that the agency “ failed to get information they needed and failed to act to prevent this crisis . ”
“ FEMA ’s reaction to the problem was deliberately stunted to bolster the agency ’s litigation position , ” he said .
Davis said FEMA officials had acted to obstruct an almost yearlong investigation into the allegations by incorrectly invoking attorney - client privilege on most of the 5,000 pages of documents released Thursday .
But the agency ’s director , R. David Paulison , denied taking a cue from legal counsel when setting agency policy .
“ The general counsel does not set policy for this organization , ” said Paulison , who joined FEMA as acting director in September 2005 and was confirmed as its chief eight months later .
“ The health and safety of residents is my primary concern . ”

He would not confirm that formaldehyde had contributed to any illnesses , and said that FEMA trailers would soon be tested for mold , airborne bacteria and more , including formaldehyde .
The tests , announced Wednesday , will be conducted in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Formaldehyde is a common component of glues , molded plastics and building materials , including particleboard used in manufactured homes .
Symptoms of long - term exposure can include respiratory problems , burning eyes or nose , headaches and bloody noses .
The International Agency for Research on Cancer identifies the chemical as a carcinogen in humans .
Committee members argued that FEMA had ample opportunity to test the trailers after about 200 residents lodged complaints referring specifically to formaldehyde .
Agency documents showed that only one inhabited trailer was tested , in April 2006 .
Its formaldehyde level was measured at 1.2 parts per million , 75 times higher than the maximum workplace exposure level set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health .
FEMA subsequently tested 96 new trailers last fall , but under what Waxman called dubious conditions -- their ventilation systems and air conditioners were constantly running and the windows were left open for three weeks before final readings were taken .
Asking individuals to live like that , Waxman noted , was not realistic .
Advertisement
“ We recognize that in the summertime on the Gulf Coast , that ’s not going to be reasonable , ” said Paulison , adding that the test conditions were set with advice from other agencies , including the Environmental Protection Agency .
Paul Stewart , a former Army officer and one of three trailer residents who testified that they had experienced formaldehyde - related illnesses , said he asked FEMA to test his trailer after the family ’s pet cockatiel became ill .
When nothing was done after several months , he obtained a test kit from a nonprofit group .
He called FEMA with the results , which he said were twice the workplace safety standard .
FEMA replaced that trailer with one that was dirty , said Stewart .
“ They told us it was brand - new , ” he said .
“ When I lifted the sheets on the bed , there were bugs crawling around in it . ”
Stewart ended up purchasing his own mobile home .
He also began helping the Sierra Club test other FEMA trailers , with 30 of 32 testing above the workplace standard .
Advertisement
“ We have lost a great deal through our dealings with FEMA , not the least of which is our faith in government , ” he said .
One committee member , Rep. Diane Watson ( D - Los Angeles ) , told of an experience as a member of the California state Senate .
She said formaldehyde in the carpet glue of her Sacramento office made her violently ill and she had to move .
“ My face was swollen .
I had stomach cramps , ” she said .
Watson pushed Paulison to agree not to sell or pass the trailers on to other users if they contained formaldehyde .
Paulison said that as long as the level of the chemical was determined to be safe , he did n’t see a problem .
Advertisement
“ All travel trailers made in America have formaldehyde in them .
We ’ll at least post something in these trailers to make sure people know they ’re not for long - term living , ” he said .
Rep. Mark Souder ( R - Ind. ) , whose district produces a majority of the country ’s trailers , chastised those who testified , saying they were jumping to conclusions in blaming an entire industry .
“ A sweeping statement does n’t cut it ; there needs to be actual checking and measurement , ” said Souder .
Committee members demanded that Paulison notify the almost 60,000 residents living in FEMA trailers of a potential risk of formaldehyde exposure .

Homeland security chair responds to Chertoff's ' gut ' Will Menaker
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Following yesterday 's statement by Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff that his remarks on the increased risk of terrorism this summer were based " on a gut feeling , " the Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson has sent a letter to Chertoff demanding an explanation , " what color code in the Homeland Security Advisory System is associated with a ' gut feeling ? '
What sectors should be on alert as a result of your gut feeling ?
The letter states , " Over the past five years , tens of billions of taxpayer dollars have been dedicated to standing up and building capacity at the Department of Homeland Security .
The Department of Homeland Security is charged with deterring , preventing and responding to the threat of terrorism .
To that end , systems have been erected to identify risks and communicate them to the American public .
With all the resources you have at your disposal and all the progress that you assure us that you are making , I cannot understand why you are quoted in the Chicago Tribune as saying you have a ' gut feeling ' that we are entering a period of heightened risk this summer . "
Thompson continues by asking Chertoff to further explain what measures the country should take based on his instincts , " What cities should be asking their law enforcement to work double shifts because of your gut feeling ? 
Are the American people supposed to purchase duct tape and plastic sheeting because of your ' gut feeling ? ' "
Later , he stresses the importance of specific , actionable , intelligence as it relates to the function of the Department of Homeland security , and stressed how counter - productive vague warnings of terror are , " I urge you to follow up on your ' gut feeling ' and share whatever information our nations first preventers need to be on alert and prepared .
Otherwise , we run the risk of communities taking it upon themselves to mobilize for every possible threat .
This not only would result in communities depleting their scarce homeland security resources but runs contrary to your efforts to move toward a risk - based approach to homeland security . "
Chairman Thompson closes by offering to hold classified briefings on the subject of this summer 's newly heightened terror alert .
Read whole letter here .
Just because your machine is n't a firewall - lacking , virus - ridden , spyware - infested zombie under the control of Eastern European crime syndicates does n't mean you 're a typical US computer user .
The reality is that viruses , spyware , and other computer threats have cost to US households an estimated $ 7 billion over the last two years alone , and 25 percent of all households are likely to become a " cybervictim " this year .
That 's the word from Consumer Reports , which just announced the results of its most recent " State of the Net " survey .
A sample of 2,000 US households turned up some surprising and troubling results about the level of basic computer literacy in this country .
For instance , after years of mainstream news stories about viruses , spyware , and the like , an estimated 3.7 million broadband - connected households still have yet to deploy a firewall .
There 's a bit of good news .
Spam appears to be dropping , in large part due to better spam filters ( and not to a lack of spammers trying to peddle their wares ) .
But spammers only remain in business so long as consumers continue to purchase dubious herbal concoctions , mortgages , and porn after reading unsolicited e-mail .
And no one does that , right ?
Right ?
Actually , people do .
Consumer Reports estimates that 650,000 people in the US " ordered a product or service advertised through spam in the month before the survey . "
Keep in mind , that 's a single month .
Viruses continue to plague computer users .
38 percent of US households reported a virus infection in the last two years , and 20 percent of all users had significant computer trouble because of it .
The situation is somewhat better when it comes to spyware — only nine percent reported a major problem — and phishing affects about 1 out of every 81 households .
Still , that translates into 23,000 phishing attacks in April 2007 alone .
Consumer Reports believes that , over the past two years , malware infestations have resulted in 1.8 million households replacing their PCs in order to free themselves of viruses and the like .
While the geeky set may avoid most of these horrors , it 's clear that average users are still experiencing plenty of pain .
Hopefully the situation will improve as people upgrade and new computers come equipped with default firewalls .
In the meantime , Consumer Reports suggests some sensible precautions : use a firewall and security software , take care when using public computers , and ... consider Mac .
" Because Macs are less prevalent than Windows - based machines , " we 're told , " online criminals get less of a return on their investment when targeting them . "
There you go .
With fund raising efforts exceeding expectations and seemingly unstoppable momentum , Ron Paul continues to be a candidate on the rise .
While other presidential campaigns have sputtered , peaked , and are on the decline , he has positioned himself to become a serious contender .
He still has a lot of room for growth , but in this process he is being elevated from second tier status to one of the top five Republican presidential candidates .
The success of his campaign has caught many by surprise , including himself .
Some of his rivals are now trying to duplicate his formula , but true spontaneous grassroots movements cannot be generated or manufactured .
His support is diverse , and what is becoming increasingly clear is that before all is said and done , Ron Paul will have made a huge impact , win or lose .
If we are going to defeat big government corruption and tyranny , and rid ourselves of huge deficits that are spiraling out of control , there will have to be a coming together of the people .
Unfortunately , the global elite have many of us trapped in the whole fake left / right paradigm which does nothing , but divide and conquer , and is designed to keep us down .
Many are blind to Republican corruption , but have no problem exposing the Democrats and vice versa .
What we have is both parties double teaming us with fake squabbles and theater politics , when essentially their goals are the same .
Only their methods , propaganda , and rhetoric differ a little .
The good news is that many are waking up , and the illusion is being shattered , which is evident by the increasing mistrust of both parties by the people , coupled with low congressional and presidential approval ratings .
Ron Paul running as a Republican and not as an independent has resulted in more exposure , and has placed him on more of an even playing field , with a better chance of becoming president .
He is the dream candidate we have all been waiting for .
We must rally around him , do what is right , and vote according to our conscience , not party affiliation or tradition .
This is a historic opportunity , and everything in our power must be done to ensure a Ron Paul victory .
O n the campaign trail , Ron Paul has consistently demonstrated his ability to overcome adversity -- a trait that will serve him well if he becomes president .
A good example of overcoming adversity is the huge success of his Iowa rally , which was in response to being excluded from a candidates forum .
Even when he is in enemy territory and is being attacked from all sides , he remains calm , focused , and is n't distracted from the real issues and getting his message across .
Paul has accepted an invitation to participate in the CNN / You Tube debates , a format that will showcase his willingness to answer even the toughest questions .
It will give him an opportunity to interact with ordinary Americans on a national level , a role that unlike other candidates he excels in and relishes .
This will define his candidacy and further distinguish him from the others .
Perhaps not wanting to face Dr. Paul in such a capacity and sensing more harm than good coming out of these debates , both Guliani and Romney have not committed and are leaning towards non-participation .
If Ron Paul has another strong performance , they can later claim that the debates were n't legitimate since two of the supposed top candidates did not attend .
It 's all about downplaying and trying to minimize Ron Paul 's accomplishments .
The Iraq war is unpopular with the majority of the American people , and it is also becoming increasingly unpopular with the soldiers fighting in this conflict .
This discontent has translated into considerable contributions to Ron Paul 's campaign from our military personnel more so than any other candidate .
Ron Paul was against the Iraq war from the beginning , even when opposing it was seen as unpatriotic .
Many of the troops recognize that if he is elected president , they will come back home to their families sooner .
In an effort to hopefully speed up this process , Ron Paul has teamed up with Dennis Kucinich along with other Democrats to introduce a bill that would repeal President Bush 's authority to use force in Iraq .
He stated ,
“ I think if you approach this from a constitutional viewpoint , we can join hands with the left as well as the right and come up with solutions and get our troops home . ”
This shows his leadership capabilities and demonstrates his willingness to reach across the aisle to get things accomplished .
We the People have an opportunity to use Ron Paul as a vehicle to fix and save a broken America .
The question on many people 's minds is if his huge internet support can manifest itself and translate into stronger polling numbers .
He is starting to register at 3 % in some national polls , and as more hear his message , these numbers will steadily increase .
The stage is being set for this Republican dark horse candidate to be elevated to main event status .
He will be able to build upon his success if he finishes strong in the first few primaries .
At that point it may already be too late to stop the Ron Paul juggernaut , and many will be shocked when he steps out of the shadows to become a legitimate top contender .
There are some who view the Constitution as something obsolete and an obstacle to their agenda .
Time after time both the congress and the president ignore it .
One man stands head and shoulders above all as its defender .
If believing in freedom and following the constitution is radical , then Ron Paul is as radical as they come .

On Friday , the media was abuzz with the discovery of a ‘ gene for obesity ’ .
Researchers funded by the Wellcome Trust found that people who carry a single copy of a variant of the FTO gene are 30 % more likely to be obese than people with no copies .
But one in six Europeans carry two copies of this variant , and they are 70 % more likely to be obese .
On average , these dual carriers weighed three kilograms heavier than their peers .
The FTO gene itself is a mystery .
Noone knows what it does or even which other genes it interacts with , and the Wellcome Trust team are now probably itching to find out .
But in this case , the reaction to the discovery was almost more interesting than the science itself .
If internet talkbacks are any indication , people roughly fall into two groups .
To the first camp , the findings echo their own experiences of finding it difficult to maintain a healthy body weight .
It points to something deeper and innate at work .
But the reactions from the other , slightly louder camp have been acrimonious to say the least .
To them , the discovery of the FTO variant is yet another way for obese people to brush off the burden of responsibility from their shoulders .
After all , they say , obesity is just a matter of eating healthily and exercising regularly .
To go beyond this is to over - complicate a simple lack of willpower .
And where exactly was this gene in post - war Britain when obesity levels were much lower ?
This attitude could n’t be more wrong or more unhelpful , and many of these complaints misunderstand the nature of obesity - related genes .
It is clear that obesity has some genetic basis , but no researcher worth their salt would imagine that a single gene dictates whether a person becomes obese or not .
Obesity - related genes are likely to work through much more delicate ways .
Some may affect how we metabolise food or lay down fat .
But subtlest of all are genes that affect our very behaviour .
These inherited influences could make individuals more responsive to the smells or sights of food .
They could make the brain less responsive to signals from the gut that say , “ I ’m full . ”
They could give people a strong innate preference for the chemicals that give fatty foods their taste , or equally put them off the chemicals ( often bitter ones ) within healthier choices .
In a society where food supplies are modest , say post - war Britain , variations in such genes across a population would n’t have much effect .
But in the 21st century , things are very different .
With more junk food widely available at cheaper cost , and active lives replaced by office jobs , cars and the telly , it is notoriously easy to eat lots and do little .
In this environment , small genetic differences that affect how people react to food or activity can have massive effects .
So where was the FTO variant in post - war Britain ?
Well , in all likelihood , it was around , but its effects have been masked until now .
Genes and environment interact with each other to affect our lives – nature and nurture usually walk hand in hand .
Obese people are likely to carry around a host of genetic variants that alter their behaviour in ways that leave them very vulnerable in a world where obesity is just around the corner .
Obesity then , is a complex disease with many underlying causes .
And because of this , throwing words like ‘ self - discipline ’ and ‘ laziness ’ about with cavalier abandon does nothing for the obesity debate or for obese people themselves .
After all , where are personality traits like ‘ discipline ’ housed , if not the brain ?
And what controls behaviour and the development of the brain if not genetic information ?
Is the combination of genes and environment an excuse for obesity ?
Hardly .
But it does go some way toward explaining it , which is more than an accusation of faulty willpower will do .
Scientists hope that the discovery of genetic variants that influence the risk of obesity may one day herald new treatments for obesity .
But this is a distant dream .
For the present , very little actually changes for obese and overweight people .
To overcome the effects of genes and environment , they must still make lifestyle choices .
The old maxim of “ eat well , be active ” still applies .
The real benefit to FTO ’s discovery would be a change in the attitudes of everyone else , from damning to supportive and from accusatory to understanding .

Models demonstrate Sony 's new PlayStation portable ( PSP - 2000 model ) at the Tokyo Game Show in Chiba , east of Tokyo September 20 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Issei Kato
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp 6758.T sold about 250,000 units of the new version of the PlayStation Portable in Japan in the four days since its launch , a game magazine publisher said on Wednesday , roughly matching total Japanese sales of the original PSP in the two months through August .
Sony launched the new PSP , which is cheaper and slimmer than the initial model , on September 20 in Japan in a bid to compete better with Nintendo Co Ltd 's 7974 .OS hot - selling DS Lite .
Both Sony and Nintendo released their handheld consoles , the PSP and DS , respectively , late in 2004 .
But sales of the PSP , which can play movies , music and games , have recently been outshone by the DS Lite , the lighter version of the DS .
Sony sold 250,702 new PSPs in the four days through September 23 , compared with 275,223 units of the original PSP it sold in July and August in Japan , according to data from videogame magazine publisher Enterbrain .
The new PSP sells for 19,800 yen , which is 5 percent less than the original model and compares with 16,800 yen for the DS Lite .
It 's called the ReCharge , a concept car from Volvo to be unveiled officially next week at the Frankfurt Auto Show , it 's a plug - in hybrid with a battery - only range of 100 km before you need to have the car 's four - cylinder 1.6 - liter Flexfuel engine kick in to power the car and recharge the battery .
The ReCharge is built off a specially designed Volvo C30 , meaning it's got a platform that does n't need to be built from scratch — boosting the possibility we could see something like it really hit the streets .
The best news would be for the environment which would see " about 66 % lower emissions of carbon dioxide compared with the best hybrid cars available on the market today . "
We can already hear the birds singing .
Full press release after the jump .
UPDATE : First video of the Volvo ReCharge just posted here .
Volvo ReCharge Concept : Plug - in hybrid with battery - only range of 100 km - and Flexifuel engine for backup power
Volvo Cars is introducing the Volvo ReCharge Concept , a plug - in hybrid with individual electric wheel motors and batteries that can be recharged via a regular electrical outlet for maximum environmental benefit .
Recharging allows the car to be driven about 100 kilometres on battery power alone before the car 's four - cylinder Flexifuel engine is needed to power the car and recharge the battery .
Volvo ReCharge Concept makes its debut in a specially designed Volvo C30 at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
" A certain proportion of electrical vehicles will be necessary to meet the CO2 emission demands of the future .
Since the Volvo ReCharge Concept combines an excellent battery range with a backup combustion engine , it is a very interesting concept , " says Magnus Jonsson , Senior Vice President Research and Development at Volvo Cars .
The ReCharge Concept has been developed at the Volvo Monitoring and Concept Center ( VMCC ) , the Volvo Car Corporation 's think - tank in Camarillo , California .
" This is a ground - breaking innovation for sustainable transportation .
A person driving less than 100 kilometres a day will rarely need to visit a filling station .
In the USA , this may apply to almost 80 percent of drivers , " says Magnus Jonsson .
Thanks to the excellent electrical range from a fuel consumption angle , the Volvo ReCharge Concept is exceptionally kind to the car owner 's wallet .
When driving on electric power only , operating costs are expected to be about 80 percent lower than that of a comparable petrol - powered car .
When driving beyond the 100 km battery range , fuel consumption may vary from 0 to 5.5 litres per 100 km depending on the distance driven using the engine .
" This plug - in hybrid car , when used as intended , should have about 66 percent lower emissions of carbon dioxide compared with the best hybrid cars available on the market today .
Emissions may be even lower if most of the electricity in intended markets comes from CO2 - friendly sources such as biogas , hydropower and nuclear power , " says Magnus Jonsson .
An electric motor at each wheel
The Volvo ReCharge Concept combines a number of the latest technological innovations into a so - called " series hybrid " where there is no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels .
The battery pack integrated into the luggage compartment uses lithium - polymer battery technology .
The batteries are intended to have a useful life beyond that of the car itself .
Four electric motors , one at each wheel , provide independent traction power .
Four - cylinder 1.6 - litre
Flexifuel engine drives an advanced generator that efficiently powers the wheel motors when the battery is depleted .
Electric car with a combustion engine as backup
In principle , the Volvo ReCharge Concept is a battery electric car with an efficient generator , an Auxiliary Power Unit ( APU ) , that steps in when battery charge becomes insufficient for adequate driving performance .
The APU is designed to distribute electrical power to the individual motors at each wheel .
Since the combustion engine only powers the APU , it can operate in an optimal fashion , both for regulated emissions and CO2 .
The APU is sufficiently powerful to supply an entire villa with electricity .
For example it could with minor modifications in principle give the car owner an electricity generator right at his front door in the event of a power failure .
The driver can choose the power source
The combustion engine starts up automatically when 70 percent of the battery power has been used up .
However , the driver also has the option of controlling the four - cylinder Flexifuel engine manually via a button in the instrument panel .
This allows the driver to start the engine earlier in order to maximize battery charge , for instance when out on the highway in order to save battery capacity for driving through the next town .
" There is a considerable difference between our plug - in hybrid and today 's hybrids .
Today 's hybrids use the battery only for short periods to assist the combustion engine .
Our solution is designed for most people to run on electric power all the time , while providing the extra security that comes with having a combustion engine as a secondary source of electrical power , " says Ichiro Sugioka , project manager for the Volvo ReCharge Concept .
He adds : " What is more , our C30 with plug - in hybrid technology retains its lively and sporty driving properties .
Acceleration from 0 -100 km/h takes 9 seconds and top speed is 160 km/h . "
Specially developed electric motors
The central electrical components in the Volvo ReCharge Concept demonstrator - the generator for the APU and the wheel motors - were developed together with British electromagnetic specialists PML Flightlink .
With an individual electric motor at each wheel , weight distribution as well as mechanical efficiency and traction are maximized .
The friction in mechanical gears is eliminated .
Since the car does not have the transmission found in ordinary cars , there is no need for a gear lever .
To help maximize the environmental benefits , the Volvo ReCharge Concept has high - efficiency tyres developed by Michelin .
They are specially designed to accommodate the wheelmotors .
Further more , the car has All Wheel Drive in the truest sense of the term .
Power to each wheel is controlled individually .
The energy that is generated during braking is transmitted to the battery pack .
When the system is ultimately developed , traditional wheel brakes will be completely replaced by electrical brakes with minimal energy wasted through friction .
To ensure reliable operation of the drivetrain and braking system , driver inputs are fed into a quadruple - redundant electronic control system .
Ecologically sound solution for commuters
The Volvo ReCharge Concept is best suited to car drivers who cover moderate distances every day .
For example , a commuter who has less than 100 kilometres ( 62 miles ) to drive between home and workplace can cover the entire round trip on electric power alone and the equivalent daily fuel economy will be zero litres per 100 km .
Even drivers who cover more than the battery - only range will benefit from the ReCharge Concept .
For a 150 km ( 93 mile ) drive starting with a full charge , the car will require less than 2.8 litres of fuel , giving the car an effective fuel economy of 1.9 l/100 km ( 124 mpg ) .
" The only requirement is that the car owner has access to electrical outlets at convenient places , such as at home or at the workplace .
A full recharge takes 3 hours .
However , even a one - hour quick charge should provide enough charge to drive about 50 kilometres , " says Magnus Jonsson .
Repatriated Guantánamo
Bay detainment camp prisoners have once again been mistreated at the hands of their home countries despite “ diplomatic assurances ” of humane treatment made to the US government , according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday .
The report , titled “ Ill - fated Homecomings : A Tunisian Case Study of Guantánamo Repatriations , ” focuses on two men , Abdullah al - Hajji Ben Amor and Lotfi Lagha , who were sent home to Tunisia after serving approximately five years in Guantánamo  without ever being charged  only to face torture and abuse .
“ Closing Guantánamo provides the United States one of the best opportunities to help rebuild its moral authority and international good will , ” said Jennifer Daskal , senior counterterrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , referring to the increased pressure to close the facility .
“ Washington should not squander that chance by forcibly repatriating detainees to countries with known records of torture and abuse . ”
Tunisia , according to the State Department , uses sleep deprivation , electric shocks , water - boarding , cigarette burns , beatings and prolonged suspension by the wrists to interrogate suspects , and both men have told visitors that they would rather be back in Guantánamo than suffer their current abuse , says the report .
“ The US State Department …is crystal clear about the persistence of torture and unfair trials in Tunisia , ” said Sarah Leah Whitson , director of the Middle East and North Africa division at HRW .
“ Does the US government really think that ‘ diplomatic assurances ’ are going to stand up against these entrenched practices ? ”
The US is officially prohibited , under the Convention Against Torture , from returning people to countries where there is a substantial risk of torture , but as another HRW report noted in March , the US government seems satisfied by simple assurances of proper treatment from the countries to which the detainees are being sent .
“ Governments with records of torture do n’t suddenly change their behavior because the US government claims to have extracted some kind of assurance from them , ” said Carroll Bogert , associate director of Human Rights Watch .
“ This case shows precisely why the US government should be screening Guantánamo detainees before sending them home .
Forcing people to go back to this kind of abuse is a clear violation of international law . ”
The March HRW report examined the case of seven Russian citizens who were released from Guantánamo Bay in 2004 , following diplomatic assurances from Russia to the US that the repatriated prisoners would be treated humanely .
The prisoners reportedly returned home to beatings , harassment , and torture .
HRW recommends putting a system in place whereby detainees are informed in advance of their transfer and are allowed to contest the decision before a federal court if they fear ill - treatment .
Priti Patel , an associate attorney with Human Rights First , told IPS that “ our basic view is that the US should never transfer people to countries where it ’s more likely than not that the detainees will be tortured …
[ When prisoners ] raise fears of being tortured … they should have these fears heard by an independent judge or court . ”
According to the report , approximately 50 of the 355 detainees now held in Guantánamo Bay come from countries with known records of abuse  such as Algeria , China , Libya , Tunisia and Uzbekistan  and have told their attorneys that they do not wish to return home out of fear of being mistreated .
Al - Hajji , says HRW , was convicted in absentia of participating in a foreign terrorist organization in 1995 by a Tunisian military court , a charge he was only informed of upon his arrival in Tunisia , and one he says  had he known about it  certainly would have motivated him to ask not to be repatriated .
Unlike al - Hajji , Lagha had no unserved sentences , but since his return to Tunisia a judge has recommended that he also be tried for terrorist activities .
Upon returning to Tunisia 11 weeks ago , the 51 - year - old father of eight al - Hajji and 38 - year - old Lagha were handed over to Tunisian security forces , their blindfolds were swapped for hoods and they were taken to the Ministry of Interior , says HRW .
While Lagha was only threatened there , al - Hajji later told his family and lawyer that in these two days he was slapped , threatened with the rape of his wife and daughters , shaken awake when he tried to sleep , and made to sign a document he could not read due to the absence of adequate eyeglasses .
After briefly appearing in court , both men spent the next six weeks in solitary confinement , where al - Hajji , still without good glasses , could not even read to pass the time between the weekly 15 minute appointments with his family  appointments where guards watched and topics of conversation had to be reported .
“ The US has a legal responsibility not to send detainees to places they are likely to be tortured and it needs to make sure it does n’t violate that legal obligation , ” said Patel .
Sept. 25 , 2006  --
In about 45 years , temperatures on Earth will be hotter than at anytime during the past one million years , says the U.S. government 's top climatologist in a new report released today .
According to the report , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the planet is just two degrees shy of an average temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit , which is what they believe the temperature was about a million years ago .
NASA 's James Hansen , along with colleagues from the University of California and Columbia University , are for the first time , marking a calendar signaling the approach of temperatures that humans have never experienced .
" Humans are now in control of the Earth 's climate , for better or worse , " Hansen tells ABC News .
Based on a " business as usual " scenario in which greenhouse gasses continue to rise unabated , Hansen says we 'll break the million - year - old record in about 45 years .
But he stresses we can't wait that long to cut greenhouse gas pollution , because of the decades it takes for the climate system to respond to changes .
" We need to get started now , " he says .
" We can't wait another decade or two to take this seriously . "
Those 2 degrees the scientists are talking about may not sound like much , but what that change means is that by mid-century , the world will experience even more record heat waves , wildfires , more intense storms and flooding .
In other parts of the world , the increase may worsen drought conditions as more mountain glaciers and snow packs vanish , no longer sending water to the valleys below .
And in a highly unusual move for a scientific paper , the authors devote eight paragraphs to systematically deconstructing the assertions of a prominent science fiction novelist .
In the non-fiction sections of his 2004 book " State of Fear , " best - selling author Michael Crichton wrote that Hansen 's climate change calculations were " wrong by 300 percent . "
Hansen says Crichton misrepresented his scientific work and , adds the scientist , has done so in testimony before Congress and in a meeting with President Bush -- even though he is not a climate expert .
" He is propagating false information to the public , " Hansen says .
Crichton , through a publicist , declined ABC News ' request for an interview .

Notes From Mr. Rasczak 's Lecture
What Do You Call A Missile Attack That Kills A Senior Hamas Leader , His Pregnant Wife , And His Three Year Old Daughter ?
A Good Start .
The Feces Flinging Monkey on why the death of innocents is not the ultimate horror .
Essentially I agree , but the problem is that if the death of innocents is only preferable to the alternative if the time period in which they occur is a short one , and the way the West presently wages war seems to preclude that .
What 's the point of a war if the enemy does n't realize it has lost ?
'' The United States sent the Iraqi army home without compensation .
They set up checkpoints and prevented farmers from going to work , '' said Taleb , a farmer , as he watched a truck full of U.S. soldiers pass in front of his home .
( emphasis added )
This must be the first war in history where the forces on the losing side demand to be paid by the winning side .
Even given the media penchant for seeking out the Iraqi disaster angles in a story , it does n't really feel like the Iraqi army has been " pacified , " does it ?
What 's the best way to take off a bandage ?
Quickly .
The pain is intense but soon over .
Now imagine a doctor who , instead of removing the bandage immediately , talks about it incessantly while removing it very , very slowly , so that each hair is slowly ripped out of the pore .
He does n't want to rip it off , because he 's afraid of how the patient will react , even though in his heart of hearts he knows it would be best .
To the patient , it 's nothing but torture , and the longer it takes the more he hates the doctor .
As you are no doubt one of the keenly perceptive and highly literate regulars that frequent the Hraka , you 've already realized the metaphor :
Israel is the doctor , and the Palestinians are the patient .
Pinprick assassinations is how Israel has chosen to deal with the Hamas bandage up till now .
Even though Israel claims that the entirety of Hamas is now a target , I 'm not going to believe Israel is serious until the political leadership of Hamas is gone , until Sheik Ahmed Yassin and all around him are dead .
If one is engaged in the active pursuit of evil , then the death of innocents , horrible though they are , serves some purpose .
But the pursuit must be continued until all of the targets of it are accounted for .
Stopping halfway , as Sharon now appears to be intent on doing , not only ensures that your enemy will return , it ensure that more innocents will die in the future , innocents that would not have died otherwise , innocents on both sides .
Hamas will be responsible for these deaths , for that group cannot win this war , yet will not lay down its arms , so the death of innocents will continue .
Israel will be responsible for these deaths , for that country can win this war , yet will have chosen not to , so the death of innocents will continue .
Ripping off a bandage is a violent act , but it is an act with an end , unlike the " cycle of violence " meme that permeates the media , a cycle that continues because Israel is unwilling to use the force necessary to end it .
Violence applied properly can solve problems .
Hamas can be wiped out , or reduced to ineffectiveness .
History is full of examples of just such an occurrence .
There are no more Carthaginians , Nazism is nothing but a sad joke , and there is no Confederacy , thanks to violence .
Either Hamas dies now , or more toddlers and pregnant women die in the years to come .
I know which outcome I prefer .

UNC 's Official Fright Song
I 'm a Tarheel born ,
I 'm a Tarheel bred ,
Now I 've got SARS
By a Tarheel spread !
The SARS outbreak on the UNC campus grows more worrisome .
Instead of one case with an unknown and mysterious transmission vector , there are now three , as two co-workers of the initial case are now showing symptoms of the disease .
Neither has been categorized as a suspected SARS patient with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , since they are not believed to have had the kind of exposure necessary to contract the disease .
Health officials are awaiting laboratory test results , which they expect by Monday , to determine whether the men can be diagnosed with SARS .
This is exactly the same sequence of events taken with regards to the UNC campuses zero case .
SARS was not initially considered as a diagnosis in his case , since although he had been to Toronto , he had not come into direct contact with anyone showing symptoms of the disease , nor had he visited a location where a SARS case had been reported previously .
The issue of when and where exposure occurs is important .
In their investigations of more than 8,445 cases worldwide , scientists have surmised that the virus only spreads when the carrier is in the throes of illness , suffering a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher , a cough or other respiratory trouble , and body aches .
Based on those criteria , public health officials remain skeptical that the Orange County man was contagious during his week back at work .
The man told health investigators that once he became sick on that Saturday , he stayed home and left his house the next week only to visit his doctor , said Dr. Jeffrey Engel , state epidemiologist .
In other words , " We know next to nothing about the disease , not that this prevents us from assuming exactly the opposite when it comes to how the germ spreads . "
First public health officials were skeptical that the patient had SARS , now they are skeptical that he spread the virus , despite the fact that how he came to be infected with the disease in the first place is a complete mystery , and despite the fact that two of his co-workers are showing initial signs of the disease .
Chapel
Hill has always been thought of as just a hop , skip and a jump from outright Communism by the rest of the state ; now its public health authorities have adopted China 's initial attitude towards SARS wholesale .
If SARS is spreading in Chapel Hill , it wo n't be confined to the Giles Horney Building .
Public transportation in Chapel Hill is free , and used by large numbers of UNC workers who ride in to work on buses from satellite parking lots on the edge of town .
One SARS sneeze or post nasal drip on any of five different bus routes that run near the building , and the virus will be spread all over town .
If the two cases under observation turn out to be SARS , then it will be proof positive that a person who exhibits no sign of the disease can still spread it .
So it 's wash hands , Car'lina - lina
Stay home , Car'lina - lina
Wear masks , Car'lina - lina
Go to hell ......... cough , < choke >........ gasp .
The UNC SARS update page can be seen here .
Update : Sighs of relief all round .
Both SARS tests came out negative , though one UNC worker has died .

Who is Greg Packer ?
I liked this too much .
Mickey Kaus pointed me towards this Ann Coulter article on a NYT story about the queue outside the Lincoln Center Barnes and Noble in New York Sunday night , where people were waiting to buy Hilary Clinton 's new book .
That convoluted enough for you ?
Here 's what Coulter discovered about one of the line attendees featured in the article , Greg Packer .
Another average individual eager to get Hillary 's book was Greg Packer , who was the centerpiece of the New York Times ' " man on the street " interview about Hillary - mania .
After being first in line for an autographed book at the Fifth Avenue Barnes & Noble , Packer gushed to the Times : " I 'm a big fan of Hillary and Bill's .
I want to change her mind about running for president .
I want to be part of her campaign . "
It was easy for the Times to spell Packer 's name right because he is apparently the entire media 's designated " man on the street " for all articles ever written .
He has appeared in news stories more than 100 times as a random member of the public .
Packer was quoted on his reaction to military strikes against Iraq ; he was quoted at the St. Patrick 's Day Parade , the Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Veterans ' Day Parade .
He was quoted at not one – but two – New Year 's Eve celebrations at Times Square .
He was quoted at the opening of a new " Star Wars " movie , at the opening of an H&M clothing store on Fifth Avenue and at the opening of the viewing stand at Ground Zero .
He has been quoted at Yankees games , Mets games , Jets games – even getting tickets for the Brooklyn Cyclones .
He was quoted at a Clinton fund - raiser at Alec Baldwin 's house in the Hamptons and the pope 's visit to Giants stadium .
Coulter spins this as another blow to the rep of the NYT , but Greg Packer is actually a publicity seeker with well - honed skills .
By 8 o'clock on the coldest morning of the year , Greg Packer was already in his second hour waiting in line to go on a double - decker bus tour of Manhattan with Brandy , the R&B singer .
Spending a day waiting in line to meet celebrities is not unusual for the 38 - year - old Huntington , N.Y. , native , but his position so far back in the queue was .
Packer has made obsessions out of being first in line and of being in the company of celebrities .
But on this day , he was 15th in line .
That was good enough , for his goal was just to be among the first 50 who would make it on the Brandy bus .
If there 's a global or celebrity - laden event in or near New York , odds are Packer is there , or is trying to be there .
He was first in the line to see ground zero when the viewing platform opened at the World Trade Center site Dec. 30 .
He was the first in line in 1997 to sign the condolence book at the British consulate when Princess Diana died .
He slept outside in the snow in Washington last January to be the first in line to greet President George W. Bush after his inauguration .
Here 's another picture of him , waiting for the Times Square ball to drop in 2002 .
This is a man who enjoys the spotlight and seeks it out , not another giant screw - up by the Times .
I suspect he can ID reporters from a half mile away .
Update : Kausfiles noticed !
I am as giddy as a girl .
2 down , 2 to go .
Mickey wonders why the NYT has n't caught on to Greg Packer yet .
But that begs the question of why the NYT would write about this semi-professional line - stander and quote machine as if he were a typical man on the street .
You'd think he'd be notorious by now and " No More Greg Packer " signs would be posted next to the Metro desk ....
Michael Cooper of the NYT did bust Packer when quoting him on New Year 's Eve , 2001 , but this week the NYT ''s James Barron accepted him as an ordinary " fan of Hillary and Bill 's " who wants Hillary " to change her mind about running for president . "
I would think it 's due to some inherent ( though perfectly understandable ) journalistic snobbery .
Think about the stories Greg appears in .
I do n’t think there 's a journalist in the world that looks forward to being sent out to interview the line freaks for a lightweight entertainment feature .
It 's beneath them .
They go in , they get a quote or two from people who come up to them and say " Hey , are you a reporter ? " come back to the office and file a piece that reminds them exactly how far they are from their J - school dreams of being the next Woodward or Bernstein , then try to forget it .
Same thing with the editors .
Even a crusty , knowledgeable old newsroom vet is n't going to give a crap about who gets interviewed for a " people queue up to meet Brandy " story .
On top of that , a lot of the reporters on the freak beat are probably low on the status ladder .
As they move their way up , they escape from the " go interview the geeks " stories , and the new wet behind the ears guy or gal is the next guy to meet Mr. Packer .
He seems them coming , gets his name in the paper , and gets nice little clipping for the scrapbook back home .
Too bad the jig 's probably up .

The Scabrous Search
A Silflay Hraka Exclusive , for some odd reason .
By Joe McCain
So now the political hounds are after the ' Great Mass Weapons Scam ' , eh ? Going to hold hearings .
Going to find out if the poor old American people have been tricked , fooled , misled .
What is the matter with them ?
Here 's what SHOULD matter to them : A man has been removed from power who murdered millions and made many more millions terrified .
A man has been removed that had , and used , weapons of mass murder on many occasions , on the Kurds , on the Iranians , on the Shiites -- in short , on the weak .
What happened to those weapons is not clear .
We know he had them .
We know , because we saw the piles of bodies over the years .
And we should be very worried about what happened to them , where they are now , not whether we have been tricked by the President of the United States .
A man has been removed whose friends and kin raped women , tortured athletes , grabbed property and possessions at whim , destroyed whatever and whomever they wished .
Have these political defects not seen the photos of the mass graves , seen the trophy photos of torture , not heard the stories from the victims , not heard even our own troops and rescued Prisoners - of - War ?!
At least this one man and his pals will never murder and terrify and torture and maim and waste and destroy again .
And perhaps the other strange and dangerous thugs of the word , especially this terribly dangerous Kim Jung - Il will hesitate before starting up their killing machines .
This is a terribly malevolent world , where battalions of misled fanatics are simply and violently anti-Western , Anti-Christian , Anti-Jewish .
And they will kill , just as the Kamikaze - driven troops of the Japanese Empire and the Nazi- infected Wehrmacht killed -- until enough of them died , and the killing finally stopped .
It is a horrible , cancerous world in which only radical surgery applies .
As long as we stay subtle and rational and philosophical , millions more will die .
Jews , Americans , Westerners , reasonable Arabs , peaceful Muslims .
They will die just as others kept dying while Neville Chamberlain temporized , and Americans cried " America , First ! " .
If the Japanese had n't made the incredible decision to raid Pear Harbor , when would we have joined that war ?
And does anybody remember , it was German who declared war on the United States ?
Else , when we have gone to Europe to help beat down these monsters of holocaust and pillage ?
Have we gone that insane , again ?
Despite so many terrible , bloody lessons from history ?
Recent history ?
Ancient History ?
ANY history !!!
This is not new .
The Crusades against the Moors ?
The American White Man against his former slaves ?
Virtually any country against the Jew for 1500 years ?
It is a bad time .
But for the sake of history , there is one land strong enough to deal with it .
And deal with we must !
No amount of petulance against George Bush , and complaints about misinformation , and elite sniffing distaste is going to change the fact that there is a band of unthinking radicals that murder only to murder -- and the more horrific the murder is , the more devastating it is , the more innocent the victims are , the better .
It brings them closer to Allah .
Well , just as we had to help millions of Japanese Imperial Troops get to their gods faster , so must we enhance the celestial trip of these assassins of humanity .
That 's what matters ..... REALITY matters !
Please , no matter what you think of George Bush -- and we McCain Republicans have much vinegar to remember from South Carolina -- do n't go down this trashy , sleazy road !!
If you do , you will wreck a very problematic victory with which we must be patient -- we were in Germany and Japan four and five years , remember -- but more , you will absolutely cripple any chance of dealing with so many other mastes of death and murder and mayhem .
No , you will absolutely take away the fear our terribly brave men and women have put into them , and perhaps unleash them !
Editor 's Note : Joe McCain is the brother of Arizona Senator John McCain , and resides in Washington .
I got the essay above from an e-mail he sent to the parents of his godson yesterday , whom the Sainted Wife and I have been friends with for years .
An earlier essay of his can be seen here .
Why we happen to be the only place on the web these are found is a complete mystery to me .

Matter , Anti Mattter , and Blogmatcher
According to Blogmatcher , friend of Hraka On the Third Hand , is the most like - minded blog to us out of the 1558 listed .
Compendium Hermetica , which to all appearances is a perfectly decent blog by a lucid and well - read author , is the least like minded .
Zod : Decent , lucid and well read .
No wonder Blogmatcher awarded him the coveted Anti-Hraka position .
You should never touch , lest the world be shattered by the resultant cataclysmic explosion .
I read all the damn time .
Zod : Comic books and Science Fiction .
You 're a regular Robert Burton , you are .
Quiet , damned voice .
Left of us on the war , or at least left of one and perhaps two - thirds of the Hraka staff , but so is Skippy , and he's in the top 10 of the like minded .
I 'm going to guess that the calculation is performed via some sort of six degrees analysis of links in common .
Update : And I would be right .

Widening The Scope
This caught my ear the other day while listening to NPR on the commute to work the other day .
Families in northern Uganda are sending their children away at night to sleep alone on the city streets of Kitgum and Gulu .
It 's the only way they can ensure that they are n't kidnapped by the Lord 's Resistance Army , who force the boys to fight for them and turn the girls into sex slaves .
According to Reuters , more than 9000 people are traveling from their homes each night to sleep wherever they find a spot to lay down in the cities .
Children as young as 4 make the trip each night , traveling on foot up to 5 miles each way in order to sleep in safety .
The Lord 's Resistance Army is supported an encouraged by the Islamist government in Sudan , a country listed by the State department as a supporter of international terrorism , and a country that rivals Saudi Arabia in its all talk / no action approach to the war on terrorism .
Uganda on the other hand is cited as a model for African development in democracy and the fight against HIV / AIDS .
The president of that country met today with George Bush , who praised him for his support in the war on terrorism , yet apparently did not offer any U.S. aid or support for Uganda in its struggle with an Islamist supported movement .
Yet why not ?
The American experience in Afghanistan proved that a combination of a small number of special forces and air support in conjunction with native ground forces is a lethal combination .
The Lord 's Resistance Army is demonstrably as vicious as the Taliban , supported by a regime with strong ties to Islamic terrorism , and would likely put up even less of a struggle than did the Taliban once they were faced with a US supported force .
Since there is already a functioning civil government in Uganda , we would not even face the vacuum of authority problems that have cropped up in areas of Afghanistan and Iraq , while simultaneously demonstrating that the American war on terrorism is not limited to those of Arab descent , or even to Islam .
The LRA , though supported by Islamists , is an ostensibly Christian movement .
If relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people is in hindsight a valid reason for the American invasion of that country , and I believe that it is ( And did before the war .
WMDs were always a side issue for me . ) then those reasons are just as valid for the people of northern Uganda .
No , we can't solve all of the world 's problems at once , but it 's not like clearing terrorists out of Uganda would take even as much effort as we put into Afghanistan , and it would demonstrate that America cares as much about stability in Africa as it does anywhere else .
Terrorists thrive in failed states , and Africa is full of states on the edge of failure .
It will be simpler and cheaper now to support the African civilian and democratic nations than it will be to make war on them ten or twenty years in the future .
Chasing the Islamists out of the Middle East , only to find them popping up in sub-Saharan Africa will come as rude shock , one we can prevent from occurring in the future with only a little effort in the present .
A little effort , yet one that to all appearances is not being made .

Living In The Hot Zone
Remember the North Carolina SARS case of a week or so ago ?
It 's troubling the health authorities , in that there is no on is able to determine how patient was infected in the first place .
Canadian health officials said Tuesday that they are unsure how or where the man contracted the disease , because his case defies the accepted understanding of the disease and its method of spreading .
" I can't pick one logical explanation here .
All are unlikely , and we 're dealing with various degrees of unlikely , " said Dr. Allison McGeer , director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto .
Since the virus almost certainly was passed to the patient while he was visiting a relative in a rehabilitation clinic , he probably picked it up from a surface contact , something like a elevator button or a doorknob .
What 's troubling for the Toronto authorities is that if this is true , then there is at least one person transmitting the virus who is unknown to the Toronto public health system .
Meanwhile the UNC campus is on pins and needles waiting for another case to occur .
Odds are it wo n't , but if it does a lot of the tech staff will start working from home .

Bishop Ussher Reaches a Higher Spin Rate
New fossils from Ethiopia push the known date for the first appearance of Homo Sapiens back to 158,000 BCE .
The skulls include evidence of ritual cutting and polishing , evidence for the argument that human culture has always been characterized by a surprising level of complexity .
There 's also grounds for argument that we were already masters of our domain at that time
The skulls , from two men and a child , are also very large by human standards suggesting the adults cut an imposing figure .
Large skull and imposing figures are a direct function of food supply .
Lots of food , especially in the childhood developmental years , is critical in the determination of final adult size .
If we were growing them large 160,000 years ago , there were n't a lot of things standing in the way of our control of the immediate environment .

Chewing the Fat ( Tax )
British doctors are apparently pushing a " Fat Tax " in an effort to curb that country 's obesity problem .
To me this falls into the category of " Ridiculous . "
People should have the right to be fat , and eat whatever the hell they want to .
If I wanted to be obese , that should be my decision , and I should not be penalized ( nor should the fast food joints of the world ) for wanting a big ass burger and a side of fries .
Even though I do n't smoke , I feel the same way about over - taxing cigarettes and the like .
Maybe those opposed to this tax could stage an " Eat In " , or something to protest this movement .
Being overweight is a health problem , but if people are okay with who they are and the size they are , then leave them alone and tax something else .

Culture Jamming
When they are n't letting little girls burn to death , the Saudi religious police busy themselves by confiscating their toys .
The following are among the items seized by the mutaween , aka the Authority for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice .
Reuters has a story on the mutaween today , noting their roles as enforcers of the Wahabist version of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia .
Answerable only to King Fahd and separate from ordinary police , members of the " Authority for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice " patrol with police escorts , ensuring that their strict interpretation of Islamic social customs remain the norm among a youthful , Westernised population with wide access to the internet and satellite TV .
They check that women wear the abaya , the all - enveloping black cloak , that men and women together in public are related , that drugs and alcohol are not being traded and that Muslims do not observe " frivolous " customs such as Valentine 's Day .
Their website invites citizens to inform on those suspected of any manner of immoral behaviour .
In typical Reuters fashion , there 's not a link anywhere on the site to the mutaween home page , or to the form where a cowardly Saudi could inform on his neighbors .
And that 's why we 're here .
The mutaween home page is here .
More pictures of dangerous plastic , glass and cotton threats to Mohammed are here , and the form is here .
The first text box is for your name .
The drop down list underneath it is for the name of city where the incident took place .
The first four on the list are :
Mecca
The City of Lights ( No , not Paris .
Give them time .
For now , it 's a Saudi City . )
Riyadh
Jeddah
The second text box is your email address .
The drop down list underneath it is for the particular sin you are reporting .
Note :
These are general translations .
More specific ones are welcome
1. Someone not attending daily prayers
2. Flirting
3. Loitering
4. Selling Stolen Goods
5. Immoral Observations
6. Engaging in Western Habits ( Holding your wife 's hand in public , kissing or hugging her would all be examples of this .
Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are others . )
7 . Other
The big box is for a specific description of the activity being reported ; say something along the lines of " Fraulein Gunter is hiding a family of Jews in her attic at 31 Hemmelstrasse . "
Well , perhaps not that message exactly .
The sentiment is the same .
So are the results .
If it 's possible for a website to be evil , this one is .
The button on the right is " Submit . "
The button on the left is " Reset . "
Purely in a spirit of scientific enquiry , I wonder what would happen if everyone reading this post decided submit a false report , or multiple ones ?
Is it possible to file so many false reports that the ones turned in by the craven Islamists this site is aimed at get lost in the shuffle ?
Is it possible to crash the server entirely , or to drive it off the Net forever ?
How many people would be willing to file two or three false reports a day until that happens , possibly something along the lines of " I saw Prince Bandar Bin Sultan eating a dog sandwich . "
How many people would send the Wahabists a little note letting them know that we remember the origin of 15 of the 19 despite the coddling Saudi Arabia has been given in the days since ?
Purely in a spirit of scientific enquiry , of course .
Update :
While I was looking for the site , I wrote the author of the story , John Bradley , asking for the url .
He just got back to me with the url listed above .
I 'd already found it , thanks in large part from following links from Doctor Weevil and Memri , but it 's nice to have confirmation .
Some of the translation was done at ajeeb.com , who realy wanted me to pay for the service .
If someone would like to do the blogosphere a service , come up with free online Arabic to English translation service .
More Update : A handy list of names to submit , as well as an example message , can be found here .
Email addresses and other website info is here .

The Sixth Day
For the last day on the 36th anniversary of the Six - Day War , an anecdote .
During the Six - Day War between Israel and the Arab nations , a friend called me excitedly and said , " Did you hear the news from Paris ? "
" No , " I said , :' What ? "
" The French government heard there was a war going on somewhere , so just to be on the safe side , it surrendered . "

Super Sounds of the Seventies
Bill and Hillary adopted Fleetwood Mac. Will Dennis Kucinich adopt ABBA ?
So , for those of you scoring at home , that 's
The Clinton's - " Do n't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow " and Dennis Kucinich - " Take a Chance on Me " .
ABBA swould seem to be uniquely suited as the producer of theme songs for American politicos .
Dancing Queen - Barney Franks , of course .
Amerika - Nancy Pelosi
Waterloo - Cynthia McKinney
Alley Cat - Bill Clinton
Daddy Don’t Get Drunk On Christmas Day - Ted Kennedy
Dance With The Devil - Tom Delay
Slipping Through My Fingers - Al Gore
The Winner Takes It All - George Bush
You Owe Me One - William Rehnquist
But I suspect something similar could be done with the songs of any group with a sufficiently long career .
Who wants to try Queen ?

Killing Two Birds With One Post
A couple of the projects I am tangentially involved in right now is the offering of personalized cgi-bins for the students and faculty at UNC .
Everyone has a public html folder that they can use for static html , but people are growing steadily more sophisticated with each passing year , and so there 's been a growing demand for something like the above .
A personal cgi-bin allows the user to run php or Perl scripts that they have written , to submit forms to a database or host a Movable Type blog , among other things .
There 's something of a slight security risk in allowing any Tom , Dick or Sheila to run whatever jury - rigged code they manage to type up on the campus web servers , but we 've gotten around that by running all the scripts within the context of a cgi wrapper that one of the more able department developers wrote .
So , problem solved , mostly .
But , just because the faculty and students have gotten sophisticated enough to want to write scripts does n't mean they actually know how to write scripts , nor are the willing to write such scripts in anything other than Microsoft Word , Wordpad , or Notepad .
This is a problem .
The main campus servers run Solaris , or Linux , and when they run across a Perl or php script that 's been composed on a PC and then transferred to a Unix filesystem this is what they see .
#!/afs/isis/pkg/php/bin/php^M
^M
< html >^M
< head >^M
< title > Untitled Document </ title >^M
< meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=iso - 8859 -1 " >^M
</head >^M
Those " ^M " s are how Unix translates the ASCII character that Windows uses to indicate a carriage return .
In a static html file this does n't normally matter .
In that case the web server just hands the file to the browser , and the browser parses it .
But in the case of a script , the web server must run it , then return something to the browser .
For the snippet of php code above to work , the web server has to find the campus php binary ( think " program " when you see " binary " .
You 'll sleep better at night . ) that we installed and submit the code to it .
The first line in any cgi-bin script , in this case the " #!/afs/isis/pkg/php/bin/php " line , tells the server where to go to submit the code .
To us technical types , this is known as the " path . "
The web server sees the " ^M " at the end of the path and assumes that is part of the directions it has to follow .
There is no such path , so the server returns an error code , the bespectacled freshman at the other end curses , then opens up a ticket with the help desk to tell us our php is broken .
In order to fix it , one of the sysadmins has to spend valuable coffee drinking time finding the code , opening it up to verify that yes , Johnny is trying to crack the furryteens.com password system with code he wrote in MS word , and then track him down and tell him how to fix it .
Oddly enough , this is duty considered less than enjoyable , so it is passed down to the most junior of the sysadmins .
Guess who that might be .
Now , there are a number of ways to avoid the ^M bug that we know of , or to ameliorate it afterwards .
The first is to use one to the native Unix editors like vi or Emacs to compose one 's code .
Sadly , most do not choose this path , for Unix editors scare the pants off your average user .
One could also compose the file in Windows , then open it up in vi and run a command like " : 1, $s / ^M//g " to rid one 's code of the unwanted characters .
Told you it was scary .
Most people do n't like doing this either , even though they tend to force themselves to once we tell them that we wo n't do it for them .
The ^M problem , though still limited in scope at the moment , is growing , so we 're in the process of developing a tutorial on how to deal with the problem for the help.unc.edu site .
Once again , this is a job for the junior sysadmins .
The alternatives listed above will be part of it ; there 's also a Perl script we 've written that a user can call to strip out the ^M from the end of each line .
I think some shareware code editors like Ultraedit can be set to prevent this as well , but do n't know for sure .
The mantra around the office is " Surely someone has had to deal with this before . "
Before I submit the help doc , I thought I 'd ask .
Has anyone else run into this ?
How do you work around it ?
This is you chance to earn everlasting fame as part of a rarely accessed document in the UNC help system , so do n't be shy .
Update :
If your solution is a particular program , it needs to be able to run under AIX , which is what the UNC login nodes are running .

This was found on an AOL news site :
U.S. : Major al - Qaida Attack Probable
By Edith M. Lederer , .c The Associated Press
UNITED NATIONS ( June 10 ) - There is a ' ' high probability ' ' that al - Qaida will attempt an attack with a weapon of mass destruction in the next two years , the U.S. government said in a report Monday .
The report to a U.N. Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against the terrorist group did not say where the Bush administration believes such an attack might be launched .
But the United States said it believes that despite recent setbacks , '' al - Qaida maintains the ability to inflict significant casualties in the United States with little or no warning . ''
This brings up an interesting question .
Where will George W. believe we need to strike next , and perhaps more importantly , will he receive any support , especially from foreign leaders ?
If he states that we need to attack somewhere else to deal with al - Qaida 's threat of using WMD , will anyone get on his bandwagon ?
While I am not upset in the least that we attacked Iraq , he did say that we were doing so because of the threat of WMD .
I wonder , since none have been found thus far , if people , including some Americans will be hesitant to engage in any more military operations .
While al - Qaida has already proven their willingness to kill by any means , the evidence will need to be solid and be shared with others we try to pull into the mix .

The Fifth Day
An Egyptian felt the need of a brain transplant and walking into a surgical supply store asked what they had in the ay of brains .
He was shown the brain of an excellent mathematician who had died the year before at the age of sixty .
In view of his age , he could have it for five hundred dollars .
The Egyptian felt the age was a disadvantage .
" Do you have anything younger ? "
A peasant 's brain was shown him .
He had died at the age of twenty - five .
The Egyptian shook his head .
He was a little too high - class for a peasant 's brain .
" What is this one ? " he said suddenly , for one brain was encased in a beautiful glass - walled refrigerator with a spotlight on it .
" That , " said the dealer , " is our prize possession .
It is the brain of an Egyptian general who died fighting gallantly against Israel in the Six - Day War , and it costs a hundred thousand dollars . "
" A hundred thousand dollars ! " said the would - be customer , shocked .
" why so much ? "
And the dealer said , " Because it 's never been used . "
Thanks once again to Isaac .

Socket To Me
Spent most of the day struggling through the process of cramming a square Apache 1.3 configuration file from one of our aging Solaris servers into a round Apache 2 hole on one of the new Linux boxes .
I learned a lot , which meant that my office mates spent most of the day listening to me curse before I finally got the web server to start .
I 'm still not done .
Just because something is running does n't mean that it 's running correctly .
You could probably get a Trans - Am to run on french fry oil , but that does n't mean it 'll run very long .
In fact , odds are that the new Apache is running badly , especially as the only way I managed to get the old config file parsed correctly was to cut and paste large chunks of Apache 2 configuration code that we do n't really understand into it .
I 'll have to start pruning tomorrow , cutting out code and restarting the process to see which bits are critical and which are useless window dressing .
Yes , I could have read the documentation , but that would have taken just as long , and leave me knowing less than I do now .
It 's been my experience that after the first 15 minutes of looking at documentation my brain shuts down out of sheer boredom and stops learning anyway .
Documentation is almost always written from the viewpoint that the reader knows as much as the writer , a assumption that is demonstrably wrong , else the reader would n't be there in the first place , so it 's also confusing .
This is the error dogged me most of today .
" no listening sockets available , shutting down
Unable to open logs . "
Think of a socket as one of the little holes an early telephone operator plugged a line into .
Most programs connect to specific ones , identified for convenience 's sake by numbers , usually called ports .
One can tell Apache to connect to any port one wishes , but it defaults to port 80 .
What the error is saying is that for some reason port 80 is unavailable .
But , since it can't open the log file , it iss unable to tell me why .
Most of my job is spent looking at log files ; so not having one is like making Batman fight crime without his utility belt .
Or in my case , arms or legs .
Normally the " no sockets available " message would mean one thing --- that I 'm a dumbass who already has Apache or some other web server running , thus closing the port off from new connections .
Turn off the offending process , and my problems are solved .
Google the error and that will be the solution to almost all of the links brought up .
In this case , that was n't it .
There 's a command , " netstat - a , " that will let me see which ports are in use at any particular time , and when I ran it " 80 " was nowhere to be found .
So instead of the error meaning that I was a dumbass , it meant that someone up there hated me .
There 's nothing more frustrating than a error with no explanation and no clues , except perhaps looking at the documentation in the mistaken belief that it might help .
The first thing I did was to start removing parts of the old configuration , reasoning that by cutting out code I could eventually isolate the problem .
Our standard Apache config is over 2000 lines long , so it took a while .
This only works if the bug is being caused by something in the code , not if the bug is due to something missing from the code , so Apache still refused to start even after I reduced the file down to about 10 lines .
That 's when I started throwing extra code in .
I think I 've identified the code snippet responsible for ending my sisyphean task ;
# Listen : Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and / or
# ports , instead of the default .
See also the
# directive .
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses ( 0.0.0.0 )
#
# Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80
The above is part of the global configuration part of the Apache 2 configuration , something that is n't specified in the same manner our 1.3 files .
Tomorrow I 'll take it out and hope everything breaks .
If not , then I 'll curse and start again .

A Dose of Reality
Hillary Clinton has stated that she is not planning to run for the presidency in either of the next 2 elections .
I 'm sure that a number of advisors have spoken to her about this , and tried to give her some advice as to what her chances might be if she were to run for the highest office in the land .
Personally , I think the advice could be reduced to one sentence : " People are not ready to elect a woman as President of the U.S. "
I 'm sure that will anger some people , but I have no doubt that it is the truth .
I 'm sure , with all of her experience and her smarts , that Hillary is qualified to be president .
In reality , there are so many people who run the presidency that she could make it through a term without doing worse than some presidents we have had in the past , but America is still not ready to give this responsibility to a woman .
I , unlike many people , would not rule her out because I am a Republican , or because I did n't like her husband when he was in office , because neither of those reasons are true for me .
I am a registered Democrat and do n't have any problems with Bill or his time in office .
I am just being realistic and understand that many voters still would be hesitant to vote for a woman or any other person who falls into a major minority category .
I think that even women are not ready to vote for a woman .
Sure , some would jump on her bandwagon just because of women 's rights , blah , blah , blah , but I think it is still an unspoken belief that a woman would not be as effective as a man in that role .
Maybe she will run in 2012 , but a lot will have to change between now and then for her to have a chance , but who knows ............ maybe hell will freeze .

Cantillon Kriek Lambic
Beer of the Night
Though this will likely come a surprise to many , there are times when I skip the whole rigamarole surrounding a beer post and just drink the damn stuff .
The Cantillon Gueze made it through without me taking note one Saturday night , as did the Top of the Hill cask beer the day before .
I tell a lie .
I did take notes on the cask beer , but it was more about the horror of being presented with three quarters of a pitcher of beer in the middle of a workday by a beaming brewmaster when I was expecting to partake of a pint before going back to work .
Good beer though .
Slightly less hoppy than an IPA , as citrusy as one would expect with a trace of butterscotch overtone towards the end .
It went really well with the fries and a steak sandwich .
I pitched a beer blog to the editor of All About Beer magazine earlier that day .
They 're local , and I figured it might get me into the seasonal beer festivals for free , so why not ?
It was via email , so I do n't expect to hear back , but I still think it 's a good idea , especially for niche publications like All About Beer .
It enables them to engage their readership on a daily basis rather than a monthly or bi-monthly one , with all that means as far as advertising and promotion , as well as giving them an outlet for material that dates easily or does n't fit into an issue for one reason or another .
There are other beer blogs , but they do n't appear to update very often , which means that the genre is someone 's for the taking .
Yes , I 'd like to be the Instapundit of Beer blogs .
Who would n't ?
The glamour , the groupies , the ....... possibility that people might send me six packs of free review beer .
mmmmmm ....... free beer .
The only question in my mind is whether or not there enough material around to justify a beer blog , say one updated three or four times a day .
There 's a daily review , yes , but what else is there ?
Is there enough daily new material to support a blog devoted entirely to beer ?
I think there is .
Taking just today as an example , there 's the gripping story behind Police Car Damaged By Flying Beer Cans , where a group of underage drinkers in a red hatchback tossed full cans of Natural Ice at the pursuing cops during a high speed pursuit .
Natural Ice , the beer with the taste that makes you want to hurl ........ it at the pigs .
There 's also Anheuser - Busch , who has started to market an upscale beer , Anheuser World Select , in hopes of improving their share of the beer geek market .
The company is quick to point out that World Select comes in green bottles with embossed labeling .
Heineken , a top import made by the Dutch brewer Heineken , also comes in green bottles .
Because what 's on the outside of a beer bottle has always been more important to Anheuser - Busch than what 's on the inside .
Finally , Dogfish Head WorldWide Stout , the strongest beer in the world .
AS the effects kick in I decide it is time to turn on the charm with the ladies .
Dutch courage , you 've got to love it .
First up is a pretty blonde called Eve .
The unsuspecting banker is enjoying a quiet glass of wine when bottle in hand I stagger , I mean sidle , up .
Surprisingly the 26 - year - old from Richmond , South - West London , is unimpressed by my patter and soon gives me the brush - off .
" Do n't drink this stuff if you want to go out on the pull , " she tells me .
NEXT I try my luck with Melanie , 27 , another banker .
" The beer makes you really sexy and attractive , " she purrs .
There 's a noise behind me and I turn round to see her friends laughing hysterically .
When I turn back Melanie has gone .
Might have to find me some of that for the fishing trip come October .
It sounds like it would improve my conversational skills .
There 's more , a lot more .
One could easily beer blog all day long .
No , that 's not a threat .

The Fourth Day
Another Six -Day war joke , stolen from my pal Isaac .
He refers to it during his section on the Six - Day war , not as a joke about that war per se , but as an example of one way in which the Jews viewed themselves before the war , and how refreshing the change was afterwards .
Two Jews were up against the wall , hands tied behind their backs , waiting to be shot .
The officer in charge of the firing squad came to them and asked curtly , " Do you want a final cigarette ? "
The first Jew replied , " Keep your cigarette , you murdering bum ! "
Whereupon the second Jew whispered anxiously , " Quiet , Jake .
Do n't make trouble . "

A Little Place Blogging , for Fred
It 's rained here 12 of the last 15 weekends .
Of the three clear weekends , we were gone for two and having a baby on the other one .
The area as a whole is nearly 12 inches over normal for the year .
( Thanks to Newmark 's Door for the link . )
This time last year we were in a drought .
I 'm finding I preferred the drought , despite the whole " Oh my god there 's going to be water riots and we 're all going to die " vibe the Sainted Wife kept giving off .
A lawn that crackles when you walk on it is annoying , but a lawn that wells up between the toes with every step is worse .
Ngnat used to think " barefoot walking " on the lawn was a treat .
Now she stays in the garage and draws what looks like an endless series of chalk jellyfish on the cement .
" I like your jellyfish . " I told her last night .
" Are they the ones from Spongebob ? "
" They 're men , " she said to me indignantly .
All the rain has also been bad for the tomato plants , but good for mushrooms , the now brilliantly blue hydrangeas and the wildlife .
The grass in the yard has been overrun with hundreds of little frogs , appropriately known as Pseudacris ocularis , the .... Little Grass Frog .
Small snakes seem to be the frog 's main threat , so I 'm hoping to run across a bumper crop of them soon .
Meanwhile , there are an inordinate number of flat little silhouettes decorating the driveway .
There was also a 10 or 12 pound snapping turtle crawling through the remains of the garden the other day , one of the few I 've ever seen close up .
It was at least a mile from a body of water large enough to support it .
Ngnat and I crouched in front of him , and I warned her to stay away from turtles with bumpy backs while I held a stick out as bait .
The snapper 's strike was so swift I involuntarily jerked .
The stick snapped , Ngnat burst into tears , and the snapper went on its grouchy way .
I may have put her off turtles for good .
I took a couple of snapper pics , but with Mom 's digital camera rather than my own , so until she mails them I can't post them .
Do n't think they were that good to begin with ; given the height of the grass it was in , good camera range was uncomfortably close to being within striking range .
The rain seemingly has affected the normal food supply for the birds in the area as well .
I would think that more rain equals more bugs to feed on , but there 's a steady traffic at the feeders .
I 've seen mockingbirds at the suet feeder for the first time in ... ever , as well as pair of bluebirds with two fledglings desperately demanding food .
Flickers and Red Bellied Woodpeckers have joined them , then flown to the top of the chimney to announce their presence and mark their territory by drumming on the hollow metal cover at the top .
It 's very resonant , so they use it often .
I keep hoping the Red headed and Pileated woodpeckers I 've seen in the bottomland behind the house will join them , at least at the feeder , but no luck so far .
A Pileated would probably sound a like a jackhammer if they ever did drop by , damn things were the size of crows .
The hummingbird feeder also ran dry in less than a week for the first time I can recall .
There 's a little male who perches on the deckrail underneath almost all day long , guarding it from interlopers .
I 've seen dogfights so acrobatic they 'd put dolphins to shame in the four by four area around the feeder .
Males will come in to be chased away by the resident male , and while the guard is off chasing them a female drops in , to be chased off in her turn by the resident female .
I can't see how they find the time to breed and raise a brood , they seem to spend most of the day guarding the sugar water .
The old wives tail is n't true , though .
Hummingbirds can't fly between rain drops .
I was out on the covered part of the deck yesterday and saw a big fat one hit the male dead amidships .
He bounced like God 's tiniest basketball and kept on , seemingly none the worse for his drenching .
He landed on the rail , shook his head like a dog and cursed .
" I know what you mean . " I told him .
" Bloody weather . "

Mr. Answer Man Denigrates Your Alcohol
Deb of MustBeNice asks
" Seriously , not to make an issue or nothin ' but what are the chick beers ?
* checks fridge .. finds budweiser cans and a rolling rock pony bottle from last summer *
Well , just because you 're a chick does n't mean you drink chick beers .
Anyone who drinks a year - old Rolling Rock pony bottle is a man in my book .
A stupid man , but a man nonetheless .
Also , the definition changes with time .
When Miller Lite first came out , it was seen as a chick beer .
Real men did n't worry about calories in 1973 , it seemed .
Advertising changed all that , though it just made it more acceptable for men to drink light beer rather moving woman to another drink .
That particular feat is harder than one might think .
Remember shandy ?
The latest chick beer is Michelob Ultra , though there is a growing class of what might be called chick alcohol .
All are malt beverages , aka alcopops , scions of Zima sent forth to trouble the unhappy world .
Many are marketed under the brand name of a liquor company or have descriptions like " hard lemonade . "
The once hot cider market has been infected by the practice , and sales have slumped in response .
It 's only a matter of time before we see Bartles & James Hard Raspberry Lemonade .
Other than that , chick beers can be regional in nature , or comparative .
Amstel Light was a chick beer in Chapel Hill for a number of years , and most women in brewpubs will invariably order the lighter lagers over the IPAs , porters and stouts .
But the real definition of a chick beer , as any man will tell you is : " Whatever beer it is that a woman is drinking , as long as I am not also drinking it . "
We 're funny that way .

In its fumbling attempts to explain the purge of United States attorneys , the Bush administration has argued that the fired prosecutors were not aggressive enough about addressing voter fraud .
It is a phony argument ; there is no evidence that any of them ignored real instances of voter fraud .
But more than that , it is a window on what may be a major reason for some of the firings .
In partisan Republican circles , the pursuit of voter fraud is code for suppressing the votes of minorities and poor people .
By resisting pressure to crack down on “ fraud , ” the fired United States attorneys actually appear to have been standing up for the integrity of the election system .
John McKay , one of the fired attorneys , says he was pressured by Republicans to bring voter fraud charges after the 2004 Washington governor ’s race , which a Democrat , Christine Gregoire , won after two recounts .
Republicans were trying to overturn an election result they did not like , but Mr. McKay refused to go along .
“ There was no evidence , ” he said , “ and I am not going to drag innocent people in front of a grand jury . ”
Later , when he interviewed with Harriet Miers , then the White House counsel , for a federal judgeship that he ultimately did not get , he says , he was asked to explain “ criticism that I mishandled the 2004 governor ’s election . ”
President Bush often insists he has to be the decider — ignoring Congress and the public when it comes to the tough matters on war , terrorism and torture , even deciding whether an ordinary man in Florida should be allowed to let his wife die with dignity .
Apparently that burden does not apply to the functioning of one of the most vital government agencies , the Justice Department .
Americans have been waiting months for Mr. Bush to fire Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who long ago proved that he was incompetent and more recently has proved that he can’t tell the truth .
Mr. Bush refused to fire him after it was clear Mr. Gonzales lied about his role in the political purge of nine federal prosecutors .
And he is still refusing to do so — even after testimony by the F.B.I. director , Robert Mueller , that suggests that Mr. Gonzales either lied to Congress about Mr. Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping operation or at the very least twisted the truth so badly that it amounts to the same thing .
Mr. Gonzales has now told Congress twice that there was no dissent in the government about Mr. Bush ’s decision to authorize the National Security Agency to spy on Americans ’ international calls and e-mails without obtaining the legally required warrant .
Mr. Mueller and James Comey , a former deputy attorney general , say that is not true .
Not only was there disagreement , but they also say that they almost resigned over the dispute .
Both men say that in March 2004 — when Mr. Gonzales was still the White House counsel — the Justice Department refused to endorse a continuation of the wiretapping program because it was illegal .
( Mr. Comey was running the department temporarily because Attorney General John Ashcroft had emergency surgery . )
Unwilling to accept that conclusion , Vice President Dick Cheney sent Mr. Gonzales and another official to Mr. Ashcroft ’s hospital room to get him to approve the wiretapping .
Army ACAT II Program
Prime Contractor
DESCRIPTION : The Hornet is being developed in four sequential phases : 1 ) basic hand emplaced ( HE - Hornet ) , 2 ) HE - Hornet product improved ( HE - Hornet PIP # 1 ) with remote control on / off / on and redeploy capabilities , 3 ) HE - Hornet PIP # 2 with improved performance capability including the ability to engage wheeled vehicles and improved countermeasure resistance , and 4 ) a deep attack version ( DA - Hornet , delivered by rocket , missile or fixed wing aircraft ) .
The Hornet , common to all variants , has standoff detection and engagement capability .
It attacks targets from the top at ranges of up to 100 meters and provides a mobility kill .
The basic HE - Hornet engages tracked armored vehicles , and may be armed manually or by the M71 MOPMS Remote Control Unit ( RCU ) .
The HE - Hornet PIP # 1 will be remotely controlled by the CIRCE RCU , and can be recovered and redeployed prior to initial arming .
a communications module ,
a ground platform module , and
a smart submunition / warhead ( sublet ) module .
STATUS : The Hornet program began in 1986 with a Department of the Army message .
A required operational capability document was approved in 1990 that outlined a prioritized , three - phased WAM development plan : ( 1 ) deep - attack , ( 2 ) hand - emplaced , and ( 3 ) Volcano - emplaced .
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise in importance of early - entry operations , the priority was changed to ( 1 ) hand - emplaced , ( 2 ) hand - emplaced with two - way communication and redeployability , and ( 3 ) deep - attack .
EMPLOYMENT CONCEPT : Hornet can be used in offensive and defensive operations and in both tactical and operational level role .
In the close battle , HE - Hornet will be emplaced by combat Engineers , maneuver forces under Engineer supervision , and at extended ranges by Special Operations Forces and Rangers .
Hornet gauntlets , a series of randomly spaced clusters of 3 - 6 Hornets , will be employed along high - speed avenues of approach to disrupt and attrite the enemy .
Hornet area disruption obstacles , consisting of 20 Hornets employed in an " X " pattern across a grid square , will disrupt and attrite the enemy as he moves cross country prior to the start of the direct fire battle .
When employed deep , Hornet will disrupt a threat commander 's operational tempo by attacking his follow - on forces , logistics and C2 , by denying key terrain such as approaches to bridges / river crossing sites , and by selectively attacking high - value targets , such as Tactical Ballistic Missile ( TBM ) launchers .
BASIS OF ISSUE : Hornet is a Class V item .
TRAINING / PERSONNEL : USAES will provide training on the employment of Hornet .
Individual and collective trainers are being procured to train operator tasks and for force - on - force training .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Chief Justice John Roberts suffered a seizure Monday , causing him to fall while at his summer home off the coast of Maine , the Supreme Court said .
Chief Justice John Roberts was taken to a hospital in Maine after a fall at his summer home .
Roberts has " fully recovered from the incident , " and a neurological evaluation " revealed no cause for concern , " the Supreme Court said in a statement .
Doctors called the incident a " benign idiopathic seizure , " similar to one suffered by the chief justice in 1993 , the court statement said .
An idiopathic seizure is one with no identifiable physiological cause .
A source close to the chief justice told CNN that Roberts fell five to 10 feet after the seizure .
Roberts , 52 , was conscious after the fall , which caused only minor scrapes , the Supreme Court said .
The chief justice was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was expected to stay overnight , officials said .
A hospital spokesman would not discuss the case , citing privacy concerns .
Sources close to the chief justice said Roberts suffered an unexplained seizure in 1993 , soon after his first nomination to the D.C. circuit stalled in the Senate .
Friends blamed the seizure on stress from the confirmation fight , and Roberts limited certain activities such as driving after it happened .
But after a few weeks , the problem went away , the sources said .
Roberts had not suffered any recurrence since the seizure more than 14 years ago , the sources said .
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were informed about the earlier seizure when they were considering Roberts ' nomination to be chief justice in 2005 , but they did not think it was significant enough to bring up during his confirmation hearings , said Sen.
Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , who chaired the panel at the time .
" We knew but we did n't draw a heavy breath on it , " Specter said Monday .
President Bush was notified about Monday 's incident during an Oval Office meeting , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Roberts recently spent two weeks in Europe , where he taught a law course in Vienna , Austria , and attended a judicial conference in Paris , France , court sources said .
Roberts was at the Supreme Court late last week before traveling to Maine .
The chief justice bought his vacation home in June 2006 .
Roberts was appointed by Bush and has served as chief justice since September 2005 .
He is the youngest of the court 's nine justices .
Roberts served on the influential federal appellate court for the District of Columbia before being nominated to the Supreme Court after the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist .
The Supreme Court ended its session in June and wo n't reconvene until October .
Roberts and other federal judges , who have lifetime tenure , are not required to divulge information about their health or medical conditions .

All About U.S. Supreme Court
Scientists looking at the effect global warming will have on our major cities say a modest increase in the number of urban parks and street trees could offset decades of predicted temperature rises .
The University of Manchester study has calculated that a mere 10 % increase in the amount of green space in built - up centres would reduce urban surface temperatures by as much as 4°C .
This 4 °C drop in temperature , which is equivalent to the average predicted rise through global warming by the 2080s , is caused by the cooling effect of water as it evaporates into the air from leaves and vegetation through a process called transpiration .
“ Green space collects and retains water much better than the built environment , ” explained Dr Roland Ennos , a biomechanics expert in Manchester ’s Faculty of Life Sciences and a lead researcher in the team .
“ As this water evaporates from the leaves of plants and trees it cools the surrounding air in a similar way to the cooling effect of perspiration as it evaporates from our skin . ”
Taking Greater Manchester as their model , the team used Geographic Information System ( GIS ) mapping to build up a picture of the conurbation ’s land use .
The team then worked out the impact that increasing the amount of green space would have on the urban climate as well as on water retention .
“ Urban areas can be up to 12 °C warmer than more rural surroundings due to the heat given off by buildings , roads and traffic , as well as reduced evaporative cooling , in what is commonly referred to as an ‘ urban heat island ’ , ” said Dr Ennos , who worked on the project with Professor John Handley and Dr Susannah Gill in the School of Environment and Development .
“ We discovered that a modest increase of 10 % green space reduced surface temperatures in the urban environment by 4°C , which would overcome temperature rises caused by global warming over the next 75 years , effectively ‘ climate proofing ’ our cities .
“ Such a reduction has important implications for human comfort and health within urban areas and opportunities need to be taken to increase green space cover wherever structural changes are occurring within urban areas , as well as planting street trees or developing green roofs . ”
The research , published in Built Environment , also examined the effect increased green space would have on the amount of rainwater urban areas capture and retain ; towns and cities lose a large proportion of rainwater through what is termed ‘ run - off ’ where precipitation quickly leaves the surface and drains away into streams and rivers , eventually returning to the sea .
“ By the 2080s , our summers will be hotter and drier but winters are predicted to become wetter , ” said Dr Ennos .
“ An extreme wet winter ’s day by the 2080s will deliver almost 50 % more rain than is currently experienced .
“ Based on an existing model , we have calculated that these more powerful storms would increase the amount of run-off from urban areas by more than 80 % .
Unfortunately , increasing the amount of green space only has a limited effect in reducing run-off and so flash flooding will become an increasing problem in our cities .
“ Conversely , the warmer , drier summer months will reduce the amount of water available to plants and , during the longer droughts , this will reduce transpiration with its associated cooling effect .
“ In order for the cooling effect of green spaces to work when it is most needed , cities would need to develop ways to store additional water , which could then be used to irrigate the green spaces during drier months . ”

The common wisdom circulating in Washington these days is that the United States is too bogged down in Iraq to consider risky military action against Iran or – God forbid – North Korea .
Policy analysts describe the U.S. military as " overburdened " or " stretched to the limit . "
The presumption is that the Pentagon is telling President Bush that it can’t really undertake another major military contingency .
Added to these pessimistic assessments of U.S. military capacity is the widespread claim that a " new realism " has taken over in the administration ’s upper reaches , that cautious " realists " like Condoleezza Rice have gained the upper hand over fire - breathing neoconservatives .
Ergo :
No military strike against Iran or North Korea .
But I ’m not buying any of this .
Just as an empire on the rise , like the United States on the eve of the invasion of Iraq , is often inclined to take rash and ill - considered actions , so an empire on the decline , like the British and French empires after World War II , will engage in senseless , self - destructive acts .
And I fear the same can happen to the United States today , as we , too , slip into decline .
The decline of an empire can be a hard and painful thing for the affected imperial elites .
Those who are used to commanding subservience and respect from their subjects and from lesser powers are often ill - prepared to deal with their indifference and contempt .
Even harder is overcoming the long - inbred assumption that one ’s vassals are inferior – mentally , morally , and otherwise .
The first malady makes the declining elites extraordinarily sensitive to perceived slights or insults from their former subjects ; the second often leads elites to overestimate their own capabilities and to underestimate those of their former subjects – an often fatal error .
The two misjudgments often combine to produce an extreme readiness to strike back when a perceived insult coincides with a ( possibly deceptive ) military superiority .
The Suez Blunder
One of the most spectacular examples of such miscalculation in modern times – and an especially illuminating one – was the Suez Canal crisis of 1956 .
The crisis began in July 1956 when Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser , angry at the West ’s failure to support construction of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile , nationalized the Suez Canal , then owned principally by a British - French company and long regarded as a preeminent symbol of the British Empire .
A reasonable Anglo - French response to Nasser ’s move might have been to negotiate a dignified turnover of the canal ( as President Carter did in 1977 with the Panama Canal , thereby removing a major irritant in U.S. - Latin America relations ) .
But no : it was beneath their dignity to negotiate with rabble like Nasser .
Instead , with images of imperial grandeur still fresh in their minds , the British and French embarked on Oct. 29 , 1956 , upon an invasion of Egypt ( wisely bringing in the Israelis for a little backup ) .
Then the second malady kicked in .
From what can be reconstructed today , it never occurred to British and French leaders that their former subjects would even consider putting up any resistance to modern European armies , and so victory would occur swiftly .
Instead , it was pure debacle .
The British and French were far too few on the ground to win any military victories , and the Egyptians did n’t cry " uncle " at the first sight of the Union Jack .
Desperately , the British and French – who had first dismissed any need for American help – pleaded with then - President Eisenhower for American assistance .
But Ike was n’t in a mood to help .
Having seen which way the wind was blowing in the Middle East , he decided it was better to abandon his NATO allies than support the old imperialists in a battle with pan-Arab nationalism ( which might then choose to align with Moscow ) .
And so the British and French were forced to withdraw in utter humiliation .
Much in this extraordinary episode bears on the situation in Washington today .
Once again , a former subject state – in this case , Iran – is thumbing its nose at its former imperial overlords – Britain and the United States ( which together put the megalomaniacal shah in power there in 1953 ) .
Once again , extreme discomfort and distress has been the result .
Yes , I recognize that Iran ’s pursuit of nuclear technology poses a different sort of danger than Egypt ’s seizure of the Suez Canal ( though to hear the British tell it , that was no less of a strategic peril ) .
But there nevertheless remains a symbolic aspect to this whole crisis that cannot be entirely ignored .
A once subservient Third World nation confronts the Greatest Power the World Has Ever Known on something approaching equal terms .
It is precisely these sorts of circumstances that are likely to trigger rash , ill - considered action on the part of the declining power .
" How dare they stand up to us in that way ? " British and French officials must have been muttering to themselves back in 1956 .
And : " We ’ll teach them a thing or two !
Just you watch ! "
" How dare they stand up to us in that way ? "
White House officials must be saying to one another in private today .
And : " We ’ll teach them a thing or two !
Just you watch ! "
Overcoming Objections to War
But what about the problem of the over - stretched U.S. military and all those American soldiers now bogged down in Iraq ?
This is where the second post - imperial malady comes in .
Yes , American ground troops are bogged down in Iraq , but American air and sea power , currently underutilized in the Iraq conflict , can be used to cripple Iranian military capabilities with minimum demand on U.S. ground forces .
Despite the Israeli inability to emasculate Hezbollah with air power during the Lebanon fighting last summer , American air and naval officers , I suspect , believe that they can inflict punishing damage on the Iranians with air power alone , and do so without suffering significant casualties in return .
I also suspect that well - connected neoconservatives and , no doubt , Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld are whispering this message into the ear of President Bush .
And what about all the forms of retaliation we might expect from the Iranians , like an upsurge in Shi’ite disorder in Iraq and chaos in the oil markets ?
These and other likely Iranian responses are also said to be deterring a U.S. military strike .
But the Iranians will be incapable of such coordinated action after the U.S. Air Force subjects them to Shock and Awe , and anyway there are contingency plans in place to deal with the fallout .
Or so say the neocons , I would imagine .
So I believe that the common wisdom in Washington regarding military action against Iran is wrong .
Just because American forces are bogged down in Iraq , and Condoleezza Rice appears to enjoy a bit more authority these days , does not mean that " realism " will prevail at the White House .
I suspect that the response of declining British and French imperial elites when faced with provocative acts by a former subject power in 1956 is a far more accurate gauge of what to expect from the Bush administration today .
The impulse to strike back must be formidable .
Soon , I fear , it will prove irresistible .

Deadly germs may be more likely to be spread due to a biodefence lab accident than a biological attack by terrorists .
Plague , anthrax , Rocky Mountain spotted fever – these are among the bioweapons some experts fear could be used in a germ warfare attack against the US .
But the public has had near - misses with those diseases and others over the past five years , ironically because of accidents in labs that were working to defend against bioterrorists .
Even worse , they may be only the tip of an iceberg .
The revelations come from Ed Hammond of the Sunshine Project , a biosafety pressure group based in Austin , Texas , US , who after persistent requests got the minutes of university biosafety committees using the US Freedom of Information Act .
The minutes are accessible to the public by law .
There are now 20,000 people at 400 sites around the US working with putative bioweapons germs , says Hammond , 10 times more than before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
Some scientists have warned for years that more people handling dangerous germs are a recipe for accidents .

Unreported incidents ?
The fears have been borne out by publicised infections of lab workers with tularemia , brucellosis and Q fever .
The Q fever incident took place at Texas A&M University , which has now been ordered to stop research into potential bioweapons while an investigation takes place .
However , Hammond ’s minutes contain further slip - ups which had not been reported to the general public :
 At the University of New Mexico , one worker was jabbed with an anthrax - laden needle , and another with a syringe containing an undisclosed , genetically engineered microbe .
 At the Medical University of Ohio , workers were exposed to and infected with Valley Fever .
 At the University of Chicago , there was another puncture with an undisclosed agent normally requiring heavy containment , probably anthrax or plague .
 At the University of California at Berkeley , workers handled deadly Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , which spreads in the air , without containment when it was mislabelled as harmless .
 At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , and at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City , TB escaped containment after equipment failed .
As yet , none of the accidents have been serious in outcome .
But , Hammond fears , more such accidents may go unreported .
“ Instead of a ‘ culture of responsibility ’ , the federal government has instilled a culture of denial ” he says .
“ Labs hide problems , and think that accident reporting is for masochists ”
Reporting essential
Without stringently enforced reporting rules , he says , labs have every reason to cover up accidents .
They want to avoid losing research funds , and fear the massive official reaction to any accident – such as the imprisonment of plague researcher Thomas Butler in 2003 .
And he claims Texas A&M officials have said they now regret reporting the Q fever incident .
“ I think the answer is to create a level playing field by having clear and absolutely mandatory reporting requirements , ” says Hammond .
“ Eliminate even the possibility of an institution claiming that it does not have to report infections . ”
“ The labs will say , you ca n’t do that because then people wo n’t report accidents , ” says Hammond .
“ Well , I think it ’s pretty clear that people do n’t report accidents as it stands . ”

The conservation group 's annual Red List of threatened species , published today , found that the extinction crisis had escalated in the last year with 16,306 species now at the highest levels of extinction threat , equivalent to almost 40 % of all species in the survey .
A quarter of all mammals , a third of all amphibians and one in eight birds on the 2007 IUCN Red List are in jeopardy .
More than 180 species have been added since 2006 to the ranks of those classified as endangered , critically endangered or vulnerable .
IUCN director general Julia Marton - Lefèvre warned that this year 's list showed how efforts to protect species were inadequate and that a concerted effort by all levels of society was needed to prevent their widespread extinction .

Troops say failure to learn lessons led to soldier kidnappings David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email
This CNN reported on Friday that the recent kidnapping of American soldiers in the so - called " Triangle of Death " in Iraq might have been avoided if the military had learned the lessons of a very similar incident in the same area a year ago , when a post was attacked and soldiers kidnapped and later killed .
According to taped depositions taken by lawyers , the soldiers in that area are " constantly " complaining there are too few troops on the ground and asking for a larger force .
" If I was an an insurgent , I would attack , " says one soldier .
" These jackasses , they did it again ... they did n't learn , " says another .
After the earlier incident , a platoon leader and a commander were disciplined , but ironically they were the same men who had been begging for more troops .
CNN asked a retired general to comment on the incident .
He said that lessons can easily be forgotten as troops rotate in and out of a combat area , but also agreed that under current circumstances 170,000 troops in Iraq are not enough .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning .

The Election Science Institute just released a statement revealing that the memory cards that will be used to store votes on Election Day in Cuyahoga County , Ohio were stuck into ordinary laptop computers in September .
The release points to an online video shot by Cleveland - area filmmaker Jeffrey Kirkby , shows a group of election workers sitting at tables , each with a laptop computer .
An official explains that these laptops were gathered from around the office , and some are the personal laptops of election workers .
Each worker has a laptop and a stack of memory cards , and is inserting the memory cards one by one into the laptop .
Our e-voting study ) showed that the memory cards used in Diebold touchscreen voting systems can carry computer viruses that can infect voting machines and steal votes on the infected machines .
The risk here is that one of the laptops is infected with malicious software that could infect a memory card that will eventually be inserted into a voting machine .
Safe procedures call for memory cards to be inserted only into computers that are carefully secured and never connected to the Internet .
Using ordinary laptop computers , borrowed from offices and homes , to process memory cards is dangerous .
Voting machine vendors and election officials often argue that rigorous procedures can compensate for the technical weaknesses of voting machines .
Some jurisdictions implement such procedures well , but many do not .
Talking about procedural controls is easy .
Putting them into practice is much harder .
Points to Ponder : “ The love of one ’s country is a splendid thing .
But why should love stop at the border ? "
- Pablo Casals ( Spanish Cellist , Wrote music for UN Anthem for world peace , 1963 Presidential Medal of Freedom ; b.1876-1973 )
Story Line : On September 24 , 1970 , I saw an envelope in the mail box .
It had exotic stamps on it that said Philippines , a place I had not heard of .
It was from Luisa Go in Manila who had gotten my address from her best friend who was my cousin ’s penfriend .
I already had twelve penfriends in various countries but decided to make one more friend for the reasons mentioned in the Reflection section .
During childhood , Luisa had a fascination with Indian culture and people .
I found out later that on the way home from high school , she would walk down a street full of shops owned by Indians who lived in Philippines .
Filipinos called them “ Bombay ” .
When she would reach home , her mother would tease her “ Did you see your Bombay today ? ”
In 1969 she saw an American movie Maya which was about two teenage boys and Elephant in the jungles of India .
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(1966_film)).
One of them was an American actor ( Jay North ) and the other was an Indian actor ( Sajid Khan ) .
She became a big fan of Sajid Khan .
So when she learned that her best friend had a pen friend in India she asked her to find her one through her Indian penfriend .
-- and
She became my 13th penfriend .
That is how it all began fifty years ago .
The rest of the story is in the reflection section that was shared on our 40th wedding anniversary two years ago .
Reflection : The Spy Who Loved Me During my years in elementary school , I developed an interest in collecting stamps .
I heard that our neighbor was getting letters from Germany so every other week I would go to his window to check if he had received any letters , and ask if he had some stamps for me .
After returning from one summer vacation , and expecting a ton of stamps , I went to his place only to find the windows shut .
After a few more days with closed windows , I knocked on the main door of the house .
The lady who was renting the room to him informed me that he had moved to Germany .
Upon further investigation I found out that his “ Penfriend ” had come and they had gotten married and moved to Germany * .
That was my first exposure to English word , " Penfriend . ”
That experience added to my hobby of stamp collecting and I wanted to know more about other countries while improving my English .
By the summer of 1970 , I had Penfriends in twelve different countries .
So when my cousin Yogini informed me that she had given my address to a girl in Philippines who was looking for a friend in India , I was not very enthusiastic .
All the other Penfriends I had selected were from countries where I could correctly pronounce the name .
I had never heard about the country named “ Fili Pines * * ” .
Plus she was going to be No. 13 .
I also thought about having no more money to buy stamps to send letters .
My cousin was persistent and informed me that the person she was recommending is the best friend of her penfriend Helen Tan in Philippines and I would be very happy .
She also showed me the stamps from Fili Pines which were very attractive .
On September 24 , 1970 I received the first letter from Luisa Go .
The casual writing style , handwriting and the brief introduction was very appealing .
And the stamps were beautiful .
The only thing that seemed strange was she had used the word Penpal instead of Penfriend .
But I accepted the new label considering that one purpose of having friends around the world was to learn new things .
Things started out well until in one of her subsequent letters , she mentioned that she had a Chinese heritage .
Her father was born in China and had migrated to Philippines at an early age and her mother was half Chinese and half Filipino .
The word “ Chinese ” raised a Red Flag on my side .
In the early 60s India and China had a border war and after that the relationships between two countries were strained .
When some people found out she was “ Chinese ” they gave me cautionary advice ; be careful , Chinese are very smart and they might be trying to get a spy through Fili Pines .
After some discussion with my parents about this I decided to take a chance and keep writing letters .
Over next five years , we exchanged many letters , stamps and sometimes coins as Bonus .
She had great sense of humor and shared very interesting stories about places , movies and various things written on variety of papers in a very likeable style .
In 1974 I moved to California .
After a string of coincidences , On August 2 , 1978 , I ended up in Philippines to meet her .
Since we never thought we would ever meet in person , we had told each other enough secrets about ourselves leaving no need for confessions .
So in my second visit there in September of the same year , we got engaged .
During my third visit there on December 19 , 1978 , we exchanged vows “ I Do ” in front of the judge in Manila City Hall .
Reflection :
The last forty years have enriched us with the great understanding of each other ; for me , richness and diversity of Chinese and Filipino people ; and for her , fascinating history and heritage of India and its people .
In August 1978 , when I came out of the door of Manila International Airport for the first time , I saw two girls waiting outside .
Instantly I recognized my Penpal .
The very first thought that came to my mind was “ Do I want to be with her for the rest of my life ? ” and my heart said “ Yes ” .
And Yes , through the years there have been some border conflicts ( aka disagreements , dialogues ) , some intense , but not once over anything related to our countries , cultures or religions .
Just excursions we would have had in any relationship even if the person was from our own culture .
One ancient rule of warfare has been followed : Ceasefire before dark ( and a goodnight hug ) .
In 14 years of Friday Reflections being in a public domain , I have never shared such very personal story .
Thank
You for allowing me to do so on the significant milestone in our journey ; 40 years .
I will end with the words from a very first valentine card from my new life partner and former penpal ( Year 1979 . )
“ You are life ’s most precious gift to me , for the reasons even I ca n’t explain .
I love you more and more every day . ”
* in late 1980s we were able to track down that neighbor through common association .
JayKrishna and Giesla came by our place during their visit to USA .
** We pronounced Philippines as Fili Pines in early days .
Animals
Humans are hardly the only interesting members of the animal kingdom .
Research on the bodies and behaviors of our furry ( and creepy and crawly and slimy and slithery ) cousins can help scientists learn more about our own species ’ evolution and cognition .
And even when they do n’t help unlock the ancient secrets of human ancestry , some animals are just too cute — or weird , or gross , or terrifying — not to get to know a little better .
Go ahead : take a walk on the wild side .

Snowclone collectors , call your offices
Eagle - eyed reader Josh Kamensky points out a phrasal formula that has popped up in the headings of three separate Language Log posts :
Geoff clearly enjoys this trope , having sent similar requests in other contexts to Deborah Tannen and William Safire .
( He even exhorted me to call my office in a May 25 , 2007 post , though sad to say I never did . )
Having spotted this pattern , Kamensky wonders if this is properly categorized as a snowclone ( or perhaps merely a catchphrase or cliché ) , and he also inquires after the source of the expression .
I can take a stab at the second question , which may help in answering the first question .
Young whippersnappers may not remember an age before beepers , pagers , or cellphones .
( Of course , in the march of technology , beepers and pagers are now almost forgotten . )
There once was a time when a doctor or other professional could only be paged in a public place by means of an announcement over a public address system .
The paged person would then presumably scurry to the nearest pay phone ( remember those ? ) .
Sporting events were prime locales for these announcements .
Take this moment from Nelson Algren 's 1942 novel Never Come Morning , taking place between rounds in a Chicago boxing match featuring the protagonist Bruno " Lefty Biceps " Bicek :
The announcer climbed over the ropes and spoke into the amplifier .
" Is Dr. Morris Pechter in the house ?
Dr. Pechter , please call your office .
Is Dr. Pechter here ? "
" Is that fer him 'r me , Case ? " Bruno wondered .
" Not fer neither .
You ai n't hurt .
Fer some croaker in the house is all . "
Baseball games were another typical venue for the " call your office " announcement .
Here are mentions in reports on World Series games in 1945 and 1957 :
Just when the Detroit Tigers belted Chicago 's Hank Borowy from the mound , the public address system blared : " Coroner A.L. Brodie , call your office . "
( Washington Post , Oct. 8 , 1945 , p. 11 )
There 's no free publicity for doctors here at the stadium [ in Milwaukee ] .
If they are expecting calls , they are issued numbers , and are paged over the loud - speakers as , " Dr. 123 , please call your office . "
( Los Angeles Times , Oct. 7 , 1957 , p. 6 )
It 's hard to know when such announcements became common , since they only get referred to in newspaper articles when they 're somehow noteworthy .
With the advent of large - venue PA systems ( and coin - operated public telephones ) around the country , it 's probably safe to say that the " call your office " line could be heard on a regular basis by 1930 .
That was the year when Joseph Crater , a New York Supreme Court judge , mysteriously disappeared after entering a Manhattan taxi .
The case attracted an enormous amount of attention , but Crater was never found .
A 1979 Washington
Post article recounts the effect of Crater 's disappearance on the national consciousness :
Within mere months of his disappearance he had become part of the national folklore , the subject of scavenger hunts and night club routines — " Judge Crater , call your office . "
The phrase " to pull a Crater " entered the idiom .
( Washington Post , Aug. 5 , 1979 — via Barry Popik )
Other secondary sources back up the popularity of this punchline in the months and years following Crater 's disappearance ( Arthur S. Koykka 's Project Remember says " vaudeville routines of the 1930s often included the line " ) .
Unfortunately , I have n't been able to find any contemporaneous accounts .
The line first starts popping up in the newspaper databases quite suddenly in 1966 , when it was revived as a popular bit of graffiti .
Syndicated columnists picked up on it right away :
And this inscription in the gentlemen's room of a lower Manhattan saloon ain't bad either : " Judge Crater  Call Your Office . "
( Column by Norton Mockridge , Delaware County [ Penn . ]
Daily Times , Sep. 21 , 1966 , p. 7 )
A few days ago , some wag among the many state legislative leaders assembled in conference at a Washington hotel affixed the following note to the lobby bulletin board : " Judge Crater ... Please call your office . "
( " NEA Washington Notebook , " Hagerstown [ Md. ]
Daily Mail , Nov. 30 , 1966 , p. 6 )
Kids no longer chalk up the same old words on , walls and subway posters .
That 's considered very , very old hat these days  and decidedly unsophisticated .
Instead , you can , find startling inscriptions like the following : ... Judge Crater , please phone your office .
...
The handwriting , concludes Warren Boroson , who copied down the above graffiti , is obviously on the wall .
( Bennett Cerf 's " Try And Stop Me , " Playground Daily News , Fort Walton Beach , Fla. , Dec. 22 , 1966 , p. 8 )
The American Psychiatric association heard a learned paper based on scribblings on the walls of bars , wash rooms , bus stations , etc. Examples : " Judge Crater — Please Call Your Office Immediately , " [ etc . ]
( Column by George Morgenstern , Chicago Tribune , Dec. 31 , 1966 , p. 1 )
It 's a bit surprising that this would emerge as a widespread graffito 36 years after Judge Crater disappeared , but he was apparently still remembered as " the most missingest man in America . "
( He would eventually be eclipsed by D.B. Cooper in 1971 and Jimmy Hoffa in 1975 . )
In any case , the " X , call your office " line was subsequently applied to various public figures whose whereabouts were unknown , at least temporarily .
For instance , it came in handy when Chicago Alderman Fred Hubbard disappeared in May 1971 with $ 100,000 in federal funds ( he was later tracked down and convicted of embezzlement ) :
A restaurant on Touhy Avenue in Skokie sports this sign : Ald. Fred Hubbard , Call Your Office !
( Chicago Tribune , June 18 , 1971 , p. 18 )
Ald. Hubbard : Call your office !
( Chicago Defender , Feb. 29 , 1972 , p. 4 , headline )
And when Wilt Chamberlain was brought on as a coach for the San Diego Conquistadors of the American Basketball Association but then did n't show up for two games , the Mar. 1 , 1974 Los Angeles Times headline predictably read , " Wilt , Call Your Office . "
With the expression firmly entrenched , " X , call your office " began to be extended to other humorous uses , not simply as a joke about someone " pulling a Crater . "
X could be a literary or historical figure whose presence was rhetorically requested by the writer .
( Similar devices include " Paging Dr. Freud ... " )
Conservative columnist George
Will took advantage of this trope rather too often .
A search on his columns ( in the Washington Post and Newsweek , and syndicated elsewhere ) finds an enormous number of examples , beginning with " George Orwell , call your office " in a Mar. 8 , 1976 column .
Here is a list of the other figures that Will called upon from the late ' 70s to the late ' 80s :
Henry Adams ( June 10 , 1979 ) , Pericles ( Oct. 21 , 1982 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( Jan. 2 , 1984 ) , Ring Lardner ( Oct. 9 , 1984 and again on Apr. 14 , 1986 ) , Peter Pan ( Feb. 3 , 1986 ) , Karl Marx ( Dec. 28 , 1986 ) , Stephen Gould ( June 25 , 1987 ) , Abraham Lincoln ( Jan. 4 , 1988 ) , Jesse Jackson ( Apr 17 , 1988 ) , Edward Gibbon ( May 9 , 1988 ) , Jefferson and Madison ( Dec. 15 , 1988 ) , Immanuel Kant ( Feb. 27 , 1989 ) , and Cotton Mather ( May 8 , 1989 ) .
( Whew ! )
Finally , someone took
Will to task for his repetitiveness .
Reviewing a collection of his columns in the Washington Times ( Nov. 5 , 1990 ) , Florence King wrote :
Otherwise , in an age that is seeing the certain collapse of English , the miracle is that George Will has only one stylistic tic : " E.T. , phone home , your accountant says you have sold 15 million videocassettes . "
" Immanuel Kant , call your office .
Washington cannot keep track of all its categorical imperatives . "
George Will , phone home .
The Graffiti Protection Society has surrounded your house .
That review must have chastened Will to some extent , since he put the kibosh on the " call your office " line for several years .
He returned to his old favorite " Orwell , call your office " as the headline for a Newsweek column on Feb.
3 , 1997 and since then has used the formula quite sparingly ( " Freud , call your office , " Aug 10 , 2003 ; " Inspector Clouseau , call your office , " Dec. 18 , 2006 ) .
So , is " X , call your office " properly considered a snowclone ?
When the question was brought up at the Language Log water cooler , Adam Albright chimed in :
I have a feeling that it does n't really count as a snowclone in the sense of " generalization of a specific expression as it enters popular parlance " , since it was truly a very common functional formula that has gotten stranded in restricted contexts nowadays .
I personally take a more latitudinarian approach to snowclones .
First , I do n't think we always need to pinpoint a " specific expression " that is the source of a generalizable template .
For instance , the standup comedian Richard Lewis takes credit for popularizing the snowclone " the X from hell " in the ' 80s , even though we can't trace a single baptismal use of this expression .
And in the case of " X , call your office , " we actually do have an originating source for the current cliché in " Judge Crater , call your office , " from which all subsequent jocular and rhetorical usage apparently flows .
The sturdiness of the Crater joke outlasted the original functionality of the expression and has displayed true snowcloniness by spawning countless imitators .
Of course , the template can now be used by younger generations of writers with no firm memory of Crater or the public paging routines that provided the cultural context for the punchline / graffito .
As we 've seen before , successful snowclones very often take on a life of their own , detached and decontextualized from whatever provenance we might be able to document .
But uncovering the hidden histories of such snowclones ( now made possible by digitized databases of books , magazines , and newspapers ) can certainly be fascinating in its own right , even if the quarry remains as slippery and elusive as Judge Crater , the most missingest man .
Fox analyst : Germany 's actions leave us ' no choice ' but to bomb Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This According to Fox News , advisers are telling the White House that diplomacy has failed to stop Iran 's nuclear program , and as a result officials are making plans to attack Iran as early as next summer .
" A recent decision by German officials to withhold support for any new sanctions against Iran has pushed a broad spectrum of officials in Washington to develop potential scenarios for a military attack on the Islamic regime , " Fox reported on Tuesday .
Lt. Gen. ( ret. )
Thomas McInerney told Fox , " Since Germany has backed out of helping economically , we do not have any other choice .
...
They 've forced us into the military option . "
" I think the option should initially be tit - for - tat , " McInerney went on .
" For every explosively formed projectile from Iran that goes off in Iraq , two go off in Iran , no questions asked . "
" The one I favor the most , of course , is an air campaign , " he continued .
" Forty - eight hours duration , hitting 2500 aimed points to take out their nuclear facilities , their air defense facilities , their air force , their navy , their Shahab - 3 retaliatory missiles , and finally their command and control .
And then let the Iranian people take their country back . "
McInerney described such a bombing campaign as " easy " and spoke enthusiastically of the weaponry involved , including " a new massive ordnance penetrator that 's 30,000 pounds , that really penetrates ...
Ahmadinejad has nothing in Iran that we can't penetrate . "
Although introduced by Fox merely as a military analyst , McInerney has been prominent for several years as an advocate of war against Iran and chairs the advisory council of the hardline Iran Policy Committee , known for its backing of the anti-Iranian terrorist group , MEK .
McInerney was quoted in February 2005 as saying , " [ Bush ] does n't have any choice .
" He understands [ the Iranians ] are the king of terror right now .
They are striving for nuclear weapons that can get into the hands of terrorists , and then it 's too late . "
# Excerpts from
Fox article : Germany  a pivotal player among three European nations to rein in Iran 's nuclear program over the last two - and - a - half years through a mixture of diplomacy and sanctions supported by the United States  notified its allies last week that the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel refuses to support the imposition of any further sanctions against Iran that could be imposed by the U.N. Security Council .
Consequently , according to a well - placed Bush administration source , " everyone in town " is now participating in a broad discussion about the costs and benefits of military action against Iran , with the likely timeframe for any such course of action being over the next eight to 10 months , after the presidential primaries have probably been decided , but well before the November 2008 elections .
The discussions are now focused on two basic options : less invasive scenarios under which the U.S. might blockade Iranian imports of gasoline or exports of oil , actions generally thought to exact too high a cost on the Iranian people but not enough on the regime in Tehran ; and full - scale aerial bombardment .
On the latter course , active consideration is being given as to how long it would take to degrade Iranian air defenses before American air superiority could be established and U.S. fighter jets could then begin a systematic attack on Iran 's known nuclear targets .

The following video is from Fox 's America 's Newsroom , broadcast on September 12 .
We know political pressure building on ending the war in Iraq could cause Bush to attack Iran .
He will not allow Congress to force him to admit the fact that he has failed .
My bet is he will order an attack before Sept. 15 – before the Petraus report is likely to further increase political opposition to the Iraq War .
More to the grim report :
Last year Mr Bush came down in favour of Ms Rice , who along with Britain , France and Germany has been putting a diplomatic squeeze on Iran .
But at a meeting of the White House , Pentagon and state department last month , Mr Cheney expressed frustration at the lack of progress and Mr Bush sided with him .
" The balance has tilted .
There is cause for concern , " the source said this week .
There is a powerful , toxic cocktail in the White House .
It ’s one part Cheney , the terrible tyrant who does not believe in this Republic and does not accept facts that conflict with the warmongering outcome he wishes to impose on us peasants .
It ’s also one part Decider – deciding from the options Cheney ’s already decided on .
And the sociopathic , narcissistic Decider will never admit failure .
This is the truly scary part - he ’s trapped and can never face the failure he in fact is .
The drumbeats to war have been growing louder for the past several months .
On of the early reports to warn about this was posted by Steve Clemons on May 24 , 2007 .
He wrote at that time :
Multiple sources have reported that a senior aide on Vice President Cheney 's national security team has been meeting with policy hands of the American Enterprise Institute , one other think tank , and more than one national security consulting house and explicitly stating that Vice President Cheney does not support President Bush 's tack towards Condoleezza Rice 's diplomatic efforts and fears that the President is taking diplomacy with Iran too seriously .
This White House official has stated to several Washington insiders that Cheney is planning to deploy an " end run strategy " around the President if he and his team lose the policy argument .
The thinking on Cheney 's team is to collude with Israel , nudging Israel at some key moment in the ongoing standoff between Iran 's nuclear activities and international frustration over this to mount a small - scale conventional strike against Natanz using cruise missiles ( i.e. , not ballistic missiles ) .
If the Guardian report is accurate , then it looks like Cheney 's end run is just about ' mission accomplished ' .
The exposure of Cheney ’s evil machinations seems to have in no way constrained his subterfuge .
And the Senate votes 97 - 0 ...... Mark my word that will be in the first line in Bush 's speech justifying the sneak attack on Iran .
Are we powerless to stop a war with Iran ?

In the 1970s , terrorist violence is the stuff of networks ' nightly news programming and the corporate structure of the UBS Television Network is changing .
Meanwhile , Howard Beale , the aging UBS news anchor , has lost his once strong ratings share and so the network fires him .
Beale reacts in an unexpected way .
We then see how this affects the fortunes of Beale , his coworkers ( Max Schumacher and Diana Christensen ) , and the network .

For four years , Vice President Dick Cheney has resisted routine oversight of his office ’s handling of classified information , and when the National Archives unit that monitors classification in the executive branch objected , the vice president ’s office suggested abolishing the oversight unit , according to documents released yesterday by a Democratic congressman .
The Information Security Oversight Office , a unit of the National Archives , appealed the issue to the Justice Department , which has not yet ruled on the matter .
Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , disclosed Mr. Cheney ’s effort to shut down the oversight office .
Mr. Waxman , who has had a leading role in the stepped - up efforts by Democrats to investigate the Bush administration , outlined the matter in an eight - page letter sent Thursday to the vice president and posted , along with other documentation , on the committee ’s Web site .
Officials at the National Archives and the Justice Department confirmed the basic chronology of events cited in Mr. Waxman ’s letter .
In 1943 , some American troops were stationed in Iraq .
Here is a PDF of a War Department handbook introducing them to the country ( ' i - RAHK " ) , and providing some do's and don'ts when interacting with the Iraqi people .
Some highlights :
NEVER discuss religion or politics or women with Moslems .
Do n't stare at anyone .
Remember the fear of the " evil eye " .
Knock before entering a private house .
If a woman answers , wait until she has had time to retire .
If you see grown men walking hand in hand , ignore it .
They are not queer .
You can usually tell a mosque by its high tower .
* Keep away from mosques .
*[ Emphasis in the original ] * * If you try to enter one , you will be thrown out , probably with a severe beating .
There are four towns in Iraq which are particularly sacred to the Iraq Moslems : Kerbala , Najaf , samarra , and Kadhiman .
Unless you are ordered to these towns it is advisable to stay away from them .
Moslems here are divided into two factions something like our division into Catholic and Protestant denominations – so do n't put in your two cents when Iraqis argue about religion .
There are also political differences in Iraq that have puzzled diplomats and statesmen .
You wo n't help matters any by getting mixed up in them .
And then there 's this :
American success or failure in Iraq may well depend on whether the Iraqis ( as the people are called ) like American soldiers or not .
It may not be quite that simple .
But then again it could .
Amen , brother !

I just wanted to give you all another gentle reminder about the Aurigid Meteor Shower , due to light the heavens on September 1st , 2007 .
Although the shower wo n’t peak until early tomorrow morning , astrophotographer John Chumack has already captured one on camera , and made a little video of its path through the skies .
Now , we do n’t know if this meteor shower is going to be amazing or boring , it ’s all a mystery .
John had an automated camera pointed East on morning of August 31st , 2007 , and captured a meteor streaking out of the constellation Auriga .
John estimates that the meteor brightened to about 0.1 magnitude before fading away .
John created a quick video of the meteor , and overlaid the constellation Auriga , so you can get a sense of direction .
The video is a Windows movie file ( WMV ) , and it ’s about 850 kb .
Click here to download the movie .
Check out John ’s website here for more amazing space images .
As I mentioned in an earlier article , the Aurigids are the dusty remnants from Comet Kiess .
This long - period comet has only visited the inner Solar System twice in the last two thousand years – its last visit was in 83 BC .
During that visit , the comet put down a trail of material that ’s been drifting towards the Earth ’s orbit ever since .
And on September 1st , 2007 , our planet will cross this dusty trail for the first time .
Will it be spectacular or boring ?
Nobody knows , we ’ve never hit this dust trail before .
The outburst peaks on September 1st at 11:36 UT .
In other words , for folks in Europe , that ’s in the middle of the day .
Not great timing .
For me here on the West Coast of Canada , that ’s 4:36 am PDT .
The whole event should last about 2 hours , and be visible from California , Oregon , Hawaii and the Eastern Pacific Ocean .
But you never know what ’s going to happen .
If you ’re feeling adventurous , check out the show .
Get up a few hours before dawn , or watch in the early evening , and see if you can spot some meteors .
And as always , let me know how it goes .
Here ’s more info from NASA .
No evidence to prove existence of Ram , Centre to SC

In the midst of a political controversy over the Sethusamudram project , the Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that there was no historical evidence to establish the existence of Lord Ram or the other characters in Ramayana .
In an affidavit filed before the apex court , the Archaeological Survey of India rejected the claim of the existence of the Ram Sethu bridge in the area where the project was under construction .
The multi-crore rupee project proposes to provide a shorter sea route from Rameshwaram to Sri Lanka [ Images ] .
Referring to the Ramayana , the affidavit said there is no " historical record " to incontrovertibly prove the existence of the character , or the occurrences of the events , depicted therein .
ASI in its affidavit filed through ASI Director ( monuments ) C Dorjee stated , " The petitioners while seeking relief have primarily relied upon the contents of the Valimiki Ramayana , the Ram Charit Manas by Tulsidas and mythological texts , which formed an important part of ancient Indian literature , but which cannot be said to be historical records to incontrovertibly prove the existence of the characters or the occurrence of the event , depicted therein . "
Whereas it is submitted that the ASI is aware of and duly respects the deep religious import bestowed upon these texts by the Hindu community across the globe , it is also submitted that the study of human history , which is the primary object of the ASI , like other sciences and fields of study , must be carried out in a scientific manner using available technological aids , and its findings must be based on tangible material evidence . "
Earlier , Marine and Water Resources Group , Space Application Centre , Ahmedabad , which had conducted the study had said , " The Adam 's bridge / Ram Sethu is believed to be constructed by Lord Ram to cross over to Sri Lanka . "
The period of Ramayana is considered as Tretha Yug ( more than 17,00,000 years ago ) .
The study , however , concluded that the Adam 's bridge is not man made in nature .
The views expressed by the government and ASI are also same .
It may be noted here that the petitioner has sought declaration from the court that the formation known as Ram Sethu / Adam 's bridge is a protected and ancient monument and it should not be demolished while constructing Sethusamudram which is going to connect Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in order to save navigation time for the ships .
The apex court is going to hear the petition on September 14 .
Hindus believe that Ram Sethu was built by Lord Ram with the help of Hanuman 's [ Images ] Vanar Sena to free his wife Sita from the captivity of ' demon king ' Ravana .
Wednesday 's affidavit filed jointly by Central government , ASI , and other government agencies virtually puts a question mark against authenticity of the epic called Ramayana and even questions whether the incidents mentioned in it including the battle between Lord Ram and Ravana ever took place .
The apex court had earlier directed the government not to damage 35 - km- long Ram Sethu .
The Centre and state of Tamil Nadu are hell bent on removing Ram Sethu as they have refused to take any of six alternative routes suggested for Sethusamudram .
Additional Reportage : UNI
Godin ’s Sunday post is titled “ The new rules of naming “ .
Here ’s our take on these “ rules ” , point by point :
For a long time , I did n’t like my name .
I spent more than 30 years spelling both my first and last name in school and on the phone .
It did n’t help that I had a little trouble with my S ’s when I was a kid .
Of course , now I think it ’s fantastic that my grandfather overruled my mom when she wanted to name me Scott .
( I think he had an issue with the branding of a type of toilet paper , but that ’s a different story ) .
Scott ’s a tough name in the Google world .
Mark is even tougher .
Michael is probably toughest of all .
We went through a lot of hoops in naming Squidoo .
I realized as I was explaining the process to a friend the other day that the same logic applies to any product or service or company in our bottom - up world , so here goes :
OK , he ’s promising to lay out a logic and a process .
A long time ago , the goal of a name was to capture the essence of your positioning .
To deliver a USP , so you could establish supremacy in your space just with your name .
International Business Machines and Shredded
Wheat were good efforts at this approach .
IBM and Shredded Wheat are names that have nothing to do with positioning .
Each name is a generic descriptor .
Apple and Virgin and Yahoo are names designed to capture the essence of their respective company ’s positioning .
Names that are designed to portray positioning cannot be purely descriptive .
Ever .
It quickly became clear , though , that descriptive names were too generic , so the goal was to coin a defensible word that could acquire secondary meaning and that you could own for the ages .
That ’s why “ Jet Blue ” is a much better name than “ Southwest ” and why “ Starbucks ” is so much better than “ Dunkin Donuts ” .
That ’s the Hobson ’s choice ?
Either pick a descriptive name or a coined name ?
Names like Apple , Virgin , Yahoo and Igor need not apply ?
We believe that the most effective route in naming is to name your positioning rather than your goods or services .
Seth ’s “ new rules ” eliminate that choice , the most powerful choice .
“ Naming companies ” flourished , charging clients hundreds of thousands of dollars to coin made up words like Altria .
Altria is a useless name , as is Agilent .
The irony is that the set of flawed goals and assumptions that lead companies to embrace names with negative marketing and branding value , like Altria and Agilent , are the very same goals and assumptions that lead to Squidoo : domain availability and a unique spelling to raise it to the top of Google .
And ease of trademark , of course .
( Seth , you migh want to file a trademark for Squidoo , since it does not appear in the trademark database .
That ’s a good naming rule by the way , and it ’s not even new . )
This is a horrible choice of priorities and a horrible choice of name direction .
Any spod worth his salt knows that less than one percent of your internet traffic will be generated by people searching your actual name .
The notion that Squidoo or Altria are working well for Google searches is true only for searchers who know the name , who know what Altria or Squidoo does , and still want to find them .
Those people will find them anyway , even if they are called “ Mikes blog ” .
So our stand is that even though these names were chosen to perform only one task , the task itself is a banal , unnecessary , low - level strategy point .
Then domains came along .
Suddenly , people were charging ( I ’m not making this up ) , $ 300,000 for goggles.com .
The idea was that if you could grab a domain name ( there ’s only one goggles.com in the entire world ) , then people could easily find you .
I think many of these rules have changed , largely because of the way people use Google .
Goggles.com , Pets.com and Drugstore.com were not the result of a rule that was in place .
They were part of an ill - informed trend .
Generic branding was and will always be a bad idea .
If you want Jet Blue or ikea or some other brand , you ’re just as likely to type the brand into google as you are to guess the domain name .
In essence , we ’ve actually added a step in the process of finding someone online .
( How else would anyone find Del.ico.us ? )
This means that having the perfect domain name is nice , but it ’s WAY more important to have a name that works in technorati and yahoo and google when someone is seeking you out .
Sort of a built - in SEO strategy .
Flickr is a good name .
So is 37 signals .
The design firm Number 17 , however , is not .
Answers , About , Hotels and Business are all fine URLs , but they do n’t work very well if someone forgets to put the < dot com > part in .
Do a Yahoo search on radar and you wo n’t find the magazine or the website in the making , and do a search on simple and you wo n’t end up at the very expensive simple .com domain .
If you ’re trying to make your way as a blogger , calling yourself Doc or Scoble or Seth is a much simpler way to establish a platform than calling your blog “ Mike ’s Blog ” .
Sound obvious ?
Of course it does .
But books still get titles like “ Chip Kidd , Work : 1986 - 2006 , Book One ” .
Yes , it is obvious , do n’t do anything generic .
Is that a new rule ?
So , that was the first task .
Find a name that came up with close to zero Google matches .
The only English language matches I found for Squidoo were for a style of fishing lure ( we bought 6 gross , more on that later ) .
If I had a choice between a killer domain with a generic word in it or a great word that led to a less than perfect domain , I ’d take the first , second every time .
There are no killer generic domains .
Again , Pets.com , Drugstore.com , Business.com are all generic and therefore bad choices .
What is meant by “ a less than perfect domain ” here ?
One that ’s not a generic descriptor like Pets.com ?
Is there a new rule hidden in that thought ?
The second thing that ’s happening with the explosion of made - up unique names is that the very structure of the word now communicates meaning .
Web 2.0 names often have missing ( or extra ) vowels .
The “ oo ” double o is a great way to communicate a certain something about a net company .
Um , we are actually now in Web 3.0 .
Web 1.0 was Chairs.com , Automobiles.com and Search.com .
Web 2.0 was Agilent , Xignux , Razorfish and Bluekangaroo.com , ( Squidoo is a good example of this trend , though 5 years late to the dotbomb party ) .
Web 3.0 has arrived , hopefully , and people are beginning to realize that the Web never did change the fundamentals of language , imagery and metaphor .
Web 3.0 is simply a return to rationality and an abandonment of intellectual laziness .
Web 3.0 is understanding that behind it all , you are most importantly communicating with OTHER PEOPLE AND NOT JUST A SOULESS PIECE OF SOFTWARE .
And just what is “ that certain something ” the “ oo ” is doing a great job of communicating ?
Seth does n’t say ; it ’s a vague , unsupported and un-actionable statement .
Is it an homage to Google and Yahoo !?
Is this a new rule : put a “ oo ” in the name to guarantee success ?
“ HRK om ” does n’t sound like the same kind of company as , say , “ Jeteye ” .
This is all very irrational , artsy fartsy stuff , and it ’s also important .
If it ’s important , explain it .
What ’s important ?
Is this another new rule ?
Altria and Achieva and Factiva and Kalera all sound like companies invented by naming firms .
Which is a fine signal to send to Wall Street , but nothing you ’d want to name your kid or your web 2.0 company .
The shift , then , is from what the words mean to what the words remind you of .
WTF ?
What is this nugget based upon ?
It sounds like some sort of conclusion , but from where ?
And to what ?
Is it a “ new rule ” ?
Is it demonstrated by , “ Squid means Squid , Squidoo reminds you of Squid ” ?
The structures of the words , the way they sound , the memes they recall … all go into making a great name .
Starbucks is made of two words that have nothing at all to do with coffee ( except for their profits ! ) and the reference to Moby Dick is tenuous for most of us .
But over time , the shape of the letters , the way they sound and the unique quality of the word makes it close to perfect .
So , using the fantastic NameBoy service ( also a great name ) , I found thousands of available domains that managed to sound right and were unique .
It took more than a month .
Along the way , I almost bought FishEye.com but the owner ( who has a charter boat in the Cayman Islands ) was n’t budging .
The notion that NameBoy is a great name means one of two things : either that a name no longer has to stake out different territory than its competitors ( new rule ! ) , or that Seth cut a deal for the domain name from NameBoy in exchange for the “ shout out ” .
Or maybe he just forgot that naming , branding and marketing are competitive sports .
Here are some company names any Google searcher would encounter when looking for services related to names and domains :
ABC Name Bank
Brighter Naming
Moore Names
Namebase
NameBoy
Name Designer
Name Development
Name Evolution
Name Generator
NAME-IT
NameLab
Name One
Name Pharm
NameQuest
Name Razor
NameSale
Name Sharks
Name - Shop
NameStormers
Name Tag
NameTrade
NameWorks
Naming Systems
Naming Workshop
Namington
Namix
What does NameBoy accomplish in the above competitive space ?
Nada or greatness ?
Keep in mind , these “ new rules “ say “ greatness ” .
The last thing to tell you is this : you need to sell a name internally .
There are two things you should keep in mind :
This selling internally bit is essential ; it ’s not a great name if never implemented .
1. do n’t use a placeholder name .
People will fall in love with it .
Find your name , use that name and that ’s it .
No !
Do use a placeholder name !
It ’s one of the best things you can do !
Placeholder names are created before people get too nervous , political and fearful .
By the time launch rolls around , people might be used to it and love it .
Naming something too close to launch will inspire panic and compromise .
IBM ’s new mainframe was code named “ T - Rex ” , but the actual name was changed to “ eServer zSeries 990 . ”
AMD ’s chip , code named “ Sledgehammer , ” became “ Opteron , ” while Intel ’s “ McKinley ” chip became the “ Itanium 2 . ”
In all these cases the code names are much , much better , proof of which can be found in the fact that many people still refer to these and similarly code - named products by the code names long after the products have been released with “ official ” names .
2. do n’t listen to what your friends and neighbors and colleagues tell you about a name .
We had a placeholder name ( yikes ) , I had to change it and everyone hated the new name .
For weeks !
Now , it feels like it could n’t be anything else .
If you need to sell a name internally , and you do n’t have to “ listen to your colleagues ” , then you do n’t actually have to sell it internally , do you ?
This means that you are either Richard Branson or Steve Jobs .
The entire point of “ secondary meaning ” is that the first meaning does n’t matter at all ( especially since you picked a name with no meaning to begin with ) .
Over time , a surprisingly short time , your unique word , especially if it sounds right , will soon be the one and only word .
That ’s not writing , it ’s typing .
Why give up primary meaning , imagery , emotion , and metaphor ?
We ’re back to the misguided premise that your most important audience already knows your name and what you do , wants to find you on Google , but might not be smart enough to .
Are these really “ new rules ” , or just an attempt to rationalize being saddled with “ Squidoo ” ?
Remember when it was “ smart ” to name your business “ AAA Aardvark & Sons Plumbing ” so you would grab the top spot in the search engine of the day , The Yellow Pages ?
Quickly , you had competitors called “ AAAA Acme & Daughters Plumbing ” and soon a good portion of plumbing company names were indistinguishable from each other and nothing more than garbled nonsense .
These new rules are merely an extension of that short sighted strategy .
Sincere debate among Muslims
Part I
In my last posting , I may have presented a very grim picture of the Muslim situation in the world .
As a Muslim I say these facts with a lot of pain and displeasure .
But I firmly believe that such an approach is very necessary to begin the healing process ; starting with myself .
I truly believe that the first step to reform ourselves intellectually is by pointing the finger of blame at ourselves and stop blaming others for our present miserable situation .
Such a step , in my opinion is the only way towards reformations at all levels of life .
Unfortunately , Muslims are always blaming the west and their political leaders for their misery .
Rather they should acknowledge that the responsibility falls on both sides .
Leaders or those who are in control of public office and who have the means to influence society direction , are limited in their ability to manipulate and shape the outcome for their society unless there are fertile grounds for such agendas .
Society ’s members have a crucial role in allowing their leaders to implement their agendas and consequently will enable them to achieve their ambitions .
As it is said ; leaders are the products of their societies .
So there are two participants to this equation of responsibility ; that is the caller and the receptor .
This analogy is beautifully laid out in the Holy Quran which has been revealed 1400 Years ago , but Muslims do not seem to adhere to it .
Allah ( SW ) has created the human being and knows his nature , potentials and weaknesses , so He provided a great remedy for this potentially dangerous social problem : that is , blaming others for our mischief .
This kind of typical response and excuse which is uttered by Muslims in this world will be uttered again on the Day of Judgment before the Supreme Judge of all creations as mentioned in the Quran .
In this verse the Quran discloses to us from the unseen knowledge of Allah ( SW ) .
This verse is one the most fascinating verses of the Holy Quran , because it foretell an event which must happen in the exact details as given in the verse in Sura 14 ( Ibrahim ) verse 22 :
14:22 And Satan will say when the matter is decided : “ It was Allah Who gave you a promise of Truth : I too promised , but I failed in my promise to you .
I had no authority over you except I called upon you and you responded unto me : then do not blame me , but blame yourselves . …
وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي فَلاَ تَلُومُون ِي وَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُ م 14:22 )
This above verse presents to us riveting details of how the events of Allah ’s Supreme Court will play out .
It seems that on the Day of Judgment we are given the chance to testify and we seem to say the same excuse for our sins and crimes that is the Shaitan ’s fault .
Then Allah ( SW ) summons the Shaitan , the accused , and give him a chance to defend himself .
In his defense Shaitan makes it very clear that he has nothing to do with us and he puts the blame on us by saying :
“ blame not me , but blame yourselves “
He explained his role in relationship to our evil deeds by saying :
“ I but called you - and you responded unto me . ”
In summary this verse points out to very important issues which are extremely crucial and relevant to the problems and failures of Muslims today .
These points are :
1- Shaitan has no absolute authority over us , rather the final decision in taking actions rests with us .
2- Shaitan invites us to mischief through various enticements by which our true faith in Allah is put to the test .
3- It is only us to blame for the consequences of our actions .
4- Shaitan deceives us through corrupt man-made philosophies , corrupt leaders and personal gains .
5- Responsibility is shared by both sides - the caller and the receptor .
It is worth noting here that the Shatan ’s assessment , in defining his role and throwing the blame on us , is to be considered true and accurate , for the Supreme Judge Allah ( SW ) did not interject nor rebuke the Shaitan ’s statements , as He ( SW ) did in other instances regarding Shaitan ’s claims mentioned in the Quran .
We should blame our selves for our misery and bad deeds .
According to the above verse , the caller is Shaitan where Saitan operates through his followers using their evil intentions and goals in the absence of Allah ’s guidance .
And the receptors here are the ordinary followers who answer the call of their leaders in the absence of Allah ’s boundaries and limits set out through His holy books and messengers .
These limits are very clear and no scholar has the jurisdiction to either alter nor manipulate .
No religious leader , political leader or community leader should have an absolute authority over us .
From an Islamic perspective , we must honor any authority and obey it if it emanates from the Quran and the true Sunnah .
Such authority ought to be guarded by the limits and boundaries set by Allah ( SW ) and His messenger .
Once we give a blind authority to leaders , then deception or deviation ( intentional or unintentional ) cannot be detected .
We will become like herds and slaves .
Such an approach by followers toward their leaders may corrupt good leaders and will turn them into dictators and undisputed and will turn already corrupted ones into monsters and ruthless rulers .
We see such phenomena very prominent in the Muslim world today with no exceptions ; Iraq ; Iran ; Lebanon ; Libya ; Egypt and others .
I believe this Quranic principle of shared responsibility is the key to moving forward towards progress and advancement .
It is the only course of action that would help providing meaningful solutions to many of our social , political and economical problems .
I also believe that adopting such a Quranic approach is the only way to achieve the ultimate goal of Islam , that is , “ social justice ” among all the creatures of Allah , Muslims and non Muslims .
We must learn how to take responsibility for our setbacks and failures and not allow ourselves to be the platforms of ruthless systems , political or economical , which are designed to spread injustice and misery in our world .
When Muslims begin to recognize their faults and their distorted approach toward Islam and stop blaming others for their setbacks , then and only then the process of change will take its proper course .
It will also open for any other Muslim efforts which share a similar vision toward positive change within the Muslim people .
In recent years some genuine attempts were made by some Muslim scholars from both the Shi’a and Sunni , but these attempts were sabotaged through fierce rejection by the majority of Muslims and through extremist scholars .
It is no surprise when Muslims reject any voice which is for change or an invitation for a genuine debate to discuss important issues .
Muslims are very scared of discussing any fundamental issue of their religion .
They do not have the courage to do so for fear of condemnation and retribution by these extremist or by the people who follow them and reject any positive change and refuse to move forward .
Often the majority refuse any positive change and prefer to blindly imitate their ancestral practices , something which the Quran strongly opposes .
This problem is an ancient one which had faced and challenged all the prophets of Allah ( SW ) , as mentioned in Sura 43:23 :
“ And thus it is : whenever We sent , before thy time , a warner to any community , those of its people who had lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures would always say , “ Behold , we found our forefathers agreed on what to believe – and , verily , it is but in their footsteps that we follow ! ”
وَكَذَلِكَ مَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلَّا قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَا إِنَّا وَجَدْنَا آبَاءنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى آثَارِهِم مُّقْتَدُون َ ( 43:23
This social behavior is repeatedly mentioned throughout the Quran with every messenger ’s mission .
So long as there are a human beings and societies on earth this behavior will repeat itself , for this problem emanates from the human nature in the absence of adherence to guidance .
Therefore it became part of people ’s behavior and character .
Since it is connected to human nature and social development , it becomes very hard to deal with .
Any human conduct which becomes habitual requires a lot of genuine efforts by the individual to deal with it .
Due to the complexity of this social problem it is essential to rethink our definition of things ; our relationship with the various elements of this world , whether it be our job , family , religious or political leaders or any other corporeal things in this world .
We must recognize that there is nothing in this world deserves an absolute loyalty except Allah ( SW ) .
On the Day of Judgment all people will be brought before Allah and will be held accountable for their actions .
And before it is too late , my dear friends , we should not be among that group of people who are referred to in 14:22 .
“ Behold , we found our forefathers agreed on what to believe
We should stop attributing all the blame at the western world , colonial powers , Zionism , or “ whateverism ! ! ” except our selves and begin to re focus our loyalty to the Lord of this universe .
We must connect to the ultimate truth of this universe who is the almighty Allah .
Remember not to use the lens of your school - of - thought to define and connect to the ultimate truth ” Al - Haq ” , for it is out of focus .
Just use the lens of your good “ Fitra - disposition ” as it is referred to in the Quran 30:30 :
“ AND SO , set thy face steadfastly towards the [ Haneef - one ever - true ] faith , turning away from all that is false , in accordance with “ Fitra - the natural disposition ” which God has instilled into humankind ..
فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا … ( 30:30 )
In the above verse Allah is reminding us to be “ Haneef - one ever - true ” first and not Shi’a or Sunni , through “ Fitrata Allah ” or the divine Fitra - the natural disposition which is vested in all of us .
This divine Fitra is designed to recognize the simple truth “ Al - Haq ” around us and within us .
You do not have to look for the truth “ Al - Haq ” too far away from you , for it is within you and around you ; if you ca n’t find it then you will never connect to it .
Al - Haq , Truth is very simple because it represents the glory of the creator and His manifestations around us .
It could be as simple as attending the ill , planting a tree , preserving life , helping your fellow human regardless of their race , color or school of thought .
Connecting to the Ultimate truth “ Al - Haq ” is a lot easier than proving who is on the right path ; the Sunnis or Shi’as ; Christian or Muslims .
Surely , from an Islamic perspective , on the right path are those who utter the words “ No God but Allah and Mohammad is His messenger ” and act by it .
And on the right path , for the sake of Allah ; for the sake of God ; for the sake of Humanity , for the sake of pure goodness , those who make a difference in this world ;
Who alleviate the pain and suffering of the unfortunate people of the world ; who bring smiles to the orphans , in particular to those who have been orphaned by sectarian killings of Muslims ; such good acts will surely please Allah and His messengers .
There is a lot more to be done in this world than proving who is right or who is wrong .
In the light of what has been said so far , we must acknowledge that there are many obstacles which face Islam today and these are very serious and challenging .
In my opinion , the biggest challenge faces Islam today is posed by its followers , the Muslims .
There are obviously major factors that contribute to the current horrific Muslim situation .
In future postings , in - Sha a Allah , in addition to this factor above , I will try to point out the various negative factors of social and political backwardness of Muslims today resulting from the negative aspects of the inherited knowledge of our schools of thoughts ( with full respect to the great positive aspects of wisdom and knowledge both schools have to offer - where I personally learned and still am learning from ) .
Please be ready to have an open mind when discussing such issues .
I leave you at this note until next time
May Allah help us all ?

Ever wish you had the luxury of staying up late and sleeping in ?
Be careful what you wish for .
According to a new study , night owls with insomnia may have a harder time of it than early risers , despite spending more time asleep .
The conclusion comes from 312 insomniacs — those who have trouble falling or staying asleep or who have poor quality sleep — who went to the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic in California for group therapy .
Patients filled out a series of questionnaires about their sleep habits , mental health and attitudes about sleep .
Researchers categorized each patient as a morning or evening person , or an intermediate case , depending on when they went to bed and the time of day they preferred to do things .
Compared with the morning and intermediate types , night owls went to bed an hour or more later but reported more time spent sleeping and more time in bed .
On average , they slept 6.4 hours , compared with 5.9 for early risers , and spent 8.7 hours in bed compared with 7.9 .
" Even after we adjusted for the severity of their insomnia [ the amount of time they spent awake in bed ] , there were still differences between the night owls and the morning people , " says Jason Ong , a behavioral sleep psychologist at Stanford University , and lead author of a report published this week in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine .
For one thing , night owls were less consistent in when they went to bed and got up .
In addition , " they seemed to hold more negative and more rigid beliefs about what their sleep should be , " Ong says .
Night owls reported feeling less in control of their sleep and feeling that they have a hard time getting through the day with less sleep , which might perpetuate insomnia , the researchers say .
And they had more risk factors for depression .
Thirty percent of the population reports some symptoms of insomnia , which can affect a person 's job performance and may contribute to depression , obesity , heart disease and diabetes .
The result , Ong says , suggests that night owls suffering from insomnia might need different treatment than morning or day people do , perhaps because of problems with their internal clocks , called the circadian system .
" It seemed like , anecdotally , it was a little more difficult to work with night owl types , " he says .
" This provides some evidence that , hey , there are some differences . "

New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston is kind of an awesome dude .
Yesterday , he dropped one of his customary bombshell reports :
[ Earners of over $ 1 million / year , ] who constitute less than a quarter of 1 percent of all taxpayers , reaped almost 47 percent of the total income gains in 2005 , compared with 2000 .
People with incomes of more than a million dollars also received 62 percent of the savings from the reduced tax rates on long - term capital gains and dividends that President Bush signed into law in 2003 …
So less than one - quarter of one percent of all taxpayers took in almost 50 percent of the nation ’s revenues revenue gain .
And what about the little guy ?
Screwed , as you would suspect .
Americans earned a smaller average income in 2005 than in 2000 , the fifth consecutive year that they had to make ends meet with less money …
Total income listed on tax returns grew every year after World War II , with a single one - year exception , until 2001 , making the five - year period of lower average incomes and four years of lower total incomes a new experience for the majority of Americans born since 1945 .
Mother Jones has written in the past about how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer .
We ’ve also interviewed David Cay Johnston .
Welcome to the Show , kid .
The Democrats have " surrendered " on Iraq .
Liberals are " shocked . "
And all the innocents who did n't know any better , did n't see it coming , feel " betrayed . "
Poor Duncan Black , better known as " Atrios , " is nearly at a loss for words : " People hate Bush , hate Republicans , and hate this war , " he protests , and yet the Democrats caved !
" I do n't understand these people , " he wails .
Precisely .
Keith Olbermann , using the same tone of humorless , near - postal anger he uses in every commentary , no matter the topic , calls the Democratic rollover a " Neville Chamberlain moment . "
I prefer to think of it as a teachable moment .
At a time when even conservatives have come to loathe Bush , when people who thought he was going to round up all the " illegal aliens " and deport them are so upset , they think impeachment 's too good for him , the Democrats labor to craft legislation " acceptable " to him .
Liberals have already spent six and a half years loathing Bush -- longer if they live in Texas , a state whose statutes are said to recognize two classes of persons : Fuckors and Fuckees .
( Republicans and Democrats , the big shots , belong to the former class .
You and I belong to the latter . )
There is nothing particularly wrong with loathing Bush .
It only becomes a problem when it prevents progressives from finally figuring out that the people they 're really going to end up having to fight are the Democrats .
As Big Walter the Thunderbird used to say , " Sho ' is tough . "
Right now , both major parties are playing dodge ball with the planet , trying to avoid " ownership " of Iraq .
The only way at this point to " own " the war is to stop it , and there is no serious move afoot to make that happen .
Having used antiwar sentiment , and disgust over Katrina , to regain control of Congress , the Democrats have no intention of relinquishing power .
They all " support the troops , " who are being asked to " lay down their lives for America " in far Mesopotamia -- but you did n't expect these people you elected to lay down their political careers for the good of the country ... did you ?
Of course not .
Already Michael Tomasky is praising the Dems for practicing " smart politics , " as though winning the White House in 2008 were far more important than " merely " ending the war in Iraq .
How quickly " put us into power and we 'll change things " becomes " put us into power and watch it change us . "
For the corporate powers behind the candidates , the rule is as it ever was : from time to time , things have to change in order to stay the same .
But ( someone protests ) , ca n't you at least admit that the Democrats are better than the Republicans ?
And if you love the country , or care about the world , are n't you obligated to support the lesser of two evils , even if it 's only slightly less evil ?
To which I reply :
What 's really evil is being forced to choose between people on the one hand who support the war , and accuse anyone who questions it of " helping the terrorists " -- and people on the other who oppose the war , criticize the war , pledge to the end the war , and then vote to keep it going .
Or being asked to choose between the village idiot and someone who 's consistently outsmarted by him .
Once upon a time , Bill Clinton filled the Interior Department with " environmentalists . "
Bush filled it with oil company hacks .
Who was more honest ?
Lo and behold , when they cut down the old growth forest , it did n't make much difference to the trees and the rivers and the critters , whether oil company insiders or professional environmentalists were sitting at the desks in Washington .
Eight years of Clinton - Gore , two terms of Bush - Cheney : the toxic dumps remain , and only the rhetoric has changed , to protect the naïve .
Demonstrably now , it makes no difference to the war whether Republicans or Democrats control Congress .
Do you suppose the shooting will end , on the day when a refined , well - spoken Democrat , who reads poetry perhaps and scorns the religious right , and who does n't embarrass us when receiving foreign dignitaries , succeeds the bumbling oaf Bush ?
Think so ?
Or do you suspect people will soon be wailing , " I do n't understand these people !
They control Congress , the White house , and the military !
Why do n't they stop the war ? "
Perhaps apologists will go on CNN to reassure us : " The president wants to stop the war , really .
But first she has to form a consensus , and set her legislative agenda in Congress , and build up her political capital .
And when , not if , she wins re-election , then in that second term she 'll be free to act , and she 'll have that mandate , and I think you 'll start to see some movement on ending this war . "
Sound about right ?
Look .
Millions of people marched in the streets trying to prevent the invasion of Iraq , long before Bush sent a cruise missile into a Baghdad neighborhood trying to " take out " Saddam Hussein with one wild lunge , like the man who shot Liberty Valance .
Without result , in either case .
People marched and listened to speeches and then went home .
The opinion of the multitudes counted for nothing .
No one in power saw the slightest need to pay attention to them .
They 're still not paying attention .
Why would they , as long as those bags of money keep coming in through the transom ?
The system is broken .
It ca n't be fixed .
As long as the Fuckors run it , it will continue to be utterly unresponsive to the will of the Fuckees .
The system tolerates , even welcomes antiwar people , but it co-opts them if it can .
Just as the oil companies co-opted Earth Day , and just as the nuclear power industry hopes to turn global warming into a wholly - owned subsidiary .
In one party , if you 're antiwar , you can get a job as Rudy Giuliani 's foil .
In the other one ... well , if you still " do n't understand these people , " what 's it going to take ?
As the great working class poet Charlie Musselwhite says in " Black Water , " the devastating post - Katrina anthem from his CD Delta Hardware :
" Hello America -- are you ready for more ? "
David Vest can be reached through his web site at www.rebelangel.com.
A new CD featuring him , " The Last of the Best : Live Recordings by the Paul deLay Band , " will be released on June 12 .
George Bush does n’t want the American people to know what ’s going on in Iraq — he just wants his sanitized spin in the news .
Yesterday , we learned that top Bush administration officials — not General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker — would be writing the September report on Iraq .
Today ’s revelation is that , despite the law mandating a public hearing by Petraeus and Crocker , the Bush administration now wants only a private congressional briefing :
White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report , congressional aides said .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates would provide the only public testimony .
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) told the White House that Bush ’s presentation plan was unacceptable .
An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl M. Levin ( D - Mich . ) said that “ we are in talks with the administration and . . . Senator Levin wants an open hearing ” with Petraeus .
Those positions only hardened yesterday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House , with input from Petraeus , Crocker and other administration officials .
No one should be surprised by this latest effort by the Bush administration to control the spin .
For them , Iraq has been nothing but a public relations campaign .
George Bush just cannot be honest with the American people .

Facebook JACKSON , Miss . ( AP ) 
A federal judge has ruled that a majority black county in eastern Mississippi violated whites ' voting rights in what prosecutors said was the first lawsuit to use the Voting Rights
Act on behalf of whites .
U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee ruled late Friday that Noxubee County Democratic Party leader Ike Brown and the county Democratic Executive Committee " manipulated the political process in ways specifically intended and designed to impair and impede participation of white voters and to dilute their votes . "
The Justice Department accused Brown of trying to limit whites ' participation in local elections in violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act , written to protect racial minorities when Southern states strictly enforced segregation .
" Every American has the right to vote free from racial discrimination , " said Wan J. Kim , assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice 's Civil Rights Division .
" The court 's ruling is another victory in the department 's vigorous efforts to protect the voting rights of all Americans , " Kim said .
Noxubee County is a rural area along the Alabama line with a population of about 12,500 , of whom 70 % are black .
Brown did not immediately return calls Saturday from The Associated Press seeking comment .
The Justice Department alleged in the 2006 lawsuit that Noxubee County blacks tried to shut whites out of the voting process .
Brown had claimed the Justice Department was misconstruing as racial intimidation his attempts to keep Republicans from voting in Democratic primaries .
Lee , who presided over the case without a jury , gave attorneys on both sides until July 29 to file briefs suggesting how to end the discrimination .
The case was a civil matter carrying no criminal penalties , but defendants who violate Lee 's final order could face contempt of court charges and fines , prosecutors said .
Ricky Walker , who is white and the county 's prosecuting attorney , believes Brown recruited an opponent to run against Walker in 2003 simply because of Walker 's race .
" We 're glad to be getting it over with so we move on and get to the point where maybe we can just have fair , honest , impartial elections here and just go about our business and not have to go through all this circus to get an election done , " said Walker , who was a Justice Department witness during the trial in January .
Walker , who is unopposed this year , said the lawsuit created some unrest in the county " that we were getting past ... blacks and whites starting to support people on their ability to fulfill the job rather than just strictly a political or racial basis . "
The judge said there was a pattern to Brown 's efforts to keep all whites out of the county 's Democratic Party , including holding party caucuses in private homes rather than public voting precincts and inviting only blacks to the meetings .
Lee said he could not find that the defendants had a specific animosity against white people .
" Brown , in fact , claims a number of whites as friends , " Lee wrote .
" However , there is no doubt from the evidence presented at trial that Brown , in particular , is firmly of the view that blacks , being the majority race in Noxubee County , should hold all elected offices , to the exclusion of whites ; and this view is apparently shared by his allies and associates on the NDEC , who , along with Brown , effectively control the election process in Noxubee County .

DefCon security on Friday warned attendees at the annual hacker conference that Dateline NBC may have sent a mole with a hidden camera to the event to capture hackers admitting to crimes .
DefCon says it was tipped off by their own mole at Dateline who sent them a pic of the undercover journalist who DefCon employees identified as producer Michelle Madigan .
DefCon , an annual underground hacking convention in Las Vegas , has a strict policy against filming conference attendees – TV media outlets are barred from sweeping a room with their cameras and also have to get permission from any individuals before capturing them on film .
All journalists covering DefCon sign an agreement upon registering for the conference that outlines the rules , but the DefCon organizers say the mole apparently registered as a regular attendee , thereby bypassing the legal agreement .
Dateline NBC is best known for its controversial To Catch A Predator series , which uses hidden cameras to tape men who are allegedly seeking to have sex with minors they met online .
Dateline spokeswoman Jenny Tartikoff would not confirm or deny the allegations about Madigan and the undercover camera at DefCon , saying only that " It 's not our policy to comment on our newsgathering . "
Before opening the show for business Friday , the DefCon goons announced to the crowd that there was a media mole among them .
DefCon has been broadcasting her picture on the screens in conference rooms before each talk .
Note :
The original version of the story did not have the picture or name the journalist or outlet .
The story was updated once Dateline responded to a request for comment .
UPDATE 2 : NBC 's mole , Michelle Madigan , became the target of predators herself this afternoon when she was outed at DefCon as an undercover reporter and bolted out of the conference hotel with about two dozen reporters with cameras and others chasing after her – in the manner of an NBC Dateline To Catch a Predator episode .
According to DefCon staff , Madigan had told someone she wanted to out an undercover federal agent at DefCon .
That person in turn warned DefCon about Madigan 's plans .
Federal law enforcement agents from FBI , DoD , United States Postal Inspection Service and other agencies regularly attend DefCon to gather intelligence on the latest techniques of hackers .
DefCon holds an annual contest called Spot the Fed , in which attendees out people in the audience they think are undercover federal agents .
The contest is good - natured , but the feds who get caught are generally ones who do n't mind getting caught .
DefCon staff say that Madigan was asked four times – two times on the phone and two times at the conference – if she wanted to obtain press credentials , but she declined .
DefCon staff lured her to a large hall telling her that the Spot the Fed contest was in session and that she could get a picture of an undercover federal agent at the contest .
When she sat down , Jeff Moss , DefCon 's founder , announced that they were changing the game .
Instead of Spot the Fed , they were going to play Spot the Undercover Reporter and then announced , " And there 's one in here right now . "
Madigan , realizing she 'd been had , jumped from her seat and bolted out the door with reporters carrying cameras chasing after her through the parking lot and to her car .

At a press conference with his Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov in Sofia , Bush said he did not know if the proposal , aimed at defusing a Russian - U.S. row over U.S. missile - defense plans , was " technologically feasible , " however .
Bush said he would like U.S. and Russian defense experts to hold meetings to discuss the matter .
Bush also reiterated that Kosovo ought to be independent from Serbia , saying that " the time is now to move the Ahtisaari plan , " referring to the proposal by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari to give Kosovo a form of supervised independence .
In Albania on June 10 , Bush said the United Nations should grant independence quickly to the Serbian province .
Russia , which has veto power on the UN Security Council , has joined its ally Serbia in opposing moves to grant Kosovo independence .
Russia has called for more negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo 's ethnic - Albanian majority .
In his comments in Albania , Bush said that " sooner rather than later , " Kosovo needs to become independent .
Finally , Bush urged Libya to release five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for allegedly infecting hundreds of children with the virus that leads to AIDS .
He said the release of the five was a " high priority " for the United States . ( with material from AFP , AP )
A decade ago the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice accused Dr. Faruk Abuzzahab of a “ reckless , if not willful , disregard ” for the welfare of 46 patients , 5 of whom died in his care or shortly afterward .
The board suspended his license for seven months and restricted it for two years after that .
But Dr. Abuzzahab , a Minneapolis psychiatrist , is still overseeing the testing of drugs on patients and is being paid by pharmaceutical companies for the work .
At least a dozen have paid him for research or marketing since he was disciplined .
Medical ethicists have long argued that doctors who give experimental medicines should be chosen with care .
Indeed , the drug industry ’s own guidelines for clinical trials state , “ Investigators are selected based on qualifications , training , research or clinical expertise in relevant fields . ”
Yet Dr. Abuzzahab is far from the only doctor to have been disciplined or criticized by a medical board but later paid by drug makers .
An analysis of state records by The New York Times found more than 100 such doctors in Minnesota , at least two with criminal fraud convictions .
While Minnesota is the only state to make its records publicly available , the problem , experts say , is national .

[ 13th October 2019 ] London Transport Museum have just launched an Exhibition entitled Hidden London : The Exhibition .
I went there to see it this weekend and I was most impressed !
This is my
My first review of someone else 's work on a similar interest of my own .
[ 11th September 2020 ]
Great news !
London Transport Museum re-opened 7th September ( with social distancing restrictions ) .
A great opportunity to visit the Hidden London exhibition ( mostly about what this web site is concerned about ) !
[ 29th September 2020 ]
London Transport Museum 's Hidden London exhibition has won the MandHAward for Temporary or Touring Exhibition of the Year ( and it certainly deserves it ) !
The exhibition was due to close in January 2021 but due to the long closure of the Museum due to virus lockdown , it has now been confirmed that this exhibition will be open throughout 2021 .
Introduction
When I moved to live near London a few years ago , one of my interests became the London Underground , the oldest and one of the busiest underground railway networks in the world .
I 'm not a train spotter by any means , but I find the history and background of London 's subterranean railway fascinating .
One of the things I find most interesting is the changing history of the railway , of which there is still much hidden evidence .
For example , look through the window as you travel between Tottenham Court Road and Holborn on the Central Line and you 'll see a station - where no passengers have alighted since 1932 .
This used to be British Museum station .
Or perhaps you may notice the tunnel wall change from cast iron tubing to bricks as you travel on the Piccadilly Line between Green Park and Hyde Park Corner .
This also used to be a station .
Down Street , closed in the same year as British Museum .
These stations are often referred to as ghost stations .
There are about 40 abandoned or relocated stations on the Underground network along its entire 249 miles ( 402 Km ) of trackway - some subsurface and some above ground .
Some have vanished without trace whereas others are almost intact , grimey time capsules of the era when they were closed .
There are 5 visitors reading these pages at the moment including yourself .
Orientation
One point to note is that in these pages , all lines are referred by their contemporary names .
Many if not all of the lines have however had different names during their existence .
Site Navigation
You can navigate this site in a number of ways .
You can get to key pages by clicking on the menu bar at the top left of the page .
Alternatively , at the bottom of most pages you 'll also find a series of links to the main pages in text form .
You may also decide to navigate the site by following the links within the nariative - indeed , many pages have been broken down into a series of smaller pages so that each individual page is n't too large for people browsing with a modem connection .
The site has been designed with a resolution of 1024x768 or more in mind .
It has however been designed to also work well in 800x600 .
In order to better understand the location of these stations on today 's network , you may wish to download a copy of the world famous underground map ( well , technically it's a diagram not a map ) , originally designed by Harry Beck in 1931 and first seen by the public in January 1933 .
This can be found in several formats on the Transport for London web site .
Click here to visit their page .
Some people have asked me why I do n't have a copy of the Underground map here , or more to the point , why I do n't have a version of the map that shows the closed stations .
I 've explained this in more detail here .
1929 Map of the London Underground
Since the majority of the stations that closed in central London were abandoned after 1930 , a map of the railways as they existed in 1929 , that 's been annotated to show which Underground stations have closed or changed their name since that time is available .
This page also includes some advertisements from the publication from where the map came from , showing how advertising style and standards have changed .
Your Monitor Settings
Some people have had difficulty reading or seeing images on these pages .
Admittedly some of the images are dark but all look presentable if the monitor is correctly set up .
Here , you can find some test patterns I 've generated to help you see these pages as I see them on my monitor !
Fun
Several of the images found on these pages can also be found as interactive jigsaws !

Two major types of tunnels can be found on the London Underground .
In the 19th century , digging deep level tunnels , especially under water was a dangerous and tricky business .
Several attempts to cross the Thames had ended in failure , even with lives being lost .
Brunell 's Thames Tunnel ( used today by the East London Line ) was the first successful tunnel under the Thames but its construction was costly and very difficult .
When it was discovered that steam traction could be replaced with electricity , tunnels could be dug that were much deeper .
James Henry Greathead had devised a new method of tunnelling which employed compressed air to prevent leaking in conjunction with a circular drilling shield to bore circular tunnels ( about 3 metres in diameter ) much deeper into the ground , which were then lined with cast iron rings .
When mining the soft north London clay however , the air pressure was hardly ever needed , as the clay is waterproof .
Due to the speed at which these tunnels could be mined , many stations were envisaged on each of the lines that were created and most of these stations are still in use today .
A small number however have fallen into disuse over the years .
Take Aldwych for example , at the end of a disused railway siding right in the heart of London .
Or Down Street , where the Railways Executive Committee were based and on rare occasions some of Winston Churchill 's World War Two cabinet meetings were held when the Cabinet War Rooms were unavailable ... or Brompton Road , used as a World War 2 anti aircraft Ack Ack command centre , with maps from this era still on the walls today !
Evidence of these stations remains both on the surface and also beneath the ground if you know where to look .
Before the Greathead Shield was invented , most subterranean railways in London were built using the Cut and Cover technique .
In many cases , this involved digging a deep cutting along the path of a road .
The railway was laid in the trench and was then covered up with the road being re-laid above .
These underground railways started out as extensions of some of the existing outlying railways and were initially served by steam locomotives and so many places were required where steam could be safely vented .
Over the years , the need and use for some of these stations have changed with the result that some were closed .
A careful observer can still see some today whereas others have completely vanished without trace .

There are other parts of the Underground network that are in use today , but also contain abandoned tunnels and shafts .

Other Erstwhile Subterranean London Transportation
This final section deals with some other interesting disused underground tunnels and stations which though never having formed part of London 's underground system , nevertheless have had an important role to play in the city 's transport infrastructure in the past ...
Although not strictly part of the Underground System , the Tower Subway was the world 's first underground tube railway .
Constructed using the revolutionary Greathead Shield invented by James Henry Greathead ( used subsequently for many of the other tubes ) , the train ( actually a single carriage ) was cable operated and was effectively used as a shuttle service between the two banks of the Thames .
The railway unfortunately was only open from August 2nd 1870 until November the same year due to very poor patronage .
The tunnels were resurrected as foot tunnels but even this was short lived as they were again made redundant by the building of the nearby Tower Bridge in 1894 and were permanently closed to the public and the tunnels were equipped with pipes to provide hydraulic power .
Today the tunnels are used as a conduit for water mains pipes and also for the transmission of fibre optic cables for computer networks across the Thames .
The photograph above shows the small structure built over the northern shaft next to the Tower of London .
Written around it are the words " A.D. 1868 LONDON HYDRAULIC POWER COMPANY " , though this was not the original structure - the building seen today was built in 1926 .

Approximate subterranean route of Tower Subway
The aerial photograph shows the approximate location of Tower Subway 's crossing of the Thames .
The close proximity of Tower Bridge , the source of its eventual demise can clearly be seen .
The south entrance to the Subway ( to the left of the photograph ) is now surrounded by a large building development but access to the subway is maintained so that engineers can service the pipes and communication cables .
This picture was taken in 1999 , just before construction work started on the City Hall building to the left of the picture .
Kingsway Tram Underpass
Not all of the rail tunnels under London were used by trains !
The Kingsway Underpass was a cut and cover tunnel that ran the length of Kingsway starting just north of Holborn through Aldwych and ending under Waterloo Bridge and was expressly designed for the blossoming tram network in the early 20th century London .

Missing but not forgotten ...
As some people have already mentioned by email , the stations covered on this site are n't the complete list of disused stations on the Underground network .
My original aim was to cover all the subterranian Underground stations on the network , which I believe I now have ( though some will no doubt be updated and added to in future ) .
Stations that remain include :
Bakerloo Line
The Bakerloo line used to run beyond Harrow & Wealdstone until quite recently ( date to follow ! ) .
Maps exist today on the network that still show the line serving Headstone Lane , Hatch End , Carpender 's Park , Bushey & Oxhey , Watford ( High Street ) and Watford .
They 're not abandoned though - the mainline service that follows the Bakerloo Line along its northern stretch has now taken over the operation of these stations .
Metropolitan Line
The section of the Metropolitan Line beyond Amersham has now been covered on the Cut & Cover pages .

A brief explanation about the next three icons before I delete them shortly because they mean nothing at all these days ... [ 13th October 2019 ]
... about 15 years ago , in the early 00's when this page was in its formation years , you could submit for ( and were also given ) awards for the web site !
So noughties I know ... but these were three I was awarded at the time and like the abandoned stations , they 've lingered at the bottom of my front page like forgotten memories of the past !
Firstly - the Smokin ' Award ... this was by far the one I felt an achievement because the awarder would give you points for many different aspects of a rail based web site , from content to downloadability .
He even invited you to re-submit after his cricisism to get a higher award .
I got Bronze as you can see here and I only know one other rail site that got a Silver ... I did mean to re-submit ... but ... I do n't know what happened but Smokin ' disappeared off the scene really quickly along with the web site that hosted it , the kvrr.net , which was about a hairpin railway in the States .
Secondly , Demon Internet , who at the time were actually hosting this content allowing me a measly 20 Megabytes of homepage content ... actually gave this award without even asking me .
They featured the page in a 2 page spread in their magazine ( given to Demon Internet ISP subsribers ) and even gave me a video capture device as a prize ( worth about £ 100 ) !
Demon have subsequently been swallowed up into the big boy companies and even the original address of Underground History ( starfury.demon.co.uk ) would no longer be viable .
Thirdly ... Yahoo ...

ALTHOUGH THE 110th Congress has brought to Capitol Hill 43 Jews , two Buddhists and a Muslim -- Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - Minn. ) , who took his oath of office on Thomas Jefferson ’s Koran -- Washington remains a disproportionately Christian town .
More than 90 % of federal legislators call themselves Christians , making Congress more Christian than the United States itself .
The president is an evangelical Protestant .
Catholics enjoy a majority on the Supreme Court .
Biblical references -- from the Jericho Road to the golden rule to the promised land -- permeate political speech .
Yet U.S. citizens know almost nothing about the Bible .
Although most regard it as the word of God , few read it anymore .
Even evangelicals from the Bible Belt seem more focused on loving Jesus than on learning what he had to say .
In a religious literacy quiz I have administered to undergraduates for the last two years , students tell me that Moses was blinded on the road to Damascus and that Paul led the Israelites on their exodus out of Egypt .
Surveys that are more scientific have found that only one out of three U.S. citizens is able to name the four Gospels , and one out of 10 think that Joan of Arc was Noah ’s wife .
No wonder pollster George Gallup has concluded that the United States is “ a nation of biblical illiterates . ”
Biblical illiteracy is not just a religious problem .
It is a civic problem with political consequences .
How can citizens participate in biblically inflected debates on abortion , capital punishment or the environment without knowing something about the Bible ?
Because they lack biblical literacy , Americans are easily swayed by demagogues on the left or the right who claim -- often incorrectly -- that the Bible says this about war or that about homosexuality .
One solution to this civic problem is to teach Bible classes in public schools .
By Bible classes I do not mean classes in which teachers tell students that Jesus loves them or that the Bible is the inerrant word of God , but academic courses that study the Bible ’s characters and stories as well as the afterlife of the Bible in literature and history .
Last week , the Georgia Board of Education gave preliminary approval to two elective Bible courses designed to teach religion rather than preach religion .
As long as teachers stick to the curriculum , this is a big step in the right direction .
Advertisement
The most common objection to such courses is that they are unconstitutional .
But the Supreme Court has repeatedly given a constitutional stamp of approval to academic courses about religion .
In 1963 , Justice William Brennan wrote in Abington vs. Schempp that “ the holding of the Court today plainly does not foreclose teaching about the Holy Scriptures . ”
And in 1948 , Justice Robert Jackson wrote in McCollum vs. Board of Education that “ a course in English literature that omitted the Bible ... would be pretty barren . ”
But barren of the Bible is just what our public school curriculums are .
According to a study by the Bible Literacy Project , which publishes a Bible textbook for secondary schools , only 8 % of U.S. high school students have access to an elective Bible course .
As a result , an entire generation of Americans is growing up almost entirely ignorant of the most influential book in world history , unable to understand the 1,300 biblical allusions in Shakespeare , the scriptural oratory of President Lincoln and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or even the prominence of Ezekiel 25:17 ( actually a mishmash of this verse and passages from Genesis , Psalms and other books ) in the film “ Pulp Fiction . ”
Some have argued against Bible courses in public schools on the theory that they would unconstitutionally “ establish ” Judeo - Christianity .
For Scripture courses to be lawful , this argument goes , teachers must give equal time to all the world ’s scriptures , treating the Bible as one scripture among many .
But the Bible is of sufficient importance in Western civilization to merit its own course .
Treating it no differently from , say , the Zend - Avesta of the Zoroastrians or Scientology ’s Dianetics makes no educational sense .
What makes sense is one Bible course for every public high school student in the U.S.
This is not a Christian proposal .
It does not serve the political left or the political right .
It serves our young people and our public life .
Unless you ’ve just recently signed on to this whole Internet Thing , you ’ve probably noticed an increasing trend in the World of Authentication .
These days , when logging on to various websites , users are asked for a name , password , and the answer to one or more “ secret questions . ”
It ’s actually a new - fangled type of authentication called Wish - It - Was Two - Factor .
It all started way back in the year 2005 , when the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a guideline entitled Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment .
It ’s a rather exhilarating read if I do say so myself , especially if you ’re a fan of government banking regulations .
And , really : who is n’t ?
In a nutshell , the FFIEC mandated that internet banks utilize a Two - Factor approach to authentication by year - end 2006 .
The idea behind Two - Factor authentication is n’t too complicated .
Simply ( 1 ) verify that a user knows something , and ( 2 ) verify that he physically has something .
This could be done with a ( 1 ) name and password , and ( 2 ) one of those key fob things or even a print - out of one - time use codes .
Banks , however , were n’t too happy with the requirement of implementing such “ costly ” changes and instead chose to invent the Wish - It - Was Two - Factor authentication .
In this method of authentication , they ( 1 ) verify that a user knows something , and ( 1 , again ) verify that a user knows something else .
For example , Charter One Bank ’s implementation of Wish - It - Was Two - Factor requires that customers create three “ secret questions ” as shown below :
Users are asked to pick from all sorts of different “ secret questions , ” ranging from “ In what city is your vacation home ? ” to “ What is your second - favorite post - modernistic European novel ? ”
And if they ’re lucky , users can actually remember what answers they gave and figure out exactly how they typed them in .
Unfortunately , this Wish - It - Was Two - Factor type of authentication has become an industry standard .
A recent study reported that 96 % of U.S. banks are failing to implement the recommended Two - Factor authentication , opting instead for “ authentication methods that solicit confidential information from consumers . ”
The problem with this , of course , is that industry standards are … well … standard .
It ’s just the way things are supposed to be done .
Worse still , the Online Banking industry is perceived to be one of the most secure .
Surely , if anyone knows how to do online security , it ’s the online banks , right ?
And if you want your web application to be extra secure , it should be modeled off of an online bank , right ?
That ’s exactly what Russ ’s company figured .
When the higher - ups learned how “ unsecure ” their web application was ( it only asked for name and password ) , they directed development to implement “ bank level ” security .
Development , figuring that online banks must know what they 're doing when it comes to online security , went ahead and implemented their own version of Wish - It - Was Two - Factor authentication .
After signing on , end users were required to select four questions from a selection of sixteen .
The users , however , were n’t too thrilled with the change .
One email from a disgruntled user reminded them just how wishfully secure their new authentication protocol was …
Dear -------.com , Extra security , fine .
I do n’t mind it .
But let ’s get serious .
I never met my grandfather ( he ’s been dead over sixty years ) .
My parents never talk about where they were born .
I was never married .
I did n’t go to college .
High school mascot ?
Come on , I ’ve been out of high school for decades !
And who has a favorite color ?
Sure , I can make up answers , but since there ’s no way I 'll remember my made up answers , then I ’m screwed .
So I ’ll have to write them all down , but that does n’t seem very secure .
So , basically , I ’m screwed .
Thank you ,

Caught in the act …
How could you Tiddles !
This post is aimed mainly at Factor developers who need to make their repository accessible to Slava to retrieve patches .
Factor has recently moved to using git as the version control system .
To set up a repository on a server you should clone the existing Factor repository using the ' - - bare ' option :
git clone -- bare http://www.factorcode.org/git/factor.git factor.git
A bare repository is one without a checked out working copy of the code .
It only contains the git database .
As a general rule you should never push into a repository that contains changes in the working copy .
To ensure this does n't happen , we 're making the server repository a bare repository - it has no working copy .
Copy the ' factor.git ' directory onto your server .
I put it in '/git/factor.git ' .
Now if you have changes on your local machine that you want to push to your repository you can use something like :
git push yourname@yourserver.com :/git/factor.git
If you want to push changes from a specific branch in your local repository :
git push yourname@yourserver.com :/git/factor.git mybranch : master
To publish the remote repository you have two options .
You can publish via the HTTP protocol , or via the git protocol .
The first is slower but usable by people behind restrictive firewalls , while the second is more efficient but requires an open port .
I suggest doing both .
To publish via HTTP , you must make the file ' hooks / post - update ' executable :
chmod +x /git/factor.git/hooks/post-update
This gets executed whenever something is pushed to the repository .
It runs a command ' git - update - server - info ' which updates some files that makes the HTTP retrieval work .
You should also run this once manually :
cd /git/factor.git git-update-server-info
Now make the / git directory published via your webserver ( I symbolic link to it in the server 's doc-root ) .
People can pull from the repository with :
git pull http://yourserver.com/git/factor.git
To set up the git protocol you need to run the ' git - daemon ' command .
You pass it a directory which is the root of your git repositories .
It will make public all git repositories underneath that root that have the file ' git - daemon - export - ok ' in it .
So first create this file :
touch /git/factor.git/git-daemon-export-ok
Run the daemon with :
git - daemon --verbose / git
The ' - - verbose ' will give you output showing the results of connecting to it .
I run this from within a screen session .
You can set it up to automatically run using whatever features your server OS has .
Now people can retrieve via the git protocol :
git pull git://yourserver.com/git/factor.git
My repository is accessible from both protocols :
git clone http://www.double.co.nz/git/factor.git git clone git://double.co.nz/git/factor.git
You can also browse it using gitweb .

“ Emergency room visits from computer injuries increased sevenfold between 1994 and 2006 , according to a report published June 9 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine . ”
33 year old Austrian Markus Stoeckl has smashed the World Speed Record for series mountain bikes .
Stoeckl , nicknamed " Hercules " because of his 6 ’ 4 " , 220 lbs. frame , broke the 8 year old record by 14 mph on the 2000 meter , 45 degree La Parva run in what are known as the Chilean Alps .
Because of the extreme cold , Hercules had to hold his breath for the 40 second duration so his helmet did n’t fog up .
Crazy , indeed , but we wonder how on Earth he stopped .
Those disc brakes were surely useless .
See the video below , wherein Stoeckl makes it all look effortless .

It 's a politic that has to appeal to an awful lot of people , but it does n't have to appeal to them all that much .
The successful presidential candidate wants to establish just enough passion for their political stances that voters will waddle down to the polling place on the first Tuesday of November and vote for them ( or send in the appropriate form ) .
Too much passion could be a dangerous thing , because it probably indicates that the candidate has moved off of the acceptable boilerplate messages of the retail campaign and has introduced ideas and possible political solutions that are both novel and challenging .
Winning presidential candidates do n't want to be any more challenging than blockbuster movies .
Establishing an adequate but bland affinity with voters around their politics is , of course , not the main job of the blockbuster Prez candidate .
The main job is to create a comfort level with the candidate 's personality and backstory .
They have to live up to a fantasy of mainstream family life .
Sure , we 've gotten used to Republican divorcees , but if Ronnie had left Jane for Johnny instead of Nancy , he would have ended his career as a fluffer for Joey Stefano .
What 's sort of weird about all this is that a lot of people actually seem to agree with the " fringe " candidates – those who confront some of the taboo topics on my list .
Ron Paul has had some luck pressing forward with ideas and positions that are considered taboo .
He 's the breakout " fringe " candidate this year , but fringe nevertheless .
And substantial numbers — maybe even a majority — of Democratic primary voters like Dennis Kucinich 's positions on the issues better than those of Clinton or Obama .
But Kucinich 's campaign has never even caught a light breeze .
Obviously , perception trumps content .
Voters may agree with nearly everything a fringe candidate says , but when the media echo chamber dismisses that candidate as " fringe , " they are drawing a big " L " for Loser across the candidate 's face .
And while voters will eventually develop some measure of contempt for the actual President , loser candidates are beneath contempt , and can't really be taken seriously .
Of course , some topics or lifestyle choices are truly taboo for presidential candidates because very few potential voters are ready or willing to deal with them .
In deciding on this list of taboo topics for Presidential campaigns , I used several criteria .
First of all , the issues had to deserve discussion .
That would exclude stuff like : " Hitler was awesome ! " ; " Let ’s make seven - years - old the age of consent ! " ; or " Let 's force all blondes to dance naked in public squares every Tuesday at noon !
" There are also some topics , like the loss of civil liberties ; the usurious policies of credit card companies ; or the undemocratic methods used to prevent " third " political parties from challenging the duopoly , that candidates could popularly confront , but wo n't .
I have not included those either .
I am only choosing topics that candidates both wo n't and can't reason about if they hope to have a chance of being elected President .
It 's also worth noting that candidates can confront a few of these issues and get elected to lower offices , but they can't go for the big kahuna .
Also , in deciding how to assign different topics their place on this Top 20 List , I had to decide whether to emphasize the issues of importance to the health of the nation or just those with the most totally awesome taboo - ness .
I decided to put the most taboo topics at the top , rather than the most important ones .
I believe this is an accurate reflection of the triviality of our political culture .
Presidential candidates can't be openly gay or transsexual .
They can't have open marriages and relationships or practice polyfidelity or polyamory .
They can't openly enjoy orgies , consensual gangbangs , or pornography .
They can't even be real swingin ' bachelors or bachelorettes .
During the '90s , we made it to : " I do n't care if he got a blow job , as long as he does a good job . "
Now we need to get to : " I do n't care if he 's going to move his pet sheep Sweetiecakes into the White House and post videos of their long nights of passion on YouTube .
If his policies could save millions of lives , what 's more important ?
"
No presidential candidate can advocate sex- positive attitudes including open marriages and relationships ; they can't be pro-porn , positive about teen sexuality , or generally advocate the sophisticated notion that eroticism is life 's greatest gift .
Who are we kidding ?
They 're not going to pay a big fine , touch down in the home country and then come back again .
And we 'll never round up 12 million people and kick them out of the country or keep out the next few million .
For all intents and purposes , we have open borders and it can't be stopped any more than drugs can .
But no Presidential candidate can say so .
Many adults know that some mind drugs – particularly marijuana and psychedelics – can be quite kind , enlightening , and creatively stimulating .
There has also been a mountain of good news about the therapeutic and medical potentials of these substances over the last several years , thanks to legal testing allowed in the US , Europe , and Israel .
But no Presidential candidate could ever say anything positive about the experiences these drugs induce , even though several of them have known better .
( Hello , Bill and Al. ) Candidates must pay lip service to the prevailing native superstitions and they 'd better be able to back it up with some evidence of genuine piety ( or at least church attendance ) .
" Americans are a peace - loving people . "
Not so much , actually .
In my lifetime ( b.1952 ) , we sent ( substantive numbers of ) troops into Korea , Vietnam , Dominican Republic , Cambodia , Lebanon , Grenada , Panama , Iraq , Haiti , Afghanistan , and Iraq again .
We 've dropped bombs on Korea , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Libya , Iraq , Iraq again , Sudan , Bosnia , Yemen , and of course more Iraq .
( Listing all the conflicts where we 've tried to overthrow states through less direct but nevertheless violent means , or that we 've been involved in peripherally , or through " client states " could probably fill a book . )
Remember when Al Gore grew himself an existential beard after being ripped off for the presidency ?
Oh my , what a snarkfest !
Of course , pretty much all the 19th Century presidents had furry faces , but nobody had to look at them much .
If you display any non-conformity in dress or appearance , you 're a damned hippie and wo n't be allowed anywhere near the White House .
Today , money is issued in the form of bank credit .
In the past , it was related to " the gold standard . "
Throughout history , these exchange signals have had different forms and significances .
Money is n't a physical commodity ; it 's a signifier of value .
It 's the dominant social force in our world and the specifics of how it functions at its root are pretty much completely occult , even in the business world .
" Social Security is going to run out of money in thirty years . "
You can't run out of money , in the way that you can run out of oil , potable water , or spotted owls .
Any presidential candidate worth his or her stripes should talk about how money works and ask whether we could n't make it work better , but he or she would be labeled a " fringe crazy .
" Maybe , just maybe , we can elect someone named Barack Obama .
But he better not get caught bowing toward Mecca .
Most sophisticated commentators admitted a dozen or so years ago that the drug war is unwinnable , unfair and a corrupting influence on American culture , creating the types of criminal gangs and violence that we saw with alcohol prohibition in the 1920s .
But no Presidential candidate dares to suggest that this nightmare be ended .
Home of the brave , my ass .
What kind of a country needs to spend more money on " defense " than all the other nations on earth combined and is still as collectively paranoid as a cuckolded husband in the throes of an amphetamine psychosis ?
A huge Military - Industrial complex overcharges taxpayers on a scale that makes the pharmaceutical industry look like Robin Hood .
It 's the biggest financial scam in human history , but no serious candidate dares to say peep , less he or she be seen as unpatriotic .
( In a less trivial time , this would be the # 1 taboo issue . )
Dear candidate .
You may not seriously question or challenge any of Israel 's military policies or actions .
My fellow Jews in Israel can , and they do it all the time , but you can 't .
( Nyah nyah ! )
I guess it 's sort of like with black folks and the " N Word . "
Except this is kinda like about war and peace in the Middle East and the future survival of humankind and stuff .

When we give someone an important job that engages a lot of complex problems , we usually want the smartest cookie we can find .
But heck , Americans like Presidents that are just like them — simple - minded and borderline literate .
Is this you ?
Representative democracy was a fine idea back when people were riding around in a horse - and - buggy and we did n't have airplanes , phones , and portable devices connected to the internet – a series of tubes that does magical things !
Now I can apparently register a signal about every issue I care about over an encrypted secure line that is more likely to be accurately registered than the vote I make on election day .
Maybe we should think about direct democracy , rather than leaving policy to our elected representatives and the elites that gather around them .
Now , direct democracy scares the crap out of me unless the power of the people is mitigated by a robust , libertarian system of rights protecting us all from the majority .
Still , the tools for giving citizens agency are at hand and we may as well talk about it .
Of course , the only candidate talking about this is way out on the fringes – Mike Gravel .
And he 's treated like a total lunatic .
Oh , wait a second .
He is a total lunatic .
How coercive should the Federal government be ?
And do they have to stick their nose into everything ?
It 's a common discourse among libertarians and it's a valid question .
Do we really need the federal government to investigate television , movies , and video games ?
Should " This is bad for people " automatically translate into government action or even bluster ?
If you are what you eat , is it your personal right to be a ton of lard ?
Well , if you 're running for President , you 've got to pay some lip service to taking on bad choices people make that might best be private .
All candidates must dance to the tune of " family values . "
Nobody can suggest that remaining childfree could be one way of doing this overburdened planet a service .
Should people get special privileges for having kids ?
And if we love kids so much , why do we let approximately 20 % of them live in poverty ?
In American , the best family values can be found at Costco .
It 's all a bunch of populist hype .
Nobody who is taken seriously is proposing to entirely ban guns or to even make it difficult for most citizens to get them .
And nobody who is taken seriously is seriously proposing to completely deregulate guns .
It 's all a lot of hand waving , so stick 'em up .
Unless you 're running for President , in which case you better be televised hunting ( Hillary ? ) while also waxing responsible .
Two administrations got something like 2 million people killed in Viet Nam .
Another administration completely scammed all American laws during Iran - Contra and completely got away with it .
And those guys in the White House now ?
Do n't get me started .
But if you suggest that Henry or Ollie or George , Dick , and Donald should like maybe spend a few more days in jail than Paris Hilton , you will be portrayed as " way outside the mainstream " ( unless you can find some sex tapes . )
We 're warehousing a greater percentage of our people in iron cages than all the nations in the economically advanced and even semi-advanced world .
( We 're kicking Russia and China 's ass ! )
It 's turning into a substantive form of slave labor with prisoners receiving anywhere from 8 cents to 15 cents per hour .
It 's also a massive , partly privatized industry that will defend its vested economic interest in human incarceration .
The prison industry is central to the economy of several counties in America .
But do n't talk about it if you want to be elected President .
For one thing , it 's too depressing .
And they shouted back , " Who cares ! "
Some conspiracy theories are true and some are false .
Congressional hearings in the 1970s concluded that the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King remained unsolved .
You'd think that when we celebrate these men's birthdays , we 'd like to know who killed them , and if some of those people might still be alive and in positions of power .
The majority of Americans believe in pretty much all the conspiracy theories , but they will also believe it when the media repeats over and over again that you 're too far outside the mainstream to be President if you bring even the most plausible ones up .
Over the following week , Mr. Slocombe continued discussions about the planned order with top Pentagon officials , including Mr. Feith .
During that same period , Lt. Gen. David McKiernan , the field commander of the coalition forces in Iraq , received and cleared the draft order .
I briefed Secretary Rumsfeld on the issue several times , and forwarded a final draft of the proposed order for his approval on May 19 .
Walter Slocombe subsequently received detailed comments on the draft order incorporating the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense , making clear that the top civilian and military staff in the Pentagon , as well as the commanders in the field , had reviewed the proposal .
Another coalition adviser , Dan Senor , spent the night of May 22 coordinating the text of the announcement with Mr. Rumsfeld ’s close adviser Lawrence Di Rita .
Apart from minor edits to the order , none of the military or civilian officials raised objections to the proposal to create a new Iraqi army or to formally dissolve Saddam Hussein ’s security apparatus .
On May 22 , I sent to President Bush , through Secretary Rumsfeld , my first report since arriving in Iraq .
I reviewed our activities since arrival , including our de-Baathification policy .
I then alerted the president that “ I will parallel this step with an even more robust measure dissolving Saddam ’s military and intelligence structures . ”
The same day , I briefed the president on the plan via secure video .
The president sent me a note on May 23 in which he thanked me for my report and noted that “ you have my full support and confidence . ”
The decision not to recall Saddam Hussein ’s army was thoroughly considered by top officials in the American government .
At the time , this decision was not controversial .
When Mr. Slocombe held a press conference in Baghdad on May 23 to explain the decision , only two reporters showed up — neither of them Americans .
The first I heard of doubts about the decision was in the fall of 2003 after the insurgency had picked up speed .
Moreover , we were right to build a new Iraqi Army .
Despite all the difficulties encountered , Iraq ’s new professional soldiers are the country ’s most effective and trusted security force .
By contrast , the Baathist - era police force , which we did recall to duty , has proven unreliable and is mistrusted by the very Iraqi people it is supposed to protect .

And How Outsiders Such as Fred Thompson Appear to Be Working on a Solution
On June 5 , U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton will sentence Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who has been convicted of obstruction of justice , making false statements , and perjury , as the result of the Special Counsel investigation arising from the revelation of Valerie Plame 's identity as a CIA agent .
I suspect that Judge Walton 's actions will create a difficult and delicate problem for the White House .
Needless to say , I have no crystal ball .
But it is plain that the White House must be bracing itself for Libby 's being sent to prison .
Moreover , it appears that high - powered friends of Libby and Cheney have figured out the White House 's dilemma , so they are trying to help keep Scooter out of prison in a manner that will not have criminal consequences for anyone involved .
No one has been more active in this undertaking on Libby 's behalf than former Tennessee Senator Fred D. Thompson , who has strong Presidential aspirations .
Yet , to my surprise , Thompson is either being blatantly dishonest , or he is remarkably uninformed about his efforts .
Unfortunately for Thompson , neither state of mind ought to commend itself to Republicans clamoring for a conservative with stature for the GOP nomination in 2008 .
Libby 's Likely Sentence and Duration of Incarceration
Since Libby 's conviction , there has been considerable public speculation about his sentence .
Typical of the consensus is an article by U.S. News & World Report that explains , " Under current federal guidelines , Libby 's four felony convictions , which stem from an FBI [ and Grand Jury ] investigation into the disclosure of a CIA operative 's identity , would most likely net him 18 months to three years in prison . "
This report notes , however , that " this is not an ordinary case , and â€¦ aggressive lawyering by both sides and the intense media scrutiny add an element of unpredictability . "
There is a historical parallel to certain Watergate - related convictions .
For example , former Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell , White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs John D. Ehrlichman were each sentenced to 30 to 96 months for perjury and obstruction of justice - two of the three crimes of which Libby was convicted ( They each served some 18 months before they were released . )
Providing a closer parallel to the Libby situation , Presidential Appointment Secretary and Deputy Assistant to the President Dwight Chapin was convicted for lying about his involvement in the 1972 Nixon campaign " dirty tricks " operation .
Chapin was not convicted for involvement in the dirty tricks per se , but rather for making false statements to the grand jury about his activities .
Chapin was sentenced to 10 - to - 30 months in prison , with the judge required that he serve not less than 10 .
Similarly , Libby was not convicted for leaking information about Valerie Plame Wilson 's covert status at the CIA , but rather for lying about his efforts to leak the information .
All of these former Nixon Administration officials were permitted to remain free on bond during the time they unsuccessfully appealed their convictions .
But the law has become more settled in the three decades since Watergate , and currently , defense lawyers tell me that unless a defendant has serious legal issues in play on appeal , federal judges seldom allow defendants to remain free on bond during the appeal process .
Libby very likely has no strong appellate issues :
His trial and conviction were rather uneventful , and Judge Walton - an experienced trial judge -- was widely seen as having been fair to both sides , and careful not to make any mistakes of law .
It is well known that Judge Walton , who arrived on the bench after a successful career in the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Washington , DC , gives out tough sentences .
He is the kind of " law and order " judge that conservatives praise , except when one of their own is being sentenced .
As I was told by one person who knows him well , Judge Walton is tough as they come , and he has the cojones to send Scooter to get his orange jumpsuit sooner rather than later .
How long a sentence is Judge Walton likely to impose ?
On May 25 , Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald filed the Government 's Sentencing Memorandum asking Judge Walton to sentence Libby in the range of " 30 to 37 months . "
Criminal defense attorneys with whom I have spoken expect that Judge Walton will choose a sentence of roughly 30 months ( two - and - a - half years ) , and to give Libby at most a couple of days to get his affairs in order before surrendering to the Federal Bureau of Prisons .
No doubt , the Bush White House has been making similar calculations .
Thus , they are approaching a moment of truth .
There are only three real insiders here : Bush , Cheney and Libby .
However , it appears that the outsiders have looked at the situation , and acted to try to improve it .
And as long as they are outsiders , they can do so without criminal exposure .
The Cost of Clemency : The White House 's Dilemma Regarding the Libby Sentencing
If Watergate had any lesson , it was that when someone connected to the White House is heading for prison , it is dangerous for the president or those close to him to even think about - not to mention talk about - clemency .
After all , the March 1 , 1974 indictment of Mitchell , Haldeman , Ehrlichman and Chuck Colson ( who pled guilty , rather than risk a trial ) charged each of them with a conspiracy to obstruct justice by offering to provide clemency to those involved in the Watergate break - in .
In addition , as Nixon 's tapes showed , the president discussed pardons on several occasions , and this abuse of power was included in the bill of impeachment against him that was pending when he resigned .
If Libby had been acting on his own behalf , a pardon would present no problem ; Bush and Cheney could feel it was the humanitarian thing to do , given his long service to the government .
However , no one I know believes Libby was acting simply for himself , nor does the evidence suggest it .
Let 's suppose , instead , that Libby was doing Cheney 's bidding , and that Cheney was deeply involved in both Libby 's leak of Valerie Plame 's CIA status and the lies Libby subsequently concocted to deflect attention away from the Vice President .
If so , then there was a conspiracy to obstruct justice - and if Cheney should go to Bush and request that he pardon Libby , he would be furthering that conspiracy .
No wonder then , that Special Counsel Fitzgerald remarked during the Libby trial that there was " a cloud " over the Vice President .
Come Tuesday , that cloud could get much darker for Cheney .
It 's likely that only Cheney and Libby know precisely what transpired between them , assuming they are half as shrewd as they appear .
In addition , Libby has probably not been foolish enough to directly request a pardon , nor Cheney imprudent enough to directly promise one .
Given what happened during Watergate , surely they are smart enough not to have had that conversation .
However , these men have worked together so long and closely that a knowing look , or pat on the back , from Cheney at the right moment could and would have said all that was necessary .
And my strong impression , from the outside , is that , indeed , that message has been sent .
Libby 's Public Defense Fund and Pardon Efforts
Following the bungled Watergate burglary and the arrest of Gordon Liddy 's troops in the Democratic National Committee , there was discussion in the White House and at a meeting of the Nixon reelection committee of setting up a public defense fund .
Nixon 's friend Bebe Rebozo offered to do so , with the plan of soliciting contributions from heavy hitters who merely were contributing because those arrested had all been Nixon loyalists , and were entitled to a fair trial .
But it never happened .
Scooter Libby , however , did create such a defense fund .
Whether Dick Cheney quietly picked up the phone to get this going , is not known .
If he did , he kept himself well removed .
Indeed , Lynne Cheney could well have done it .
We will never know .
But whoever was behind the defense fund , it has worked .
The drive to pardon Libby has come from people outside the White House who are smart enough to have figured out the dilemma facing the White House .
A list of these people can be found at Libby 's defense fund site , where these purported friends have gathered .
It is a Who 's Who of the Right - Wing Establishment -- many of whom have not only raised money to help pay Libby 's legal fees , but have also written letters to Judge Walton about Libby 's good character and public service , and continue to call for his pardon .
If high - powered folks like Fred Thompson lobby Bush for a pardon , Cheney need not be involved , and risk further participation in a conspiracy to obstruct justice .
But the claim , made by Thompson and others , that Libby is the subject of a great injustice in being prosecuted is pure hogwash .
This , in turn , suggests that this entire effort is nothing but a charade .
The Bogus Claim that Libby Has Been Unjustly Prosecuted
Frankly , I am not only stunned that Fred Thompson has taken up the " Free Scooter " campaign , but by the crude and thoughtless tactics he has employed .
He has either lied or could not be troubled to inform himself of the facts before he attacked Special Counsel Fitzgerald .
Thompson , a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in Tennessee , gave an audience his assessment of the prosecution against Libby for perjury and obstruction of justice in a speech on May 12 , 2007 .
He claims that the investigation was a sham from the outset : that there should have been no Special Counsel selected , and there never was any violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act .
Indeed , he claimed " that there was no violation of the law , by anyone , and everybody - the CIA , the Justice Department and the Special Counsel knew it .
Ms. Plame was not a ' covered person ' under the statute and it was obvious from the outset . "
This is a remarkable charge - suggesting that the CIA referred the matter to the Justice Department knowing that Plame was not covered by the law ; that the Justice Department commenced the investigation even though it had the same knowledge ; and that the Special Counsel continued the investigation even though he , too , knew she was not covered .
Yet why would Attorney General John Ashcroft 's Justice Department have undertaken a baseless investigation ?
Why would a busy and highly - respected U.S. Attorney from Chicago take the assignment of Special Counsel if the law did not apply ?
And why would that same highly - respected U.S. Attorney make representations to a federal judge that the law did cover Valerie Plame , if it did not ?
It seems Fred Thompson has made a remarkably irresponsible charge .
" Furthermore , " Thompson claimed , " Justice and the Special Counsel knew who leaked Plame 's name and it was n't Scooter Libby . "
Yet , Thompson added , " the Beltway machinery was well oiled and geared up so the Special Counsel â€¦ spent the next two years moving heaven and earth to come up with something , anything , " and finally " came up with some inconsistent recollections by Scooter Libby . "
Inconsistent recollections ?
Apparently Thompson does not have a clue about the evidence that was presented at the trial , which proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Libby concocted a complex lie to explain away key behavior .
Nonetheless , based on his two - plus years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney , Thompson informed the audience , " In no other prosecutor 's office in the country would a case like this one have been brought . "
Apparently , other prosecutors tolerate perjury and obstruction of justice .
In addition , later in his speech , Thompson explained , " I have called for a pardon for Scooter Libby .
When you rectify an injustice using the provisions of the law , just as when you reverse an erroneous court decision , you are not disregarding the rule of law , you are enforcing and protecting it . "
That twisted report of the Special Counsel 's investigation , and disturbing view on what to do about it is a bit frightening - especially coming from a man who wants to be president .
But it is arguments like this that are the basis of the drive for leniency from Judge Walton , for a pardon , and , more broadly , for a change in public opinion regarding this case .
Fitzgerald Responds To The Conservatives ' Claims
Although a few paragraphs of the Government 's Sentencing Memorandum were filed under seal , Special Counsel Fitzgerald addressed within the publicly - available portions of the Memorandum assertions like those Thompson has made .
In the Memorandum , Fitzgerald advises Judge Walton that until the investigation was as complete as possible , he had not decided who could , or should not , be charged .
He also makes clear that Valerie Plame was , indeed , a covert agent , and that the law did , indeed apply to her : " [ I ] t was clear from very early in the investigation that Ms. Wilson qualified under the relevant statute ( Title 50 , United States Code , Section 421 ) as a covert agent whose identity had been disclosed by public officials , including Mr. Libby , to the press . "
Unlike Thompson , who is free to act irresponsibly , Fitzgerald is not .
He backed up his assertion by providing Valerie Plame 's employment record .
As MSNBC explained , " An unclassified summary of outed CIA officer Valerie Plame 's employment history at the spy agency , disclosed for the first time today in a court filing by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald , indicates that Plame was " covert " when her name became public in July 2003 . "
Although Fred Thompson claims no other prosecutor would have taken action against Libby 's perjury , Fitzgerald 's filing makes it difficult to imagine how any legitimate prosecutor could have failed to take such action .
Fitzgerald quotes and cites United States v. Mandujano - one of a number of cases reaching the very same conclusion - to the effect that " [ p] erjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings .
Effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative .
The power of subpoena , broad as it is , and the power of contempt for refusing to answer , drastic as that is -- and even the solemnity of the oath -- cannot insure truthful answers .
Hence , Congress has made the giving of false answers a criminal act punishable by severe penalties ; in no other way can criminal conduct be flushed into the open where the law can deal with it . "
It should be of concern to Vice President Cheney that the Fitzgerald filing on Libby 's sentence once again indicates that Special Prosecutor has concluded , based on the evidence , that Cheney was involved in Libby 's misdeeds .
Fitzgerald all but states that he still has not gotten to the bottom of this investigation because Libby refuses to tell the truth , and that , if he did reach that bottom , he would likely find Dick Cheney , who may well have violated a number of laws .
With Friends Like Thompson , Libby 's Pardon Is In Doubt
Judge Walton has agreed to make public the hundred - some letters he has received from present and former government officials regarding the Libby pardon .
After Judge Walton sentences Libby , the world will know if the rumor as to his truly having cojones is correct -- for if Walton does tell Libby to surrender forthwith to the Federal Bureau of Prison , the campaign to " Free Scooter " will begin in earnest .
I suspect Patrick Fitzgerald will be watching with great interest any pardon action .
After all , he was working in the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York when that office ignored the refusal of the Bush Department of Justice , under Attorney General Ashcroft , to investigate former President Bill Clinton 's pardon of financier Marc Rich .
What will happen if Fitzgerald observes Bush pardoning Libby without any better rationale than the paper - thin ones Fred Thompson and friends have been pushing ?
One would be wise to remember that Fitzgerald will still have five years before the statute of limitations runs to find out why such a pardon was issued , as occurred with Clinton 's Marc Rich bottom .
Fitzgerald 's appointment as Special Counsel ends when he ends it , and given his apparent view that Cheney is at the heart of the Plame scandal , I do n't expect him to end it prematurely .

Ahmadinejad speech
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said debate over Tehran 's nuclear programme was " closed " and the issue was now in the hands of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said a nuclear Iran could threaten the world .
Other issues raised by world leaders included Darfur , climate change , protests in Burma and human rights .
In a wide - ranging speech , Mr Ahmadinejad reiterated his assertions that all of his country 's nuclear activities had been " peaceful and transparent " .

Iran leader enjoys spotlight Key quotes : UN assembly
He denounced the " arrogant " and " bullying " permanent members of the UN's Security Council , which has imposed sanctions on Iran over its uranium enrichment programme .
And he offered educational programmes to help other UN member states with their own nuclear work .
Representatives of the US and Israel were absent for Mr Ahmadinejad 's speech , in which he also repeated his verbal attacks on Israel as an " illegal Zionist regime " .
In his speech , Mr Sarkozy said that while Iran had the right to nuclear energy , allowing Tehran to develop nuclear weapons would mean an " unacceptable risk " for regional and world stability .
There would be no world peace if the international community showed " weakness in the face of the proliferation of nuclear weapons " , Mr Sarkozy said .
But there were dissenting views , among them Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega , who asked how the US - the only country to have used nuclear weapons - could challenge the rights of Iran and North Korea to a peaceful nuclear programme .
US sanctions
US President George W Bush used his 15 minutes at the podium to highlight human rights violations around the world , highlighting Belarus , North Korea , Syria and Iran .
The central theme of President Bush 's speech was the struggle against extremism .
He focused on the themes that have dominated much of his presidency - the need to spread freedom , to reward advocates of democracy and to isolate regimes whose policies run counter to what he sees as the tide of history .
Mr Bush contrasted those who were seeking the path of democracy : Lebanon , Iraq and those he dubbed moderate or mainstream Palestinian leaders , as opposed to the leadership of North Korea , Syria and Iran .
' Climate of change '
UN chief Ban Ki-moon told leaders the world faced " daunting challenges " - from tackling climate change to ending conflict in Sudan 's western region of Darfur .

He stressed that peace in the Middle East was vital to regional and world stability , and insisted that " no stone would be left unturned to end the tragedy in Darfur " .
" I expect the year ahead to be among the most challenging in our history .
And I am sure that , together , we can make it one of the most successful , " he said .
He also called on Burma 's military leaders to show restraint in the face of continued pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks .
This line was echoed by Mr Bush , who said Americans were " outraged by the situation in Burma " .
He announced " tighter " economic sanctions against the junta and urged other nations to apply pressure .

werkzeug German noun : “ tool ” .
Etymology : werk ( “ work ” ) , zeug ( “ stuff ” )
Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library .
It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries .
Werkzeug is Unicode aware and does n’t enforce any dependencies .
It is up to the developer to choose a template engine , database adapter , and even how to handle requests .
Update :
This post is really really out of date .
Please disregard most of what ’s written here .
Ruby on Rails by default encourages developers to develop insecure web applications .
While it ’s certainly possible to develop secure sites using the Rails framework you need to be aware of the issues at hand and many technologies that make Rails a powerful easy to use platform will work against you .
Cross Site Request Forgery
CSRF is the new bad guy in web application security .
Everyone has worked out how to protect their SQL database from malicious input , and RoR saves you from ever having to worry about this .
Cross site scripting attacks are dying and the web community even managed to nip most JSON data leaks in the bud .
Cross Site Request Forgery is very simple .
A malicious site asks the user ’s browser to carry out an action on a site that the user has an active session on and the victim site carries out that action believing that the user intended that action to occur .
In other words the problem arises when a web application relies purely on session cookies to authenticate requests .
Let ’s look at a simple example .
I want my site to add me to your 37 Signals Highrise contact list .
37 Signals Highrise
Working out how to do this is pretty simple .
I go to Highrise and take a look at the “ Add a person ” form in Firebug or using View Source .
It ’s a fairly straightforward form that submits to http://ianloic.highrisehq.com/people and has a bunch of fields .
I can easily recreate that form on my own server .
Since Highrise uses a different domain for each user I ask the user to enter their domain name .
I use the same username I use everywhere else so it should be pretty easy to fool my user into giving me their Highrise domain name .
Most other sites do not have unique per-user URLs .
The page is here and the source is here .
Provided you ’re logged in and you enter your highrise domain correctly clicking “ Add me ” will add my name to your contacts list because 37 Signals ’ servers have no idea that the request is not coming from their application .
It ’s fairly straight - forward to modify a form like this to automatically submit on page load .
It ’s pretty easy to put it in an hidden IFRAME so the user does n’t even know what ’s going on .
By using a unique per-user URL the guys at 37 signals have made this exploit non-trivial .
This is not the default behavior from the Ruby on Rails framework .
By default action URLs are very predictable .
For example if we take a look at the social bookmarking site Magnolia we see predictable URLs all over the place .
Magnolia
As soon as you log in to Magnolia you are presented with a form for adding a bookmark by typing in its URL .
This is a fantastic user experience .
Unfortunately for Magnolia ’s users anyone that submits this form on their behalf can add bookmarks and the form ’s action ( http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/quicksave) is the same for all users .
A trivial page that adds a bookmark to a visitor ’s Magnolia account would look like this ( try it ) :
< html > < head >< title>Ma.gnolia</title ></head > < body onload=" document.getElementById('f ' ) .submit ( ) " > < form id = " f " method= " post " action = " http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/quicksave " > < input type =" text " value = " http://ian.mckellar.org/ " name = " url " id =" url " type = " hidden " ></ input > </ form > </ body > </html >
But it gets even worse .
Since by default Rails allows GET as well as POST submissions you can call an action from an IMG tag ( try it ) :
<img src= " http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/quicksave?url=http://ian.mckellar.org/ " >
Magnolia is not unique in the behavior .
Unless a site ’s developer has gone out of their way to prevent it , this class of attacks will affect every Rails site .
Most of the popular sites I ’ve looked at exhibit some vulnerabilities .
Other Rails sites I ’ve looked at attempt to do their input validation in JavaScript rather than in Ruby which leaves them open to JavaScript injection and hence XSS attacks .
This is a far more serious attack that I can cover separately if there is interest .
Solutions
Easy Solutions
There are n’t any good easy solutions to this .
A first step is to do referrer checking on every request and block GET requests in form actions .
Simply checking the domain on the referrer may not be enough security if there ’s a chance that HTML could be posted somewhere in the domain by an attacker the application would be vulnerable again .
Better Solutions
Ideally we want a shared secret between the HTML that contains the form and the rails code in the action .
We do n’t want this to be accessible to third parties so serving as JavaScript is n’t an option .
The way other platforms like Drupal achieve this is by inserting a hidden form field into every form that ’s generated that contains a secret token , either unique to the current user ’s current session or ( for the more paranoid ) also unique to the action .
The action then has to check that the hidden token is correct before allowing processing to continue .
This is a pain in the arse to write by hand .
What is really required at the Rails level is a of form API that can generate and consume forms securely .
In Drupal all form HTML is generated and parsed by the framework .
This allows application developers to protect themselves from XSRF without even knowing they are .
There ’s a plugin called Secure Action but I ’m not sure how well it works .
The dependence on a static shared salt rather than a randomly generated secret in the user ’s session concerns me .
The way it puts the signature in the URL makes me nervous too .
It ’s better than nothing though .

Correction Appended
When Google was a graduate - school project being run from a Silicon Valley garage , its founders , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , built their own computers out of cheap parts meant for personal computers .
They wanted to save money , and they felt that they could design a network of computers that would search the Web more efficiently than those available from traditional manufacturers .
Google no longer needs to pinch pennies .
It is a solid member of the Fortune 500 with $ 9 billion in cash .
Still , it is stubbornly sticking to its do - it - yourself approach to technology .
Even as it spends more than $ 1.5 billion this year on operations centers and technology , most of the hundreds of thousands of servers it will deploy are being custom - made based on Google 's own eccentric designs .
To be closer to its users and speed response time , it is building a worldwide string of data centers , including a huge site in The Dalles , Ore. , with technologies it designed to reduce its ravenous need for electricity .
These computers in turn use software developed with advanced tools that Google also designed itself .
There are signs that Google is even preparing to create its own custom microchips .
" Google is as much about infrastructure as it is about the search engine , " said Martin Reynolds , an analyst with the Gartner Group .
" They are building an enormous computing resource on a scale that is almost unimaginable . "
He said he believed that Google was the world 's fourth - largest maker of computer servers , after Dell , Hewlett - Packard and I.B.M .

At some point in the immediate to near future , someone is going to throw Barry Bonds a strike when he should be seeing a ball , and he will rake it with extreme prejudice .
His propulsive , compact swing will rock the sphere toward the roof of the troposphere ; it will fall to earth roughly 440 feet from where Bonds is standing , and he will react as if he is : ( a ) unimpressed or ( b ) vaguely annoyed .
He will then jog 360 feet , and some people will cheer , and some people will have mixed feelings , and some people will have mixed feelings while they cheer .
And that is because this particular raking will be the 715th home run of Bonds ' career , meaning he will have surpassed the home run production of George Herman " Babe " Ruth .
This is a problem .
It is not a problem the way global warming is a problem , nor is it a problem the way throat cancer is a problem .
But it 's a problem for anyone who considers sports to be a meaningful prism through which to understand life and culture .
It 's a problem for future historians , which means it 's a problem for us right now .
The problem is this :
It 's an achievement of disenchantment .
And that applies to pretty much everyone involved , including you .
The reason we keep statistics -- and the reason we care about statistical milestones -- is that we assume some sort of emotional experience will accompany their creation and obliteration .
These moments are supposed to embody ideas that transcend the notion of grown men playing children 's games ; these moments are supposed to be a positive amalgamation of awe , evolution , inspiration , admiration and the macrobiotic potential of man .
But the recent success of Bonds contains only two of those qualities , and maybe only the first .
It 's hard to feel good about that .
Bonds is a self - absorbed , unlikable person who has an adversarial relationship with the world at large , and he has ( almost certainly ) used unethical , unnatural means to accomplish feats that actively hurt baseball .
His statistical destruction of Ruth is metaphoric , but not in a good way .
It 's an indictment of modernity , even for people who do n't give a damn about the past or the present .
Bonds probably does n't care about any of this , and I 'm not necessarily certain he should .
But the rest of us are left in a curious quandary :
How do we reconcile a massive , momentous achievement that is neither wholly real nor socially good ?
In a vacuum , Bonds might be the greatest hitter who ever lived .
But we do n't live in a vacuum .
We live in the world .
This is a problem .
It 's a big problem composed of five smaller problems , and they 're all kind of important .
Problem 1 : The end of numbers -- in the only realm where numbers matter
At this point in history , no one considers baseball as popular as football or as culturally relevant as basketball .
But baseball is still the intellectual game ; it 's the game most compelling to the likes of Ken Burns and George Will and Yo La Tengo , and that 's at least partially due to the quantitative import of its record keeping .
Baseball is the only sport where numbers always seem meaningful , and it's the only sport where a numeric comparison between players of different eras is even halfway reasonable .
Kareem Abdul - Jabbar scored almost 7,000 more career points than Wilt Chamberlain did , but no one would ever suggest that Abdul - Jabbar was the superior , or even comparable , offensive force .
Baseball is the only game where categories like batting average and slugging percentage have objective meaning , and it's the one sport where specific cumulative plateaus ( 3,000 hits , 300 wins ) are regularly used as guidelines for the Hall of Fame .
It 's the only game where sabermetrics could exist and be taken seriously .
Unlike football and basketball , baseball exists within a hard reality .

Steroids , and Bonds in particular , have probably changed that forever .
Performance - enhancing drugs create two problems for baseball 's bean counters -- one of which is predictable and one of which is not .
The first , obviously , is that they enhance performance .
The second is that these performances are enhanced to a degree that 's completely unclear .
In the case of Bonds , it would appear that the improvement has been profound :
At an age ( 37 ) when his skills should have been diminishing , he hit 24 more home runs than he ever had before .
But that still tells us very little about the specific impact of steroid use .
There is no way to quantify the intangible components of injecting yourself with drugs that make you better .
How much of this increased production was due to Bonds ' newfound sense of mental invincibility ?
How much was due to the realization by opposing pitchers that Bonds was : ( a ) totally juiced up and therefore ( b ) impossible to overpower ?
Moreover , it 's not like steroids magically turn spray hitters into Magnus Ver Magnusson ; they mostly help hitters ( and pitchers ) recover faster from workouts , which allows them to train harder and more often .
Does this mean " the cream " and " the clear " made Bonds into a freakish superman , or does it mean they merely allowed him to become the natural superfreak he always had the potential to be ?
These are questions we can never answer .
It would be absurd to argue that Bonds ' hitting assault over the past six years is completely inauthentic or even mildly unimpressive .
It is , however , relatively meaningless .
Because steroids make the values of all modern statistics confusing and incomparable , they also diminish the two things baseball had going for it : history and math .
Everything that 's happened in major league baseball since approximately 1995 is now potentially useless , which ultimately means that everything since ' 95 is completely useless .
And this will continue to have an effect in the future , even if steroids and human growth hormone are completely eliminated from the game .
Let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that the maximum number of home runs an organic , free - range , unenhanced baseball player can hit in a 162 - game schedule is 65 .
Perhaps a 65 - homer season is the limit of human potential and as close to power - hitting perfection as any normal person can achieve .
If someone were to do this in 2016 , would anyone even care ?
It 's hard to imagine how 65 legitimate home runs could ever seem as stunning as the 73 semi - fake ones we 've already seen .
Problem 2 : We were all fools and now we have to pretend we were n't
Part of what makes Bonds ' alleged juicing so troubling , if we are to believe the exhaustively researched book " Game of Shadows , " is that it appears so brazen .
Many of us -- including his own mistress -- swear that the man 's head has physically increased in size , which is generally not a consequence of aging .
His cheating seems stupidly obvious .
But nobody seemed to perceive this obviousness until we had no other choice .
In 1998 , Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs and Sammy Sosa clubbed 66 .
McGwire looked like a bipedal Clydesdale swinging an elm tree ; he was somehow far stronger at age 34 than he had been 10 years before .
Sosa was ( supposedly ) only 29 in 1998 , which seemed slightly more reasonable ; of course , he happened to be a 29 - year - old man with acne , so that was a little weird .
But people loved these jovial manimals , and people wanted to see the never - beloved Roger Maris erased from the record books , and people casually wondered if maybe there was something wrong with the actual baseballs .
Americans tend to be conspiracy theorists , but we 're not particularly skeptical .
The situation with Bonds is different .
The evidence is overwhelming , and the protagonist is n't heroic .
Moreover , his chemistry experiments are going to have a consequence no one is happy about : Bonds will supplant Ruth , the most enduring sports figure of the 20th century .
Everybody knows this , and there 's nothing anyone can do .
It 's too late .
And because we all let this happen -- because we ignored what now seems obvious about McGwire and dozens of other hitters in the late '90s -- we will have to retrospectively reinvent how those experiences felt .
Barry Bonds will force people to change their recent memories so they correspond with a new frame of reference , which is how historical revisionism generally occurs .
Problem 3 : Tomorrow , today will be yesterday -- and Bonds will represent what that was like

In November 2000 , the United States held a presidential election , and nobody knew who won , so we just kind of made up an outcome and tried to act like that was normal .
Less than a year later , airplanes flew into office buildings , and everybody cried for two months .
And then Enron went bankrupt , and the U.S. started acting like a rogue state , and " The Simple Life " premiered , and gasoline became unaffordable , and our Olympic basketball team lost to Puerto Rico , and we reelected the same president we never really elected in the first place .
Later , there would be some especially devastating hurricanes and three Oscars for an especially bad movie called " Crash . "
Things , as they say , have been better .
I 'm only 33 years old , so I 'll concede that my life experience is limited .
But the past five years have been an especially depressing stretch to be an American , and I do n't think many people of any age would disagree with that sentiment ( except for maybe Kelly Clarkson ... things seem to be working out OK for her ) .
If it 's the era of anything , it 's the Era of Predictable Disillusionment : a half - decade in which many long - standing fears about how America works ( and what America has come to represent ) were gradually -- and then suddenly -- hammered into the collective consciousness of just about everyone , including all the people who had n't been paying attention to begin with .
This will not be lost on future historians .
In 50 or 100 years , they will search for events within the popular culture that supposedly embodied the zeitgeist of the time .
Some of these people will use sports , not unlike the way contemporary historians might use Muhammad Ali as a means to define the 1960s .
As these future historians try to explain what was wrong with the world in the early 21st century , I suspect they will use Barry Bonds .
Here was a man accomplishing unbelievable things -- things so unbelievable that they literally should not have been believed , even as they were happening .
But we did not really believe or disbelieve .
We just sort of watched it happen , and then we watched it get out of control , and then we expressed shock without feeling a grain of surprise , and then we tried to figure out how we were supposed to reconcile an alien reality we unconsciously understood all along .
So if you 're wondering how to feel about Barry 's passing Babe , here 's one option :
You can feel like you 're experiencing how the present tense will be understood in the future .
Problem 4 : What Bonds says is occasionally true -- and why this makes things worse
A mound of evidence suggests that Bonds has been less than honest about steroids .
But it seems like he 's been honest about a lot of other things .
" The last time I played baseball was in college , " he said in his grand jury testimony during the BALCO case .
He said almost the exact same thing to The New York Times Magazine in 2002 : " The last game I played was in college .
Ever since then , it 's been a business .
This is a business . "
So far as I can tell , this is the only plausible explanation for Bonds ' alleged decision to use performance - enhancing drugs : the idea of not using them seemed ridiculous .
It did not strike him as unethical , because for Bonds , this is not a moral issue .
Who possibly worries about such matters ?
The goal is to do business .
This is a job .
It 's important to realize that the way you view baseball and the way Barry Bonds views baseball have almost no relationship whatsoever .
You likely view Bonds ' life as somewhat extraordinary ; he absolutely does not .
There has never been a single moment in his existence when being around superstar ballplayers was peculiar .
Bonds ' father was an All - Star outfielder , his godfather is Willie Mays and his distant cousin is Reggie Jackson .
And Bonds has never played on a team for which he was n't the best player .
You could argue that he has never played against anyone as talented as himself .
He has always been rich , always been dominant .
Fame has always seemed normative .
So any deeper meaning we may place on how steroids will affect the sanctity of the game is -- to Bonds -- irrelevant and probably preposterous .
Baseball holds as much symbolic value to him as delivering the mail does to a postman .

This is what makes Bonds frustrating :
It 's entirely possible that he views his actions more reasonably than everyone else does .
When I consider the choices he made , I find myself thinking , " Why ? "
He was already the best player of his generation .
But then I realize that my question is reflexive .
The reason Bonds would jeopardize his legacy is because he does n't view it as a legacy -- he views it as a responsibility he does n't particularly like .
Part of what makes him unlikable is that he does n't care how other people expect him to think .
Part of what makes him unlikable is the fact that he 's so shrewd .
Early in " Game of Shadows , " authors Mark Fainaru - Wada and Lance Williams try to illustrate what motivated Bonds to inject chemicals into his rump , and they suggest that his actions were driven by jealousy and , to a lesser extent , race .
" They 're just letting him do it because he 's a white boy , " Bonds supposedly said of McGwire 's steroid - fueled run at the single - season home run mark .
This statement makes Bonds seem as paranoid as Richard Nixon .
How , one wonders , could unseen puppet masters be pulling the strings behind the home run race ?
It all seems crazy .
But , then again , nobody ever wrote a takedown book on Mark McGwire .
I 'm not sure anyone even considered it .
Nixon was n't always wrong .
Problem 5 : Babe Ruth does n't exist -- and probably never did
We are all familiar with the story of Babe Ruth ; it 's the classic American narrative .
He was born inside a burning saloon .
As a teen , he was persuaded to become a southpaw pitcher through the guidance of a priest impressed by the boy 's ability to consume entire turkeys during brunch .
As he matured , Ruth found he was able to hit 600 - foot home runs for dying children without the use of a bat .
His on - field excellence was punctuated by an ability to drink whole kegs of beer while making love to nine women simultaneously , none of whom was his wife .
When the Red Sox traded his rights to the Yankees , 560 people died in a mud slide .
Ruth served as Warren G. Harding 's secretary of state , albeit briefly .
He also weighed in the neighborhood of 18,000 pounds and once won a best - of - three - falls wrestling match against Man o' War , the horse he later ate .
For all practical -- and statistical -- purposes , Ruth was n't a real person .
In 1927 he hit 60 home runs , exactly twice as many as NL co-champs Hack Wilson and Cy Williams hit ; when Ruth retired in 1935 , he had hit 714 homers , more than twice as many as Lou Gehrig , the man in second place .
In 1925 , he got a tummy ache , and it was one of the biggest stories of the year .
He revolutionized the game , captivated radio audiences , built houses , inspired candy bars and was used as an epithet by Japanese soldiers during the war .
Ruth has been dead for 57 years , and he is still substantially more famous than Barry Bonds .
But Bonds is going to pass him , and no one knows how to feel .
Ruth was a troubling person , but he 's a wonderful idea ; Bonds is a troubling person who 's an empty idea .
For his entire career , Barry Bonds has embodied nothing .
Now he will embody only this , and " this " is n't good for anyone .
He 's just compiling numbers we do n't trust , and they are as colossal as they are meaningless .
To care about these home runs is to care about nothing .
David Grann 's 2002 profile of Bonds in The New York Times Magazine was titled " Baseball Without Metaphor . "
It ended with a rhetorical query .
" But for the moment , as the crowd settled back into its seats , there were no heroes or demons , " Grann wrote while awaiting Bonds ' next at - bat , back when his home run total still hovered below 600 .
" Just baseball .
Is n't that enough ? "
No .

The “ abortion pill ” RU - 486 could become a new form of daily contraceptive .
The pill usually contains oestrogen and progesterone , but oestrogen increases the risk of breast cancer .
Progesterone - only pills often cause irregular bleeding and spotting .
RU -486 contains mifepristone , a synthetic steroid that stops ovulation through a different mechanism .
David Baird and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh , UK , gave 72 women a low daily dose of mifepristone or the progesterone - only pill for 24 weeks .
Both pills were equally good at preventing pregnancy , but mifepristone caused significantly less unwanted bleeding ( Human Reproduction , DOI : 10.1093/humrep/dem177 ) .
The Exxon Valdez disaster is certainly the most notorious oil spill in the United States — a single , terrible accident that poured 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound 1989 , causing grievous damage to Alaska ’s waters and beyond .
But it is not the largest .
In terms of volume it cannot match the steady seepage of oil into Newtown Creek , the polluted waterway that separates Brooklyn from Queens .
The Newtown Creek spill has not received anywhere near the response that followed the Valdez incident .
The cleanup has been haphazard and ineffective , hampered by weak enforcement , and residents have been left in the dark about potential health effects .
A report this month from the Environmental Protection Agency suggested that the Newtown spill may be twice as large as first believed — some 30 million gallons , nearly three times the size of the Alaska spill .
It has polluted the 4 - mile strip of waterway and some 55 residential and commercial acres around it , gathering in subsurface reservoirs , mixing with groundwater , creating toxic vapors and and seeping , slowly but inexorably , into the creek .
One major concern is the reported leakage of chemical vapor into homes .
The report was welcome , but far too long in coming .
And it did not go far enough .
Representatives Nydia Velazquez and Anthony Weiner , two members of Congress whose districts are affected , and who fought for the study , were understandably disappointed with the results .
Both lawmakers are studying ways to speed the cleanup and assess health risks .

A couple weeks ago I posted my Beginner ’s Guide to Running , which turned out to be pretty popular .
Today I present my Beginner ’s Guide to Cycling , which I hope is just as useful .
I ’d like to note that I ’m not nearly as qualified to write this guide as I was to write the running guide .
I ’m a very early beginner in cycling , and what I ’m posting here is just the basics , from what I ’ve learned from my research ( websites , books , and talking to experts ) and from my limited experiences so far .
I basically just want to share what I ’ve learned so far , so that it might help others who want to get started .
Also , I ’d like to note that this guide applies only to road cycling , not mountain biking , as I have n’t hit the trails yet .
Last , please add to this guide with your own tips and experiences in the comments !
Two Most Important Tips
There are a lot of important tips here in this guide , and in the links I provided , but here are the most important two .
Start slow .
There ’s no need to kill yourself when you start .
Even if you ’re already in good shape , cycling uses different muscles than other exercises , and your body will need time to get used to the new types of stress .
Start out nice and easy , enjoy yourself , and progress gradually .
Just do 2 - 3 miles at first , and do them nice and slow .
Have fun !
Be safe .
More than most sports , cycling can be very dangerous , especially if you ’re on the roads with all the crazy drivers out there .
In my area , two cyclists were hit in recent months ( one died ) , so I take extra precautions .
Ride during the daylight hours , follow traffic laws , always yield the right of way , wear bright colors and reflectors , wear a helmet .
More safety tips below .
The Bike
What ’s the best bike to get for cycling ?
Heck if I know .
I ’m just a beginner .
I suggest that you start with any old bike you can get your hands on .
Really .
If you ’ve got one in your garage , or you know someone who has one that ’s not being used , just spray some WD - 40 on the rusty parts , inflate the tire and make sure there are no leaks , and give it a go .
You do n’t need anything fancy to start with .
The really nice bikes are optimal , of course , but they are also well over $ 1,000 ( some are well over twice that ) , and they are n’t necessary to get into the sport and enjoy it .
Once you get into it , and are sure you ’ll be doing it for the long term , look into a better bike .
The nice road bikes are lighter , with strong frames , thin tires ( for less friction ) , with a whole host of other nice features to make riding fast and easy .
However , I use an old mountain bike , and I still love riding .
What ’s most important is that the bike fits you .
The bike should fit your height ( from ground to crotch ) , as well as the distance from the seat to the handle .
I ’m not an expert at this — it ’s best to go to a good bike shop to get fitted .
Equipment
Cycling , more than many other sports , is equipment - centric .
I am of the minimalist school – you do n’t need a host of fancy gear to get started .
Add those later .
What ’s the minimum gear needed ?
Here ’s my list :
Helmet .
Do n’t ever ride without one .
It can mean the difference between a bad headache and being a vegetable .
Make sure it fits well ( see this guide for tips on that , along with other equipment needed to get started ) .

Water bottle .
Get one with a cage that attaches to your bike .
Regular bottles do n’t fit in this cage , btw .
An alternative is a hydration backpack .
You really only need hydration tools once you start cycling beyond an hour , but it ’s good to have just in case .

Pump .
A portable pump that you attach to the bike is necessary , in case you get a flat or a slow leak .
You do n’t want to be walking your bike back home .
A floor pump is good to have at home , too , for easier pumping , but is n’t absolutely necessary .

Repair kit .
A simple repair kit would include a patch kit , a spare inner tube , 2 tire levers , a multi-tool for bikes , all in a small bag that attaches to the bike .
Other stuff you could get later :
Gloves .
I actually have a pair of these , and you could consider them essential .
They absorb shock from the handles ( cycling gloves are padded ) , but more importantly , if you crash , your palms are protected .

Bike computer .
This attaches to the bike ( no , they do n’t have it in Linux or Mac flavors ) and tells you how far you ’ve gone , how fast you ’re going , your RPMs , and all other kinds of good info .
Very useful , but not absolutely necessary .
I do n’t have one at this point , but it ’s on my to - buy list .

Gel - padded seat .
For beginners , riding on a hard cycling seat can be very uncomfortable .
This gel padding has saved me a bit of pain .
Experienced riders tell me that you get used to it after awhile , and I have , to some degree .

Glasses .
To some , these are a must .
I have n’t gotten them yet , but they block bugs and other debris from hitting you in the eyes .
Has n’t been a problem for me yet , but then I do n’t go that fast !

Shoes / pedals .
The most efficient way of peddling is if you are using your up - stroke as well , not just your down - stroke ( pulling the pedals up and pushing them down ) .
To do this , of course , you either need cage pedals to put your shoes in , or the kind of pedals that lock into your cycling shoes .
You ’d also need special shoes for that , of course .
I plan to get these some time , but have n’t gotten to it yet .

Racks .
Important if you want to transport anything .
There are all kinds of racks and panniers ( cycling bags ) .
Awesome for touring or commuting .
There are , of course , a ton of other equipment out there .
But you do n’t need them in the beginning .
The Clothing
We ’ve all seen the tight and bright clothing that the pros wear .
I ’m sorry to report that I ’ve gone minimalist here as well — I just wear my running shorts and shirt and shoes .
That ’s really all you need to start off .
However , if you begin to get serious about cycling , you should consider some good clothing .
Good cycling clothing is thin , so you do n’t get too hot , flexible for comfort , with special material that “ wicks away ” sweat ( basically , it does n’t soak it up and chafe your skin like cotton does ) .
It ’s also tight , so the wind does n’t flap your clothing all around and irritate the hell out of you .
And the bright colors serve a purpose as well : they make you visible to those crazy drivers !
Cold weather : I do n’t live in cold weather , but many of you do — in that case , thin cycling wear is good , but layer it on .
If you get hot , you can always take off a layer .
Safety
Always be safe on the road .
Do not be daring , do not insist on the right of way , do not break traffic laws ( yes , you have to follow them too ) , and always be as visible as possible .
If you know the common causes of accidents , you can look out for them :
Opening car doors .
This is a common one — someone opens their car door , right into your path , and you do n’t have time to swerve .
Slam !
The only thing to say is to be on the lookout for any doors that are about to open , and do n’t ride too close to parked cars .

Slam !

Sideswiped .
If you right on the outermost edge of the road , as many cyclists do , cars will be tempted to try to pass you in the same lane .
As this is a tight fit , this could result in you being hit .
It ’s safest to take the center of the lane , even if that does n’t seem as safe , until you can safely move to the shoulder to let cars pass if necessary .
You have just as much a right to that lane as the cars do .

Intersections .
If you are making a left turn across an intersection , be very careful .
You might think that the oncoming traffic , or the cross traffic from either side , will see you , but you could be wrong .
Be very sure you are seen by all drivers .
Right turns can also be dangerous if the traffic going into that lane does n’t see you — or if the driver behind you also making a right turn does n’t see you , as he is busy looking to his left .
Safety is too large a topic to be covered here .
Try this guide or this one for more .
Shifting Gears
This is a topic that might seem simple , but for many true beginners , it can be confusing and a little scary .
But with a little practice , it ’s actually pretty easy .
Here ’s what you need to know :
Three front gears .
There are usually three gears in the front — the large , medium and small .
There is one shifting mechanism at the handlebars for switching between these gears ( marked 1 , 2 and 3 ) .
The large one is for when the pedaling is the easiest , and can go the fastest .
Good for downhills and flats .
The small one is for hills , and takes a lot of pedaling to go the same distance as the other two , but is much easier to turn .
The middle is between them , and is probably going to be used most often ( at least by us beginners ) .

Seven back gears .
These also go from small to largest , and have a shifting mechanism for switching between them ( 1 - 7 ) .
I usually pair the small front gear with the largest three back gears ( 1 - 3 ) , the medium front gear with the middle back gears ( 3 - 5 ) , and the large front gear with the smallest back gears ( 5 - 7 ) .

I usually pair the small front gear with the largest three back gears ( 1 - 3 ) , the medium front gear with the middle back gears ( 3 - 5 ) , and the large front gear with the smallest back gears ( 5 - 7 ) .
Basic premise .
Basically , you want to pedal using the largest front gear with the smallest back gear that you can handle while still pedaling at a high cadence ( pedaling fast ) .
That means that if you can shift to a larger front gear while still pedaling at a high cadence , you should .
But if it begins to get too tough for you to pedal at a high cadence , shift down to a smaller front gear ( or larger back gear or both ) .
This will take a little practice , but it ’s not hard .
And as you get better at cycling , you will be able to pedal faster with the harder gears , over time .
There ’s more to gears and shifting , though .

Braking
Obviously this is a pretty important area .
It ’s a major safety skill that takes a little practice to learn .
A few tips :
Down hills .
The temptation going down hills , to limit your speed and make sure you do n’t get out of control , is to brake the whole way down .
It ’s recommended that you do n’t do this , though — the brake pad could burn out .
You want to do it in spurts .

Front brake .
Many beginners use both brakes simultaneously to brake .
But more experienced cyclists ( and I ’m not one yet ) use the front brake most of the time .
If you practice using the front brake , you will lose the fear of flipping over the front wheel .

Rear brake .
This is good for certain situations , especially if it ’s slippery or your front tire blows out .
This is a great guide for braking .
Hills
For beginning cyclists , hills can be a big challenge .
Experienced cyclists actually have no problems with hills — they know how to shift , to brake , to pace themselves , and they have gotten stronger on hills with practice .
There are two areas with hills to be concerned with :
Uphills .
Cycling uphill is n’t that hard if you shift to the right gears .
It took me a little while to learn this .
What I like to do is build up some speed going into a hill , shifting to a bigger front gear and getting some momentum .
This will carry me a little ways up the hill .
As the pedaling becomes more difficult , I gradually shift to easier gears until I ’m on the smallest front gear and largest back gear .
If I ’m lucky , I do n’t get to that point .
It ’s also good to learn to pace yourself — do n’t pump the pedals too hard early on in a long hill , or you ’ll tire out .

Steep downhills can be scary for us beginners because of the speed .
I recommend slowing yourself down with intermittent braking .
If the downhill is n’t too steep , I recommend shifting to your big front gear and smallest back gear — you can really build up some speed that will carry you when you hit the flat or the next hill .
Flat Tires
They happen to everyone .
Know how to fix them , and be sure to have a pump and a spare inner tube .
You do n’t want to be walking the bike home .
It ’s really not that hard .
See this guide and this one for more .
Commute to Work
One of my goals is to regularly commute to work .
While I ’ve done it a number of times now , I ’m still working on this one .
It saves money on gas , helps the environment , and gets your exercise in all at once .
Does it get any better ?
The main issues for commuting to work mostly revolve around being clean with clean clothes .
I give my tips on bike commuting here , but for me , the key has been to bring clothes to work when I drive or carpool to work , and then to shower at work ( this is a great option if you ’re lucky enough to have it ) .
Also try this guide on bike commuting and this one for a lot more info .
Cycling Forums
If you ’re just getting into cycling , a great way to learn more , and to motivate yourself , is to join a cycling forum ( off - line cycling groups are great too ) .
Here are a few to get you started :

There are a ton of sites on cycling out there .

Update :
This is exactly why languages with more powerful abstractions are more important than adding push - button variable renaming to less powerful languages .
Where 's the button that refactors a method with lots of mutable variables into one with no mutable variables ?
No button ?
Okay , until you invent one , do n't you want a language that makes it easy to write methods and functions without mutable local variables ?
( Attention Java programmers :
Yes you do , and I have proof .
Do you like the new for syntactic sugar in Java 1.5 ?
Its biggest benefit is that it makes loops that used to have a mutable variable look just like an iterator block with an immutable parameter in Ruby or Smalltalk .
Think about it . )
Steve Yegge wrote a terrific post about refactoring , " Transformation , " in March of 2006 .
My two cent review is that the most valuable part is his discussion of how the Blub community has become so enamored of push - button refactoring at the line of code level that they have lost sight of what refactoring is supposed to accomplish at the design level .
Many Blub programmers wo n't evena language that does n't have so - called refactoring support in their IDE .
Given the choice between dynamic metaprogramming and refactoring , they choose refactoring without even knowing exactly what dynamic metaprogramming is .
And they are blissfully unaware that the ' refactorings ' in their editors are just a few of the refactorings suggested in Martin Fowler 's seminal book on the topic .
Furthermore , there is more than one way to accomplish the goal of well - designed software , and some languages , ( especially folding languages ) , provide much more powerful tools for clean software design than micro-refactoring .
All that leads me to a question posed on programming .reddit.com
I 'll simplify things .local variables are bad .
And here 's why : Mutable local variables mean that within a method execution you have changes of state .
That makes it very difficult to change anything without breaking things .
For Eclipse fans , consider what happens if you take a random chunk in the middle of a method with mutable local variables and try to use the automatic refactoring to make a new private method .
If you have lots of immutable local variables , they have to be passed to your new method as parameters .
That 's not so bad .
But if you have mutable local variables , you have to do some back flips and sit ups to ensure that any changes to those variables are propagated to the rest of your method .
This is a tip - off that the mutable local variables have introduced a lot of complexity to the structure of the method .
Unless they make it dramatically shorter than a variable - free version of the same method , they should be removed . ( Update ) : What kind of complexity are we talking about ?
We are talking about lots and lots of dependencies between the lines of code in the method .
Those dependencies are what make the code brittle : if you try to move something or change it , you break some other code that is depending on its side effects .
The extra dependencies have introduced , which is a code smell .
The extra coupling manifests itself in many ways , not just in the difficulty of moving code around .
You also have problems changing lines of code .
This manifests itself in regressions : every time you fix a problem or add some functionality , do you find yourself having to fix a bunch of bugs created by your change ?
Let 's be clear : we do n't say mutable local variables are bad because it's hard to refactor methods with mutable local variables .
We say mutable local variables are bad because they intrduce complex dependencies and coupling between the lines of code in a method.local variables , such as the local variables you use to cache certain results , arebad .
( I should say , " in my opinion , " but this is my blog .
Note the words " my " and " blog , " establishing that we 're talking aboutandnot everyone and especially not widely accepted irrefutable facts ) .
As a matter of fact , I canthat they are not bad .
Okay , " proof " is an ambitious word given that there is no widely accepted proof that 1+1=2 .
I 'll demonstrate .
Here 's some code with an immutable local variable :
Let 's transform that code into :
We 've transformed the immutable local variable into a parameter for a lambda ( or closure , or anonymous proc object , whichever name you prefer ) .
Parameters are not harmful .
And since this transformation can be automatically performed forimmutable local variable , I claim that immutable local variables are also not harmful .
Cool discovery , hunh ?
I should be famous .
Oh wait , someone on the phone from the 1970s .
The Lisp people want theirback .
And they 're right .
People having been usingfor more than thirty years to write concise code without the side effects and state changes associated with mutable local variables .
Consider instead : That 's simpler structurally than using one of Ruby 's procs .
So what do we conclude ?
First , refactoring is cool , but it 's a tool , not an objective .
The important thing is the objective , well - designed software .
Second , read the book .
Really read it , cover to cover .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese court has jailed two officials after they let a blind contractor build a bridge which collapsed during construction and injured 12 people , the official Xinhua news agency said Monday .
Huang Wenge , township head of Bujia in the southeastern province of Jiangxi , and colleague Xia Jianzhong were sentenced to 18 months and one year in jail , respectively , for not stopping the project , Xinhua said .
“ Huang Wenge and Xia Jianzhong , who were in charge of road management and supervision , did not ask the contractors to provide certificates guaranteeing their proficiency , ” it said , citing the court ruling .
“ When they knew the bridge was being built by a blind contractor , they did not stop it , ” it said , adding the contractor had changed the blueprint without getting a professional to look at the design .
“ After the blind contractor changed the blueprint , he carried out the work only using a roughly drawn draft of the plan , which caused the bridge to collapse , ” the report said .
Xinhua did not explain how the contractor was able to run the project considering his inability to see .

Introduction
In mathematics , difficult problems can often be simplified by performing a transformation on a data set .
For example , digital signal processing programs use the FFT to convert sets of sampled audio data points to equivalent sets of frequency data .
Pumping up the bass or applying a notch filter is then just a matter of multiplying some frequency data points by a scaling factor .
Perform an inverse FFT on the resulting points , and voila , you have a new audio waveform that has been transformed according to your specifications .
Michael Burrows and David Wheeler recently released the details of a transformation function that opens the door to some revolutionary new data compression techniques .
The Burrows - Wheeler Transform , or BWT , transforms a block of data into a format that is extremely well suited for compression .
It does such a good job at this that even the simple demonstration programs I ’ll present here will outperform state - of - the - art programs .
In this article , I ’ll first present the BWT , and demonstrate its reversibility .
I ’ll then show you how a block of data transformed by the BWT can be compressed using standard techniques .
After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this type of data compression , I ’ll present my simple demonstration program .
And no article on data compression would be complete without the pro forma comparison table , showing how BWT - based compression stacks up against other modern techniques .
The Burrows - Wheeler Transform
Michael Burrows and David Wheeler released a research report in 1994 discussing work they had been doing at the Digital Systems Research Center in Palo Alto , California .
Their paper , “ A Block - sorting Lossless Data Compression Algorithm ” presented a data compression algorithm based on a previously unpublished transformation discovered by Wheeler in 1983 .
While the paper discusses a complete set of algorithms for compression and decompression , the real heart of the paper consists of the disclosure of the BWT algorithm .
BWT Basics
The BWT is an algorithm that takes a block of data and rearranges it using a sorting algorithm .
The resulting output block contains exactly the same data elements that it started with , differing only in their ordering .
The transformation is reversible , meaning the original ordering of the data elements can be restored with no loss of fidelity .
The BWT is performed on an entire block of data at once .
Most of today ’s familiar lossless compression algorithms operate in streaming mode , reading a single byte or a few bytes at a time .
But with this new transform , we want to operate on the largest chunks of data possible .
Since the BWT operates on data in memory , you may encounter files too big to process in one fell swoop .
In these cases , the file must be split up and processed a block at a time .
The demo programs that accompany this article work comfortably with block sizes of 50 K bytes up to 250 Kbytes .
Figure 1 — An sample data set
For purposes of illustration , I ’ll start with a much smaller data set , shown in Figure 1 .
This string contains seven bytes of data .
In order to perform the BWT , the first thing we do is treat a string S , of length N , as if it actually contains N different strings , with each character in the original string being the start of a specific string that is N bytes long .
( In this case , the word string does n’t have the C/C++ semantics of being a null terminated set of characters .
A string is just a collection of bytes . )
We also treat the buffer as if the last character wraps around back to the first .
Figure 2 — The set of strings associated with the buffer
It ’s important to remember at this point that we do n’t actually make N - 1 rotated copies of the input string .
In the demonstration program , we just represent each of the strings by a pointer or an index into a memory buffer .
The next step in the BWT is to perform a lexicographical sort on the set of input strings .
That is , we want to order the strings using a fixed comparison function .
This means we should compare using a function similar to the C functions strcmp ( ) or memcmp ( ) .
In this high level view of the algorithm the comparison function has to be able to wrap around when it reaches the end of the buffer , so a slightly modified comparison function would be needed .
After sorting , the set of strings is arranged as shown in Figure 3 .
There are two important points to note in this picture .
First , the strings have been sorted , but we ’ve kept track of which string occupied which position in the original set .
So , we know that the String 0 , the original unsorted string , has now moved down to row 4 in the array .
Figure 3 — The set of strings after sorting
Second , I ’ve tagged the first and last columns in the matrix with the special designations F and L , for the first and last columns of the array .
Column F contains all the characters in the original string in sorted order .
So our original string “ DRDOBBS ” is represented in F as “ BBDDORS ” .
The characters in column L do n’t appear to be in any particular order , but in fact they have an interesting property .
Each of the characters in L is the prefix character to the string that starts in the same row in column F .
The actual output of the BWT , oddly enough , consists of two things : a copy of column L , and the primary index , an integer indicating which row contains the original first character of the buffer B .
So performing the BWT on our original string generates the output string L which contains “ OBRSDDB ” , and a primary index of 5 .
The integer 5 is found easily enough since the original first character of the buffer will always be found in column L in the row that contains S1 .
Since S1 is simply S0 rotated left by a single character position , the very first character of the buffer is rotated into the last column of the matrix .
Therefore , locating S1 is equivalent to locating the buffer ’s first character position in L .
Two obvious questions
At this point in the exposition , there are two obvious questions .
First , it does n’t seem possible that this is a reversible transformation .
Generally , a sort ( ) function does n’t come with an unsort ( ) partner that can restore your original ordering .
In fact , it is n’t likely that you ’ve ever even considered this as something you might like .
And second , what possible good does this strange transformation do you ?
I ’ll defer the answer to the second question while I explain the reversibility of this transform .
Unsorting column L requires the use of something called the transformation vector .
The transformation vector is an array that defines the order in which the rotated strings are scattered throughout the rows of the matrix of Figure 3 .
The transformation vector , T , is an array with one index for each row in column F .
For a given row i , T[ i ] is defined as the row where S[ i + 1 ] is found .
In Figure 3 , row 3 contains S0 , the original input string , and row 5 contains S1 , the string rotated one character to the left .
Thus , T[ 3 ] contains the value 5 . S2 is found in row 2 , so T [ 5 ] contains a 2 .
For this particular matrix , the transformation vector can be calculated to be { 1 , 6 , 4 , 5 , 0 , 2 , 3 } .
Figure 4 — The transformation vector routes S[ i ] to S[ i + 1 ]
Figure 4 shows how the transformation vector is used to walk through the various rows .
For any row that contains S[ i ] , the vector provides the value of the row where S[ i + 1 ] is found .
The Rosetta Vector
The reason the transformation vector is so important is that it provides the key to restoring L to its original order .
Given L and the primary index , you can restore the original S0 .
For this example , the following code does the job :
int T [ ] = { 1 , 6 , 4 , 5 , 0 , 2 , 3 } ; char L [ ] = " OBRSDDB " ; int primary_index = 5 ; void decode ( ) { int index = primary_index ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 7 ; i ++ ) { cout << L [ index ] ; index = T [ index ] ; } }
You can get there from here
So now we come to the core premise of the Burrows - Wheeler transform : given a copy of L , you can calculate the transformation vector for the original input matrix .
And consequently , given the primary index , you can recreate S0 , or the input string .
The key that makes this possible is that calculating the transformation vector requires only that you know the contents of the first and last columns of the matrix .
And believe it or not , simply having a copy of L means that you do , in fact , have a copy of F as well .
Figure 5 — The known state of the matrix given L
Given just the copy of L , we do n’t know much about the state of the matrix .
Figure 5 shows L , which I ’ve moved into the first column for purposes of illustration .
In this figure , F is going to be in the next column .
And fortunately for us , F has an important characteristic : it contains all of the characters from the input string in sorted order .
Since L also contains all the same characters , we can determine the contents of F by simply sorting L !
Figure 6 — The known state after recovering F
Now we can start working on calculating T .
The character ‘ O ’ in row 0 clearly moves to row 4 in column F , which means T[ 4 ] = 0 .
But what about row 1 ?
The ‘ B ’ could match up with either the ‘ B ’ in row 0 or row 1 .
Which do we select ?
Fortunately , the choice here is not ambiguous , although the decision making process may not be intuitive .
Remember that by definition , column F is sorted .
This means that all the strings beginning with ‘ B ’ in column L also appear in sorted order .
Why ?
They all start with the same character , and they are sorted on their second character , by virtue of their second characters appearing in column F .
Since by definition the strings in F must appear in sorted order , it means that all the strings that start with a common character in L appear in the same order in F , although not necessarily in the same rows .
Because of this , we know that the ‘ B ’ in row 1 of L is going to move up to row 0 in F .
The ‘ B ’ in row 6 of L moves to row 1 of F .
Once that difficulty is cleared , it ’s a simple matter to recover the transformation matrix from the two columns .
And once that is done , recovering the original input string is short work as well .
Simply applying the C++ code shown earlier does the job .
The Punchline
The whole point to this BWT exercise is supposed be better data compression , so let ’s take a look at how this works .
Figure 7 shows a snippet of debug output taken from the test program BWT .
CPP .
Each line of output shows a prefix character followed by a sorted string .
The prefix character is actually what is found in column L after the strings have been sorted .
t : hat acts like this : < 13 >< 10 >< 1 t : hat buffer to the constructor t : hat corrupted the heap , or wo W : hat goes up must come down < 13 t : hat happens , it is n't likely w : hat if you want to dynamicall t : hat indicates an error .
< 13 >< 1 t : hat it removes arguments from t : hat looks like this : < 13 >< 10 >< t : hat looks something like this t : hat looks something like this t : hat once I detect the mangled
Figure 7 — Debug output from BWT.CPP
This section of output consists of a group of sorted strings that all start with the characters “ hat ” .
Not surprisingly , the prefix character for almost all of these strings is a lower case ‘t ’ .
There are also a couple of appearances of the letter ‘w ’ .
Anytime you see repetition like this , you clearly have an opportunity for data compression .
Sorting all of the strings gives rise to a set of prefix characters that has lots of little clumps where characters repeat .
Using the opportunity
We could take the output of the BWT and just apply a conventional compressor to it , but Burrows and Wheeler suggest an improved approach .
They recommend using a Move to Front scheme , followed by an entropy encoder .
A Move to Front ( or MTF ) encoder is a fairly trivial piece of work .
It simply keeps all 256 possible codes in a list .
Each time a character is to be output , you send its position in the list , then move it to the front .
In the above example , column L might start with the following sequence : “ tttWtwttt ” .
If we encode that using an MTF scheme , we would output the following integers : { 116 , 0 , 0 , 88 , 1 , 119 , 1 , 0 , 0 } .
If the output of the BWT operation contains a high proportion of repeated characters , we can expect that applying the MTF encoder will give us a file filled with lots of zeros , and heavily weighted towards the lowest integers .
At that point , the file can finally be compressed using an entropy encoder , typically a Huffman or arithmetic encoder .
The example programs that accompany this article use an adaptive order - 0 arithmetic encoder as the final step of the process .
And the winner is
Using the BWT as a front end for data compression has a result similar to that of simple statistical modeling programs .
An order -n statistical model simply uses the previous n characters to predict the value of the next character in a string .
Compression programs based on statistical modeling can give good results , at the expense of high memory requirements .
The BWT in effect uses the entire input string as its context .
But instead of using a preceding run of characters to model the output , it uses the string following a character as a model .
Because of the sorting method used , characters hundreds of bytes downstream can have an effect on the ordering of the BWT output .
This characteristic of the BWT has another side effect .
It means that in general , the bigger the block size , the better the compression .
As long as the data set is homogenous , bigger blocks will generate longer runs of repeats , leading to improved compression .
Of course , the sorting operations needed at the front end of the BWT will usually have O( N * log ( N ) ) performance , meaning bigger blocks might slow things down considerably .
( Although Burrows and Wheeler point out that a suffix tree sort can be done in linear time and space . )
Programmers today might also be impressed by the fact that the BWT is apparently not covered by any software patents .
I asked Burrows and Wheeler if any patents had been initiated by DEC , and both indicated not .
Since this algorithm was published in 1994 , it may mean the technique is in the public domain .
( Consult an attorney ! )
Even if the BWT is in the public domain , programmers need to be careful when selecting an entropy encoder for the final stage of compression .
Arithmetic coding offers excellent compression , but is covered by quite a few patents .
Huffman coding is slightly less efficient , but seems less likely to provoke intellectual property fights .
A Reference Implementation
One of the nice things about BWT compression is that it ’s easy to isolate each step of the process .
I took advantage of that when writing the demo programs to accompany this article .
The compression and decompression processes will consist of running several programs in sequence , piping the output of one program to the input of another , and repeating until the process is complete .
Compressing a file using the demo programs is done using the following command line :
RLE input - file | BWT | MTF | RLE | ARI > output - file
A brief description of each of the programs follows :
RLE.CPP
This program implements a simple run-length encoder .
If the input file has many long runs of 3 identical characters , the sorting procedure in the BWT can be degraded dramatically .
The RLE front end prevents that from happening .
BWT.CPP
The standard Burrows - Wheeler transform is done here .
This program outputs repeated blocks consisting of a block size integer , a copy of L , the primary index , and a special last character index .
This is repeated until BWT.EXE runs out of input data .
MTF.CPP
The Move to Front encoder operates as described in the previous section .
RLE.CPP
The fact that the output file is top - heavy with runs containing zeros means that applying another RLE pass to the output can improve overall compression .
I believe that further processing of the MTF output will provide fertile ground for additional improvements .
ARI.CPP
This is an order - 0 adaptive arithmetic encoder , directly derived from the code published by Witten and Cleary in their 1987 CACM article .
The output of the compressor can be decompressed by applying the same algorithms in reverse .
The command line that accomplishes this is :
UNARI input - file | UNRLE | UNMTF | UNBWT | UNRLE > output - file
Each of the programs here has a one - to - one correspondence with its namesake from the compression section .
The 10 source files that make up this program suite are all fairly short , and their inner workings should be fairly clear .
The most complicated programs are the arithmetic encoder and decoder , which are well documented elsewhere .

The corpus is a set of 18 files with varying characteristics that can be found at :

Table 1 — Mandatory Comparison of Results
As Table 1 shows , this demonstration program manages to compete pretty well with the compression offered by PKWare ’s commercial product , PKZip .
I consider this particularly encouraging in light of the fact that there should be plenty of headroom left for tweaking additional percentage points from my code .

The Burrows - Wheeler Transform : Theory and Practice ( 1999 ) Giovanni Manzini
For two generations of physicists , it has been a standard belief that the neutron , an electrically neutral elementary particle and a primary component of an atom , actually carries a positive charge at its center and an offsetting negative charge at its outer edge .
The notion was first put forth in 1947 by Enrico Fermi , a Nobel laureate noted for his role in developing the first nuclear reactor .
But new research by a University of Washington physicist shows the neutron 's charge is not quite as simple as Fermi believed .
Using precise data recently gathered at three different laboratories and some new theoretical tools , Gerald A. Miller , a UW physics professor , has found that the neutron has a negative charge both in its inner core and its outer edge , with a positive charge sandwiched in between to make the particle electrically neutral .
" Nobody realized this was the case , " Miller said .
" It is significant because it is a clear fact of nature that we did n't know before .
Now we know it . "
The discovery changes scientific understanding of how neutrons interact with negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons .
Specifically , it has implications for understanding the strong force , one of the four fundamental forces of nature ( the others are the weak force , electromagnetism and gravity ) .
The strong force binds atomic nuclei together , which makes it possible for atoms , the building blocks of all matter , to assemble into molecules .

" We have to understand exactly how the strong force works , because it is the strongest force we know in the universe , " Miller said .
The findings are based on data collected at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News , Va. , the Bates Linear Accelerator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Mainz Microtron at Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany .
The three labs examine various aspects of the properties and behavior of subatomic particles , and Miller studied data they collected about neutrons .
His analysis was published online Sept. 13 in Physical Review Letters .
The work was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy .
Since the analysis is based on data gathered from direct observations , the picture could change even more as more data are collected , Miller said .
" A particle can be electrically neutral and still have properties related to charge .
We 've known for a long time that the neutron has those properties , but now we understand them more clearly , " he said .

He noted that the most important aspect of the finding confirms that a neutron carries a negative charge at its outer edge , a key piece of Fermi 's original idea .
The strong force that binds atomic nuclei is related to nuclear energy and nuclear weapons , and so it is possible the research could have practical applications in those areas .
It also could lend to greater understanding of the interactions that take place in our sun 's nuclear furnace , and a greater understanding of the strong force in general , Miller said .
" We already know that without the strong force you would n't have atoms -- or anything else that follows from atoms , " he said .
This research was published online Sept. 13 in Physical Review Letters .

New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is raising the eyebrows of defense attorneys over his recently exposed plans to pay the controversial anti-piracy firm MediaDefender to gather evidence for child - porn prosecutions .
A law enforcement partnership with the peer - to - peer policing company raises questions about possible conflicts of interest and the integrity and security of evidence collected for criminal prosecutions , say attorneys .
" Generally it is not looked upon favorably when a prosecutor engages a private company to collect evidence in a case or to ... partner with in a criminal case , " says San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi .
" This raises grave ethical concerns regarding the propriety of that relationship between the prosecuting authority and the private company , and it also could potentially show favoritism toward that company in the future , " if the company broke a different law in New York and faced prosecution by the attorney general 's office .
MediaDefender , a peer - to - peer policing firm that works with the entertainment industry to thwart the illegal trading of copyright works , became the target of hackers who stole and recently posted more than 6,000 of the company 's internal e-mails online , along with a database , source code for its file - sharing tools and a recorded phone call between a MediaDefender employee and investigators with the New York attorney general 's office .
The e-mails and the recorded phone call revealed that the attorney general 's office planned to outsource certain steps in its evidence - collection process against New York child - porn violators to MediaDefender , a company based in Santa Monica , California .
Few specifics are known about the project , and MediaDefender did not return several phone calls seeking comment .
The New York attorney general 's office will not speak on the record about it .
But according to the e-mails , MediaDefender planned to unleash a peer - to - peer crawler to search unspecified file - sharing networks for child - porn videos and images based on keywords – such as " young , " " kids " and " taboo " – provided by the AG 's office .
Once suspected image files were found , the software would collect the IP address of the machines trading those files and filter for any addresses based in New York .
The data MediaDefender collected would then be sent automatically to the AG 's office , where investigators would analyze and investigate it , using a MediaDefender application to visit the IP addresses and download the suspect files .
It 's unclear whether MediaDefender planned to download the suspected - child porn itself , or leave that to the AG 's investigators .
Jeffrey Lerner , spokesman for the New York AG 's office , refused to comment on the record about whether MediaDefender was downloading child porn , due to " an ongoing investigation . "
If the company knowingly downloaded child porn , it could run afoul of federal law , notwithstanding any arrangement it made with state authorities , legal experts say .
Either way , several defense attorneys expressed surprise that a law enforcement agency would outsource any evidence collection to a private company .
" It is bizarre , " says Martin Pinales , former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
" What they 're doing is saying , ' We 're going to make you a bounty hunter .
We 're going to pay you to go collect evidence so that in the future we can prosecute somebody . '
But ( MediaDefender does n't ) have the training of law enforcement . "
Jeffrey Douglas , a criminal defense attorney in Santa Monica , California , finds other aspects of the MediaDefender law enforcement partnership disturbing .
A private company that 's under contract to collect information for law enforcement investigators has a financial incentive to produce results , he says .
" At the end of the contract , if they have n't made ' x ' number of cases , are they going to lose their contract ? " he asks .
" The company knows there are certain expectations that they 're going to accomplish , or they 're not going to get another contract . "
He also expressed concern about what could be described as a fishing expedition to net as many suspects as possible using less - than - accurate tools .
The e-mails between MediaDefender and the AG 's office , for example , discuss sending the AG 1 gigabyte of " media data " daily , along with " a couple thousand New York IPs that our geo IP database identified using our software . "
An initial test MediaDefender conducted for the AG 's office produced " a lot of false positives , " according to one of the exposed e-mails .
" No software can determine whether a person ( in a picture ) is 17 or 18 , " Douglas says , so there are bound to be a lot of innocent IP addresses collected by MediaDefender and sent to the AG , before further investigation weeds out innocent suspects from actual lawbreakers .
San Francisco public defender Adachi says the relationship also conceivably gives MediaDefender the power to decide whom to collect evidence against and whom to let go .
" Say I ... find a web site that 's run by my sister - in - law and decide that , ' Geez , I 'm not going to turn that over , ' " Adachi says .
" There 's no sworn duty by the private company ( collecting evidence for law enforcement ) to prosecute people in a fair , evenhanded manner . "
On top of all these concerns is the issue of data security and the integrity of evidence against manipulation by intruders – either inside or outside the company – particularly in light of the hack of MediaDefender 's internal e-mail .
Of course , evidence on a law enforcement computer is at the same risk of being accessed and altered , but the e-mail breach at MediaDefender makes the danger all the more glaring .
" It is extremely difficult to protect the material under the best of circumstances , " Douglas says .
" The more computers it passes through and separate control centers that it passes through , the less likely it is that the integrity of the material will be maintained . "
In the phone call between MediaDefender and the AG 's office , an AG investigator tells MediaDefender that the " intelligence information " MediaDefender is sending them needs to be able to stand up in court , and that the AG needs to know that there 's no chance that the data coming from MediaDefender was compromised , edited or modified .
Then there 's the question of MediaDefender 's own trustworthiness .
Legal experts says the biggest risk for prosecutors in using a private company like MediaDefender to aid in catching child pornographers is that the company 's stock - in - trade is deception :
It specializes in introducing decoy " pirated " content onto file - sharing networks .
A blogger even discovered in July that the company was secretly operating a video - download site called MiiVi – apparently as another way of injecting decoy files and tracking downloaders .
The hacked e-mails show the company tried unsuccessfully to hide its connection with the site , and even relaunched it under another name after it was exposed .
Mark Rasch , a former Justice Department cybercrime lawyer and current managing director of technology for FTI Consulting , says if he were defending a child - porn suspect against evidence produced by a law enforcement agency that worked with MediaDefender , he would raise an obvious question .
" How do we know that MediaDefender did n't put these files on the computer first ? " he says .
Byron Calame , public editor of the New York Times , has laid out a carefully worded exposé of the utter breakdown of editorial standards at the New York Times .
The fact that paper prominently published a falsehood is only the beginning of the problem .
When the falsehood was exposed , two senior editors of the paper issued a defense of the article without bothering to check the readily available court documents which critics had cited .
Based on this negligent defense , the newspaper 's publisher , Pinch Sulzberger , has rebutted critics who have written in .
Worst of all , even after the proof of the lie , the paper 's editor and publisher refuse to publish a correction or even an editor 's note .
The paper is therefore content to let the lie stand , officially .
If it were interested in honest reporting , it would be duty - bound to issue a retraction , one as prominent as the original lie .
This situation is functionally equivalent to the behavior of Dan Rather , who has never admitted that the Texas Air National Guard memorandum he broadcast about George W. Bush is a forgery .
Of course , Dan Rather eventually lost his job .
The miscreants at the New York Times , standards editor (! )
Craig Whitney and New York Times Magazine editor Gerald Marzorati , continue in their jobs .
And publisher Pinch Sulzberger blissfully continues to occupy the top job he inherited as scion of the family which controls the corporation , despite owning less than 10 % of its shares , thanks to a dual class system of electing directors .
Here is what happened :
The New York Times Magazine published a 7,800 word cover story on April 9 , 2006 about El Salvador 's treatment of abortion as a crime .
If ever a topic existed that would excite feminist pro-abortion rights advocates , this is it .
The story was authored by " freelance " multiple - contributor Jack Hitt , who also writes for Harpers Magazine , and is a contributor to public radio program This American Life .
Hitt is a member in good standing of elite left wing journalistic circles .
Consider this " teach in " on Gitmo , where he is identified institutionally with the New York Times .
As every editor and journalist knows , a good story needs vivid people to whom readers can relate to illustrate its points .
The Hitt - man found just such a person : a young woman named Carmen Climaco , who was supposedly sentenced to a 30 year prison term for aborting an 18 week old fetus .
What could be more poignant to an abortion militant than a poor woman languishing in a Third World jail , for a crime that is labeled a constitutional right under Roe v. Wade ?
Reading about it , the average NOW member would instinctively reach for her checkbook , fearing that we are one Supreme Court justice away from a similar fate in America .
Left wing media gobbled up the story .
For example :
This Sunday 's New York Times Magazine cover story will be a profile of a nation 8 years into the complete and total criminalization of abortion .
No rape clause , no life of the mother clause .
Nothing .
Air America 's Rachel Maddow ( if you do n't listen to her you do n't know what you 're missing ) interviews one of my favorite journalists Jack Hitt on his cover story ( click orange buttons to listen or download ) .
What you find is a nation in a near - Handmaid 's
Tale dystopia where a mother of three is imprisoned for 30 years , where a woman must wait until her ectopic pregnancy bursts in her fallopian tubes to get surgery , where the mother of a pregnant woman can be prosecuted for giving aid and comfort to her daughter before , during or after an illegal abortion .
The title of this post ?
The folks who check vaginas for evidence of an abortion procedure .
It 's real .
Absolutely chilling .
After you listen to the interview here , please go listen to Rachel Maddow every morning here .
( Rachel Maddow )
The problem is that Ms. Climaco was in prison not for doing something that is legal in the United States .
In fact , she murdered her baby after its birth following a full term pregnancy .
When an autopsy was performed , the baby 's lung floated , indicating that the baby had drawn breath .
Under the same circumstances , the death would be labeled a homicide in the United States .
So how did the New York Times publish a high profile cover story based on a lie ?
Calame writes :
Mr. Hitt used an unpaid translator who has done consulting work for Ipas , an abortion rights advocacy group , for his interviews with Ms. Climaco and D.C.
This was n't ideal , he said , but the risk posed for sources in this situation required the use of intermediaries " to some degree . "
Ipas has used the NYTM cover story to raise money , as Calame notes .
The Hitt - piece never referenced any court documents .
Calame continues :
Mr. Hitt said Ms. Climaco had been brought to his attention by the magistrate who decided four years ago that the case warranted a trial , so he had asked the magistrate for the court record .
" When she told me that the case had been archived , I accepted that to mean that I would have to rely upon the judge who had been directly involved in the case and who heard the evidence " in the trial stage of the judicial process , Mr. Hitt wrote in an e-mail to me .
So he did n't pursue the document .
This is egregiously lame as an excuse .
Calame notes that :
Although Sarah H. Smith , the magazine 's editorial manager , told me that relevant court documents are " normally " reviewed , Mr. Hitt never checked the 7,600 - word ruling in the Climaco case while preparing his story .
And Mr. Hitt told me that no editor or fact checker ever asked him if he had checked the court document containing the panel 's decision .
Apparently Ms. Smith and Magazine editor Marzorati regarded the story as " too good to check " in the old Fleet Street adage .
Violating policy to publish something guaranteed to inflame abortion - rights enthusiasts does n't seem to bother them .
Exactly how difficult would it have been to check ?
Again , Calame has done his homework :
...obtaining the public document is n't difficult .
At my request , a stringer for The Times in El Salvador walked into the court building without making any prior arrangements a few days ago , and minutes later had an official copy of the court ruling .
The Times apparently became aware of the lie it had published at least a month ago :
...anti-abortion Web site , LifeSiteNews.com , reported on Nov. 27 that the court had found that Ms. Climaco 's pregnancy ended with a full - term live birth .
The headline : " New York Times Caught in Abortion - Promoting Whopper - Infanticide Portrayed as Abortion . "
Seizing on the misleading presentation of the article 's only example of a 30 - year jail sentence for an abortion , the site urged viewers to complain to the publisher and the president of The Times .
A few came to me .
But when readers wrote in to complain , the paper 's editorial quality - assurance mechanisms went into stonewall mode .
The initial complaints triggered a public defense of the article by two assistant managing editors before the court ruling had even been translated into English ....
The response said that while the " fair and dispassionate " story noted Ms. Climaco 's conviction of aggravated homicide , the article " concluded that it was more likely that she had had an illegal abortion . "
The response ended by stating , " We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the facts as reported in our article , which was not part of any campaign to promote abortion . "
No reason to doubt ?
This is an astonishingly damning admission .
A " standards " editor who does not bother checking original sources , and who tolerates the use of advocates as translators is not interested in objectivity .
One who fails to bother with this essentials in the face of criticism is incompetent in the most charitable intrepretation .
If Mr. Whitney does not lose his job over this admission , then the New York Times is publicly acknowledging that it is happy to be a conduit for lies which serve as propaganda .
Calame even confronts NYTM editor Marzorati with the translation of the court document proving the publication of a lie .
His e-mail response seemed to ignore the ready availability of the court document containing the findings from the trial before the three - judge panel and its sentencing decision .
He referred to it as the " third ruling , " since the trial is the third step in the judicial process .
The article was " as accurate as it could have been at the time it was written , " Mr. Marzorati wrote to me .
" I also think that if the author and we editors knew of the contents of that third ruling , we would have qualified what we said about Ms. Climaco .
Which is NOT to say that I simply accept the third ruling as ‘ true ' ; El Salvador 's judicial system is terribly politicized . "
I asked Mr. Whitney if he intended to suggest that the office of the publisher bring the court 's findings to the attention of those readers who received the " no reason to doubt " response , or that a correction be published .
The latest word from the standards editor : " No , I 'm not ready to do that , nor to order up a correction or Editors ' Note at this point . "
Unfortunately , this case lacks a household name figure like Dan Rather , and it is being exposed in the deadest of news holes , following Saddam 's execution and the funeral of President Ford , and right before New Year 's revelry .
But it does stand as proof that top editorial and corporate management of the New York Times is indifferent to the publication of blatant lies , as long as the prejudices of its staff and readers are being reinforced .
Calame has distinguished himself here .
He is highly diplomatic in his criticisms , but the facts he lays out speak for themselves .
This is major journalistic scandal , not so much for the initial error ( bad as it is , especially the reliance on advocates for basic translation services ) but for the stonewalling which has followed revelations of the lie .
It is one thing to be sloppy , even unethical in journalistic practice , using biased sources as translators .
It is quite another to stonewall in the face of facts .
The New York Times has hit bottom , and continues digging .
Buddhist monks command great respect in Burma
Mr Bush seems poised to impose a US visa ban and financial restrictions on members of the government .
The move comes after eight days of increasingly popular protests against the junta led by Buddhist monks .
The junta , which violently repressed protests in 1988 , said it was ready to " take action " against the monks .
Mr Bush is expected to announce the new restrictions during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale , in Washington , says the US has already made clear that it is preparing to take unilateral action against Burma 's military dictators .
Washington is also hoping that its steps will encourage other nations to act and embolden the protesters on Burma 's streets , he adds .
On Monday Brig Gen Thura Myint Maung , Burma 's minister for religion , warned marchers not to break Buddhist " rules and regulations " .
PROTESTS MOUNT 15 Aug : Junta doubles fuel prices , sparking protests 5 Sept : Troops injure several monks at a protest in Pakokku 17 Sept :
The junta 's failure to apologise for the injuries draws fresh protests by monks 18 - 21 Sept : Daily marches by monks in Burmese cities gradually gather in size 22 Sept : 1,000 monks march to the home of Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon 23 Sept : Up to 20,000 march in Rangoon 24 Sept : New Rangoon march draws at least 50,000 and 24 other towns join in

He blamed the protests on " destructive elements " opposed to peace in Burma .
The military government has so far showed restraint against the protests .
Monks are highly revered in Burma and correspondents say any move by the junta to crush their demonstrations would spark an outcry .
But there are fears of a repeat of 1988 , correspondents say , when the last democracy uprising was crushed by the military and some 3,000 people were killed .
Some monks ' representatives had called for the entire country to join them in their campaign to overthrow the government , which began eight days ago .
Monday saw marches in at least 25 towns and cities , including Mandalay , Sittwe and Pakokku .
Turnout estimates in Rangoon , Burma 's biggest city , ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 .
State television said the demonstrations of the past week were being fomented by communists and exiled media and student groups .
Dalai Lama appeal
The BBC's Asia correspondent , Andrew Harding , described Monday 's marches as a show of defiance unthinkable just a few weeks ago .
Five columns of monks , one reportedly stretching for more than 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) , entered the city centre to cheers and applause from thousands of bystanders .
Civilians who joined in included officials from the opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party , led by Aung San Suu Kyi .
The authorities are likely to be under huge pressure from their close neighbour China to avoid bloodshed and instability , our correspondent notes .
The European Union has urged the junta to show the " utmost restraint " in dealing with the protests and to take the opportunity to " launch a process of real political reform " .
The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has given his backing to the monks ' call for freedom and democracy .
UK Ambassador Mark Canning said Burma 's leaders were now in uncharted territory but expressed concern about a possible government counter - reaction .
Detained leader
A hard - core group of more than 1,000 of the maroon - robed monks and 400 sympathisers went to Aung San Suu Kyi's street at the end of Monday 's march , the Associated Press reported .
They chanted a prayer for peace in the face of the riot police blocking access to her home , where she is under house arrest , before dispersing peacefully .
Monks have been urging Burmese people to hold 15 - minute evening prayer vigils .
The organisation that has emerged to lead the protests , the Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks , has vowed to continue marches until it has " wiped the military dictatorship from the land " .
The protests were triggered by the government 's decision to double the price of fuel last month , hitting people hard in the impoverished nation .

I 'm a University student from Mandalay .
I think Mandalay needs a leader as people are very afraid .
But they want to get freedom .
Now I saw 10,000 monks and a number of other people .
Juee , Mandalay
I witnessed the big protests in Rangoon today .
I am really sorry for our country and our people because we are under the control of the wicked junta .
We have n't got arms , we wish for peace , a better future and democracy .
We are hoping that the UN security council will put a pressure on the junta .
Kyi Kyi , Rangoon
I saw more than 100,000 monks march to 8 - mile junction , from south to north , I 'm not sure where they lead to .
This situation could be worse more if junta could n't control softly .
We want some changes in Burma , but we want these changes leading to good ways .
I can say surely that killing the monks is insulting the Buddhism religious .
Sun , Rangoon
I saw about 40,000 to 50,000 people , including monks , nuns and ordinary people , marching along Prome road .
That was at around 3:30 pm .
The protests will grow bigger day by day and I hope that they are not going to start killing people .
We need help to save our people .
Mr Tun , Rangoon
It is astounding to see such a great mass of people on both sides of the roads , some clapping and some crying , but all demonstrating their support for the monks and those chanting prayers .
It 's for sure that all these people showing their support are willing to be part of the mass protest .
They do not trust the government though and think that they could be crushed , just like it happened in 1988 .
But if we are just bystanders , today 's rare and momentous events might not lead to the fall of the regime .
Kyaw , Rangoon
I am not sure where these protests are going to lead to , but I am sure that it 's not at all a good sign .
Many people are expecting that there will be a great change coming soon .
I am not sure if the monks will be joined by students , workers , or even soldiers .
We are very insecure because we do n't know what the government is planning to do .
There are some news in the government - controlled newspapers that the monks are trying to agitate the public .
This can be a big excuse for them to start attacking the monks .
I really want some changes in Burma but I am not sure where the change is going to lead us to .
I hope there wo n't be any blood - bath this time like there was in 1988 .
Soe Soe , Mandalay
We need a little reason to combine all opposition resources into one mass movement .
This reason must be a political issue .
The current situation can lead to a civil war because hardline junta still holds the power and the opposition might use this opportunity to form an armed struggle .
After 1988 , many activists , including students , ran to the border and took up the arms against the government .
This time we want things to change peacefully , not through a civil war .
But if there 's no way to avoid the arms struggle , the people will choose it and the conditions in our poor country may become worse .
The international pressure , including from China and Russia , is very important for the future of Burma at this moment .
Mg Khar , Rangoon
One of the monks who took part in the protests came to us and told us about his experiences .
He said : " We are not afraid , we have n't committed a crime , we just say prayers and take part in the protests .
We have n't accepted money from onlookers although they offered us a lot .
We just accept water .
People clapped , smiled and cheered us . "
The monk seemed very happy , excited and proud .
But I 'm worried for them .
They care for us and we pray for them not to get harmed .
Mya , Rangoon
One reason why the generals are hesitating , may not be merely reverence .
Spiritually speaking , if one is a Buddhist , one will clearly know that one of Buddhist 's big sin is the physical harming of a monk who had taken the vow .
Such bodily harm of a monk will carry the worst penalty of sufferance in hell .
From the perspective of a devout Buddhist nation , that maybe the reason for the junta 's unwillingness to act , hoping the march will fizzle out on its own .

Colbert :
We do n't need another 9/11 , we need re-runs David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 14 , 2007
Print This Email This Stephen Colbert commented this week on various manifestations of the sixth anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center .
He began with a Philadelphia Daily News editorial titled " To save America , we need another 9/11 , " in which columnist Stu Bykofsky suggested that future targets for al Qaeda might include " the Golden Gate Bridge , Mount Rushmore , Chicago 's Wrigley Field . "
" Do not be so humble , Mr. Bykofsky . " stated Colbert .
" You are clearly enough of a patriot that your house belongs on that list . "
" Call me crazy , " Colbert continued , " but I do n't think we need another attack to re-establish post - 9/11 unity . "
He recommended instead the example of MSNBC 's unedited re-airing of three hours of its original 9/11 coverage .
" Thank you , MSNBC ! " said Colbert .
" We have all wanted to re-live that morning .
Watching every horrific moment over my banana smoothie was a rare opportunity to re-experience the emotions of that day , emotions that brought us together .
Six years later , we have turned against each other and lost sight of the ones who attacked us : Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction . "
Colbert then suggested that to really bring the nation together , MSNBC needed to continue similar rebroadcasts for another 14 months .
" MSNBC would rebroadcast January 20 , 2003 on January 20 , 2009 , President Bush 's last day in office .
That means our president would leave on a high .
No matter what his poll numbers were in reality , on tv he'd still be our unquestionable leader , just two months shy of launching Operation Iraqi Freedom .
We would be so re-confident of our ability to win that war in 100 hours and pay for it with oil revenues that whoever the next president is will have no trouble extending it for another six years . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Colbert Report , broadcast on September 12 , 2007 .
Smallpox is older than thought , according to results of a new technique reported in the Sept. 24 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by researchers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) .
The researchers created a molecular clock by looking at the rate of random mutations in the smallpox - causing virus collected in 47 locations around the world , from 1946 -- 1977 .
The variation between the strains was compared to sequences from the most similar animal poxes .
The results indicated that a mild and more severe strain diverged either 16,000 or 68,000 years before present , depending on whether accounts from East Asia or Africa are used to calibrate the molecular clock .
In either case , this divergence stretches further back in time than previously believed .
The authors compare hypotheses about where and when strains of the virus evolved .
No one hypotheses is ruled out , but an ancient origin seems most plausible since the slowly evolving virus now exclusively infects humans , implying that any intermediate link to an animal host has long since died out .
Collaboration between LLNL's Pathogen Bioinformatics group and the CDC's Sequencing and Poxvirus groups took place under a Memorandum of Understanding between the Laboratory and the CDC initiated in early 2003 .
The initial research focused on determining viral signatures by looking at unique genetic characteristics .
The CDC had recently sequenced the genomes of the various smallpox strains , based on the repository it holds for the World Health Organization ( the world 's only other declared smallpox storehouse is in Russia ) .
The disease was considered eradicated in 1980 , three years after the last naturally occurring case in 1977 .
Vaccinations had been stopped in 1972 , following an intensive worldwide effort to wipe out the virus .
Smallpox , in its most severe form , was deadly in up to 30 percent of cases .

The researchers said the correlation of historical record and a molecular clock provides a framework that could be applied to studying the natural history of other diseases .
Although no particular hypotheses of its evolution is supported or disproved , said corresponding author Inger Damon , M.D. , Ph.D. , acting chief of the CDC's Poxvirus and Rabies Branch .
" It shows the delineation of tantalizing potential connections between different isolates . "
Analysis of isolates from geographically dispersed areas indicated that local pools of old , and perhaps ancient , strains existed .
The human disease may have originated from a rodent - borne virus in Africa .
The evolutionary analysis suggests that smallpox disease slowly spread westward from East Asia , which would agree with the oldest smallpox - like descriptions from ancient China as far back as 1122 BC .
It is unclear when it first reached the New World -- some evidence suggests an ancestral virus arrived with early humans and diversified into a mild version there .
The slow spread out of Asia could explain why smallpox descriptions are missing from ancient Greece or Rome as well as the Old and New Testaments .
The Laboratory 's Shea Gardner and CDC's Yu Li devised a way to concentrate point mutations in the viral DNA , single nucleotide polymorphisms , or " SNPs . "
Four nucleotide bases , arranged in varying sequences , spell out the hereditary information encoded in DNA , the genetic material .
As cells multiply and divide , occasional errors creep in to new copies of the genetic instructions .
Some errors are more critical than others .
The variation allows some individuals among the offspring to be better - adapted to changing conditions , providing an evolutionary advantage that is passed down to their progeny .
Over time , some lines flourish and others die out .
For a reliable molecular clock , it would be nice to see the steady rate of mutation in a general sense without a marked effect of change , pro or con , in any particular gene or subset .
So the researchers created a simplified approach for looking across the nearly 200,000 DNA base pairs of the virus genome .
They concentrated the mutations for comparing sequences by excerpting stretches in which a single change at one point was flanked by seven unchanged bases at each side .

" We assumed there was a molecular clock ticking , " Gardner said .
" The question was what was the rate ? "
The Laboratory 's intensive computing capabilities complemented the CDC contribution of calibrating the information with historical accounts , Li said .
" It was a valuable opportunity to be able to compare the genomes , " added Lab scientist Beth Vitalis , who helped analyze the data .
She added that additional , related studies of virulence factors are in process .

When I was a kid , my favorite toys were Legos .
Many a rainy day was spent building planes and spaceships , supercars and battleships , medieval castles and futuristic moon bases .
But I never made anything like this .
Constructed using Lego's Mindstorm Robots , this is an autonomous production line capable of building Lego cars .
It can even select the color of the blocks used .
Consider my little Lego geek mind blown .

No matter how much effort I and we of www.ImpeachforPeace.org put into holding the White House and other corrupt officials accountable , each and every veteran or active duty soldier has the authority in the public eye to have twice the effect I or any other ‘ justice through impeachment for peace ’ activists have regarding Peace and Justice issues around our military in half the time .
As it should be .
How powerful would the anti-war effort have become in a big hurry with Pat Tillman as the nexus along with Cindy Sheehan – bless her Gold Star heart ?
If only Pat Tillman had n’t been hit by enemy fire .
I mean …
If only Pat Tillman had n’t been hit by friendly fire in a firefight .
I mean …
If only Pat Tillman had n’t been hit by friendly fire in a firefight that we have found out did n’t actually take place .
I mean …
If only someone had n’t put three bullets in Pat Tillman ’s head from approximately ten yards away ( what at least one veteran sniper has written looked very much like a hit and two confirmation shots ) , he would have been able to keep the appointment with war critic and fellow intellectual Noam Chomsky that his mother has shared was his plan upon being discharged or upon his next leave / furlough ( I do n’t know the lingo ) .
Tillman was ready to come home and likely would have emerged as the most potent high profile war and Bush Administration critic as a veteran since … well … since John Kerry .
Is a Court Martial movement the best means by which to pick up Tillman ’s weapon of words and action to support and defend the Constitution of the United States from domestic enemies to it ?
I am not the one to say , but if it is , who will be the one they themselves have been waiting for ?
The ‘ new ’ John Kerry wo n’t even invoke the First Amendment to keep you from being tazed for asking the wrong questions , thus supporting with his inaction a student being proscribed for asking questions outside the prescribed parameters of a public hearing .

Well , not the primaries , he won two straw polls .
But there ’s less here than meets the eye .
First let ’s look at Alabama :
Tom Tancredo – 0 ( 0 % )
Sam Brownback – 2 ( .75 % )
John McCain – 2 ( .75 % )
Mike Huckabee – 6 ( 2 % )
Rudy Giuliani – 7 ( 3 % )
Fred Dalton Thompson – 9 ( 3 % )
Duncan Hunter – 10 ( 4 % )
Mitt Romney – 14 ( 5 % )
Ron Paul – 216 ( 81 % )
That ’s right 216 votes out of a total of 266 votes cast .
At it ’s not entirely clear that many of the other candidates were actively seeking support in this straw poll .
While it is impressive to see organization at the grass roots level like this , it ’s not an indication of anything significant .
Then there ’s New Hampshire :
Ron – 208 ( 73 % )
Romney – 26
Huckabee – 20
Tancredo – 8
McCain – 7
Cox – 5
Hunter – 5
Fred Thompson – 3
Giuliani – 3
Brownback – 1
208 votes out of 286 cast .
And , other than Tancredo and Huckabee , Paul was the only candidate who showed up for this straw poll .
As I said while discussing the results of the Iowa Straw Poll last week , polls like this are usually pretty meaningless and are almost never an accurate predictor of the winner of a particular primary , or the nomination .
So , I guess what I ’m saying , is , do n’t let stuff like this lead you to think something significant is happening .
It might , but the evidence just is n’t there yet .
A gharial .
Most of these crocodile - like reptiles have all but disappeared and now only survive in remote stretches of the river .

The fourth of July ; freedom , independence , a day off , fireworks and a good time .
The fourth of July is our statement to the world and to ourselves that we are free .
Free from the tyranny of a King who took away all of our basic human liberties .
Red white and blue , these colors never run , freedom is n’t free , and a million other T - shirt sages have impressed upon us over the years that these freedoms are something we should fight for , cherish , and maintain at all costs .
Should we fear terrorists , or North Korea , or some other shady organization that “ hates us for our freedom ? ”
Seems to me that the biggest threat to our freedom is our own apathy .
Maybe because it wont fit on a bumper sticker , but there is more about maintaining liberty than blowing up terrorist training camps , and imposing economic sanctions on rogue states .
Freedom is a living thing .
It breaths and changes and needs to be cared for .
Like all living things , if deprived of its food it will die .
The food that powers liberty is ironically thought , and rebellion .
We thought we were getting a bad deal from King George , and we rebelled .
A lot of people thought that black people should have the same rights as whites , so they rebelled ( peacefully in most cases ) .
Thought and rebellion keep a free democracy from becoming a dictatorship .
I see a dangerous trend , a trend of apathy , of non-action , of thoughtlessness , of bumper sticker ideology , of sheep like acceptance of the status quo .
If it ai n’t broke do n’t fix it .
The opposite is just as true , something is broke , so we must fix it .
Paris Hilton buys her way out of jail , something no poor person could ever hope to do .
Scooter Libby takes the fall for a corrupt leader and gets away with it , again something no ordinary citizen could do .
Dick Cheney says he is n’t a member of the legislative branch when the legislative branch wants to know about his dealings with his secret energy committee , then he is n’t a member of the executive branch when they want to know about his secret dealings with other things .
Kafka ’s birthday just passed , he would understand this sort of logic .
As trite as it sounds freedom is in fact not free , it comes with duties that every citizen that wishes to enjoy that freedom is expected to preform .
You think your a patriot , you support the troops , you have the magnetic ribbon ?
When was the last time you contacted your senator and let them know how you felt about an issue ?
When was the last time you marched in a protest , how much do you know about current goings on in Washington , in your own state , in your own town ?
Do you read the news ?
If you want to be a good citizen of this country , if you want to thump your chest and say proudly “ I love America ! ” then you need to help weed the garden of freedom every once in a while .
You need to be informed , you need to know what the government is doing ( thought ) , and you need to act ( rebel ) when they act poorly .
The governments job is not to watch itself , thats our job .
We have been doing a pretty poor job the last couple of years .
I see very few marches in the streets , I see no general strikes , I see no flooding of congress with letters , we have let the garden grow out of control , and its time for a severe invasive species removal campaign .
This fourth , as politicians spout platitudes about freedom , terrorism , and the like , remember the only one maintaining you freedom is you .
Government would rather have you be a placid consumer that sits on the couch and absorbs the next episode of whatever , then goes to some big box and buys way more crap than you need , then put it all on a your credit card .
These kind of people are easy to control .
The government would rather you not be a politically active , well informed voting citizen who is not afraid to bother the people in power .
These kind of people are free , and thus harder to control .
You might not see the shackles but they are there , your debt , TV , political double talk , blind patriotism , its all a symptom of your lack of freedom .
As they say , if you are not pissed off you are not paying attention .
This fourth of July , before you go to the party , or before you go see some fireworks , take the time to visit your congress person ’s web page , and drop them an email .
Let them know how you feel , good or bad , with what is going on in the world .
Let them know you are watching them , let them know that they work FOR YOU and that you are checking in to see how they are doing .
Let them know you will be basing you decision to vote for them on how they handle special interest lobby groups , and what they do about the war , or how they handle an issue important to you .
Then let them know that if they do n’t do what you want , you are going to fire them .
Happy fourth of July .
Electronics specialty retailer Best Buy , which announced in April that it would be expanding its Mac pilot program to about 200 stores , has begun fitting some of its higher profile locations with radically improved Apple store - within - a - store concepts .
As can be seen in the photos below , isolated Apple display areas have cropped up near the front of some of the retailer 's computing departments .
A two - foot thick black display wall forms the centerpiece of the layout , packing stereo speakers and an embedded LCD display ( or " mini theater " ) flanked by two glowing Apple logos .
A wooden table , reminiscent of those used in the Cupertino - based Mac makers own retail stores , sits in front of the mini theater .
It 's stocked with iMac , MacBook and MacBook Pro display units .
Power and security cords , like in Apple 's own stores , are channeled through recesses within the tables , reducing clutter and minimizing the appearance of wired connections .
It appears that Apple has even taken measures to jazz up Best Buy 's ancient looking price tags , concealing them with Apple - branded plastic jackets that can be flipped up to reveal product costs , specifications and steeply priced extended warranty options .
Adjacent to the Apple display tables are shelving units that feature matching planograms for both Apple Peripherals and Apple Accessories .
In stock appear to be the usual array of Apple cables , mice , routers and replacement notebook batteries .
Those items are joined by a handful of third party offerings such as Iomega 's MiniMax and Western Digital 's MyBook external hard drives .
Apple and Best Buy have been working to expand the presence of Apple 's Mac line at Best Buy outlets since last Spring .
The initiative began as a 7 - store pilot program on the West Coast and quickly expanded to approximately 50 locations by the Fall .
In April , Best Buy used a quarterly conference call to reveal that it , along with Apple , had decided expand the pilot to approximately 200 of its stores by the fall of 2007 .
Investment bank Morgan Stanley has said that a full expansion of the pilot to all of Best Buy 's stores could generate as much as $ 400 million in additional Mac sales for Apple each year .
A few reminders : Iraq is not our country .
Our invasion and occupation are illegal , being in violation of both international law and our own traditions .
We were lied into war .
We are still being lied to .
Both the Bush administration and the Democrats intend to maintain American troops in Iraq indefinitely .
The catchy little phrase “ If you break it , you own it ” might apply to unpurchased merchandise , but it definitely does not apply to nation - states .
You do n’t gain title to your neighbor ’s house just because you blow it up .
We definitely broke Iraq , but that only gives us the burden of sin .
It does not entitle us to the country .
It ’s easy to forget that when you listen to American politicians in both parties talk about what Iraq has to do or ought to do or should do .
The Iraqi government does not have to do anything we tell it , and so far it has n’t , despite promises to the contrary .
The phrase now being heard most often around Baghdad is “ Iraq is finished . ”
That ’s according to Pepe Escobar , a correspondent for Asia Times Online .
I urgently recommend his piece “ Baghdad : Up Close and Personal . ”
He and two Iraqi journalists toured the “ Red Zone , ” which is all of Baghdad except the heavily fortified Green Zone .
Compare what he saw and heard with what you hear from the talking heads in Washington .
And , by the way , they traveled in a plain car without armored vehicles , troops and helicopters hovering overhead , which is how American big shots travel .
They got shot at and arrested but otherwise survived .
We need to get out of Iraq right now .
This folly has already cost us 3,300 American lives , $ 500 billion in tax money , 30,000 wounded , and there is not so much as a faint glow at the end of the tunnel .
The reason I say both Democrats and Republicans intend a long - term military presence is because that ’s what they say if you listen closely .
The so - called withdrawal deadline of the Democrats stipulates some troops left in country .
To quell an insurgency , if you can do it at all , usually requires about 10 years .
You can see by the casualty figures  overwhelmingly Iraqi  that we are not doing the main fighting .
We lose people daily , but so far in the single digits .
And we will go on losing people no matter what tactics we employ as long as we stay there while the Iraqis fight a civil war .
We can , with our sick devotion to legalese , say it is not an occupation , but the Iraqis call it an occupation , and they do n’t like it worth a toot .
When American politicians say if we leave , there will be chaos , that ’s a joke .
There is chaos there now .
Another joke is that we can democratize the Middle East .
Still another joke is the belief that we can deal with terrorism without solving the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
If I thought the people in Washington were smart enough , I ’d say we intended to destroy the country and leave it in the wreck it is .
I do n’t think they ’re that smart , though .
I think they really believed we could waltz in , topple Saddam Hussein and waltz out .
That ’s what happens when you let a bunch of pointy - headed intellectuals from universities and think tanks set policy .
Only people who have worn muddy boots and heard the sounds of gunfire should be consulted on the issues of war and peace .
Such people are darned scarce in Washington these days , even at the Pentagon .
The present policy sins daily against the Iraqi people , wastes the lives of American military people , adds to the financial burden of future generations and demonstrates to the world that we are a nation led by fools .
IBM Corp. has demonstrated how to perform certain computer functions on single atoms and molecules , a discovery that could someday lead to processors the size of a speck of dust , the company said Thursday .
Researchers at IBM 's Almaden Research Center in California developed a technique for measuring magnetic anisotropy , a property of the magnetic field that gives it the ability to maintain a particular direction .
Being able to measure magnetic anisotropy at the atomic level is a crucial step toward the magnet representing the ones or the zeroes used to store data in binary computer language .
In a second report , researchers at IBM 's lab in Zurich , Switzerland , said they had used an individual molecule as an electric switch that could potentially replace the transistors used in modern chips .
The company published both research reports in Friday 's edition of the journal Science .
The new technologies are at least 10 years from being used for components in commercial products , but the discoveries will allow scientists to take a large step forward in their quest to replace silicon , said IBM spokesman Matthew McMahon .
To build faster , smaller chips , IBM and other chip vendors like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have shrunk the dimensions of chip features from 90 nanometers to 65nm in the current generation of chips and plan to continue to 45nm and 32nm in coming years .
The problem is that wires built from silicon tend to leak more electricity at each step on that scale , and will eventually reach a limit where they are no longer useful .
" Across all our areas of nanotechnology research , we 're trying to determine the new kinds of materials we can use in computing when silicon reaches its fundamental limits .
The ultimate goal is molecular - level computers , but the interim products will probably be hybrids with current technology , using things like carbon nanotubes , " McMahon said .
IBM defines nanotechnology as work done at a scale of 100nm or smaller .
At that scale , scientists must use a tool called the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) to photograph and manipulate individual atoms , as they did in their latest research .
Their next challenge is to find a way to make these laboratory demonstrations work at room temperature , he said .
Having measured the magnetic anisotropy of a single atom , " their next step is finding atoms that can do it at stable temperatures that are suitable for storage devices .
If they can find that , it 's still a decade out from commercialization , " he said .
The Zurich researchers also developed a technique for using a molecule containing two hydrogen atoms as a switch , either on its own or with an adjacent molecule .
They are now looking to apply the method to many other molecules , enabling the system to work as a collection of logic gates , the building blocks of microprocessors .
Even if the teams reach those goals , they must find a way to manufacture the systems on a large scale , instead of moving single atoms with the STM .
One possibility is to use the process of self - assembly , where atoms under certain conditions will naturally form the desired shapes .
In May , IBM said it had used that approach to insulate the wires on a chip by creating trillions of tiny , vacuum - filled holes around each one .
Kucinich : Obama 's ' newfound '
Iraq strategy is ' too little , too late ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidates spent part of Wednesday sniping at each other , beginning with a speech by Senator Barack Obama which alluded to a few of his opponents who voted to authorize the war in Iraq .
Although one target , Senator Hillary Clinton , laid low for the time being , four other Democratic candidates fired back at Obama and also at the former first lady .
" Conventional thinking in Washington lined up for war , " Obama said , in remarks not specifically mentioning Clinton or Edwards , but targeting the Washington political class of which both were prime members .
" Despite -- or perhaps because of how much experience they had in Washington , too many politicians feared looking weak and failed to ask hard questions . "
Obama added , " Let me be clear :
There is no military solution in Iraq and there never was .
The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq 's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops .
Not in six months or one year -- now . "
Obama said if he were president now , he would immediately begin pulling combat troops out of Iraq at the rate of two brigades -- around 4,000 troops -- a month , to be completed by the end of next year .
" Obama joked about making the speech in a city named Clinton , " the Associated Press noted .
" ' I hope the headline when we leave is ' Clinton endorses Obama , '' he said . "
Later in the day , in a press release , Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich challenged Obama 's " newfound " Iraq strategy as " too little , too late , and too politically contrived and convenient to be credible or persuasive . "
The AP article continues , " But two other Democratic candidates , John Edwards and Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd , chastised Obama and Clinton for not pursuing a troop withdrawal vigorously enough .
Another rival , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , called Obama 's plan dangerous and argued that he had dodged the question of how many troops he would leave in the country .
Excerpts from AP article : # Edwards  who has been calling for an immediate withdrawal of 40 - 50,000 troops and a complete withdrawal of all combat troops within nine to 10 months  said Obama 's plan would only " ' begin ' to end this war now . "
" Our young men and women are dying every day for a failed policy .
Every member of Congress who believes this war must end , from Senators Obama and Clinton to ( GOP Sen .
John )
Warner , has a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them , including a filibuster , to force the president to change course , " said Edwards , the former North Carolina senator .
Dodd said he was " disappointed " that Obama " did n't include a firm , enforceable deadline for redeployment , " and dismayed that neither he nor Clinton " will give an unequivocal answer on whether they would support a measure if it did n't have such an enforceable deadline . "
Said Richardson : " Leaving behind tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for an indefinite amount of time is nothing new .
This plan is inadequate and does not end the war . "
# Excerpts from Kucinich 's press release : # Kucinich , the only Democratic Presidential candidate who voted against the original Iraq war authorization in 2002 and every supplemental war appropriation since , said Obama 's announcement today of a " new approach " to Iraq is " sorely wanting at every level . "
" With all due respect to my friend and colleague , his newfound strategy for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq is too little , too late , and too politically contrived and convenient to be credible or persuasive , " Kucinich said .
" While Senator Obama is now struggling mightily to establish himself as the Party 's leading advocate of ending the war and bringing our troops home , until recently , his record shows that he voted for every re-authorization of the war by approving of every additional spending measure placed before him by the Bush Administration .
" He gave one highly publicized and highly promoted speech against the war before he was elected to the U.S. Senate .
But , starting in 2004 , when he was elected to do more than give speeches , his votes show that he bought the lies and paid for the war over and over again .
It was only a few months ago -- when he became a candidate for the Presidency -- that he decided it was politically inconvenient to keep supporting the President , keep supporting the war , and keep supporting the diversion of hundreds of billions of dollars from our crucial domestic priorities .
" The Senator 's call for what 's being described as ' an immediate withdrawal ' is actually an unacceptable , inadequate , and disingenuous campaign tactic that leaves our brave men and women in Iraq at risk and in jeopardy until the end of next year .
They need to come home now .
The war needs to end now .
The Congress needs to stop supporting the President 's failed policies now .
" I welcome the Senator 's late arrival to the debate I began in 2002 when I led the opposition in the Congress to going to war .
I 'm glad that he has finally joined me in a call for more international involvement to stabilize the situation .
I also appreciate his new willingness to support my call for additional spending to help Iraqi citizens whose lives and property have been destroyed by this war .
" After almost three years , the Senator has finally recognized that he has a lot of catching up to do .
What America needs is a leader , not someone who spends years struggling to catch up , " Kucinich concluded .

The general public are worryingly ignorant about the symptoms and risk factors that contribute to serious medical conditions such as stroke and HIV / AIDS , according to a study published in the online open access journal BMC Medicine .
Surprisingly , those with university degrees , a medical background or personal experience of an illness are only slightly better informed .
Lucas M. Bachmann from the University of Zurich , Switzerland and colleagues devised a scale to measure people 's minimal medical knowledge ( MMK ) of heart attack , stroke , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV / AIDS .
This included questions such as : " How can one protect oneself from HIV infection " " and " What are the symptoms of a heart attack " "
It was tested on 185 adults .
The average score was just 32 % , and no one scored 100 % .
The fact that having a university degree , a medical background or personal experience of an illness only slightly improved individual scores is a particular cause for concern , the authors say , and may occur because people prefer to take health - related advice from trustworthy figures in positions of authority , rather than actively seek it themselves .
It is essential that people know the symptoms and risk factors linked to serious clinical conditions since early detection can positively influence treatment outcome , say the authors .
It can also cut related costs and reduce risk - taking behaviour .

Explore further Myths about fentanyl spread more prolifically online than articles correcting them , study finds
A new fingerprinting technique could potentially detect the diet , race and sex of a suspected criminal , according to new research published in the August edition of the journal Analytical Chemistry .
The team , led by Professor Sergei Kazarian from Imperial College London ’s Department of Chemical Engineering , has devised a technique which collects fingerprints along with their chemical residue and keeps them intact for future reference .
Chemical residues contain a few millionths of a gram of fluid and can be found on all fingerprints .
Conventional fingerprinting techniques often distort or destroy vital chemical information with no easy way of lifting residues for chemical imaging , until now .
Imperial scientists found that the use of gel tapes , commercial gelatine based tape , provides a simple method for collection and transportation of prints for chemical imaging analysis .
The prints , once lifted , are analysed in a spectroscopic microscope .
The sample is irradiated with infrared rays to identify individual molecules within the print to give a detailed chemical composition .
The information is then processed by an infrared array detector , originally developed by the U.S. military in smart missile technology .
The array detector chemically maps the residue .
This process builds up a picture , or chemical photograph , and allows for the most comprehensive information obtained from a fingerprint .
“ The combined operational advantages and benefits for forensic scientists of tape lifting prints and spectroscopic imaging really maximises the amount of information one can obtain from fingerprints .
Our trials show that this technique could play a significant role in the fight against crime , ” said Professor Kazarian .
In many cases , this information is enough to determine valuable clues about a person beyond the fingerprint itself .
It could potentially identify traces of items people came in contact with , such as gunpowder , narcotics and biological or chemical weapons .
Chemical clues could also highlight specific traits in a person .
A strong trace of urea , a chemical found in urine , could indicate a male .
Weak traces of urea in a chemical sample could indicate a female .
Specific amino acids could potentially indicate whether the suspect was a vegetarian or meat - eater .
Professor Kazarian believes that this technique could allow forensic scientists to observe how fingerprints change in time and within different environments .
“ By focussing on what is left in a fingerprint after periods of time , scientists could potentially gauge how old a crime scene is .
Studying what happens to prints , when they are exposed to high temperatures , could also be particularly significant , especially in arson cases where lifting prints has been notoriously hard , ” he said .
Speculating about the possible future benefits of this process , Professor Sergei Kazarian said :
“ In the courtroom of the near future , chemical images could feature as key evidence .
I hope our work assists law enforcement authorities to bring dangerous criminals to justice . ”

Anyone who has been in the IT job market in the last few years will have noticed an increasing amount of references to “ people skills ” in job advertisements .
Sometimes recruiters talk up “ soft ” skills when describing the requirements to applicants .
What they mean is beyond technical skills , IT workers are increasingly being expected to have strong communications skills .
In my experience , employers are giving this topic lip service far more than placing real value on this set of skills .
Partly , this is because it can be quite difficult to quantify someone ’s ability to communicate – hence the name “ soft ” skills .
Standard parts of a job description are usually easier to quantify – they are “ hard ” skills .
If you have a degree , this suggests at least a basic level of competency ( whether this is accurate or not is another matter ) ; you can be set standard programming tasks to test your coding skills ; your ability to put together a specification can be evaluated if you ’re an analyst ; your ability to put together a project plan can be tested if you ’re a project manager ; your ability to lie to little old ladies and hurt babies can be tested if you ’re in marketing .
So why are communications skills being focused on in IT roles where this has not traditionally been a prime requisite .
In short , this is one of the biggest problems in the IT industry worldwide .
The breakdown in communication between the business / management side and the IT side derails far more projects than it should .
Competent or even perfect technical execution is no guarantee of success in the corporate world .
If the people side of the equation is not managed then life for IT workers is far harder than it needs to be .
Here ’s the good news : communications skills are easier to learn than IT skills .
I think the reason the burden of communication is being increasingly placed on IT workers is that the non-IT people have hit a dead - end .
IT has become so complex and changes so quickly that business people think they do n’t have a chance of understanding what ’s going on .
They do n’t even know how to ask the right questions .
Taking on this role should n’t be seen as an additional burden by IT workers .
This is a golden opportunity .
A chance to drive IT decisions in a direction you think is appropriate .
Not to mention an opportunity to further your career ( if that ’s the way you want to go ) .
So here are my fundamental keys to communications success for IT workers :
Get used to talking to people .
You ca n’t communicate if you ’re scared of talking to people .
The old stereotype of introverted IT people is not without basis .
My observation over the years is that IT is filled with people who suffer a massive deficit between their intelligence and their ability to communicate ( i.e. they ’re really smart but have trouble communicating the value of their intelligence ) .
So presenting to meetings at work scares you .
Deal with it .
Do something scarier in front of people .
The IT group where I work currently runs a “ Toastmasters ” speaking group .
If you want something really terrifying , try stand - up comedy ( trust me on this one ) .
Start a band .
Sing karaoke .
Do SOMETHING that involves being in front of people .
Do n’t underestimate how important this is to a successful career .
Do n’t mumble !
It ’s appalling how many IT people are “ low talkers “ .
Fair or not , if people have trouble understanding you they ’ll stop listening .
Mumbling is usually a sign of lack of confidence – in a business setting it will often be taken as a lack of confidence in what you are saying , not a lack of confidence in speaking itself .
You do n’t have to be the loudest voice in the room but make sure you do n’t mumble .
Move your lips when you talk .
Words do n’t come out properly if you do n’t articulate correctly .
This is a close relative of mumbling but it is n’t all about volume .
It ’s an order of magnitude harder to understand what you ’re saying if you do n’t use your lips and tongue to form words .
God forbid you might be the type who talks without parting your teeth .
I had to deal with this the other day – I barely took in a word he said , all I could think was “ Open your damn mouth when you talk ! ”
Vary your pitch and rhythm .
Another way to make sure nobody pays attention to what you say is to talk in a monotone .
It ’s so boring listening to someone who talks in a constant , droning level – it ends up taking on the quality of an annoying background noise like a hard drive that whirrs too loudly .
Vary your pitch and inflection to make points and just to stay interesting .
And do n’t be afraid of silence – the occasional pause after making a point is an extremely powerful way of giving additional weight to your point .
Adjust your communication for your audience .
Jargon is almost always a bad idea .
Too often , jargon and technical language is used by people to cover the fact they do n’t really know what they ’re talking about .
Prove you know what you ’re doing by explaining it in clear , unambiguous language .
Get your written communication right too .
The exact tone of your emails and other written communication will be dictated by the standards of your particular workplace but here are some standards that will improve how you are perceived wherever you work .
Spell check everything before you send it .
If it ’s important review it manually to find the things your spell - checker missed ( it ’s even better if you can get another person to proof read for you ) .
No matter how relaxed you think your workplace is , NEVER EVER use “ leet - speak ” or text abbreviations .
It looks terrible and is almost always guaranteed to get you written off as someone who ’s not making a serious contribution .
Do not underestimate the importance of this point .
Seriously .
Just do n’t do it .
A lot of IT workers , particularly those immersed in the programming part of the cycle , will be wondering why this is important to them .
Is n’t the only requirement that they produce and ship quality code ?
Well , if you never want to advance , that ’s a fine attitude .
And I ’m not talking simply about people who want to move into management .
If you want to have a say in the technical direction of your company , if you want to improve the quality of your work life , if you want people to understand the simple fact that you are actually doing quality work , you need to learn to communicate .
Particularly with non-technical people .
It may not be in the safety of your comfort zone but simply getting out of your cubicle and talking to people is one of the best ways to improve your prospects .
You ’re not going to turn into an award - winning public speaker overnight but honestly , it ’s almost certainly going to be easier than you fear .
You have nothing to lose but the poor reputation IT people have for communicating and you have everything to gain .

It 's about 3 months after the iPhone launch , and happy with the improvements , I was planning to change our " Wait " verdict to a full - on and rabid " Buy " .
That was n't because of Apple , but because of the cool apps being offered by independent developers .
All that came to an end yesterday after the new Apple firmware 1.1.1 neutered the handset .
Sure , unlocked iPhones were broken .
But more importantly , Apple wiped away the powerful programs that helped push the iPhone to greatness .
With this , I 'm going to have to move our recommendation from " Wait " to " Do n't hold your breath . "
I 'm done with this handset until third - party apps come back .
Argh , I did n't want to have to write this , but this is what 's on my mind .

It 's understandable for Apple to wage a war on unlocking the iPhone , since the company shares revenue from fees with AT&T .
But the truth is , if cellphone service was awesome , like it is on iTunes , there would n't be a need to unlock the iPhone .
Secondly , bricking these things is totally uncool , and apparently , malicious — according to some early code investigations by the independent iPhone Dev Team , Apple could have avoided this entirely .

I get that Apple might not have wanted to wage a long back - and - forth war with hackers , as the PSP developers are .
And this kind of big blow is going to be a devastating and effective scare tactic , even if a fix comes a few days later .
Unlike a Sony PSP , people can't go a few days without their phones , without social or work hiccups .
This is why I never unlocked my main iPhone , only testing these hacks on a spare 4GB test dummy .
But I do n't want to be held hostage like this .
Did I buy these phones or am I just renting them ?
Screw the unlock for a second .
Let 's talk about the those third - party apps .
While my 4GB iPhone is a brick , and the 8GB phone , which I kept on a totally legit AT&T contract , is now stripped down .
Programs like the faux - GPS , IM clients , Flickr Upload , and NES emulator — what did they ever do but make the iPhone far better than the stock original ?
They made it far more competitive with open - platform superphones like the Nokia N95 , to which I will now be switching .
I flew back from NY to SF today .
While there , I would have liked to have pushed my photos from the trip to flickr ; I would have liked to have played NES games on the subway .
I would have liked to have used the Navizon GPS thing to figure out where the hell I was at any given moment , and when I used one of those web 2.0 IM clients , my battery took a huge hit , and I missed a lot of messages because Safari could n't tell me I was getting IMs while out of the browser .
Very annoying .

I look at my iPhone with version 1.1.1 software on it compared to the old hacked one .
I 'm happy for the iTunes Store , which we 've been waiting for .
But it 's not more important than fixing things , and adding capabilities such as copy / paste and email search .
And it 's certainly not better than all those programs I can't use anymore .
Here 's the comparo chart , from Rob Beschizza at Wired based on a chart from 9to5 :

At Mossberg 's All Things D conference , Jobs mentioned that the thing Apple was n't good at , compared to MSFT , was the ability to work with partners .
Some believe that 's a big part of why Apple lost the Big OS War back when GI Joe was a Saturday morning cartoon .
So why make the same mistake twice ?
There 's a question here of " if we liked the stock iPhone before , why not now ? "
First off , the verdict was based on the future value of the iPhone once Apple had fixed a lot of the quirks that resulted our " wait " verdict .
Right now , it seems like Apple is n't going to innovate that much more , since much of our list of what needed to be patched is still unfulfilled .

I 'm not so deluded that I think this little rant of mine will stop Apple from selling millions of these phones .
But I 'm pretty sure this is what other geeks are thinking .
And possibly , more than just the geeks .
Today , I met a regular guy at the SoHo apple store who went in to service his iPhone after installing some apps , and the firmware , which bricked his phone ; he 's just your average joe , upset to find out his phone is n't repairable ( video here ) .
And at the airport , the security guard guy recognized me and told me he was holding off on the new firmware as he patted me down .
( His iPhone was running on T - Mobile . )
Saul Hansel at the NYTimes is following the story closely , noting that the Navizon GPS app , a hack , was downloaded 80 k times .
That 's almost 10 percent of all iPhone users , who we know to have been using installer .app , likely the smartest of all iPhone users .
And David Pogue decided to teach the mainstream the benefit of the hacks with one of his videos , entitled Hacking the iPhone ; unfortunately it came out the day the firmware did .
Hmm .
Maybe there 's no reason to think that these apps belong in the tech ghetto .
Smart iPhone users , geeks or not , are hacking the iPhone ; this is how people are choosing to use it .
So , Apple , even if you have to fight the unlocks , the apps deserve to live .
It 's what we all want .
I hope we can work it out .

UPDATE :
The hackers have figured out how to downgrade the phone to version 1.02 of the firmware , reversing any bricking and restoring use of third party apps .
Good news , but that does n't change the fact that we 've got to make a choice between Apple 's upgrades and the ones by third party developers .

Navy tells vet to buy own 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
PEARLAND — Korean
War veteran Nyles Reed , 75 , opened an envelope last week to learn a Purple Heart had been approved for injuries he sustained as a Marine on June 22 , 1952 .
But there was no medal .
Just a certificate and a form stating that the medal was " out of stock . "
" I can imagine , of course , with what 's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan , there 's a big shortage , " Reed said .
" At least , I would imagine so . "
The form letter from the Navy Personnel Command told Reed he could wait 90 days and resubmit an application , or buy his own medal .
After waiting 55 years , however , Reed decided to pay $ 42 for his own Purple Heart and accompanying ribbon — plus state sales taxes — at a military surplus store .
On the day he was injured , getting a medal was the last thing on his mind .
Stationed close to the front lines at Panmunjom , where peace talks were under way , Reed " was a forward observer — the one that 's up on the front line directing the artillery .
I had to get to the observation point . "
Reed jumped in a Jeep and had started out when a 76 - millimeter shell " comes in and hits right below the Jeep in the mud .
And when it went off , it blew the Jeep over and threw me into the windshield , where I busted my cheek — you can see the scar — and I was bleeding like a stuck pig . "
" And I could see this battalion aid station , with Navy corpsmen .
So this doc , this surgeon , sewed me up and he says , ' Do you want a Purple Heart ? '
That 's when I said , ' I have n't got time !
They 're waiting for me up at the front lines , ' " Reed recalled .
He rushed back to duty .
About three years ago , Reed said , he started thinking that it would be nice to have the Purple Heart to pass on to his two sons or daughter , or to show to his eight grandchildren and six great - grandchildren .
" I thought it was going to be an easy thing .
Well , I found out that 's not true , " Reed said .
The first response Reed got was that there was nothing in his record about the incident , and that he had to provide witness statements and other verification .
Reed located two Marine Corps buddies , who provided the statements .
" Then I started sending all this information to congressmen , senators , the president , the commandant of the Marine Corps , anybody , " Reed said .
" Well , I kept getting turned down . "
" The real support I got was from Sen . ( John ) Cornyn . "
John Drogan , a spokesman for the Texas Republican , said Thursday that the senator 's office has now arranged for Reed to get an actual medal .
" I have word from Navy folks they have just received additional Purple Heart medals , and we are going to make sure Mr. Reed gets his , " Drogan said , adding that he could not explain why the Navy Department had no medals when the senator 's office contacted it last month .
Maj .
J. DeLaRosa , a media affairs officer for the Marines at the Pentagon , could n't believe Reed received only the certificate .
" That 's unacceptable .
' Out of stock ' ?
That 's like saying , ' We 're out of ammo . '
That 's like saying ' The Marines are going to close tomorrow . '
It just seems a bit weird , " DeLaRosa said .
" There have been a lot of guys wounded , but not to the point that we 're out of medals . "
The Department of Defense estimates that 29,098 troops have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan through Thursday .
For his part , Reed is simply happy he finally received recognition for what happened to him that day .
" That 's why I am so grateful to Sen. Cornyn . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Iraq 's Interior Ministry is regarded as " dysfunctional and sectarian , " and the National Police should be " disbanded and reorganized , " according to an independent report obtained by CNN .
Iraqi armed forces patrol the streets of Karbala during a celebration August 27 .
The report , produced by the Independent Commission on Security Forces in Iraq , fires stinging criticism at Iraqi security forces but also includes promising words for the country 's military .
Ordered by Congress , the report comes less than a week before the White House is expected to provide to lawmakers a highly anticipated assessment of President Bush 's addition this year of some 30,000 troops to Iraq .
Part of the reason for the increase was to reduce sectarian killings that have spread throughout much of Iraq since 2006 .
The independent report , set for release Thursday , says Iraq 's Interior Ministry " is a ministry in name only . "
It " suffers from ineffective leadership " and " is widely regarded as dysfunctional and sectarian , " the report says .
Watch the top House Democrat say the report is evidence of a failed Iraq policy »
The Interior Ministry and the National Police force it operates have long been regarded by observers as being infiltrated by sectarian Shiite militias .
" Such fundamental flaws present a serious obstacle to achieving the levels of readiness , capability , and effectiveness in police and border security forces that are essential for internal security and stability in Iraq , " the report says .
" Sectarianism in its units undermines its ability to provide security ; the force is not viable in its current form .
The National Police should be disbanded and reorganized , " it says .
The Pentagon said Wednesday it does not agree with the report 's recommendation that the Iraqi National Police be disbanded .
The commission , headed by Gen. James L. Jones , the former top commander in Europe , said Iraq 's armed forces wo n't be ready to perform independently during the next 18 months .
The Bush administration has often cited the ability of Iraq 's newly created military to stand on its own as a requisite for U.S. troop withdrawals .
" We 've always recognized that this is a long - term project , " said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell , who had not seen the report .
" Getting the Iraqi army on its feet and capable of defending the borders of that country independently is not an overnight project , and we are continuing to work on it . "
The Pentagon is committed to rebuilding the Iraqi army , Morrell said .
" I do n't know if it takes 12 months , I do n't know if it takes six months , I do n't know if it takes longer , " Morrell said .
" But we are committed to stay as long as it takes to help the Iraqi army gets back on its feet to the point that they 're able to take on the normal functions of an army . "
Morrell said the size of Iraq 's police should be put into context .
" The National Police are 25,000 police officers , " he said .
" It 's not reflective of the entire Ministry of Interior police force , which I think includes roughly 300,000 local and provincial police as well . "
The report says the Iraqi Police Service " is incapable today of providing security at a level sufficient to protect Iraqi neighborhoods from insurgents and sectarian violence . "
The report says the " Iraqi Police Service must be better trained and equipped , " and the commission " believes that the Iraqi Police Service can improve rapidly should the Ministry of Interior become a more functional institution . "
The report has promising words for the Iraqi army , special forces , navy and air force , describing them as " increasingly effective " and " capable of assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of Iraq . "
" The commission assesses that in the next 12 to 18 months , there will be continued improvement in their readiness and capability , but not the ability to operate independently .
Evidence indicates that the ISF [ Iraqi Security Forces ] will not be able to progress enough in the near term to secure Iraqi borders against conventional military and external threats . "
In addition , Iraq 's Department of Border Enforcement " suffers from poor ministerial support from the MOI [ Ministry of Interior ] , " the report says .
" Border forces often lack the equipment , infrastructure and basic supplies to conduct their mission .
Overall border security is further undermined by the division of responsibilities between the MOI and the Ministry of Transportation .
Corruption and external influence and infiltration are widespread .
Absent major improvements in all these areas , Iraq 's borders will remain porous and poorly defended . "
Other key conclusions of the report include :
The Defense Ministry " is building the necessary institutions and processes to fulfill its mission .
However , its capacity is hampered by bureaucratic inexperience , excessive layering , and overcentralization .
These flaws reduce the operational readiness , capability , and effectiveness of the Iraqi military . "
The Iraqi army and special forces " possess an adequate supply of willing and able manpower and a steadily improving basic training capability " and " are making efforts to reduce sectarian influence within their ranks and are achieving some progress .
Substantial progress can be achieved to that end . "
The " Iraqi air force 's relatively late establishment hampers its ability to provide much - needed air support to ground operations " but " it is nonetheless progressing at a promising rate during this formative period . "
" The Iraqi navy is small and its current fleet is insufficient to execute its mission .
However , it is making substantive progress in this early stage of development . "

The Many Uses of Gold
Article by : Hobart M. King , PhD , RPG
The Most Useful Metal
Of all the minerals mined from the Earth , none is more useful than gold .
Its usefulness is derived from a diversity of special properties .
Gold conducts electricity , does not tarnish , is very easy to work , can be drawn into wire , can be hammered into thin sheets , alloys with many other metals , can be melted and cast into highly detailed shapes , has a wonderful color and a brilliant luster .
Gold is a memorable metal that occupies a special place in the human mind .
A Bit of Gold History When Spanish explorers first arrived in the " New World " they met the native people of South America .
These two cultures had been separated by a vast ocean , they had never touched one another , they spoke different languages and lived entirely different lives .
Yet they had one thing in common - they both held gold in highest esteem and used it to make some of their most important objects .
Throughout the history of our planet , almost every established culture has used gold to symbolize power , beauty , purity , and accomplishment .
Today we continue to use gold for our most significant objects : wedding rings , Olympic medals , Oscars , Grammys , money , crucifixes and ecclesiastical art .
No other substance of the same rarity holds a more visible and prominent place in our society .
Jewelry : The Primary Use of Gold Gold has been used to make ornamental objects and jewelry for thousands of years .
Gold nuggets found in a stream are very easy to work and were probably one of the first metals used by humans .
Today , most of the gold that is newly mined or recycled is used in the manufacture of jewelry .
About 78 % of the gold consumed each year is used in the manufacture of jewelry .
Special properties of gold make it perfect for manufacturing jewelry .
These include : very high luster ; desirable yellow color ; tarnish resistance ; ability to be drawn into wires , hammered into sheets , or cast into shapes .
These are all properties of an attractive metal that is easily worked into beautiful objects .
Another extremely important factor that demands the use of gold as a jewelry metal is tradition .
Important objects are expected to be made from gold .
Pure gold is too soft to stand up to the stresses applied to many jewelry items .
Craftsmen learned that alloying gold with other metals such as copper , silver , and platinum would increase its durability .
Since then most gold used to make jewelry is an alloy of gold with one or more other metals .
The alloys of gold have a lower value per unit of weight than pure gold .
A standard of trade known as " karatage " was developed to designate the gold content of these alloys .
Pure gold is known as 24 karat gold and is almost always marked with " 24 K " .
An alloy that is 50 % gold by weight is known as 12 karat gold ( 12/24ths ) and is marked with " 12 K " .
An alloy that contains 75 % gold by weight is 18 karat ( 18/24 = 75 % ) and marked " 18 K " .
In general , high - karat jewelry is softer and more resistant to tarnish , while low - karat jewelry is stronger and less resistant to tarnish - especially when in contact with perspiration .
Alloying gold with other metals changes the color of the finished products ( see illustration ) .
An alloy of 75 % gold , 16 % silver and 9 % copper yields yellow gold .
White gold is an alloy of 75 % gold , 4 % silver , 4 % copper and 17 % palladium .
Other alloys yield pink , green , peach and even black - colored metals .
Financial Gold : Coinage , Bullion , Backing
Because gold is highly valued and in very limited supply , it has long been used as a medium of exchange or money .
The first known use of gold in transactions dates back over 6000 years .
Early transactions were done using pieces of gold or pieces of silver .
The rarity , usefulness , and desirability of gold make it a substance of long - term value .
Gold works well for this purpose because it has a high value , and it is durable , portable , and easily divisible .
2019 Gold Production Country Metric Tons China 420 Australia 330 Russia 310 United States 200 Canada 180 Indonesia 160 Ghana 130 Peru 130 Mexico 110 Kazakhstan 100 Uzbekistan 100 South Africa 90 Brazil 85 Argentina 72 Papua New Guinea 70 Other Countries 800
The values above are estimated gold production in metric tons .
Data from USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries .
Some early printings of paper money were backed by gold held in safekeeping for every unit of money that was placed in circulation .
The United States once used a " gold standard " and maintained a stockpile of gold to back every paper dollar in circulation .
Under this gold standard , any person could present paper currency to the government and demand in exchange an equal value of gold .
The gold standard was once used by many nations , but it eventually became too cumbersome and is no longer used by any nation .
The gold used as a financial backing for currency was most often held in the form of gold bars , also known as " gold bullion . "
The use of gold bars kept manufacturing costs to a minimum and allowed convenient handling and storage .
Today many governments , individuals , and institutions hold investments of gold in the convenient form of bullion .
The first gold coins were minted under the order of King Croesus of Lydia ( a region of present - day Turkey ) in about 560 BC .
Gold coins were commonly used in transactions up through the early 1900s , when paper currency became a more common form of exchange .
Gold coins were issued in two types of units .
Some were denominated in units of currency , such as dollars , while others were issued in standard weights , such as ounces or grams .
Today gold coins are no longer in wide use for financial transactions .
However , gold coins issued in specific weights are popular ways for people to purchase and own small amounts of gold for investment .
Gold coins are also issued as " commemorative " items .
Many people enjoy these commemorative coins because they have both a collectible value and a precious metal value .
Uses of Gold in Electronics
The most important industrial use of gold is in the manufacture of electronics .
Solid state electronic devices use very low voltages and currents which are easily interrupted by corrosion or tarnish at the contact points .
Gold is the highly efficient conductor that can carry these tiny currents and remain free of corrosion .
Electronic components made with gold are highly reliable .
Gold is used in connectors , switch and relay contacts , soldered joints , connecting wires and connection strips .
A small amount of gold is used in almost every sophisticated electronic device .
This includes cell phones , calculators , personal digital assistants , global positioning system ( GPS ) units , and other small electronic devices .
Most large electronic appliances such as television sets also contain gold .
One challenge with the use of gold in very small quantities in very small devices is loss of the metal from society .
Nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year , and most of them contain about fifty cents worth of gold .
Their average lifetime is under two years , and very few are currently recycled .
Although the amount of gold is small in each device , their enormous numbers translate into a lot of unrecycled gold .
Uses of Gold in Computers Gold is used in many places in the standard desktop or laptop computer .
The rapid and accurate transmission of digital information through the computer and from one component to another requires an efficient and reliable conductor .
Gold meets these requirements better than any other metal .
The importance of high quality and reliable performance justifies the high cost .
Edge connectors used to mount microprocessor and memory chips onto the motherboard and the plug - and - socket connectors used to attach cables all contain gold .
The gold in these components is generally electroplated onto other metals and alloyed with small amounts of nickel or cobalt to increase durability .
Uses of Gold in Dentistry
How would iron work as a dental filling ?
Not very well ... your dentist would need blacksmithing tools , your smile would be rusty a few days after a filling , and you would need to get used to the taste of iron .
Even at much higher expense , gold is used in dentistry because of its superior performance and aesthetic appeal .
Gold alloys are used for fillings , crowns , bridges , and orthodontic appliances .
Gold is used in dentistry because it is chemically inert , nonallergenic , and easy for the dentist to work .
Gold is known to have been used in dentistry as early as 700 B.C. Etruscan " dentists " used gold wire to fasten replacement teeth into the mouths of their patients .
Gold was probably used to fill cavities in ancient times ; however , there is no documentation or archaeological evidence for this use of gold until a little over 1000 years ago .
Gold was much more generously used in dentistry up until the late 1970s .
The sharp run-up of gold prices at that time motivated the development of substitute materials .
However , the amount of gold used in dentistry is starting to rise again .
Some motivation for this comes from concerns that less inert metals might have an adverse effect on long - term health .
Medical Uses of Gold Gold is used as a drug to treat a small number of medical conditions .
Injections of weak solutions of sodium aurothiomalate or aurothioglucose are sometimes used to treat rheumatoid arthritis .
Particles of a radioactive gold isotope are implanted in tissues to serve as a radiation source in the treatment of certain cancers .
Small amounts of gold are used to remedy a condition known as lagophthalmos , which is an inability of a person to close their eyes completely .
This condition is treated by implanting small amounts of gold in the upper eyelid .
The implanted gold " weights " the eyelid , and the force of gravity helps the eyelid close fully .
Radioactive gold is used in diagnosis .
It is injected in a colloidal solution that can be tracked as a beta emitter as it passes through the body .
Many surgical instruments , electronic equipment , and life - support devices are made using small amounts of gold .
Gold is nonreactive in the instruments and is highly reliable in the electronic equipment and life - support devices .
Uses of Gold in Aerospace
If you are going to spend billions of dollars on a vehicle that when launched will travel on a voyage where the possibility of lubrication , maintenance and repair is absolutely zero , then building it with extremely dependable materials is essential .
This is exactly why gold is used in hundreds of ways in every space vehicle that NASA launches .
Gold is used in circuitry because it is a dependable conductor and connector .
In addition , many parts of every space vehicle are fitted with gold - coated polyester film .
This film reflects infrared radiation and helps stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft .
Without this coating , dark colored parts of the spacecraft would absorb significant amounts of heat .
Gold is also used as a lubricant between mechanical parts .
In the vacuum of space , organic lubricants would volatilize and they would be broken down by the intense radiation beyond Earth 's atmosphere .
Gold has a very low shear strength , and a thin film of gold between critical moving parts serves as a lubricant - the gold molecules slip past one another under the forces of friction and that provides a lubricant action .
Uses of Gold in Awards & Status Symbols
What metal is used to make the crown worn by a king ?
Gold !
This metal is selected for use because gold is THE metal of highest esteem .
It would make no sense to make a king 's crown out of steel - even though steel is the strongest metal .
Gold is chosen for use in a king 's crown because it is the metal associated with highest esteem and status .
Gold is associated with many positive qualities .
Purity is another quality associated with gold .
For this reason , gold is the metal of choice for religious objects .
Crosses , communion ware , and other religious symbols are made with gold for this reason .
Gold is also used as the first place winner 's medal or trophy in almost any type of contest .
First - place winners at the Olympic Games are given gold medals .
The Academy Awards Oscars are gold awards .
Music 's Grammy Awards are made of gold .
All of these important achievements are honored with awards made of gold .
Uses of Gold in Glassmaking Gold has many uses in the production of glass .
The most basic use in glassmaking is that of a pigment .
A small amount of gold , if suspended in the glass when it is annealed , will produce a rich ruby color .
Gold is also used when making specialty glass for climate - controlled buildings and cases .
A small amount of gold dispersed within the glass or coated onto the glass surface will reflect solar radiation outward , helping the buildings stay cool in the summer , and reflect internal heat inward , helping them stay warm in winter .
The visor on the helmet of an astronaut 's space suit is coated with a very thin film of gold .
This thin film reflects much of the very intense solar radiation of space , protecting the astronaut 's eyes and skin .
Gold Gilding and Gold Leaf Gold has the highest malleability of any metal .
This enables gold to be beaten into sheets that are only a few millionths of an inch thick .
These thin sheets , known as " gold leaf " can be applied over the irregular surfaces of picture frames , molding , or furniture .
Gold leaf is also used on the external and internal surfaces of buildings .
This provides a durable and corrosion - resistant covering .
One of the most eye - catching uses of gold leaf is on the domes of religious buildings and other important structures .
The cost of this " roofing material " is very high per square foot ; however , the cost of the gold is only a few percent of the total project cost .
Most of the cost goes to the labor of highly skilled artisans who apply the gold leaf .
Future Uses of Gold Gold is too expensive to use by chance .
Instead it is used deliberately and only when less expensive substitutes cannot be identified .
As a result , once a use is found for gold it is rarely abandoned for another metal .
This means that the number of uses for gold have been increasing over time .
Most of the ways that gold is used today have been developed only during the last two or three decades .
This trend will likely continue .
As our society requires more sophisticated and reliable materials , our uses for gold will increase .
This combination of growing demand , few substitutes , and limited supply will cause the value and importance of gold to increase steadily over time .
It is truly a metal of the future .

Substitutes for Gold and Reductions in Use Because of its rarity and high price , manufacturers are always looking for ways to reduce the amount of gold required to make an object or substitute a less expensive metal in its place .
Base metals clad with gold alloys have long been used as a way to reduce the amount of gold used in jewelry and electrical connections .
These items are constantly being redesigned to reduce the amount of gold required and to maintain their utility standards .
Palladium , platinum , and silver are the most common substitutes for gold that closely retain its desired properties .
I hate to give away the introduction to my next article , but this ca n’t wait .
â€ “ Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to Sam Tannenhaus Vanity Fair , May 9th , 2003 :
“ There are a lot of things that are different now [ that the U.S. occupies Iraq ] , and one that has gone by almost unnoticed â€ “ but it ’s huge â€ “ is that … we can now remove almost all of our forces from Saudi Arabia .
Their presence there over the last 12 years has been a source of enormous difficulty for a friendly government .
It ’s been a huge recruiting device for al Qaeda .
“ In fact if you look at bin Laden , one of his principle grievances was the presence of so - called crusader forces on the holy land , Mecca and Medina .
I think just lifting that burden from the Saudis is itself going to open the door to other positive things .
“ I do n’t want to speak in messianic terms .
It ’s not going to change things overnight , but it ’s a huge improvement . ”
Using genetic engineering , researchers have created an obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) – like set of behaviors in mice and reversed them with antidepressants and genetic targeting of a key brain circuit .
The study , by National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) - funded researchers , suggests new strategies for treating the disorder .
Researchers bred mice without a specific gene , and found defects in a brain circuit previously implicated in OCD .
Much like people with a form of OCD , the mice engaged in compulsive grooming , which led to bald patches with open sores on their heads .
They also exhibited anxiety - like behaviors .
When the missing gene was reinserted into the circuit , both the behaviors and the defects were largely prevented .
The gene , SAPAP3 , makes a protein that helps brain cells communicate via the glutamate chemical messenger system .
“ Since this is the first study to directly link OCD - like behaviors to abnormalities in the glutamate system in a specific brain circuit , it may lead to new targets for drug development , ” explained Guoping Feng , Ph.D. , Duke University , whose study was funded in part by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) , the National Institute of Mental Health , and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) .
“ An imbalance in SAPAP3 gene - related circuitry could help explain OCD . ”
Feng , Jeffrey Welch , Ph.D. , Jing Lu , Ph.D. , William Wetsel , Ph.D. , Nicole Calakos , M.D. , Ph.D. , and colleagues report on their discovery in the August 23 , 2007 , issue of Nature .
“ This serendipitous discovery illustrates how pursuit of basic science questions can provide important insights with promising clinical implications into poorly understood diseases , ” said NINDS director Story C. Landis , Ph.D .
“ Ultimately , the challenge will be to translate what we learn from this stunning new genetic animal model into help for the 2.2 million American adults haunted by unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors , ” added NIMH director Thomas R. Insel , M.D. , who conducted clinical studies on OCD earlier in his career .
Previous studies of OCD had implicated a circuit in which the striatum , which straddles the middle of the brain , processes decisions by the cortex , the executive hub at the front of the brain .
But exactly how circuit communications might go awry remained a mystery , and glutamate was not a prime suspect .
Nor were Feng and colleagues initially interested in OCD .
Rather , they sought to understand the function of the protein made by the SAPAP3 gene , which is involved in glutamate - mediated communications in the cortex - striatum circuit .
To find out how it worked , they used genetic engineering to generate SAPAP3 knockout mice .
The mice seemed normal at first , but after four to six months , all developed telltale bald patches of raw flesh on their faces , caused by compulsive scratching .
Videotapes confirmed that the sores were self - inflicted – grooming behavior gone amok .
“ We were surprised by the magnitude of this phenomenon , ” recalled Feng .
“ The parallels with OCD were pretty striking . ”
In a series of behavioral tests , his team determined that the SAPAP3 knockout mice also showed anxiety - like behaviors , often associated with OCD .
They were slower to venture into – and quicker to exit – risky environments .
And like their human counterparts , the animals responded to treatment with a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor ( fluoxetine ) , which reduced both the excessive grooming and anxiety - like behaviors .
SAPAP3 is the only member of a glutamate - regulating family of proteins that is present in large amounts in the striatum .
It is part of the machinery at the receiving end of the connections between brain cells , where the neurotransmitter binds to receptors , triggering increased activity among the cells .
The researchers found that lack of SAPAP3 genes dampened the increased activity usually caused by glutamate and stunted the development and functioning of circuit connections .
When the researchers injected the striatum of seven - day - old knockout mice with a probe containing the SAPAP3 gene , it protected them from developing the OCD and anxiety - like behaviors 4 to 6 months later and corrected the circuit dysfunction .
This confirmed that the absence of the SAPAP3 gene in the striatum was indeed responsible for the OCD - like effects .
The findings suggest that anxiety - related behavior may stem from the striatum , which serves as a pivotal link between the cortex and emotion hubs .
The researchers note that recent genetic studies of OCD have hinted at involvement of glutamate - related mechanisms .
Feng ’s team is also looking beyond the SAPAP3 gene to other related genes in the circuit that could lead to similar behavioral problems .
They are exploring how the SAPAP3 gene affects neural communications and how it works at the molecular level – with an eye to possible applications in drug development .
Collaborating clinical investigators are exploring whether specific variants of the SAPAP3 gene in humans may be related to OCD spectrum disorders , such as trichotillomania , or obsessive hair pulling – a human syndrome also characterized by bald patches on the head .

The US Department of Defence has abruptly shut down Faces of the Fallen , an exhibition of 1,319 portraits of American military killed in Afghanistan and Iraq on the pretext of sending the portraits " home to the families of the troops to serve as a lasting tribute to their service . "
But Pentagon has refused to allocate the $ 32,500 need to de-install the exhibit which has been housed at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial since March 2005 , and send the portraits home , forcing the Faces of the Fallen Foundation to ask for public donations .
“ Sadly , our exhibition portrays less than half the number of brave men and women who have lost their lives in America ’s latest war , " Annette Polan , the founder of Faces of the Fallen said .
" It captures a mere snapshot in time , yet it recognizes and memorializes the sacrifice of all these fallen heroes . "
“ I do n’t wake up in the morning wondering why my son died ; I know why he died , ” Commons said .
“ He performed the ultimate community service ; he gave his life trying to save the life of someone else .
Of that I ca n’t be more proud .
These paintings , these carvings , these etchings , these faces of the fallen , pay tribute to another generation of young men and women who have answered the nation ’s call . ”
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Peter Pace , the man who was instrumental in disbanding the exhibition , justified his actions saying the picture remind him of a photo he keeps on his desk of Marine Lance Cpl. Guido Farinaro , the first Marine under Pace ’s command to die in Vietnam .
“ I know how much his picture means to me , " he said .
" I know how much these portraits mean to the families . "
Polan said that before the orders to take down the portraits came , viewers asked if the exhibit will travel around the country so that Americans and visitors who cannot come to Arlington also have an opportunity " to remember , to honor and to mourn . "
John Prescott sparked controversy yesterday by linking America 's refusal to tackle climate change to the devastation of the New Orleans hurricane .
The Deputy Prime Minister caused potential embarrassment for Britain by drawing a parallel between the US city destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and island states that scientists believe are under threat of being swamped .
In a speech in Berlin , he also criticised the US for failing to sign the Kyoto protocol on climate change , which is aimed at slowing global warming by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
A debate has raged in the US over whether global warming is responsible for the recent series of storms .
So far this year there have been 15 named storms , significantly more than average .
President George Bush says he does not believe that human activity causes global warming , but some experts say excessive carbon emissions lead to higher sea temperatures and stronger storms .
With the death toll from Katrina expected to be in the thousands , however , comments like these from a senior politician will be seen by some as insensitive .
A spokesman for Prescott said Downing Street had seen the speech beforehand , but the Prime Minister 's office later refused to comment .
Tony Blair will meet Bush in New York this week at the United Nations world summit , at which global warming will be a key issue .
A White House spokesman said the two leaders ' warm relationship would not be affected by the comments .
The spokesman also dismissed the suggestion of a link between Kyoto and Katrina .
James Connaughton , the chief White House environmental aide , said Prescott was careful in his choice of words .
' Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster , ' said Connaughton .
' Even had we ratified and implemented the provisions of Kyoto , this would not have stopped Katrina .
We 've had hurricanes for centuries .
' I have a high regard for John Prescott and it has been reinforced by the fact that he was careful in what he said on this issue . '
In his speech , Prescott stressed his compassion for the US hurricane victims , but said Bush 's administration was wrong not to join Britain and many other leading industrial nations in supporting Kyoto .
He told the international congress of the Council for European Urbanism : ' As a European negotiator at the Kyoto climate change convention , I was fully aware that climate change is changing weather patterns and raising sea levels .
' The horrific flood of New Orleans brings home to us the concern of leaders of countries like the Maldives , whose nations are at risk of disappearing completely .
There has been resistance by the US government to Kyoto - which I believe is wrong . '
The Ringtones Racket
Steve Jobs , introducing iTunes 7.4 during last week ’s Apple special event : “ We ’re going to ship a new version of iTunes tonight , to support some of the new products you ’re going to hear about shortly .
And the biggest new feature is going to be ringtones .
Well , we ’re going to do ringtones in our own special way . ”
Apple ’s own special way of doing ringtones is this :
You can only use songs purchased from the iTunes Store ; you must pay an additional 99 cents on top of the price of the song itself ; only a small subset of the songs at the iTunes Store are eligible ; and , if you decide to create a second ringtone using a different segment of the same song which you ’ve already paid for twice , you must pay for it again .
But you do get to pick which segment of the song to use .
This “ special way ” seems fair only when compared to the ringtones offered by competitors , which , as Jobs pointed out in his keynote , typically sell for $ 2.50 , which price includes only the ringtone snippet , not the entire original song itself .
The whole ringtones racket is predicated on the notion that ringtones are something different than songs .
This notion is bullshit .
You do n’t turn songs into ringtones ; you treat them as ringtones .
They ’re not even a different file format .
It ’s just a different context for playing the same song on the same device .
1
This false notion that ringtones are something in and of themselves is an anachronism , an artifact dating back to the time when mobile phones existed in their own ecosystem , wholly separate from the PC or the Internet .
There was no way to transfer songs from your computer to your phone , because phones did n’t support USB or Bluetooth .
Back then , if you wanted new ringtones , the only way to get them onto your phone was through your mobile service provider .
And because people did want them , and there was no other way to get them , the mobile providers were able to charge exorbitantly high prices for them .
But ringtones are simply digital audio files — no more , no less .
( Actually , they are less , given that most are only 15 or 30 seconds long . )
The way it should work today , not just with the iPhone but with any music - playing mobile phone , is that any song the phone can play should be allowed to be specified as a ringtone .
If you should n’t have to pay for each device on which you play a song — computer , iPod , Apple TV — then clearly you should n’t have to pay for each context for playing the same song on the same device .
Instead of the complicated , confusing mess of a ringtone policy that Apple announced last week , what they should have announced is this :
Any song you can play on your iPhone can be used as a ringtone for no additional charge .
Want a new ringtone ?
Just buy it from iTunes or rip it from a CD .
Yes , this might have further antagonized Apple ’s already - contentious relationship with the music labels ( and with the entertainment media conglomerates in general ; cf. NBC ) , but the reason these relationships are rocky is that the executives running these companies are stubborn fools who are only willing to consider ways to keep things the way they were , and who hold their own customers in utter contempt .
You ca n’t reason with the masterminds behind “ ringles ” .
The distinction between ringtones and songs is an artificial marketing construct .
It is a misconception , albeit a widely held one , that there is any foundation in copyright law for this , i.e. that an honest consumer is obligated to pay for ringtones separately from “ regular ” songs for some legal reason .
Not so .
Copyright attorney Nilay Patel dispelled this notion last week in a piece at Engadget .
Patel points out that , oddly enough , even the RIAA agrees :
Well , the RIAA wanted to be able to distribute ringtones of its artists without having to pay them big money to do so ( surprised ? ) , and it won a decision last year before the Copyright Office saying that ringtones were n’t “ derivative works ” , meaning they did n’t infringe on the copyright of the songwriter .
So if you have the right to play a song , you have the right to use it as a ringtone on your phone .
There ’s no reason to feel one iota of guilt about using tools like MakeiPhoneRingtone or iToner .
All That Is Gold Does Not Glitter
Clearly , in some way , Apple is beholden to the whims of the music labels with regard to iTunes ’s ringtones support .
There are over six million songs available for sale through iTunes , but , as of this writing , only 500,000 are available for purchase as ringtones .
Why are n’t all songs available for purchase as ringtones ?
Clearly it ’s not Apple ’s choice , but a limitation imposed upon them by the music labels .
Even if we concede for the moment that it ’s reasonable to charge additional money to use songs as ringtones , the question remains :
What is wrong with the music labels that they wo n’t allow Apple to sell every song at iTunes as a ringtone ?
It boggles the mind .
The recording industry is going down the tubes because people are buying less and less music each year ; but here , in iTunes , they ’re willfully turning down potential sales .
Customer : I ’m willing to pay you an extra dollar for this song I ’ve already given you a dollar for , so that I can use it as a ringtone on my iPhone .
Music Labels : Nope .
i Tunes — the application , not the store — has long supported two distinct types of music : files obtained from outside the iTunes Store , and those purchased from the iTunes Store and restricted by FairPlay .
The difference being one ’s afforded usage rights ; FairPlay - protected songs are restricted in terms of the number of devices they can be played on , for example .
With the introduction of ringtones support , iTunes now breaks songs into three groups :
Non-iTunes
Store songs .
iTunes
Store songs which are not eligible for sale as ringtones .
iTunes Store songs which are eligible as ringtones .
Apple ’s right to sell songs through iTunes is not simply a matter of copyright law .
If we assume , as seems likely , that the music labels stipulated in their contracts with Apple that songs to be sold at an additional cost for use as ringtones must be cleared separately , the distinction between groups 2 and 3 is not under Apple ’s control .
But group 1 — those songs in your iTunes library which you did not purchase from the iTunes Store — is under Apple ’s control .
Apple ca n’t charge you for the right to use these songs as ringtones , but they could allow you to do so for free , just as you ’re allowed to play them on a Mac , iPod , Apple TV , or iPhone for free .
They could do it , but they have n’t .
From the inception of the iTunes Store , Apple has done right by its customers .
The iTunes Store was conceived and designed as something customers would enjoy .
It competes fairly , both against traditional music sales on physical media such as CDs , and against illegal bootlegging .
It ca n’t beat bootlegging on price , but it can beat it in terms of convenience and user experience .
Three billion songs sold ca n’t be wrong .
iTunes ’s new ringtone feature , though , is the first time Apple has created a feature that is only usable with iTunes Store tracks .
Burning to disc , transferring to peripheral devices such as iPods and Apple TV , playing over the air to Airport Express — in all these cases , the features work with all songs in your library , wherever they came from .
In fact , prior to ringtones , the only special treatment iTunes granted to iTunes Store files were additional restrictions , such as the “ only five authorized computers ” rule .
The difference with ringtones is n’t legal ; it ’s that there ’s money to be made .
Even if you agree that the entire notion of a “ ringtone industry ” is a racket , you might be tempted to argue that Apple would be foolish not to participate simply because it ’s a profitable endeavor .
But rackets seldom continue forever .
Short - term , yes , surely Apple is already generating additional revenue from the sale of ringtones .
But this money comes at a cost : resentment .
For any song you already own on CD , Apple is asking you to pay three times for it in order to use it as a ringtone on your iPhone : once for the CD you ’ve already purchased , again to buy a needless duplicate of the track from the iTunes Store , and a third time to generate the ringtone .
A fair , free “ just use the songs you already own as ringtones ” policy would n’t generate revenue directly , but it could be used as a powerful marketing bludgeon .
Consumers know what ringtones are , and they know that mobile providers want them to pay through the nose for them .
Imagine an ad proclaiming that with the iPhone , any song in your iTunes library can be used as a ringtone .
Want to use a new hit single as a ringtone ?
Just buy it from the iTunes Store , and play it everywhere .
The policy as it stands now , on the other hand , discourages people who know better from buying tracks from the iTunes Store .
Apple may well close or change the loophole in a future iTunes update , but as of version 7.4.1 , the “ change the file extension ” trick and yesterday ’s newly discovered metadata trick ( now used by MakeiPhoneRingtone 1.1 ) allow informed iPhone users to do what they should be able to do , both by common sense and U.S. copyright law : use any song they already own as a ringtone — but only with songs that are n’t protected by FairPlay .
2
Faced with the choice between doing what ’s right for customers or charging them money for something they should n’t need to pay for , Apple chose the latter .
There is no middle ground .
And any business that hinges on your customers “ not knowing any better ” is a bad business .
Mr Pratt said the slogan was intended to be humorous
Forklift driver David Pratt was told by street wardens in Peterborough he could cause offence or incite violence .
The slogan on the garment read : " Do n't piss me off !
I am running out of places to hide the bodies . "
Peterborough City Council said using insulting or offensive language was an offence , even if it appeared in print .
Mr Pratt , 46 , an American living in Peterborough , was approached by the wardens as he waited for a bus with his wife Elly .
" It is insane .
I have worn it in the city centre hundreds of times " , said Mr Pratt , whose wife bought him the T - shirt in Venice Beach , California .
" Most people who see it just chuckle .
Some people have even stopped me to tell me they like my T - shirt .
It 's a bummer because I like the shirt but I am trying to get citizenship but if I get a fine I can kiss citizenship goodbye
David Pratt
" We have put this incident online on several blogs and 90 % of people who have commented said they found it hilarious or that I should have the right to wear it wherever I like . "
Asked whether he would wear the T - shirt again , Mr Pratt replied : " I am wearing it now .
If I get a written apology I will wear it in the city centre again . "
He continued : " It 's a bummer because I like the shirt , but I am trying to get citizenship but if I get a fine I can kiss citizenship goodbye . "
He added : " I really do n't see how the wording on my T - shirt could incite violence - it 's humour , that 's all it is . "
In a statement , Peterborough City Council said : " The incident is the subject of an official complaint to the council and is currently under investigation .
" However , using offensive , abusive , or insulting language is an offence under the Public Order Act , which also applies to such language appearing in print .
" In what was an amicable conversation , the street warden advised the gentleman concerned that his T - shirt could cause offence and if he was to wear it again he could run the risk of being issued an £ 80 on - the - spot fine from the police . "
Rest assured , we 've seen some pretty fancy mirrors in our day , but Daniel Rozin 's Weave Mirror ranks pretty high up there .
This zany installation relies on " 768 motorized and laminated C - shaped prints along the surface of a picture plane that texturally mimics a homespun basket , " and as curious mortals approach it , it " paints a picture of them using a gradual rotation in greyscale value on each C- ring . "
We know , you 're probably still confounded at how this thing actually wows anyone , but give the video ( posted after the jump ) a peek and clarity will be yours .

London 's Dirty Bomb Tests
London is running a dirty - bomb drill .
Mostly a movie - plot threat , but these sorts of drills are useful , regardless of the scenario .
I agree with this :
As ever , plain old explosives are the big worry .
As for chemicals , compare the effects of the Tokyo subway gas attack ( 10 terrorists , five attacks each involving 1 kg of hard - to - get sarin nerve gas , 12 dead total ) with a typical backpack - bomb attack ( London 7/7 : four terrorists , four simple home made devices , 52 dead ) .
Only a stupid attacker would bother with chemicals .
Real pros like the IRA , for instance , never have .
Although with a dirty bomb , the media - inspired panic would certainly be a huge factor .

In what may be the first study to use brain imaging to look at the neural circuits involved in emotional control in patients with depression , researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison have found that brains of people with clinical depression react very differently than those of healthy people when trying to cope with negative situations .
According to the World Health Organization , clinical depression is one of the leading causes of disability and lost productivity in the world .
Understanding the root cause of depression , however , has proved difficult .
" It 's normal for people to have negative emotions in certain circumstances , " says lead study author Tom Johnstone .
" One of the features of major depression is not that people have negative reactions to negative situations , it 's that they can't pull themselves out of those negative emotional moods .
They seem to have a deficit in their ability to be able to regulate their emotions ... to come back down to baseline after a negative experience . "
To evaluate the role of emotional regulation in depression , psychology and psychiatry researchers from the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health and Waisman Center monitored the brain responses of healthy or depressed individuals to a series of images designed to provoke strong negative emotional responses - images such as car accidents and threatening - looking animals .
Participants were asked to consciously work to decrease their emotional responses to some of the negative images , using techniques such as envisioning a more positive outcome than the one implied or by imagining the situation was acted out rather than real .
" We ask them to reframe the content of what they 're seeing , " rather than divert their attention or distract themselves with unrelated thoughts , Johnstone says .
" We hope to engage cognitive areas in re-interpreting the emotional content of a stimulus ... to either increase or decrease its impact . "
In both healthy and depressed individuals , they found that such efforts increased brain activity in prefrontal cortical areas known to help regulate the emotional centers of the brain , as they expected .

The big difference was seen in the reactions of the emotional centers themselves , including a small almond - shaped structure called the amygdala located deep in the brain .
The study appears in the August 15 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .
In nondepressed individuals , high levels of regulatory activity correlated with low activity in the emotional response centers - in effect , the healthy subjects ' efforts successfully quelled their emotional responses .
In depressed patients , however , high levels of activity in the amygdala and other emotional centers persisted despite intense activity in the regulatory regions .
This finding suggests that healthy people are able to effectively regulate their negative emotions through conscious effort , but that the necessary neural circuits are dysfunctional in many patients with depression , the researchers say .
The difference becomes even more pronounced the harder the patients try .
" Those [ healthy ] individuals putting more cognitive effort into it are getting a bigger payoff in terms of decreasing activation in these emotional centers , " Johnstone explains .
" In the depressed individuals , you find the exact opposite relationship - it seems the more effort they put in , the more activation there is in the amygdala . "
Though the researchers do n't yet know exactly where the differences lie , Johnstone suggests multiple factors may be at work .
One possibility is that depressed individuals have a broken link between the brain regions , such that regulatory centers fail to send any dampening signals to emotional centers .
Alternately , he says , depressed patients may fall prey to rumination on negative thoughts .
Maybe , he says , " When they try to engage in this regulation they just think more about the emotional content of the images .
Perhaps it 's quite maladaptive for them ... instead of turning down their emotional responses possibly they turn up their emotional responses . "

The results of this study may help identify appropriate treatment methods for people with depression , who represent a diverse patient population , says senior study author Richard Davidson .
Common psychological therapies use mental strategies similar to those used in this study , he says , and although psychotherapy might benefit patients who found conscious efforts effective in the scenarios provided in this study , it could be counterproductive for those patients whose mental efforts increased their emotional responses .
" Our results suggest that there is a subgroup of patients with depression for whom traditional cognitive therapy may be contraindicated , " Davidson says .
" Other therapeutic interventions may benefit this subgroup more than cognitive therapy , though this remains to be studied in future research . "
Identifying the involvement of emotional brain circuits may also help focus the development of new treatment strategies for depression and other psychiatric disorders .
" Emotional regulation underlies many psychiatric disorders , not only depression , " Johnstone says .
Long term , he says , " If we understand where the brain circuits are that are important and how they are involved in regulating emotion , then we can target them with different types of therapies . "
Other authors on the study include Carien van Reekum , Heather Urry , and Ned Kalin .
The work was funded by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and Wyeth - Ayerst Pharmaceuticals .

BioShock will be Ken Levine 's magnum opus .
It will be his career defining game .
It 's ambitious , unusual and aggressive , mixing the high polish expected of a " next generation " shooter , with equal parts storytelling , politics , and philosophy , all wrapped up in a bloody , underwater , 1940 's bow .
Some months ago , I spent a day with Levine and his team at Irrational Games in Quincy , MA .
It was a chance to see the game first hand before they were really ready to do any " hands - on " with the press , but mostly it was a chance to talk to one of the industry 's more interesting developers .
See , Ken Levine believes he 's blowing the doors off the first person shooter genre , and he 's daring you to prove him wrong .
But mostly , he 's asking you to think .
Ken Levine , the creative director at Irrational Games , is one of those storied industry personalities like a CliffyB or a John Carmack .
The difference is , he does n't really make anything normal , nor does he have weird hair or an attitude .
He makes , well , irrational games .
Games that do n't make a lot of commercial sense .
Our Story so Far
After years of working BioShock in his head , Levine brought the idea to publisher 2 K Games .
" We basically had nothing , " says Levine .
" We had ' Dude , this is gonna be awesome ! ' "
There was no logical reason for 2 K to fund BioShock , but they did , and ended up acquiring Irrational in the fall of 2005 .
" They made a leap of faith .
They said ' yeah Levine , go ahead and try and reinvigorate the first person shooter genre in an underwater utopia set in 1960 with little girls walking around . ' "
That leap was n't entirely into the dark .
Levine entered the gamer lexicon with Thief : The Dark Project and System Shock 2 .
The former arguably created the stealth - shooter genre ( albeit with bows , not sniper rifles ) .
System Shock 2 , released in 1999 , brought players into a freaky horror - movie plot with twists and turns that puts " Aliens " to shame .
He and his team at Irrational went on to make Freedom Force , and it 's sequel , Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich -- a franchise the smart money said could never make it .
A quasi -turn based 3/ 4 view super hero game without a Marvel or DC license ?
Impossible !
Of course , the Freedom Force franchise turned out to be finely crafted , excellent games , even if they did n't buy Levine a new Ferrari .
But after Freedom Force , Levine realized to make the game he really wanted to make -- his game -- his team needed to get their shooter chops back .
2007 is a very , very different world than 1999 .
So they took on S.W.A.T. 4 , a completely traditional ( and largely forgettable ) first person shooter .
" It was an interesting title for us , " acknowledges Levine .
It was finely tuned , very pretty , had good AI , and was fun .
It was good , but it was also completely un-extraordinary .
If you believe him ( which he makes it hard not to do ) , this was all according to Ken Levine 's secret - master - of - the - universe plan .
" It was about training our craft , and getting really good at making a first person shooter . "
How to make shooter interfaces .
How to use the Unreal 2 engine .
How to balance weapons and levels and information flow .
All along , deep inside the insidious mind of Levine , the goal seems always to have been BioShock , the " spiritual successor " to System Shock 2 .
" If you 're going to play your genre - reinvigorating - title , you better make sure you know all your notes and all your chords .
That 's why SWAT was really good for us . "
Levine ( like , I would imagine , most gamers ) had grown frustrated with the sameness of the shooter world in the waning years of the 20th century .
" I love shooters , I love Half Life , " he admits .
But as a player , he was getting bored .
" Think of a ball of string , " he says , calling on a signature metaphor he 's used repeatedly in the last 5 years .
" Most shooters are a ball of string you unroll .
You follow a path ... there 's only one way to go , there 's only one thing to do . "
Not so with BioShock .
The intent of BioShock is to give the player free will .
Rather than running through corridors , the player will explore a city .
Not a wide - open Grand Theft Auto city , to be sure , but a city nonetheless .
And the physical environment you explore , and the story it tells , will be unique .
At least , it wo n't look like one you 've seen in any other game .
" It 's a castaway story , " explains Levine , trying his best to boil down what is an expansive , layered plot to four words .
" You 're a guy in a plane crash , you end up on the surface of the ocean .
There 's a lighthouse in the distance , you swim to it , and it takes you to this strange city that nobody 's ever heard of . "
The city is Rapture .
In the 1940s , one Andrew Ryan , fed up with the world around him sucking the life , money , and art from the brightest minds of his age , creates Rapture : an underwater utopia .
As Ryan describes it in one of many in - game soliloquies :
" Build a city on the bottom of the ocean ?
Impossible .
But on the surface , all the parasites and hangers on would have taken this from us .
So the ONLY place to build the city I wanted to build was at the bottom of the ocean . "
Descending into Rapture , the player is indoctrinated into Ryan 's vision of the world .
Disneyesque , this " 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea " ride comes with a theme park voice over .
But on entering Rapture , the theme park ends .
Rapture was , for a time , the shining utopia Ryan hoped for -- a world of unfettered capitalism , science , art , and luxury .
But somewhere along the way it all goes wrong .
Rapture 's scientists discover the Sea Slug , a miraculous creature that oozes raw stem cells ( and , like virtually every signature creation of BioShock , named in a ham - handed fashion that you can either consider endearing or lazy ) .
The gooey stem - cell stuff -- called Adam ( see what I mean ) -- is the nectar of the gods .
With it , the citizens of Rapture can transform themselves , they can mutate , they can become more than human .
And of course , this kind of power causes all sorts of problems , especially in a flaccid , unregulated utopia .
The economy changes .
People get greedy .
The struggle for this limited resource presses the city into civil war .
The haves and have - nots clash .
After all , someone has to clean the toilets , and nobody wants it to be them .
A mysterious man named " Atlas " leads a rebellion against Ryan , and the war rages , fueled by genetically modified ( and insane ) warriors called splicers .
As the player enters this world , the civil war has taken a harsh toll .
At every corner , the ocean is trying to take the city back , seeping in over windows and around doors .
And nearly everyone you meet is either mutated , crazy , or both .
It 's built into seven distinct areas -- industrial centers , medical facilities , residential housing -- each designed to take hours for the player to explore , and it is a place worthy of exploration .
Rapture is bizarre and unsettling .
It 's an underwater art - deco nightmare of neon lights , brass railing , leaking pressure seals and the garbage of a thousand dead .
It screams -- aggressively -- its 1940s pulp inspiration .
" It 's always a challenge when you start on a game , how do you make something that 's familiar yet fresh , " says Levine .
" The music , and the clothes , the look of the advertising , we 're always trying to put it in a real place . "
Sitting next to the artists and designers , there 's little question that every corner of BioShock has been lovingly crafted .
Irrational licensed the Unreal 3 engine from Epic , the visual supercharger behind the hit Xbox 360 title Gears of War .
Like most developers , Irrational has taken this engine and tortured it until it bleeds a gritty reality full of fire , water , and dust .
From the few hours I spent touring the game 's architecture ( alas , over the shoulder , as my day at Irrational was before the game went " hands on " to the press ) they 've succeeded on at least a few levels .
Everything in the game feels both organic and polished at the same time .
And the environment is extremely interactive .
" Everything is searchable , " explains Levine .
His goal was to make the world of BioShock work correctly , like a simulation .
" If the user expects to be able to do something , they can do it in this world .
So you can freeze something and then shatter it , fire spreads correctly , and so on . "
So far , the team has succeeded .
In the chaos of a fire fight , everything moves .
Bottles shatter and fly , oil slicks spread across the floor and can catch fire .
Flammable objects ( including stuffed animals ) can be ignited and thrown .
If you throw an object into a pool of water , it floats , and the surface of the water ripples .
It simply feels real .
That feel carries over in a dozen subtle ways : wind , smoke , ricochets , the dirt on an old machine , the worn corners of the windows .
That finely crafted feel carries over into the players actions .
If It Moves , Kill It
BioShock is ( as both Levine , the PR people , and the designers reminded me every 20 minutes ) , a first person shooter .
You move smoothly , you duck behind corners , you collect weapons and ammo , and , of course , you shoot stuff .
The stuff you shoot depends largely on how you chose to play the game , and that 's where things get interesting .
The primary conceit of the game is the stem - cell mutating goo called Adam .
Adam is first and foremost a plot device .
It makes people super - human , and the citizens of Rapture who are addicted to the power it provides can't get any more .
That 's the hook .
" Things just started to go really , horribly wrong a few months ago , " Levine explains , setting up the world as the player enters it .
Civil war breaks out , and " it 's like Baghdad . "
A Baghdad where the weapon of choice is biological mutations : plasmids .
The " Bio " in BioShock comes from these plasmids .
They let the bad guys alter themselves in dozens of ways to become Splicers : uber - guerrillas .
" The effect of taking all these genetic modifications is it drives everyone crazy , " Ken explains .
And these Splicers are everywhere .
" They 're like all these crazy homeless people with superpowers . "
Because they killed off all the Sea Slugs , the only place the combatants can get the raw material for these modifications -- the Adam -- is from the dead .
This sets up the most horrific act of the game -- one you will see right away and witness many times in your journey through Rapture .
A little , bobble headed girl -- a " Little Sister " genetically engineered by unscrupulous scientists -- approaches a corpse , extracts blood from it with a heart - needle syringe and then swallows it down like a shot of tequila .
She 's not alone .
She 's never alone .
She always has her protector : a deep - sea - diver - suited , well - armed and lumbering monstrosity .
A " Big Daddy . "
He 's very protective , and designed to be very hard to kill .
This set piece of the game succeeds in being horrifying and stomach turning , two reactions difficult to achieve in any medium .
If it succeeds for you , it sets up the story by forcing you to make a choice -- a moral choice -- about how you are going to interact with these little girls .
" You come up to one of these Little Sisters and you immediately have a choice .
And it has immediate gameplay implications , " Levine says .
And those implications are very real .
Kill a splicer ?
Well a little sister may come along and leech him dry .
Exploit a Little Sister ?
You 've chosen a dark path that nets you immediate resources .
Protected her ?
Well , that 's a different path , with different rewards , different payback .
Either path has implications for the kinds of battles you will fight , how your character will develop , and how the story will go .
Of course , exactly how this plays out is a secret Levine 's holding close to the vest until the game launches , and how much you care about these role playing elements depends on both the kind of player you are , and how compelling you find the game 's fundamental Little Sister set piece .
And how successful the game is as an RPG is perhaps in conflict with the constant refrain that the game is a shooter .
Because no matter what path you take , you 're going to have to mow down bad guys to progress through the game .
Not satisfied with the standard handful of weapons provided by most shooters , the team at Irrational tries to drown players with choices .
Yes , you can access all your weapons with the number keys at the top of your keyboard ( or through mashing buttons on your controller ) .
But most weapons can be modified in different ways and take multiple kinds of ( scarce ) ammo .
Even more shocking for a shooter , you can actually ( gasp ) engage in a little crafting and make modifications yourself , or trade with other characters in game for that extra something special for the discriminating rocket - whore .
This customizable weapon system has a parallel in the personal augmentation available through plasmids .
With over 60 kinds available for your limited slots , building out your character becomes a kind of " what 's your MMO build " mini - game in its own right .
Like the naming conventions , the plasmid system borders on the goofy ; they 're available through vending machines like soda and candy .
But their easy availability means that the main enemies , the Splicers , can be just as hopped up as the player .
Given that they represent the primary mob in the game -- the equivalent to Doom 's demons -- they need this diversity or they could become boring enemies very , very quickly .
Instead , you never know what capabilities that freaked out woman with the glowing eyes may bring to bear .
These plasmids let you modify and slowly build your character in a way not - dissimilar to an RPG .
But do n't tell Ken that .
" This is not an RPG , " he demands .
" It 's not about stats .
This is about huge amounts of dynamic exciting player expression ... thousands of ways to exploit the environment , take control of things and use the world to your advantage . "
He 's passionate about this to the point of hyperbole and hand - waving .
Intelligent Design
And when he talks about using the world to your advantage , he 's not talking about hiding behind counters or flinging toilets with a gravity gun .
He 's talking about artificial intelligence .
Artificial intelligence is rarely intelligent .
In most first person shooters , AI boils down to how good the bad guys are at finding you , killing you , and defending themselves .
In BioShock , AI gets a little more complicated .
Here 's a typical gameplay moment from a day of watching encounter after encounter .
You enter a burned out bar .
There 's a Big Daddy and a Little Sister .
You need an ammo can you can just see under the cash register .
You try and sneak in , but you walk too close to the Big Daddy and he starts unloading lead at you .
He moves between you and the Little Sister , holding her with one hand , shooting with the other .
As you back up , you come in range of a security camera .
Alarms sound and two helicopter drones swoop in on you .
You run to a security console and quickly hack in , taking control of the bots .
They switch targets and now shoot at the Big Daddy .
A Splicer hears the ruckus and joins the fight .
You throw chemical goo at the Big Daddy , convincing the Splicer to change targets .
But as the Splicer ( now your ally ) attacks , he stumbles into a fire started by all the weapon blasts .
Screaming , he runs from the room , puts himself out in a pool of water , finds a health station , recharges , and comes back pissed .
The interactions happening in this fight are blisteringly complex and unscripted .
The Big Daddy has to constantly evaluate the biggest threat in the room , which is changing for him by the moment .
He also has to find the best position in the room from which protect the Little Sister .
The bots have to evaluate whom to attack on entering , and then whom to attack once you hack them .
The splicer has to make a choice of whom to attack , and then needs to decide whether to save his skin or fight , and choosing wisely , how to get back in the fight .
After witnessing encounters like this one a few times , it 's extremely clear that there is no script .
Everything that happens during this fight is a result of the players actions .
You could have chosen to run , to use a plasmid to make the Big Daddy think you were a Little Sister , to use one of dozens of weapon and plasmid combinations .
Your choices make the script frame by frame .
Even the presence of the Little Sister in the room at all is dictated by your actions long before you arrived for the fight .
If these cause and effect reactions within a complex AI system bear fruit throughout the arc of the game , it should make for a very , very good straight - up first person shooter .
The more effective the AI and the more interactive the world , the more interesting the game will be to play .
Playing puppet master to the designer running my preview , I tried anything I could think of , and I ran out of ideas .
You can grab a child 's teddy bear , set it on fire , and ignite the oil - stained suit of a Big Daddy .
You can kill distant enemies by electrifying the water in which they stand .
You can catch , throw , and break things telekinetically to have Darth Vader style junk fights .
And my personal favorite , you can freeze a bad guy with an ice plasmid , then shatter them into a million pieces with a wrench .
None of This Really Matters
If the game succeeds in half of it's Icarian goals , BioShock should be an excellent game .
And while you could play it only focusing on the weapons , the combat and the environment , and have a hell of a good time while making fireworks - audience noises at the pretty water and fire effects , you 'd be missing the point .
All of this talk of AI , graphics , gameplay and design -- this was the main reason to spend the day at Irrational .
It was the gig .
Sit in a conference room , walk through wire frames and concept art and interface design .
Guide as many hours of painfully hands - off puppeteering game play as I can get away with .
Challenge the developers where I can , try to circumnavigate PR and step outside the demo- levels and well - rehearsed gameplay vignettes .
Ask them to stop , go back , turn left , pick up this , throw that , show me what 's broken , show me what 's around that corner .
That 's the reason why PR people drag journalists in off the street .
By the end of the day , I 've exhausted Levine .
I 've run through all of their plans of what to show me , checked off all the boxes on my internal checklist .
My voice recorder is nearly full .
Time to change hats .
" I really appreciate all the time you 've given me today .
I think I have a good feel for the game , and what your trying to accomplish .
If you do n't mind , I just have a few more questions for Ken . "
The PR rep dismisses the rest of the crew from the conference room .
The PCs are turned off , the sound system stuck back in the corner .
Ken eats another muffin top and I grab a coke .
" OK I get it .
It 's a kick - ass shooter . "
This is PR code .
2 KGames , Irrational - the - company 's owner and publisher of BioShock , has mixed feelings about the game 's place in genre - space .
Early on , the press pigeonholed BioShock as a " hybrid RPG / Shooter . "
This scared the crap out of them , and for understandable reasons -- shooters sell , especially pretty shooters .
And in a pre-Oblivion world , there was little evidence that a flashy RPG designed for both the PC and Xbox had a shot .
So they 've established an inviolable PR hook -- it 's a kick - ass shooter .
But that 's not really the point .
It 's not why the game is interesting , or dare I say , important .
So I spent another hour talking with Levine about story , philosophy , politics , literature and the nature of being human .
The point of BioShock , the raison d'etre , is really the story , and the messages and intellectual content that Levine tries to deliver as a payload .
" Look at Lord of the Rings , " he challenges .
" Why is Lord of the Rings more interesting than random RPG story number 507 ?
They 're exactly the same thing .
They have orcs and goblins and demons and trolls .
But Lord of the Rings is a meditation on power .
And it 's really interesting because of that .
It 's what gives it it 's heart . "
And with undenied hubris , Levine 's trying to do the same thing with BioShock , while still delivering a game 16 - year - old cheese eating high school students will want to play .
" We have these philosophical notions , but you 've got to deliver .
You gotta bring home the monsters .
You gotta bring home the superpowers . "
In short , he 's become a commercial realist .
But he 's still determined to get the ideas across .
" Even as we live in a country divided , I feel that most of us are sort of in the middle .
And I think there are some really interesting themes to play on there . "
The most prominent character in BioShock -- Andrew Ryan , Rapture 's founder -- is an embodiment of a self - centered , free - will political ideology called Objectivism .
Objectivism is the brainchild of 1960s author Ayn ( rhymes with mine ) Rand .
She defined it thus : " Man as a Heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason his only absolute . "
Put more simply , an Objectivist says " the world is what it is , my place in it is important , the only way to know anything is to use your own head , and the best political system is one that leaves me the hell alone .
" Andrew Ryan is Ayn Rand meets Howard Hughes , " explains Levine .
The initial plot of BioShock -- the founding of this utopia -- mirrors the plot ( albeit through a glass darkly ) of Rand 's 1960 's epic book " Atlas Shrugged . "
In " Atlas Shrugged " the worlds elite -- the " atlases " -- stage a minor rebellion and remove themselves to a better place : a valley where they can be free of the eye and hand of the world 's governments and those who would leech off their talents .
While the rhetoric of Rapture 's founder , Andrew Ryan ( an anagram of Ayn Rand with an extra " rew " thrown in for obfuscation ) sounds like a Randian polemic , his nemesis is ambiguously named " Atlas . "
To figure out which one is really the good guy or the bad guy , we 'll all have to play the game .
BioShock 's story -- for those who wish to stop blowing things up to delve into it -- is about translating this Objectivist ideology into the real world .
" One of the things that 's very appealing about Rand to me , and about Rapture , is at least in the beginning they 're driven by reason . "
Indeed , this is what attracts most people to Objectivism : it 's based on rationality above all else .
By both highlighting and skewering Objectivism , Levine 's on the warpath against zealots .
" I 'm trying to write about what happens when real people try to do things , " he explains .
" The characters in Ayn Rand 's books are paragons . "
But paragons are n't real people , and Levine has written his characters to be as real as possible .
They may be drawn in broad strokes , but they 're human .
" Real people are n't perfect .
That 's the problem with ideologies .
Real people carry out ideologies .
So even the best of intentions gets screwed up . "
To attempt to do this in a game -- not a college art project , but an actual commercial blockbuster game -- is phenomenally ambitious .
" You do n't elevate the discussion by saying ' listen to me ! ' " says Levine .
" You get it by saying ' look this is awesome , oh and by the way we 're also talking about being a human being .
We 're also talking about power . ' "
So knowing the story he wanted to tell , he spent most of his time and resources on making the awesome , and thus , that 's what we hear about .
" To get the themes I wanted to get in the game and make sure it was n't blah blah blah , that was the hardest challenge as a writer . "
A writer .
At the end of the day , that 's what Ken Levine 's Matrix - level residual self image is .
He slips that title in when his guard drops , when he 's tired , when he 's sure I 've absorbed ' the awesome ' and that I 've got the PR hook .
He 's writing a story .
He 's just showing it , not telling it .
" If you know the Little Sisters are carrying the most important resource in the world , they 're these little girls going around taking the resource from dead bodies .
That 's telling you something about the economy of this world .
It tells you something about how f*cked up it is . "
It 's clear that when Levine talks about ' this world ' he means not just the world of Rapture , but the world currently revolving around his Quincy , MA office .
And games are the medium he 's chosen to make his point .
" If people take anything intellectual away from this game , I hope it 's just ' here some new ideas , think about them . '
But there 's no polemic in this except think for yourself .
And watch out if someone is telling you that something is absolutely true . "
It 's anti-zealotry , pure and simple .
" That 's a message I think Rand would be very comfortable with .
You have your own reason .
All human systems are fallible . "
In another world , Ken Levine might have been a novelist , and his team at Irrational his writers group , meeting around a dusty table in a Parisian cafe .
Like Ayn Rand , he might have written a 1,000 page opus on power , free will , and human fallibility .
Instead he 's making BioShock .

It also includes information on Postal my mail host server benchmark .
Version 1.04 will hopefully be the last release of Bonnie ++ 1.x . I hope that now I can concentrate on version 2.0 which will have many new features .
I knew saying that was asking for trouble .
GCC came out and broke it , 1.03a makes it compile with GCC 3.2 .
The putc / getc results will be slightly lower with GCC 3.2 though ...
I 've been a bit slack with 2.x development , so I had to release a new 1.03b version .
Adds write support for zcav as the main change .

MIAMI , March 23 — Pondering his options after eight years in office , former Gov. Jeb Bush can cross one off the list , honorary degree recipient at the University of Florida , the largest university in the state .
The Faculty Senate there rejected a proposal on Thursday to award Mr. Bush an honorary degree this spring .
Some members openly criticized his policies .
It is the first time in memory that the group has rejected a nominee put forth by its honorary degrees committee , said J. Bernard Machen , the university president .
The Senate voted , 38 to 28 , against the proposal , which came from a former president of the university and was supported by two university trustees appointed by Mr. Bush .
Representative John Kline , a Minnesota Republican and retired Marine colonel , said he was “ doubly , triply , quadruply appalled ” at the “ clear breakdown in leadership ” that allowed some Army contracting officers to corrupt the procurement system .
He said it was inexcusable that it took so long for the Army to put adequate checks in place .
Pentagon officials did not dispute the seriousness of the problems .
However , they took issue with lawmakers ’ characterizations of their scope .
“ I think it ’s isolated incidents , ” said Thomas F. Gimble , the principal deputy Pentagon inspector general .
“ The real issue is a lack of control , a lack of integrity and lots of opportunity and lots of money . ”
Mr. Gimble and the other Pentagon officials said they were working aggressively to identify officers and civilians responsible for crimes and turn them over for prosecution , increasing the numbers of contracting officers and lawyers in Kuwait and improving the contracts and ethics training they provide to their specialists .
The Pentagon officials said that they would turn the largest contracts in Kuwait over to more seasoned military procurement specialists in the United States and that they had set up a more rigorous set of contract review procedures .
And the Pentagon inspector general has been sent to Iraq to investigate the department ’s contracting procedures .
“ I do n’t think it was a widespread conspiracy or cultural issue , ” said Lt. Gen. N. Ross Thompson 3rd of the Army , a senior procurement official who is co-leader of an Army review of contracting procedures in Kuwait and Iraq .
“ We ’ve got a number of individual cases .
All the ones we know about are being actively investigated .
We ’ve got internal controls to make sure there are n’t new problems in different areas . ”
As of Sept. 12 , the Army reported that it had 78 cases of fraud and corruption under investigation , had obtained 20 criminal indictments , and had uncovered over $ 15 million in bribes .
Lawmakers scolded the Pentagon for just recently ordering the creation of a special contracting corps of experienced procurement specialists  authorized in the legislation two years ago  to bolster purchasing teams in the most active combat zones , and to report directly to a regional military commander .
“ That it ’s taken two years to do this is an indication of a system that ’s quite slow , ” said Representative Duncan Hunter of California , the senior Republican on the committee .
“ That ’s half the time it took to win World War II . ”

Windows XP outsold Windows Vista at retail outlets by approximately 60 % in the first week of commercial availability .
According to research firm NPD , boxed copies of Windows Vista have n't exactly been flying off the shelves and sales trailed at a distance in comparison to those of Windows XP .
Microsoft has invested in excess of $ 500 million in the marketing campaign for Windows Vista , while Windows XP only has $ 200 million , but failed to tip the balance in Vista 's favor .
NPD revealed that Vista retail sales are 58.9 % lower than those of XP .
The weaker Vista sales are in correlation with lower revenue .
According to NPD , Windows Vista revenue was also down 32.1 % from XP 's performance back in 2001 .
The only aspect where Windows Vista managed to outperform XP was in PC sales .
In the first week of availability , sales of machines preloaded with Windows Vista outperformed sales of XP - based PCs by 67 % .
Microsoft managed to sell an estimated 300,000 copies of Windows XP in the operating system 's launch week .
In the first week they hit the shelves , Windows 98 was sold in over 400,000 copies .
Some 25,000 copies of Windows Vista have been sold every day for a forecasted total of 125,000 in the first week .
That is less than even Windows 2000 that scratched the 200,000 units sold milestone .
In this context , Vista sales are affected by the operating system 's hardware requirements .
" All the reviewers have been beating people over the head about hardware requirements , " commented Chris Swenson , NPD 's director of Software Industry Analysis .
" The preliminary data suggests that consumers are getting the message that they need a more robust system to take advantage of some of the new features in Vista .
So , although total dollars were down compared to XP , I think the preliminary data shows that Microsoft 's gamble on a new high - end Vista SKU will help keep dollar volumes from declining as rapidly as unit volumes in the near term . "
Washington --
Free speech took a beating with another round of arrests September 18 in the nation 's capital .
It was administered by the police at a rally sponsored by the most unlikely - sounding group to be involved in such a thing : Veterans for Freedom .
U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman , John McCain and Lindsey Graham were among the featured speakers at the rally held in Upper Senate Park on Capitol Hill .
About 150 people attended the rally to support the group 's pro-war position , as did about 30 people who were not in support .
Before the rally concluded , Leah Bolger , David Barrows , Christine Rainwater , Anne Kitridge , and Anne Katz were arrested by Capitol Police . Â
Barrows said he had gone to the park because he heard Lieberman was going to speak .
When the Senator was talking , Barrows spoke out , " I do n't want your ' bomb and run genocide ' in Iran . "
As soon as I did , a plainclothes policeman came up to me and said , " You 're under arrest , " the 60 year - old D.C. resident continued .
But , Barrows said , instead of going with the officer immediately he moved another six feet closer to the stage , whereupon he was placed under arrest .
It was n't until he was taken to the Capitol Police station that Barrows discovered one of the charges against him was assault .
" They told me I was being charged with assaulting a Gold Star mother at the rally .
When I looked at their report , the accuser 's name and address had been blacked out but I recognized the photo of a well - groomed Asian - American woman I 'd seen around Capitol Hill several times .
Â
Why in the world would I assault a Gold Star Mother ?
It makes no sense . "
Barrows was given a " stay away " order ( not allowed to step foot on and Capitol property which includes the Capitol Building , the five House and Senate office buildings , and assorted bits of property adjoining them ) and has a trial date pending . Â
Bolger , a retired Navy Commander and member of Veterans For Peace , said she went to the park for the same reason Barrows did , " to hear Lieberman , McCain and Lindsey Graham .
She was arrested and charged with unlawful assembly .
After a night in the D.C. Metro Police lockup she pled not guilty at her arraignment .
Trial is set for October 23 in D.C. Superior Court .Â
" It 's just bizzare , " the Corvallis , Oregon resident said .
How can I be charged with ' unlawful assembly ' when I was at an outdoor rally in a public park sponsored by someone else ?
I was in the Hart Senate Office Building when I heard Lieberman was supposed to speak , and I went to hear him . "
She said she was sympathetically talking with a member of a group called " Families United " about the pain of losing a loved one , when a Capitol Hill police officer told her and Adam Kokesh , co-chair of Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) to move to the other side of a sidewalk serving as a rough demarcation line between the Veterans for Freedom members and others , generally defined . Â
Bolger continued that , " At one point in his remarks , Senator Graham gestured to those of us separated from the main group and said , ' These people just do n't get it .
The reason your loved ones fought and died was for them to have the right to do what they 're doing right now . '
Bolger responded out loud to Lieberman that " You ca n't win when you 're killing innocent people . "
" Then the cop told me , ' this is your second warning , ' " Bolger added .
" And then when I said to Lieberman , ' This war is wrong .
America is wrong . '
I was arrested .
Somehow I doubt the same thing would have happened had I said ' God Bless America ' really loudly . " Â Â Â
Another person arrested , Annie Katz , from Kingston , New York , said reading the Constitution aloud in Upper Senate Park that day was enough to get her arrested . Â
Attorney Jack Berringer , who represented Barrows and Bolger in , complained of what he called the court 's " preventive " use of stay away orders to limit the movements of protesters and potential protesters , but as aggravating as those are , he said , " they 're not the real story here .
The real story is how these people ( Bolger , Barrows , and others arrested in peace protests ) are fighting to keep free speech alive . " Â
Berringer referred to a web site that several people are constructing who have represented themselves " pro se " in similar cases .
He and attorney Mark Goldstone are advising the group 's work which he hopes will become a legal resource for others .

people are crazy and life would drive people crazy
IN his address to the nation on Thursday , President Bush singled out progress in Anbar Province as the model for United States success in Iraq .
The president ’s claims echoed those made earlier in the week by Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top American commander in Iraq , in his Congressional testimony .
And they raised a question worth examining : Do United States military alliances with Sunni tribal leaders truly reflect a turning of hearts and minds away from Anbar ’s bitter anti-Americanism ?
The data from our latest Iraq poll suggest not .
Al Qaeda , it should be said , is overwhelmingly — almost unanimously — unpopular in Anbar , as it is in the rest of Iraq .
But our enemies ’ enemies are not necessarily our friends .
The United States , it turns out , is equally unpopular there .
In a survey conducted Aug. 17 - 24 for ABC News , the BBC and NHK , the Japanese broadcaster , among a random national sample of 2,212 Iraqis , 72 percent in Anbar expressed no confidence whatsoever in United States forces .
Seventy - six percent said the United States should withdraw now — up from 49 percent when we polled there in March , and far above the national average .
Withdrawal timetable aside , every Anbar respondent in our survey opposed the presence of American forces in Iraq — 69 percent “ strongly ” so .
Every Anbar respondent called attacks on coalition forces “ acceptable , ” far more than anywhere else in the country .
All called the United States - led invasion wrong , including 68 percent who called it “ absolutely wrong . ”
No wonder : Anbar , in western Iraq , is almost entirely populated by Sunni Arabs , long protected by Saddam Hussein and dispossessed by his overthrow .
I can deal with old people .
I can deal with crackheads .
I can deal with the senile , retarded , and the stupid .
I cannot deal with retired school teachers .
I ’m sorry , it had to be said , I know i’m going to get hate mail up the ass , but sweeping stereotypes are my specialty .
Copays :
They always / always / bitch and question about their copay .
It doesnt matter if they have been paying the same amount for the last 12 months , they will / always / complain and make you look it up .
Then , when they are proven to be wrong , they bitch !
( see Accountability below ) .
Know It All :
They think they know everything about everything .
Does n’t matter what drug it is , what class it is , they did research on the int0rweb and know 1000 x more than you do .
They will sit there and throw around big medical words like they are going out of style .
All you can do is try to contain your laughter at this point as they make no sense what so ever .
Entitlement :
They want trade name .
Always .
Insurance doesnt cover it ?
Then I guess its the pharmacists responsibility to make sure that it gets covered with zero copay because I demand trade name .
If that does n’t work they sit there and bitch about it .
When the insurance does cover it , they bitch about the $ 50 copay for that $ 400 drug !
You know , I ’m sorry that you make crap wages , but just add that onto the list of things that are n’t my problem .
You knew going into the job that the pay was crap .
For acting so fucking smart you obviously did n’t do your homework to realize that you would be making jack and shit .
Furthermore , if you say you teach “ for the children ” then you should be happy with with you are getting , because you ’re doing it “ for the children ” and not “ for the paycheck ”
Anyways ….
I have a rifle , a shotgun and a few rounds of ammunition locked away in my gun safe .
Should I learn that enemy soldiers are landing on the beach , I will hobble down to the dunes and kill as many of them as I can before they kill me .
That being said , as long as foreign folk stay on their side of the border , I do n’t give a birdie ’s tweet what they do or say or think .
We should drop the motto " In God We Trust " and adopt a new one , " Let Us Mind Our Own Business . "
Isolationism , as defined by George Washington , is an exceedingly good policy .
Washington warned us in his " Farewell Address " to steer clear of entangling alliances , foreign quarrels and feuds .
They do n’t concern us , he said .
Our only concerns , vis -à - vis foreign powers , should be friendship and commerce .
We should treat all countries equally , granting neither favors nor trying to harm anyone .
The only leaders we should be concerned about are our own .
God knows we have a difficult time choosing good ones among our own people without worrying about the leaders people in other countries choose or have to live under .
Given the economy , the poverty , the decaying infrastructure and the enormous mountains of debt , we have enough on our plate without trying to solve any other country ’s problems .
We should end foreign aid , abolish the CIA and withdraw from all international organizations , including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
Americans would be astounded at how much money they could save if we shucked the empire , and pretty soon they would be amazed at how much the rest of the world actually liked us once we quit interfering in their lives .
I am , of course , indulging in wishful thinking .
The empire is very profitable for an elite few .
Every foreigner with his hand in our treasury has hired lobbyists and public - relations firms to make sure it stays there .
On the whole , Congress is gutless and , to a large extent , brainless .
Some members are outright crooks , and others have oiled the zippers on their trousers .
They are in love with the sound of their own voices .
Most are contemptuous of the voters , confident they can dupe enough of them for a slim majority at the next election .
There are a handful of honorable public servants , but they are such a minority and so studiously ignored by the corporate media that chances of improvement from within are slim to none .
And let ’s face it :
We the American people , beneficiaries of a free republic , are on the whole woefully ignorant , woefully apathetic and woefully selfish .
I used to tease my friend at the local chamber of commerce who fancied himself a conservative .
I called him a long - distance conservative .
He wanted the federal government to save money by not spending any in Oregon , but he lusted after every federal dollar he could lure to his own city .
Local media are likewise .
They will openly upbraid a congressman who fails to bring home the bacon , now referred to as an " earmark . "
We may or may not be too incompetent to run our own country , but there is no doubt that we are incompetent to rule the world .
President Bush , who seems to wish he were Caesar , makes one blunder after another .
The only question remaining is , Will he run out of term before he runs out of opportunities to finish wrecking the country ?
He ’s made a pretty complete mess of the Middle East and seems intent on restarting the Cold War with Russia .
As a measure of his stupidity , even as the angry Russians resume regular flights of their long - range strategic nuclear bombers , he is moving the North American Aerospace Defense Command out of its protective mountain bunker and into an office building .
Now that ’s smart , eh ?

In my studies of Qi , I often use Haskell as an endless pool for mining good ideas .
I find that by translating these ideas into Qi , I end up learning both Qi and Haskell better than I would have done by trying to understand them separately .
For example , I was immediately able to understand that " Multi- parameter Type Classes with Undecidable instances " was really just " Sequents with bad syntax . "
But one area that Haskell reigns supreme is the Type Class .
Qi does have a sub-classing mechanism .
If you define a type under the universal truth thatthen you can define a type rule that saysand integers can now go wherever numbers go .
Basically , it is a promise to the compiler that you are REALLY sure the implementations of the types match up and all the proper functions have been provided .
Honest .
You promise ...
That tends to fail in practice .
And this sub-classing system does not provide any ability to do ad hoc polymorphism .
The Haskell idea is to use special syntax to pass around a hidden object that carries all of the required functions and is properly typed .
They call this a Type Class .
It is an incredibly handy feature because it provides a way to guarantee that you have met the basic needs of a function that requires the type class .
It also allows function overloading , a feature Qi lacks .
So how would this feature look if ported inside of Qi ?
I would imagine it would looks something like the following code snippet .
Note that the " class_ " prefix on * is due to Qi not allowing the redefinition of operators .
I 'll use that notation convention throughout , as I rebuild the ( num N ) class in Qi .
The meaning of the statement is the same as Haskell .
If I have a ( num N ) class then I can use the class_* to call the proper function .
Internally , Qi would transform this construct into the following along the same manner as Haskell .
The code to perform this transformation will not be provided .
This code would have to be intimately tied into the type system and would require a very large change to Qi .
It may be worth it , but it is not the point of this article .
I will perform the transformation by hand and demonstrate from there .
For the purposes of this article , I will be providing the base types integer and float .
They both have their own type specific operations .
I will create instances of them into the ( num N ) class which will also propagate that instance to the subtype ( eq N ) .
Haskell defines the EQ class asHaskell hides the creation of the constructor type for EQ , but in the final transformation it gets an explicit expression inside the compiler .
The final transformation should create both a new Qi datatype and some new generic functions that the type class requires .
I provide the transformation in Qi below .
As you can see , the idea is to pass along the proper EQ object for the function type and use pattern matching to splice in the arguments and the proper function and then call it .
Getting this transformation to take arbitrary code and make these datatypes and functions requires most of the work .
The final result can work as these hand written functions do , but a real implementation would structure things differently .
The instance declaration in Haskell looks something like the following
The final transformation of the Qi code would look like the following snippet .
It provides the needed functions for the type class by taking the type specific functions and putting them into a type class container .
This is the same container that we send to every function that requires a type class .
All we need to do is provide the base implementations in the proper spots .
In a full Qi type class implementation , we would have to use some special syntax or data structure to cause these functions to auto - generate themselves .
When we run the code , it behaves as expected .
Notice that line 42 fails .
To perform this kind of analysis , we will need a type class that captures both equality and the idea of being a number , with a way to translate them from the integers .
Haskell defines the ( num N ) type in a way very close to the form below .
We can define an equivalent structure in Qi by embedding the eq subclass directly into the mknum structure .
The compiler would also need to provide a function to walk the subclass tree .
The basic function definitions work like equal type class from above .
And we declare the instance by providing all of the functions in their proper slots .
So now we have what we need to take on 2.0 == 2 .
If we encapsulate that into a function ' istwo ? ' we can see the transformation a bit more clearly .
Ideally , the above ' istwo ? ' function should be auto - generated by the following Qi like code .
Note that the type system would wrap the small constants in frominteger and call the subclass datatype return function to make a valid class_equal call .
To finish , I 'll implement squares and sumsquares that work across the type class ( num N ) .
In short , type classes are a very powerful programming tool that Qi lacks and should probably have .
They give Qi ad hoc polymorphism and define types that also have guarantees about which functions it supports .
It would take a fairly large change to the Qi codebase to support the shorthand syntax , but I hope this article has proven that we can implement the powerful Haskell type system in Qi .
Thank you for your time .

Towleroad has this video from CNN up ; it ’s an interview with Major Darryl Tolleson of the Atlanta Police Department on the kind of folks his unit has busted for having sex in public restrooms — they ’ve busted CEOs , bank presidents , law professors , you name it … but most of them are straight identified , with wives and children in the dark about their netherworld activities .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThGNpOpozFs]
“ The majority of these men , they have families … You would think that it would be a gay issue but overhwhelmingly more and more , we ’re seeing that these are people with families . ”
Yes , it ’s these pathetic hetero - identified closet cases making their way to these restrooms to engage in their same - sex desires , regardless of the impact on those families that they prize for social acceptance .
Meanwhile , those of us out here fighting to obtain our civil rights stand vulnerable to the political activities and judgment from Larry Craig and others like him .
Sara Whitman at Huff
Post nails it :
He claimed a higher moral ground while he was cruising for sex in bathrooms because … well , because his fundraising clearly depended on it .
It ’s doubtful that a gay man in Idaho would get elected Senator but I might be wrong about that .
Regardless , if he wanted to be in the closet , still stay married , be a Senator , well , I can understand all of that .
It ’s not easy to be out , it means job discrimination , it means physical harassment and sometimes violence , it means not being able to have your loved one be your legal spouse or any of those benefits .
It means , often , losing your family and friends .
It ’s not an easy path .
I can respect anyone who chooses to live in the closet on one condition :
They do n’t actively fight for laws in an elected office that allow for discrimination , hate and bigotry .
If Senator Craig needs a pick me up every now and then from the men ’s room , I think that ’s pathetic , but … to each his own and understand , you ’re going to get caught .
***
National Black Justice Coalition on Larry Craig
In a similar vein , Alexander Robinson of the National Black Justice Coalition has a thoughtful piece on the Senator Larry Craig ’s “ dilemma ” — it ’s particularly relevant because it raises the issue of the fluidity of sexuality and the phenomenon of men who identify as heterosexual engaging in sex with men , something often brought up in discussions about the Down Low ( usually associated with black men in popular culture ) .
The Craig incident shows how colorblind the phenomenon is — there are a lot of “ family men ” cruising restrooms , parks and other public areas where illicit sexual encounters take place because these men cannot accept their same - sex desires as moral or legitimate .
They act out inappropriately .
Since Sen .
Craig clearly attempted to engage in gay sexual behavior but publicly denies a gay sexual identity does this mean that he is in sexual denial or perhaps deeply closeted ?
Not necessarily .
Often men who engage in the underground culture of public restroom , rest stop , tea room sex do so as an act of sexual titillation , sexual release , and an immediate sexual gratification .
They are fueled by the sexual thrill of getting caught , doing something that is taboo and the potential danger of seeking out homoerotic encounters with men who otherwise would strictly identify as heterosexual .
So in every sense and definition of the word , the sex that these men have is truly , utterly and exclusively recreational .
It is void of emotional value , love , respect , intimacy or an expectation of a romantic relationship to come .
For them having male - to - male sex is truly a sport , a hobby , a distraction and a pastime or rebellion against convention with no emotional attachment or desire for more .
He covers the differences on how black and white DL men are treated in the media , as well as the reasons why many blacks refer to themselves as same - gender - loving ( SGL ) because of the media - driven image of what “ gay ” is .
This is also the case for Larry Craig , who finds no identification with “ gay . ”
Today for an individual to self - identity as gay , they seemingly must take on an image created by the media that is based upon societal stereotypes .
For men , we must be either feminine or super gym macho bunnies .
We must be either florists or hairdressers or super witty , smart , affluent and overly - successful .
But all too often , the gay identity most exclusively seen and portrayed is that of white men and their lives ( i.e. Will and Grace , Queer as Folk ) .
Sen. Larry Craig rejects this identity , because simply this is not who he is .
He is a conservative , married man who has very little in common with America ’s gay identity .
In fact he is perfectly valid in stating that he is not a gay man .
I urge you to read the rest and comment .
A Low - Fi Solution to E- Mail Overload : Sentenc.es
I ’ve written about e-mail overload issues in the past , and today I ’m presenting what I believe is a simple , low - fi solution : sentenc.es .
In a nutshell , I have two issues with e-mail :
More than any other medium in the world , the time commitment difference between sender and receiver is huge .
For instance , if you call me on the phone and we chat for 10 minutes , that ’s 10 minutes of your time and 10 minutes of my time .
If you write me a handwritten letter and I write you one back , that ’s maybe 30 minutes of your time and 30 minutes of my time .
If we exchange text messages , that ’s 10 seconds from you and 10 seconds from me .
But with email , often times the sender will ask two or three open - ended one sentence questions which elicit multi-paragraph answers .
In these cases , the sender spends one minute and the receiver is asked , implicitly , to spend maybe an hour .
When faced with an inbox of 100 - 400 messages , I usually find myself replying to the messages which are quickest to reply to , rather than which are most important to reply to .
The end result is a continual paring down of my inbox until I have 50 really important messages to reply to which are then too old to take care of .
In thinking about how to reduce this problem for me personally , I came up with a technology solution which , while cool , would require way too much buy - in from OS makers , mail application providers , and individuals .
Essentially , whenever you send me an e-mail , I ’d like to be able to instantly pop up a Toast or Growl message on your desktop for a few seconds with a status message of my choice .
Something like “ Current response time estimate : 7 days ” or something more personable .
I do n’t like auto - responder e-mails because I ’m not trying to clog up your inbox , but the ability to send you a quick , fleeting status message would be excellent .
Perhaps even when you just hover over my name in the To : field before you even send the mail .
Annnnnnnyways … that solution is a bit too hi- fi and it does n’t really solve the core problem , so instead I ’m enacting a new policy today which seems potentially much more effective :
Every e-mail I send to anyone , regardless of subject or recipient , will be five sentences or less .
Like a cinquain .
Ideally , it would be a 160 character count like an SMS message , but since that would require an actual e-mail plug - in ( viz. “ work ” ) , we ’ll go with the much - easier - to - count concept of sentences instead .
In order to politely explain the systematic brevity with a similar amount of brevity , I will link to a new site I just set up called five .
sentenc.es in my signature line .
By ensuring that all e-mails I send out take the same amount of time to send ( viz. “ not a lot ” ) , I am evening the playing field between emails and attending to many more of them in the end .
Observe the difference :

Q : Why is this email 5 sentences or less ?
A : http://five.sentenc.es
Huge difference .
What makes it all the more easy is that before I even give my response , I already know it ’s going to be five sentences max , so there is little reason to procrastinate about it .
And on top of that , if the occasion is right , you can even start rhyming and turn it into a legitimate cinquain .
So that ’s it .
The super low - fi , systematic solution to e-mail overload .
It ’s in beta now , but you feel free to link to five .
sentenc.es in your own e-mails , or any of the sister sites at two .
sentenc.es , three .
sentenc.es , or four .
sentenc.es depending on your desired level of brevity .
Special thanks to the government of Spain for making this possible .

Not so long ago Emma Watson was bemoaning her inability to find a boyfriend .
The 17 - year - old actress feared her feisty portrayal of Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films might have intimidated potential suitors .
But last week , Emma 's fears seemed unfounded as she enjoyed a magical time on the French Riviera under the spell of
handsome young rugby player
Tom Ducker .

The teenagers were spotted hanging out in nightclubs and eating lobster with £ 90 bottles of champagne in an expensive seafront restaurant .
Staff at their hotel , Chateau de la Chevre d'Or in Eze , near Nice – where suites with ocean views cost £ 385 a night – described Emma and Tom , who is also 17 , as ' delightful guests ' .
In the five years since the first Harry Potter film , Emma – like
co-star Daniel Radcliffe – has accrued a fortune , estimated at
£ 10 million .
But unlike Daniel , who insists he only buys things that cost about £ 10 , such as books and DVDs , Emma appears much less prudent – at least when she is on holiday .

While sipping Veuve Clicquot in the Castel Plage restaurant on the famous Promenade des Anglais near Nice 's old town , she was taken by some artwork , worth about £ 15,000 , that was hanging on the wall – and offered the owner cash for it .
The work , entitled " Je suis incognito ici , faites le savoir " ( I'm incognito here , tell everybody ) is by renowned Italian artist Ben Vautier .
" Emma fell in love with it and offered to buy it there and then , " said owner Ali Abdelhafidh .
" The words on the piece seemed to sum up her evening .
But sadly it just was n't for sale , so she posed for a photo next to the picture instead . "
He added : " They arrived quietly at about 7.30 pm and drank champagne and ate lobsters all night .
They were clearly loving each other 's company and said they were in a very romantic place , with the Mediterranean just in front of them and great music .

" They said they were having a wonderful holiday and did not leave until well after 2 am .
It was great to see a young couple so much in love but Emma had time for everyone else , too .
" A lot of celebrities come here , including Elton John and Bono , but having Emma here was something special .
She 's a real star in every sense of the word . "
A fellow diner said : " They were knocking back the champagne and did n't stop laughing and joking .
Emma was acting like
a beautifully mannered young woman .
Castel Plage is very sophisticated and the two of them looked in their element . "
But back home in Chipping Norton , Oxfordshire , Tom 's father John , 50 ,
said : " They are just friends – do n't read anything more into it than that .
My wife and I have met Emma once or twice .
She is a lovely young lady . "

Emma met Tom , who has signed for Wasps , in Oxford where she lives .
Like her , he is an academic high - flier , scoring near - perfect grades in his GCSEs last year .
Although Emma 's parents have set up a trust fund to bank her riches until she is
21 , she receives a monthly allowance believed to be well into four figures .
The couple told staff at Castel Plage that they would also be sampling the nightlife in nearby Cannes and
St Tropez , before heading east to the Italian Riviera .
Emma , who was born in Paris and speaks good French , said she was " having a wonderful time " and glad to be away from the " Harry Potter madness back home " .
Meanwhile , negotiations are under way to secure Emma , Daniel , and Rupert Grint , who plays Ron Weasley , in their roles for the final two instalments of the blockbuster series .
Emma has often hinted that she is uncertain about a commitment that will tie her up until she is 20 , especially as her role left her
little time for romance , despite being surrounded by hundreds of " cute guys working on the crew " .
In a recent interview she said : " People say to me , ' It must be so easy for you .
They must be lining up for you . '
It 's not easy .
It 's a minefield .
Really .
It 's stressful . "
But , perhaps , not any more .
Design Patterns was a great book , no question .
It 's still in my Top Ten List of books every programmer should read .
It 's a beautifully crafted book , and I get a rush of nostalgia when I read through it , ten years since it was published .
It was a seminal work , groundbreaking , something that revolutionized software engineering almost overnight .
Unfortunately , for the vast majority of programmers worldwide , including many of our interview candidates , it might as well have been written in Greek , or Smalltalk .
Well , actually it * was * written in Smalltalk , but nobody seems to have minded ; most people thought that was pseudocode .
Here 's what most people got out of Design Patterns : " blah blah blah blah SINGLETON blah blah blah blah " .
I kid you not .
I 've seen this so many times that it 's become a full - fledged pattern in its own right ; patterns need a name , so let 's call it the Simpleton Pattern .
The Simpleton Pattern unfolds like this :
Me : So !
Have you ever heard of a book called Design Patterns ?
Them :
Oh , yeah , um , we had to , uh , study that back in my software engineering class .
I use them all the time .
Me : Can you name any of the patterns they covered ?
Them : I loved the Singleton pattern !
Me : OK .
Were there any others ?
Them :
Uh , I think there was one called the Visitater .
Me : Oooh , that 's right !
The one that visits potatoes .
I use it all the time .
Next !!!
I actually use this as a weeder question now .
If they claim expertise at Design Patterns , and they can ONLY name the Singleton pattern , then they will ONLY work at some other company .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's as if they said they 'd read Gödel , Escher , Bach , and I asked what they liked best about it , and they said they liked Achilles , but they also thought the Tortoise was pretty cool .
Not that they were n't !
But if that 's all that people took away from it , then no wonder Hofstadter has turned into such a grump about it .
Everyone Loves Singleton
Why is the Singleton so attractive ?
I 'll be the first to admit : I liked it too .
No , scratch that - I loved the Singleton .
It felt like an old friend from the moment I laid eyes on it .
It was simple and beautiful .
I 'll tell you why : it 's because the Singleton pattern is a throwback to non-OO programming .
It 's a lifeline for people who did n't understand a single word that the Gang of Four were trying to say .
I do n't know how it got in there in the first place -- some political OOPSLA pressure , no doubt -- but it does n't belong in there .
It 's Evil .
In my Data Structures course in college , when we got to AVL trees , my prof turned and wrote on the board , in huge , clear letters :
AVL Trees are EVIL
... and that 's all we had to learn about them .
He had us implement red / black trees and splay trees instead .
To this day , I have no idea how threaded AVL trees work .
But if that 's OK with Dan Weld , it 's OK with me .
But now I know how he felt .
Singleton Considered Warm and Fuzzy
Of course I loved all of Design Patterns , except for pages 243 to 256 , which had the magic property of inducing a coma - like trance whenever I tried to skim through them .
I could put on a black ninja suit and sneak through the building , and presuming I did n't get arrested , I could tear those pages out of every single copy of Design Patterns at Amazon , and almost nobody would notice .
That 's because it 's the most important one , so of course nobody gets it .
I sure did n't !
I do n't hold it against you , of course .
Nobody does a very good job of explaining that one .
It takes a very , very long time before people can appreciate it , and many people never do .
If YOU do , I have openings on my team .
Anyway , I liked Singleton for the same reason everyone does : it 's almost exactly the way I programmed back when I did n't know jack squat about OOP .
The only significant difference is that instead of having a file with a bunch of global functions in it , I have a file with a CLASS that has a bunch of global functions .
No need to worry my little head about how many of them to have , since you only need one !
It 's OOP made easy .
The standard justification for Singleton is : " Use this pattern whenever it 's clear that you will only ever need ONE instance of this class at a time . "
The example they use in Design Patterns is a print spooler .
Obviously you 'll only ever need one of those , so you should make it a Singleton , right ?
Right !
Unless you need another one with different behavior , that is .
But seeing as how that could never ever possibly happen , we might as well go ahead and make it a Singleton .
After all , a gang of four guys can't be wrong !
A Nagging Doubt
So I went on my merry way and made a bunch of Singleton objects .
At the time , I was programming in Java , so it required a bunch of boilerplate code for all these classes .
I suddenly had a RegistrationManager , and a DatabaseManager , and a UserManager , and a DocumentManager , and dozens of these other ultra-cool Singleton classes .
Problem was , all that boilerplate seemed unnecessary .
Why could n't I just make the methods static ?
I mean , I have this Registration Manager class .
It handles registration .
( Like , duh . )
It has a method called registerUser ( ) .
Obviously my system only needed one Registration Manager object , and would only EVER need one , so it was a Singleton , like virtually every other class in my program .
( This was Grade School OO Design , by the way , and I was reveling in it .
It 'd be kind of embarrassing if I 'd called it the RegistrationMaster , now that I think about it , given that 2/3 of our services have the word " Master " in their name . )
But for every one of my beloved Singletons , all of the client code invoking the Singleton had to do this , every time :
RegistrationManager mgr = RegistrationManager.getInstance ( ) ;
mgr.registerUser (...)
It was making my fingers kinda tired to type it out .
I thought about this carefully , and came to the conclusion that what I really needed was some sort of syntactic shortcut .
Why not do this instead :
class RegistrationManager { // BEGIN Singleton boilerplate
private RegistrationManager _instance = new RegistrationManager ( ) ;
public RegistrationManager getInstance ( ) {
return _instance ;
}
private RegistrationManager ( ) {} // prevent instantiation
// END Singleton boilerplate
// static method to delegate to instance method
public static blah registerUser ( ... ) {
return getInstance ().iRegisterUser (... ) ;
}
// instance method , as Singleton Pattern demands
private blah iRegisterUser (... ) { ... }
}
( Yes , I really did this , for about 50 classes .
I guess we were all young once . )
It was a little more boilerplate code per Singleton , because I had to declare a public static version of each method and delegate to a private instance method , BUT , my client code then turned into this :
RegistrationManager.registerUser(... ) ;
Whoo !
My client code ( by which I mean anyone in the same process using the Singleton instance ) no longer needed to do that extra getInstance ( ) call , which was just plain annoying and useless .
But why stop there ?
Why not just get rid of the delegation altogether ?
I resolved to figure this out , and hopped on the patterns newsgroups where Ralph Johnson lurked .
Lo and behold , Ralph had answered that very question the month before .
His answer : it does n't matter ; using static methods is fine - that 's still a Singleton .
Great !
Gosh , I was excited .
I 'd get rid of the Singleton instance ( and the boilerplate ) , make everything static , and my code was now super clean .
Yep .
I was using classes purely as namespaces .
Since in Java , classes are the ONLY globally available namespace mechanism built into the language , this is actually a common thing to do , Singleton or no .
Unless you want to build your own reflective registry , or use JNDI or something , classes are your only option for separating your code into namespaces .
So in that regard , the ( very ) little I was doing with classes was n't actually so wrong .
But I 'd thrown all the rest of that OO crap out the window .
It was a C program with some namespace support and garbage collection .
I suppose I could tell the rest of the story , but the nutshell version is that I wound up having to ( 1 ) learn how OOP really works , the hard way , and ( 2 ) re-implement parts of my application over and over , until it started to approximate a rational OO design .
I learned much later that this is called Refactoring , and I sure wish I 'd read THAT book in 1999 when it came out , instead of late 2003 .
Get to the Point , Already
Fine , fine .
Here 's the " short " summary , although clearly this should have been a book , not a blog entry :
a )
I have n't covered even a tenth of the issues .
But I 'll name a few of them .
b ) One is memory management ; a Singleton is basically just a memory leak , if nobody is going to be using it for a while .
But you have no idea when to deallocate it , because nobody 's going to call you and say " nobody 's going to be using you for a while ! "
Besides , you can't tell who has kept around references to your Singleton instance , since you were pretty blase about handing it out , were n't you ?
( Note : Java 's weak references can help with this issue ) .
c ) Speaking of memory leaks , what if your Singleton has a handle to some limited resource , like a database or file handle ?
I guess you get to keep that sucker open until your program ends .
Thank God C++ programs never last longer than about 10 minutes before crashing , usually from running out of resources , or from trying to access a Singleton that someone freed .
d ) Another issue is that the Singleton design is syntactically noisy ; most languages do n't support it ( well , Ruby does , sadly , but that was probably before Matz knew any better ) , so you have to stick in boilerplate code not only in the Singleton , but in everyone who uses it .
e ) Then there 's the subclassing thing .
It 's almost impossible to subclass a Singleton , and if you manage it , then you should n't have been using a Singleton in the first place .
You do n't * even * want to go there .
I 've walked roads that I dare not recount .
Just pretend you can't do it , and you 'll save yourself amazing amounts of pain .
f ) static methods are as flexible as granite .
Every time you use one , you 're casting part of your program in concrete .
Just make sure you do n't have your foot jammed in there as you 're watching it harden .
Someday you will be amazed that , by gosh , you really DO need another implementation of that dang PrintSpooler class , and it should have been an interface , a factory , and a set of implementation classes .
D'oh !
Do n't suppose that 's all .
There are many other problems .
For instance , try adding multithreading in and see what happens .
Well , I 'll tell you what happens : half the time , you get a Doubleton or a Tripleton , unless you 're a synchronization expert , and having a Tripleton is about as desirable as having three Balrogs show up at your tea party .
And even if you 're a synchronization expert and get the double - check idiom right , you 've still got one Balrog to deal with , and they 're no picnic .
But these problems all fade into insignificance compared to the Big One , which is that the Singleton " pattern " encourages you to forget everything you know about OO design , since OO is hard , and procedural is easy .
Friends : do n't let friends use Singletons !
What About The Other Patterns ?
Yeah , what about them .
Are they cool , or do they suck as much as the Singleton ?
Well , as it happens , some of them DO suck -- but not for the same reasons as the Singleton sucks .
Design Patterns is actually an odd book ; it 's part genius and part band - aid .
This owes entirely to the fact that C++ swept the computing world like a wildfire around 1991 or so .
Nobody expected this would happen , least of all Bjarne , because C++ was the most comical , far - fetched , unlikely programming language experiment in history .
I 'm not ready to bash on C++ yet .
All of this stuff I 'm writing , in blogs and the ADJ , is just practice for when I start bashing C++ in earnest , and trust me : when I 'm finished , one of us ( me or C++ ) wo n't be here at Amazon anymore .
There 's only enough room for one of us in this town .
But in the meantime , I 'll play nice .
Pretend I like C++ for now .
It 's better than Fortran or Pascal , so there 's at least a - grain - of truth there .
Design Patterns was especially well - timed because it offered a ray of hope for people who were mired in the Woes of the New OO Programmer .
You see , the OO camp was saying : " EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT !
YOU WILL THINK OF EVERYTHING AS OBJECTS FROM NOW ON !
THE OO PROGRAMMING PARADIGM IS : CREATE YOUR CLASSES , ADD OPERATIONS TO THEM , AND LAUNCH THE DAMN THING ! "
The last sentence ( forgive the caps , sorry ) is a pretty reasonable paraphrase of Stroustroup in his " The C++ Programming Language " book , where in Chapter Two he says that the programming paradigm is " Decide which types you want ; provide a full set of operations for each type . "
Everyone believed him , and they went and defined their types , which just stared back balefully .
Bob : " Hey Fred , how do I model a Loop ? "
Fred : " Easy !
Make a Loop class . "
Bob : " OK .
What operations should it have ? "
Fred : " Um , lemme look .
Prolly give it a parent , and instantiate it with a number of iterations and a stopping point . "
Bob : " Wow , this OOP solves everything !
What code should I put in the doLoop ( ) method ? "
Fred : " I think that 's where you instantiate it "
Bob : " That 's so cool , it 's almost ... confusing . "
Fred : " Make sure you make it a Singleton .
I 've never seen a reason not to . "
Everyone was bought into the fact that OOP was the future , and also the past , since Marketing felt it was important to make everyone forget what existed before OOP , in case they might start to have doubts .
But there were a few open questions , such as how to model relationships between types , a problem Stroustroup had most conveniently overlooked in his Magnum Opus .
Stroustroup :
As you can see , operator overloading has proven extremely useful , which I will demonstrate for the 16th time by once again using the Complex Number class .
See how useful it is to have the + operator for this class ?
I sure love this example .
Do n't you ?
Readers : Wow .
He 's right .
It is useful .
Stroustroup did a wonderful job of marketing C++ , and because you could learn it one feature at a time ( " I like the double - slash comments " ) , it was an attractive proposition for all the bad C programmers out there .
But Stroustroup was utterly silent on the issue of how classes actually interact , and the first book to come along and package up an idea with equally good marketing was Design Patterns .
It showed people some convenient and ( mostly ) intuitive ways for small groups of objects to collaborate to solve situations you run into all the time .
Cool stuff !
The problem is , about 1/3 to 1 / 2 of them were basically cover-ups for deficiencies in C++ that do n't exist in other languages .
Although I 'm not a huge Perl fan anymore , I have to admit the Perl community caught on to this first ( or at least funniest ) .
They pointed out that many of these so - called patterns were actually an implementation of Functional Programming in C ++.
The Visitor , for instance , is just a class wrapper for a function with some accumulator variables , something that 's achieved far more cleanly with , say , the map ( ) function in higher - level languages .
Iterator is a poor man 's Visitor .
The Strategy pattern is beautiful on the surface , but Strategy objects are typically stateless , which means they 're really just first - order functions in disguise .
( If they have state , then they 're Closures in disguise . )
Etc .
You either get this , because you 've done functional programming before , or you do n't , in which case I sound like I 'm a babbling idiot , so I guess I 'll wrap it up .
I do think that about 2/3 of the Design Patterns in the original Gang of Four book have significant merit , and I use them occasionally .
They 're no longer hammers in search of a nail , but they 're useful now and again , and I do appreciate them when I need them .
I 'll close by saying that if you still feel the need to use Singleton objects , consider using the Factory Method pattern instead .
It gives you all of the flexibility of the Singleton , with nowhere near as many problems .
Using the Singleton is usually just a sign of premature optimization - I know you dread instantiating objects ; you 've heard it 's way slow .
But just relax , take a deep breath , and treat yourself to a few extra instances .
You 'll be amazed at how fast computers have gotten these days , and you 'll be pleased at the extra flexibility using real objects gives you .
Enjoy !
Tune in next time for : " Staying Up Too Late Considered Harmful . "
( Published September 03 , 2004 )
On June 10 , Senator Joe Lieberman said on CBS Face the Nation that he had seen incontrovertible evidence that Iran was training and equipping Iraqi extremists to kill American soldiers and that we should prepare for military strikes against these training bases in Iran .
He also decried Iran 's nuclear weapons program , insisting that if we hope to stop their nuclear weapons development , " We ca n't just talk to them .
If they do n't play by the rules , we 've got to use our force , and to me that would include taking military action . "
Leslie Angeline , a member of the peace group CODEPINK who had just returned from a citizen diplomacy delegation to Iran , was appalled by the Senator 's remarks .
The next day , she began a sit - in at his DC office and decided to fast until the Senator agreed to meet with her and other activists .
We also alerted our CODEPINK supporters to call Lieberman 's office , and the phones were ringing off the hook .
By the afternoon , the Senator had agreed to a meeting on Thursday , June 14 .
On Thursday , a group of 60 people -- including members of the Iranian community - showed up for the meeting .
The group 's anger only deepened when we were told by Lieberman 's staff that the Senator had changed his mind and was no longer willing to meet .
Tensions mounted in the packed office as the group insisted on seeing the Senator and the staff called the police , who gave a warning that everyone would be arrested if they refused to leave .
Leslie Angeline now on the fifth day of her hunger strike , broke down , sobbing uncontrollably .
" I MUST talk to the Senator , " she pleaded .
" He has to know that the Iranians are beautiful , warm , kind people , that 70 percent of them are under 30 , that they love Americans , that they have never attacked another country in 200 years and have no intention of attacking the United States . "
Leslie took out stunning photos of Iranian children that she had taken on her trip .
" These are the children who would die if we bombed Iran .
We 've already killed so many Iraqis ; we just can't do this to the people of Iran , " she cried .
The Iranian women in the group began hugging Leslie and crying as well .
The emotional exchange , being filmed on camera , must have embarrassed the Senator 's staff .
They backed down from the threat of arrests and instead agreed to have their chief of staff , legislative director and Middle East aide meet with three of our team while the others waited in the hallway .
Inside , our group argued for over an hour about how to deal with Iran .
The staff claimed that classified briefings proved that Iran is " responsible for the murder of Americans in Iraq " .
We asked for and received no evidence backing these claims .
We said that the Iraqi government , protected by US forces , was pro-Iran so why would Iran want to kill American soldiers ?
Our group insisted that even if these concerns about Iran were real , if the US attacked Iran , the Iranian government would certainly retaliate against US soldiers in Iraq -- and U.S. deaths would soar .
Our team argued that the timing of Lieberman 's statement on national TV was extremely harmful to the ongoing , delicate negotiations that had begun last month in Baghdad and that it left the perception that Lieberman was trying to scuttle the talks .
We noted that confrontational rhetoric from such a prominent U.S. official only strengthens the hand of the hardliners in Iran .
The staff pointed out that on Monday Lieberman reaffirmed his support for US - Iranian negotiations .
We replied that his bellicose statements were much more prominent and asked that Lieberman speak out more forcefully in favor of negotiations .
They agreed to pass this concern to the Senator .
Our visit to Lieberman 's office with both emotional and well - reasoned arguments , combined with a powerful show of community support and calls from his constituents , seemed to have made an impact and the Senator might think twice in the future before publicly promoting a military attack on Iran .
Just to be sure , we assured his aides we represented a much larger constituency and we would be back in greater numbers if the Senator repeats the threat of military force instead of actively supporting dialogue .
We also repeated our request to meet directly with the Senator , and we have asked local peace groups and individuals in Connecticut to continue to pressure the Senator in his home state .
What we can learn from the war in Iraq is that once a war has started , it acquires a momentum of its own and becomes harder and harder to stop .
That 's why it 's so critical to prevent a war with Iran before it starts , and holding elected officials like Senator Lieberman to account is a key element of stopping the next war now .

These images were taken in eight orbits within 10 consecutive Earth days ( between orbits 299 and 309 ) with VIRTIS , in February 2007 .
The chosen wavelength was approximately 2.3 micrometres .
The images were all taken on the night side , in the evening sector .
The quarter that is observed is that which is experiencing late evening , or pre-midnight hours .
It should be taken into account that Venus rotates very slowly as compared to Earth ( one venusian day is 243 Earth days ) .
The distances from the spacecraft to the region observed span 50 000 to 65 000 km .
The contrast seen results from deeper cloud layers , at an altitude of about 50 km .
The south pole is just outside the image , in the upper right hand side .
It seems that the mid latitudes form a sort of transition region with mostly laminar flow .
Moving equatorward , there is more convective flow in the atmosphere , whereas the polar region or the ‘ black hole ’ in the upper right hand side is where the vortex dominates .
The meteorology of the planet , also its deep atmosphere , is highly variable .
The images in the bottom row as well as the leftmost image in the middle row show laminar flow .
The rest of the images show turbulent flow .
Intense , bright colours show less cloudy areas , while darker , black areas , show more cloudy regions .
This is because radiation coming from hotter regions below the clouds is blocked by thicker clouds .

Venus Express has now orbited Earth ’s twin for 500 Earth days , completing as many orbits .
While the satellite maintains steady and excellent performance , the planet continues to surprise and amaze us .
In spite of experiencing a challenging environment , Venus Express is in an excellent condition .
It receives four times the amount of solar radiation as compared to its sister spacecraft , Mars Express , but modifications to the spacecraft design have worked just as intended and operation has been very stable .
Many different activities transpire on board with each orbit : instruments are switched on and off , they change modes and targets and the spacecraft checks out and monitors its subsystems more or less continuously .
The few anomalies that occurred were quickly resolved by vigilant spacecraft controllers .
An impressive amount of data - about 1 Terabits , or one million million bits - has been transmitted to Earth over the first 500 days .
Håkan Svedhem , Venus Express Project Scientist says , " The scientists analysing the data have a challenging but exciting task ahead . ”
They will have to archive the data and extract the most important detail from this immense collection of images , spectra and profiles of temperature , pressure and chemical composition .
Some of the first detailed analyses are now being completed and will soon be published in acclaimed scientific journals .
Among many other findings that have surprised scientists , Venus ’ atmosphere seems extremely fickle .
Recent observations with the Visible and Near - Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIRTIS ) , the atmospheric structure changes quite rapidly , from day to day .

Do you think you know a lot about money ?
Maybe you do .
Maybe you do n't .
But let 's see if any of the following facts are in any way surprising to you :
More of our fantasies are about money ... than sex .
If we could have any luxury in the world ( and money did n't matter ) more of us would choose to spend money on a butler and a maid than anything else .
90 % of Americans who own pets buy them Christmas gifts .
Money is the leading cause of disagreements in marriages .
65 % of Americans would live on a deserted island all by themselves for an entire year for $ 1,000,000 .
For $ 10,000,000 most of us would do almost ANYTHING !
Including abandoning our family and friends and our church .
A very high percentage of us would , for that same amount of money , change our race or sex .
And , 1 in every 14 , would even murder someone for ten million bucks .
What 's really strange about this is , the statistics remain the same whether it 's ten million dollars all the way down to three million .
For three million bucks , most of us would do the same horrible things we would do for ten million .
But , guess what ?
Few of us would do these things for a " measly " two million .
92 % of us would rather be rich than find the love of our lives .
Here 's a weighty one : Money ( or the lack thereof ) is the biggest stress inducer in the lives of Americans .
We worry more about money than our marriages , our health , or even who 's going to win the Superbowl Game or come out on top in the latest Survivor TV show .
If you get your money out of a Hitachi ATM machine in Japan , it will be laundered .
The way they do it is , they briefly press the bills between rollers at high enough temperatures to kill most bacteria .
Women have very fixed ideas on how much they are willing to spend on a bra.
38.3 % of women wo n't spend $ 30 for a bra .
28.4 % wo n't spend $ 50 .
10 % would pay as much as $ 75 .
And , only 3.5 % would shell out $ 100 .
But , you know what ?
Almost 20 % of women say they would pay almost anything for a bra .
This is because they consider ( and I guess so do a few men ) that the contents of what those bras are encasing is of extremely high - value .
Nearly half of the people who sell their houses with furniture included will take all the light bulbs out of all the lamps when they vacate the premises .
Most people wo n't bend over to pick up money lying on the sidewalk unless it 's at least a dollar .
Most Americans think pennies are a pain in the ass and the U.S. Mint should stop making them .
There is about 405 billion dollars in circulation .
Only 32 million of that amount is counterfeit .
That means , the percentage of counterfeit money in America is .0079 % .
And , $ 20 bills are more often counterfeited than $ 100 bills .
Do people care if their bills are crisp ?
Indeed , they do .
Fresh , crisp , clean bills are considered much more valuable than those which are old , wrinkled and dirty .
I once sent a ' dollar bill thank you ' letter to a guy who sent a sincere letter back to me bitching the free $ 1 bill I sent him was wrinkled instead of crisp as I had described in the letter .
Let 's flip a coin and try to guess whether it will come up heads or tails .
Three times as many people guess ' heads ' than ' tails ' .
Here 's one I personally think really sucks :
One out of every four Americans believe their best chance of getting rich is by playing the lottery .
How about this one for a shocking fact : 5 % of lottery ticket buyers buy 51 % of all tickets sold .
( Trust me , none of these people belong to the " Einsteins of America Society " . )
A staggering 74 % of us are influenced by how much we can win in a lottery as opposed to the odds of us winning .
That 's a good thing for the Government because the odds of winning a lottery jackpot are about 10 million to 1 .
A person who drives 10 miles to buy a lottery ticket is 3 times more likely to be killed in a car accident while driving to buy the ticket ... than ... he is to win the jackpot .
Sunday newspaper coupon inserts are the second - most read section of the paper , after the front page .
Few people know it but , you can buy single - disease insurance .
Only 6 % of people in America regularly buy clothes tailor made just for them .
Here 's one that 's really important : 63 % of us decide NOT to buy a product advertised on the Internet ... because ... we think the shipping and handling charges add too much to the order .
Eight times as many Americans would rather use an ATM than deal with a real live teller .
This one 's going to blow your mind : 83 % of Americans still pay with checks instead of credit cards !
Almost 30 % of us say we would need 3 million smackaroos to feel rich .
This ties in with the fact most of us would do anything for as little as $ 3 million ... but ... not nearly as many of us would do those identical things for a measly $ 2 million .
( Hey , here 's your chance to take advantage of that situation .
If you only want to pay $ 2 million to have something done , ask me if I 'll do it .
The chances are , believe it or not , I WILL DO IT . )
Here 's another fact which is really , really important : 80 % of Americans say giving personal information ( especially their credit card information ) over the Internet scares the living shit out of them .
Two - thirds of Americans say they would n't let their spouse spend the night and have sex with another person for a million dollars .
Many of these people are liars .
There 's a big difference being asked if they would do it for a million dollars ... as opposed to ... handing them a paper sack containing the million fungolas and simply saying , " Here , you can have this if you 'll let me sleep with your sweetie tonight . "
The average wedding in America costs a staggering $ 20,000.00 .
More than one - third of American women consider money more important than good sex to the success of a marriage .
According to Employee Benefits Research Institute 96 % of all people who have jobs right now wo n't be eligible for their full Social Security benefits when they reach age 65 .
When it comes to houses , more than anything else , people want a state - of - the - art kitchen .
When people shop for a car , what they want more than anything else is reliability for the best possible price .
One of the best ways to raise money for a charity is to have a free dinner for a lot of people and have an empty envelope tucked under their plate ... for the express purpose ... of making whatever size donation they want .
People tip more on sunny days than they do on dreary days .
More than 80,000,000 people call the I.R.S. Information Hotline phone number every year .
One - third of those calls go unanswered .
And , according to the Treasury Department itself , 47 % of the answers the ' get - through ' callers receive are incorrect .
Almost two out of three people have modified their financial behavior because of their fears .
Almost three times as many people who live in the South worry about losing their jobs as compared to people who live in the Midwest .
Which would you rather do :
Shop till you drop ... or ... have great sex ?
For men , this is a no - brainer .
However , more women would actually rather have an unlimited shopping spree than spend a weekend with a fabulous lover .
In fact , the # 1 favorite fantasy of women is to have a blank check to shop at their favorite store .
The favorite fantasy of men ( at least in my opinion ) is what we would like to DO to the sales girl ... rather than ... what we would like to buy from her .

Do You Know How Much Lost Love Costs ?

Most Americans want the war in Iraq ended , but it continues and Americans are killed , mutilated or wounded every day , as the Democratic majorities in Congress struggle to produce legislation that will take our forces out of harm ’s way .
Meanwhile , President Bush continues to insist that as commander in chief , he has the constitutional power to go to war and decide when to end it , unilaterally .
At the same time , another possible disaster emerges from the shadows : Bush appears to be considering a military assault on Iran , again apparently without Congress declaring war first .
How did we get to this point and what , if anything , can we do now ?
The war happened because when Bush first indicated his intention to go to war against Iraq , Congress refused to insist on enforcement of Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution .
For more than 200 years , this article has spelled out that Congress -- not the president -- shall have “ the power to declare war . ”
Because the Constitution cannot be amended by persistent evasion , this constitutional mandate was not erased by the actions of timid Congresses since World War II that allowed eager presidents to start wars in Vietnam and elsewhere without a “ declaration ” by Congress .
Nor were the feeble , post - factum congressional resolutions of support of the Iraq invasion -- in 2001 and 2002 -- adequate substitutes for the formal declaration of war demanded by the founding fathers .
What can be done now ?
First , Democrats should make clear that it is the president who is keeping the war in Iraq from ending .
Even if Congress were able to pass a veto - proof bill with respect to withdrawal , the president would resist enforcement of the bill , insisting that as commander in chief , he is immune from Congress ’ decision .
That would raise a constitutional issue for the courts .
But judging by the courts ’ history concerning constitutional war powers , including decisions involving the Iraq war in the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Massachusetts , the judiciary would , in all probability , choose not to intervene , claiming that the disagreement between the president and Congress is a political question .
However , the political - question thesis is nowhere referred to in the Constitution , and it denies the people the protection of the Constitution in dealing with perhaps the most serious question the nation has to face : “ Should we go to war ? ”
That position should be challenged as an abdication of constitutional duty by the courts , but the sad truth is that the current conservative - dominated Supreme Court would probably support our current conservative president .
As a practical matter , that means only the president can end this waror change our strategy in Iraq .
Even if it is too late for Congress to remedy its failure to comply with the Constitution with respect to Iraq , at the very least our candidates for president and our congressional leaders should assure us that they will not allow this lapse to result in further unilateral acts of war -- against Iran , Pakistan or any other nation -- by this president or any other .
Our leaders must make it clear that in the future , Congress will insist on compliance with Article I , Section 8 for any military action that is not fairly deemed an unexpected emergency .
It is frightening that our government has permitted this fundamental and costly constitutional transgression to persist for more than four years .
We must do everything we can to end the war in Iraq and avoid a new tragedy abroad by recommitting to strict adherence to the rule of law and to the Constitution by the president , Congress and the courts -- especially with respect to war powers .

Protesters said the wall would encourage sectarianism in Baghdad
Residents of the Shula and Ghazaliya districts waved Iraqi flags and chanted slogans rejecting both the proposed separation and the US occupation .
They demanded the government intervene to ensure the barrier is demolished .
The US military said the wall would reduce sectarian violence and stop the movement of weapons and militants .
Many Iraqis reacted angrily in April when US troops began building a barrier around the Baghdad Sunni enclave of Adhamiya to prevent it being attacked by Shia militants .
' Planting sectarianism '
Tuesday 's demonstration saw many residents of Shula and Ghazaliya march between the two areas before gathering in front of the first completed section of the 2 km ( 1.25 mile ) wall .
The wall is dividing small neighbourhoods and will lead to the partitioning of Iraq
Statement by protesters
Carrying banners reading " No to the dividing wall " and " The wall is US terrorism " , the protesters issued a statement demanding that Iraqi authorities intervene .
" The wall is in accordance with al - Qaeda 's plans , " the statement said , adding that it would " separate family from family " .
Hassan al - Tai , a leader of the Sunni Tai tribe , demanded the Iraqi government act against those " planting division and sectarianism amongst Iraqis " .
" The wall is dividing small neighbourhoods and will lead to the partitioning of Iraq , " he told the AFP news agency .
A Shia cleric at the protest , Abdul Baqir al - Subaihawi , insisted the wall would provide neither security nor stability .
" The government must maintain security in Baghdad rather than separate its neighbourhoods , " he added .
That is why George Bush 's act of mercy is so inspiring , especially when one considers that compassion is not something generally associated with him .
When he was governor of Texas , for instance , there were quite a number of convicted felons towards whom he did n't show much compassion at all .
In fact he insisted they receive the full penalty of the law , which in their case was somewhat more severe than in Libby's .
They were executed .
When Bush became governor in 1995 , the average number of executions in the state was 7.6 a year .
During his time in office , he managed to put down a further 24 humans a year , bringing the annual number of executions up to 31.6 ; it is heartwarming to see how his attitude to convicted criminals has softened .
The president said the sentence imposed on Libby was " excessive " , and that he had suffered enough punishment without it .
" The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is for ever damaged , " said Bush .
" His wife and young children have also suffered immensely . "
Now this will be good news for critics of the current system of justice .
For some time , defence lawyers have been complaining that sentences are too harsh , that defendants ' positive contributions to society are ignored , and that collateral damage caused to defendants ' families is disregarded .
Only last month the US attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , announced that the justice department would push for legislation to make federal sentences even tougher and less flexible .
How delighted the critics of such harsh attitudes must be to see that the president has now come around to their way of thinking .
Mind you , Bush 's softening of heart can only have happened in very recent days .
A couple of weeks ago , in an eerily similar case , Victor Rita was , like Libby , convicted of perjury , making false statements to federal agents , and obstruction of justice .
Like Scooter , Rita has an unblemished record of public service - 25 years in the armed forces with 35 commendations , awards and medals - and yet he was handed a 33 - month jail sentence without even a message of condolence from the president .
In another recent case , the justice department tried to have Jamie Olis put away for more than 24 years for accounting fraud .
In the end he got six years inside .
But then I suppose fiddling the accounts is n't on a par with trying to obstruct an investigation into a breach of national security .
So I thoroughly approve of the president 's change of heart towards convicted criminals , and hope it will continue until his term of office expires - and that in the future we shall witness increasing moderation in the justice department 's insatiable urge to punish , imprison and execute .
And I sincerely hope that the commutation of Libby 's prison sentence will usher in a new era of clemency , compassion and human forgiveness , under a president who otherwise has so much blood on his hands .

Growing and burning many biofuels may actually raise rather than lower greenhouse gas emissions , a new study led by Nobel prize - winning chemist Paul Crutzen has shown .
1
The findings come in the wake of a recent OECD report , which warned nations not to rush headlong into growing energy crops because they cause food shortages and damage biodiversity .
Crutzen and colleagues have calculated that growing some of the most commonly used biofuel crops releases around twice the amount of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) than previously thought - wiping out any benefits from not using fossil fuels and , worse , probably contributing to global warming .
The work appears in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics and is currently subject to open review .
’ The significance of it is that the supposed benefits of biofuel are even more disputable than had been thought hitherto , ’ Keith Smith , a co-author on the paper from the University of Edinburgh , told Chemistry World .
’ What we are saying is that [ growing many biofuels ] is probably of no benefit and in fact is actually making the climate issue worse . ’
" What we are saying is that growing biofuels is probably of no benefit and in fact is actually making the climate issue worse " - Keith Smith
Crutzen , famous for his work on nitrogen oxides and the ozone layer , declined to comment before the paper is officially published .
But the paper suggests that microbes convert much more of the nitrogen in fertiliser to N 2 O than previously thought - 3 to 5 per cent or twice the widely accepted figure of 2 per cent used by the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
For rapeseed biodiesel , which accounts for about 80 per cent of the biofuel production in Europe , the relative warming due to N 2 O emissions is estimated at 1 to 1.7 times larger than the quasi- cooling effect due to saved fossil CO 2 emissions .
For corn bioethanol , dominant in the US , the figure is 0.9 to 1.5 .
Only cane sugar bioethanol - with a relative warming of 0.5 to 0.9 - looks like a viable alternative to conventional fuels .
Some previous estimates had suggested that biofuels could cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40 per cent .
2
Global picture
The IPCC ’s N 2 O conversion factor is derived using data from plant experiments .
But Crutzen takes a different approach , using atmospheric measurements and ice core data to calculate the total amount of N 2 O in the atmosphere .
He then subtracts the level of N 2 O in pre-industrial times - before fertilizers were available - to take account of N 2 O from natural processes such as leguminous plants growing in forests , lightning , and burn offs .
Assuming the rest of the N 2 O is attributable to newly - fixed nitrogen from fertilizer use , and knowing the amount of fertilizer applied globally , he can calculate the contribution of fertilizers to N 2 O levels .
The results may well trigger a rethink by the IPCC , says Smith .
’ Should we go along the road of adding up the experimental evidence for each of the processes or are we better off using the global numbers ? ’
Critical reception
But other experts are critical of Crutzen ’s approach .
Simon Donner , a nitrogen researcher based at Princeton University , US , says the method is elegant but there is little evidence to show the N 2 O yield from fertilized plants is really as high as 3 - 5 per cent .
Crutzen ’s basic assumption , that pre-industrial N 2 O emissions are the same as natural N 2 O emissions , is ’ probably wrong ’ , says Donner .
One reason he gives is that farmers plant crops in places that have nitrogen rich soils anyway .
’ It is possible we are indirectly increasing the " natural " source of N 2 O by drawing down the soil nitrogen in the world ’s agricultural regions , ’ he explains .
Others dispute the values chosen by Crutzen to calculate his budget .
Stefan Rauh , an agricultural scientist at the Instituteof Agricultural Economics and Farm Management in Munich , Germany , says some of the rates for converting crops into biofuel should be higher .
’ If you use the other factors you get a little net climate cooling , ’ he said .
Meanwhile , a report prepared by the OECD for a recent Round Table on Sustainable Development questions the benefits of first generation biofuels and concludes that governments should scrap mandatory targets .
Richard Doornbosch , the report ’s author , says both the report and Crutzen ’s work highlights the importance of establishing correct full life - cycle assessments for biofuels .
’ Without them , government policies can’t distinguish between one biofuel and another - risking making problems worse , ’ said Doornbosch .

Moore 's spat with CNN correspondent continues on Larry King Live RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Michael Moore continued his public spat with CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta when both appeared on Larry King Live Tuesday night .
Moore previously accused CNN of libeling him in a report on his new film .
Gupta praised Moore 's new film , SiCKO , for raising awareness to the " unrefutable fact that ... our health system is broken , " but he accused the filmmaker of " cherry picking " data cited in the report .
On his Web site this week , Moore posted a lengthy critique of a CNN report that accused him of fudging facts in his film .
On Larry King 's show , Moore reiterated those criticisms .
Moore 's appearance Tuesday night followed a heated exchange Monday afternoon with CNN host Wolf Blitzer on the Situation Room that generated extensive discussion online .
A primary dispute between Moore and Gupta revolved over the effects of higher taxes in countries like France , Great Britain and Canada , which provide universal healthcare .
Gupta accused Moore of falsely implying those systems were free , which he insisted they were because sick people in other industrialized nations do n't have to worry about how to pay for healthcare .
" You wo n't find many Canadians , or French or British people willing to give up their national system for our system , even if they do have to pay a little bit more in taxes , " Moore said .
" Because in the end , because they 're not paying the co-pays and the deductibles and all these other things it 's actually costing them less money in the long run . "
Moore said the problem in the US is that healthcare is a profit - based system in the US , whereas other countries are more concerned about making sure everyone is healthy .
Gupta said he did n't disagree with Moore 's criticisms , and he called the US healthcare system " shameful . "
But he worried about handing over " one of our most precious commodities " to the government , and he cited projections that Medicare would be bankrupt within 12 years .
The government can be effective in administering programs in the public interest , Moore said , citing Social Security and the Apollo missions of the 1960s .
But , he said , we can't afford to ensure citizens ' healthcare " if we keep spending $ 100 billion a year on a war . "
Reports that Wall Street , which made millions of dollars securitizing mortgages in recent years , is becoming more wary of Alt - A by putting loans back to lenders or by bidding less for them could be an indication that default rates will worsen before they improve .
The problems in subprime mortgages started late last year when big investment banks started returning delinquent loans to lenders .
Many of those lenders have since filed for bankruptcy protection .
“ The credit markets were showering the mortgage market with capital , and now that ’s just evaporating , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ The capital markets are going to exacerbate the problem , seemingly . ”
Until recently , mortgage companies had been able to sell loans to Wall Street banks and other investors for a premium that was big enough to cover their costs of making the loans and to make a tidy profit .
The banks would then package the loans into pools to be sold as bonds to hedge funds , insurance companies and other investors .
“ Now you are selling at par or lower in some instances , ” said Thomas M. McCarthy , a managing director at Carlton Group , a real estate investment firm that brokers the sale of mortgages .
“ It really throws the business upside down . ”
For American Home Mortgage , the lower prices investors are willing to pay for Alt - A loans will mean that the company will earn from 40 cents to 60 cents a share in the first quarter .
Analysts had expected it to earn $ 1.06 a share , according to a survey by Bloomberg News .
Beginning in the second quarter , the company , which is structured as a real estate investment trust , will reduce the dividend for its common shares to 70 cents a share , down from $ 1.12 in the first quarter .
The company also said it would write down $ 484 million in mortgage securities it owns because of the lower prices at which the bonds were now trading .
A new public opinion poll shows a majority of the American people do not see a danger in China ’s economic and military buildup , demonstrating that Beijing 's efforts to influence public opinion in the United States have been successful .
The poll , conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org in conjunction with research centers around the world , found that a majority of citizens in eight of 14 countries surveyed ( and a plurality in four ) expect China to catch up with the United States economically and that they are not worried about it .
Less than a third of respondents believe China 's rise will be " mostly negative , " with majorities in most countries anticipating a mixed or positive outcome .

Model Sophie
Dahl was lately snapped with her much shorter boyfriend , jazz singer Jamie Cullum .
Eight inches taller than her diminutive lover , Miss Dahl looked positively Amazonian .
Should we feel sorry for the Big Friendly Girlfriend ( BFG ) - a woman who will never know what it feels like to walk down the street nestling in the crook of her boyfriend 's arm ?
Or who always has to bend her knees if her man goes for an impromptu kiss ?
Scroll down for more ...
Not a bit , and I should know .
I am a 5ft 10 inch tall woman and I have spent the past two decades stepping out with the vertically - challenged male .
And I love it .
It may seem strange .
There is no shortage of surveys telling us how the tall , athletic male makes a better lover , earns more and rises up the social ladder faster .
But shorter men do have advantages .
They tend to be funnier , as , since their teenage years , they will have been trying to distract girls from their height .
I remember one shorter boyfriend , whose dog was almost taller than him - but he could always laugh me into bed and joke me out of a sulk .
Tall men are also more likely to be cads - they know it does n't matter if they treat women badly because there will always be another queueing up behind .
Scroll down for more ...
The few times I have gone out with a man my height or taller , he was charming at the beginning - tall men are more superficially confident .
But I soon realised he was in love with only one person - and that was himself .
The vertically - challenged male represents a more complex idea of what it means to be a man .
Having remained single longer , he is likely to be more mature .
As short men have had to work harder to get where they are - surveys show that society tends to favour taller men - they are likely to be better providers , too .
When we were hunter - gatherers , a man 's physical attributes mattered .
The taller the man , the more likely he was to bring home the bacon .
But , today , prowess is measured by financial kudos .
And when it comes to making money , the short man is more ambitious .
Many successful men are short : Rod Stewart , Salman Rushdie , Bernie Ecclestone .
And short men love tall women .
The ( SMTW ) syndrome - short male taller woman - has long been in vogue : Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes ; or Mick Jagger , who dated Sophie Dahl , married the leggy Jerry Hall , and is now with the towering L'Wren Scott .
For short men , tall women have the very thing they have coveted all their life : height .
On the other hand , tall men can be clumsy .
They have to crouch to get through doorways and they never fit on your sofa .
The shorter male has compact sex appeal : Robert De Niro , James Dean .
Yet , for the less famous , there is a more basic reason why being with a short man is so satisfying : they 're simply more grateful .
To promote the cause of liberty .
The freedom to do what you want when you want if that action does not bring direct harm to others .
25 Tips For Easier Scuba Diving
Even after over twenty years of underwater adventures , I have found that , at every diver ’s experience level , we are always learning new things about the world we are exploring , our companions , our gear and ourselves .
As more information becomes available about all of these components and our understanding grows , our journeys become easier and the experience becomes enriched .
The following 25 tips will make your diving experiences much easier and much more fun .
1
Invest In Equipment You Can Depend On
In general , SCUBA is an equipment intensive activity that involves a basic technical understanding and requires that the diver has equipment that is appropriate for the conditions they plan to be in .
This does n’t mean that you have to break the bank , but you do n’t want to skimp either .
The most common phrase that applies to buying a Life Support System is to “ Get the best gear that you can reasonably afford . ”
This means that you wo n’t find yourself needing to replace gear that ’s not that old .
2
Regulators
The most important piece of equipment a diver uses is their scuba regulator .
This is where we get the air that we are going to breathe once we slip into the world beneath the surface .
It should be quite apparent that we want as high performance as we can get .
This insures that it will fit a wide variety of applications and requirements for different locations and conditions .
For example , a regulator that works well in both warm and cold water and in deep and shallow water will cover all of a diver ’s bases for years to come without needing to invest in a new one as the diver ’s skill level increases .
3
Alternate Air Sources ( Octos )
This piece of Safety gear is what goes into action in the rare instance that a buddy runs low on or out of air .
Most divers are trained with an alternate that has its supply hose wrapped around the rib -cage on the right side .
The second stage is secured somehow within the triangle from the bottom of the chin to the lower corners of the rib cage .
An excellent way for a diver to streamline their gear and maintain the safety of an alternate air source is to get one that integrates into the B.C. .
This attaches on the left side of the BC and is used in conjunction with the inflator hose or replaces the inflator entirely .
4
Computers
A dive computer is a fantastic time - saver and information resource .
This piece of gear is an information management system .
They will not only display critical information about the dive you ’re on but , while in surface mode , they will allow you to view the dives you have previously logged or run simulations for upcoming dives .
They come as wrist - mounted units , in consoles with other instruments or as tethered units that utilize a retractor for quick deployment .
Some of them even integrate the remaining air function into the display .
The integrated hose - less / wireless units eliminate a hose from the rig .
When these are used with the BC integrated Alternate Air Sources , you wind up with only two hoses .
This makes the unit compact , lightweight and again , STREAMLINED .
5
Relax While You Dive
The Excitement of a trip and making a dive can work some folks into a frenzy of activity .
This excited attitude can lead to rapid arm movements and fin kicking which in turn causes rapid breathing and depletion of air supply .
This means your dive gets cut short .
A short rapid trip over an area probably means that many of the animals and features that make the dive interesting were hurried right by unnoticed .
On the way down , divers should maintain neutral buoyancy , and once on the bottom , check their gauges and signal each other .
This short procedure allows the group to stay together so no - one is trying to catch up .
It also gives everyone a chance to get oriented to the new environment and take a few slow deep breaths before calmly setting out to dive the planned route .
With a more relaxed group , the dives will last longer , everyone will see more and divers will be less fatigued at the end of the day .
6
Properly Weight Yourself For The Area You ’re In
When diving in a new area , do a weight / buoyancy check with the equipment you ’re going to use for that trip either in a pool before you leave or in a shallow controlled environment when you arrive .
On a trip to warmer water , divers will use much thinner wetsuits than in a local cold - water environment which means less weight is required .
An over - weighted diver may have trouble staying off of the bottom which may harm animals or remaining streamlined underwater which wastes energy and air .
7
Buoyancy Control
Before entering the water , you should fill your BC enough to float at the surface before descent .
This allows for any last - minute adjustments of gear for you or your buddy and allows the divers to descend as a group .
During the descent , maintain slightly negative buoyancy for a controlled descent , and once at your desired depth , establish neutral buoyancy .
Divers should then orient themselves far enough off the bottom so as not to disturb the animals or stir up silt .
This maintains optimal visibility and gives the diver a good vantage point for scanning the area for points of interest and animals of interest .
8
Adjust Your Equipment Properly
Taking the time topside to make sure that all of your equipment is adjusted properly before you even get in the water can save you time once you ’re in .
Be sure that straps of all kind ( BC , Mask , Fins ) are not twisted and quick - releases are shut and snug but not restrictive .
A mask strap that is too tight will cause headaches and a ring around your face .
A fin strap that is twisted will be uncomfortable on your ankle and may cause a failure on the release , resulting in its loss .
A diver will also want to be sure that their gear is set up with easy access to pockets and D -ring storage .
This means that , if you need to use a piece of gear you brought with you , it will be available .
9
Do n’t Exceed The Limitations Of Your Skills Or Equipment
Because of the amount of water there is to enjoy on the planet , there is also a wide diversity of conditions that you can find yourself in .
From warm - water shallow reefs with little current to icy Northern waters with raging currents , you can also experience everything in between .
With the proper equipment and training , you can safely have fun where few people ever go .
Without the proper equipment and training , you can find yourself in a stressful and possibly dangerous position .
Diving is a fun activity , and learning new skills is fulfilling .
For a safe and relaxing adventure , be sure that you are ready for what may occur .
10
Take Pictures
Photographs and images of all kinds have described the world around us for thousands of years .
Modern underwater cameras allow us to capture moments that otherwise , no one else would ever see .
This is a great way to further enrich your diving and that of those around you – divers and non-divers alike .
Quite simply put , “ One picture is worth a thousand words . ”
11
Dive With People You Know And With Locals When You Travel
Diving is a great way to meet new and interesting people .
Dive buddies that are familiar and have diving likes and practices that are similar to your own will make it more enjoyable .
The objectives of the dive will run parallel and will not cause friction between goals during the dive and will .
For instance , two buddies that are going to take pictures or are looking for a certain species of fish in an area can work as a team .
When diving in a new area , find a local guide or diver with experience who can show you the better locations and has knowledge of the animals and conditions .
The Scuba.com online bulletin board has a find a dive buddy section for exactly this purpose .
12
Take Animal ID Courses
There are classes and seminars that are usually taught before a trip occurs .
Be sure to become familiar with the wildlife above and below the surface before going someplace new .
It will be more exciting to recognize an animal you are familiar with than to be surprised when you are exposed to it for the first time .
Knowing an animals habits and behaviors will also allow you react to it properly for photo opportunities and other interactions .
It will also help you find them if they are particularly interesting .
13
Find Specialties You Like
Take courses for skills beyond the basics .
Continuing your skills development can help you enjoy diving immensely .
There are many levels of certification in all agencies and they all have their own rewards .
If you ’re traveling to a new place with conditions unfamiliar to you , take a class at the local shop that will give you the skills to enjoy where you ’re going to be .
You may also be taking new gear that you will want to become proficient with before you leave .
This will all add up to more enjoyment and easier adaptation to the new surroundings .
14
Take Your Time
Many divers are excited about getting in the water for their next experience .
This can lead to being in a hurry from the moment they start unloading and un-packing their gear .
Even an experienced diver can forget the most basic piece of equipment or procedure which can cause stress later .
A relaxed and methodical approach to the dive from gearing up to gearing down will insure that nothing or no one is forgotten or left behind .
15
Learn And Use Hand Signals
Knowing how to signal your buddies can make diving much more enjoyable .
In an environment where the spoken word winds up lost as a bubble at the surface , it is critical to be able to communicate coherently with one another .
Hand signals are the easiest way and they can be recognized from a distance in clear water .
Some people actually use forms of sign language and have conversations about the conditions and animals they are experiencing .
16
Communicate
In most cases where divers are close to each other or in poor visibility , slates are used to write on and leave very little room for confusion .
Some may be erased and written on repeatedly during a dive .
Others must be cleaned at the surface .
Further still , there are communications devices which actually divers to talk into a microphone and have their buddies listen live time .
17
Exposure Protection
The right wetsuit or dry - suit for your destination is critical .
Check with local operations and chat boards regarding temperatures and what is commonly used in that area at the time you ’ll be there .
Being cold can detract from your fun and can cut your diving short .
18
Stay Current With New Techniques And Theory
The science of diving is always advancing for the recreational and technical enthusiast .
The most current techniques and equipment are good to practice and have as they are there for a divers ’ safety .
There are many resources for these new ideas such as magazines , discussion boards , certification agencies and even dive club guest speakers .
19
Proper Storage
Equipment that has been properly cleaned and stored after your last trip will be in good condition and ready for action when your next trip comes up .
Gear should be stored in a cool dry place out of the sun .
It should also be kept together so that it is organized for use .
It is also a good idea to keep a checklist with your gear so that nothing gets left behind .
20
Proper Transport / Packing and Baggage
Proper packing and transport of gear is critical for easier travel and more enjoyable travel .
Pack your gear tightly so that it does n’t shift when moved .
It should also be organized for easy inspection if airport personnel need access .
Items that could be considered dangerous such as knives and spear - guns should be packed in check - in luggage .
Be prepared to answer questions about your equipment as some officials may not be familiar with the equipment .
21
Proper maintenance
Maintenance begins with cleaning your gear thoroughly after every use .
It should be soaked and dried completely so as to remove all salt and organic matter .
Your gear should also be inspected before you leave for a dive , whether it ’s down the road or across the globe .
It may be hard to fix or replace if you find that it ’s broken or has a problem when you get there .
Regulators and BCs should be inspected and serviced annually by a certified and authorized service center and technician .
22
Gadgets
Making sure that all of the equipment you are taking with you is secured so it ca n’t be lost is a good idea .
It is also good to have your Gauges and alternate air source secured to your body so that they do n’t dangle on the rocks , coral or sand .
This keeps them from damaging the area and your gear .
There are many different types of clips and retractors for these purposes .
23
Proper Documentation / Paperwork
When traveling , keep your paperwork together and organized .
Passports , I.D.s , immunization records and even your C - Card are important to have .
The faster you can produce these documents , the easier it will be to get processed into a new country .
The dive shop will need your C - Card and may keep it in a safe place for you while you dive with them .
24
Warranties
Where equipment is concerned , you always want to make sure that it comes with a warranty .
Purchase your equipment from an authorized dealer and be sure to register your equipment within the manufacturers ’ specified timeline .
This protects you if something happens to your gear and it will be covered by the warranty .
It will also serve as a record of ownership if your gear is damaged or stolen
25
Insurance
Insure your equipment .
In the unlikely event that your gear is subjected to a disaster such as a fire or is stolen , insurance will replace it .
This is extremely rare , but can mean the difference between a waiting period and starting over .
Have Fun !

PFAFFENHAUSEN , Germany , March 14 — Ask Marc Bongers about the wisdom of introducing a speed limit on the German autobahn , and he answers by impatiently revving the 435 - horsepower engine of a specially modified Porsche .
Slowpokes , he said , already spoil half the fun .
“ A lady , ” Mr. Bongers sniffed , as a Mercedes scuttled out of his way in the passing lane on a busy highway in southern Bavaria .
“ And she ’s talking on her phone , ” he said the other day , shooting her a sidelong glance .
“ Does n’t she know it ’s against the law to do that on the autobahn ? ”
With a stretch of empty road ahead , Mr. Bongers floored the gas pedal , and within seconds the speedometer registered 286 kilometers an hour ( 178 m.p.h. ) — something that is still legal here .
That , by way of comparison , is about the speed of a commercial jet taking off .
Few things are closer to the German heart than the freedom to drive like Michael Schumacher , the fabled Formula One champion .
Rule - bound and risk - averse in so many other ways , Germans regard driving on the autobahn at face - peeling speeds as close to an inalienable right .

The latest violent upheaval in Gaza has left the Palestinians with little chance of an easy reconciliation .
" The Palestinians must remain united , " Abu Amjad said .
But his haunted face told a different story .
Tension between Fatah and Hamas dates back to the mid 1990s
The car which brought him to our rendezvous in Ramallah bore the conspicuous emblems of Fatah .
A black and white chequered scarf hanging from the rear - view mirror .
A yellow flag flying from the aerial .
Such overt displays are fine in a town where Fatah rules the roost , but Abu Amjad is still scared .
He agreed to be interviewed only if we disguised his name , face and voice .
Anything but yellow
He had fled Gaza with his wife and children two days earlier .
At the height of the fighting , he had heard Hamas militants issuing chilling orders on their walkie - talkies and seen dead bodies in the street .
His children were scared , and started to speak only in whispers .
When they asked for toys or sweets , they demanded anything but yellow .
In Gaza , everyone , even the smallest child , knows that a simple colour can get you in trouble .
When Abu Amjad saw a group of gunmen on his own roof and realised he was being followed , he decided it was time to leave .
His brother , a prominent Fatah official , is still in Gaza .
Hence Abu Amjad 's reluctance to be identified .
Unlucky number
One small detail confused me .
He said Hamas gunmen had checked ID numbers before deciding what to do with people .
Anyone whose number began with a four was suspect .
Move aside , the newcomers seemed to say - we 're in charge now , leave it to us
Why ?
Because that is how Israel , which granted the permits , signified any Palestinian who returned from abroad after the Oslo peace accords in 1993 .
And the largest number of these belonged to Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction .
Here , in this innocent little digit , was one clue as to why the Palestinian struggle had turned in on itself .
Why it had become a kind of revenge tragedy , in which bloody events unfold against the backdrop of a social and political order in tatters .
In 1994 , when Yasser Arafat returned in triumph to the Gaza Strip after decades in exile , the PLO , with Fatah at its head , was on the road to national redemption .
But as they returned , Arafat 's men appeared to forget that there were other Palestinians already in the Palestinian territory .
Desire for revenge
Men and women who had already fought their own first intifada paid a heavy sacrifice in blood , and forced Israel to take them seriously .
Move aside , the newcomers seemed to say .
We are in charge now .
Leave it to us .
For Gazans and West Bankers - secular and religious activists alike - this was galling .
When the newcomers began to flaunt their new - found wealth , building ostentatious villas in one of the poorest places on earth , disillusion quickly set in .
And there was brutality too .
Hamas activists were hounded , arrested , beaten and humiliated .
A bitter desire for revenge began to fester .
Hamas militants set up makeshift checkpoints in Gaza City
And imagine how much keener that desire became after Hamas won a democratic election in January 2006 , only to see that Fatah 's disdain persisted .
Hamas had not really expected to find themselves suddenly in power .
They wanted , rather , to be regarded as a legitimate part of the Palestinian movement .
But Fatah assumed that in time , its rivals would be crushed .
Israel , through air strikes and mass arrests , worked hard to achieve this .
' No plan to rule '
The international community shunned Hamas because of its association with terrorism , despite being advised by many on the ground that constructive engagement might be a more profitable course of action .
Hamas supporters , not surprisingly , became convinced that they were the targets of an international conspiracy designed to destroy them .
For now , the desire for retribution is too strong and will , I fear , only make things worse
You will hear wildly conflicting accounts of who started what in Gaza , but none of this really matters now .
What does matter is that Hamas won and , in the process , trashed all those vulgar villas and everything else that spoke of Fatah 's misrule .
But just as Hamas was startled by its victory at the ballot box , now it seems its gunmen are equally surprised at how easy it was to win the military battle .
A friend of mine in Gaza , welcoming the fact that the streets are now safer than they have been for two years , told me Hamas is in a quandary .
They simply have no plan to rule , he told me .
They do not even want to rule .
Opposite directions
But if Hamas is waiting for Fatah to come back , cap in hand , suing for peace , then it is going to be disappointed .
On Tuesday , Fatah 's central committee cut off all contacts with Hamas .
For now , the desire for retribution is too strong and will , I fear , only make things worse .
While in Ramallah , I visited the house of a prominent Hamas politician , Abdel Aziz Dweik , fire - bombed at the dead of night .
There was no - one inside .
Mr Dweik has been languishing in an Israeli jail for the past year .
But the shattered glass and soot - stained walls looked ugly enough .
" Reconciliation ?
After all this ?
No , " said Abu Amjad .
" Because no - one can forget the blood , especially when it has been shed by your own brothers .
We are one people , but right now we are sailing in two ships , in opposite directions . "

Lispは神の言語
神はLispで世界を創世したそうです。 歌詞を聴かなければ、普通のフォークソングに聞こえてしまうのが凄いと思いました。
Bob Kanefsky , " Eternal Flame " : MP3
歌詞 : 原文
gnu.org : Eternal Flame ( song parody ) より。
I was taught assembler in my second year of school .
It 's kinda like construction work -- with a toothpick for a tool .
So when I made my senior year , I threw my code away , And learned the way to program that I still prefer today .
Now , some folks on the Internet put their faith in C ++.
They swear that it 's so powerful , it 's what God used for us .
And maybe it lets mortals dredge their objects from the C .
But I think that explains why only God can make a tree .
For God wrote in Lisp code
When he filled the leaves with green .
The fractal flowers and recursive roots :
The most lovely hack I 've seen .
And when I ponder snowflakes , never finding two the same , I know God likes a language with its own four - letter name .
Now , I 've used a SUN under Unix , so I 've seen what C can hold .
I 've surfed for Perls , found what Fortran 's for , Got that Java stuff down cold .
Though the chance that I 'd write COBOL code is a SNOBOL 's chance in Hell .
And I basically hate hieroglyphs , so I wo n't use APL .
Now , God must know all these languages , and a few I have n't named .
But the Lord made sure , when each sparrow falls , that its flesh will be reclaimed .
And the Lord could not count grains of sand with a 32 - bit word .
Who knows where we would go to if Lisp were n't what he preferred ?
And God wrote in Lisp code Every creature great and small .
Do n't search the disk drive for man.c ,
When the listing 's on the wall .
And when I watch the lightning burn Unbelievers to a crisp , I know God had six days to work , So he wrote it all in Lisp .
Yes , God had a deadline .
So he wrote it all in Lisp .
歌詞 : 訳
歌詞を訳してみました。 ( 一部訳せていない部分があります。 ) 間違ってそうなので、間違いに気がついた方はご指摘して頂ければ幸いです。
直訳ではなく、音楽に合わせた歌詞にすれば日本語でカラオケなどで歌えそうな気もするのですが。。。
難しいですね。。。 1行目で挫折しました。
アセンブラは2年生で習った。 爪楊枝で建築をするようなものだった。
だから、大学4年でコードを全部捨ててしまった。
そして、今でも好きな言語を習った。 インターネットにはC++を崇拝するものがいる。 奴らは、C++は凄くて、神が使うのはC++だと言っている。 確かにCからオブジェクトを掘り起こす事ができる。
でも、木を作れるのが神だけである理由もそこにある。 神は葉を緑にするときにLispでコードを書いた。 フラクタルで花を生成したり、 再帰的な根は今まで見たhackの中でも最高だ。 雪の結晶は二つと同じものが無い。 神は4文字の言語が好きだということを、私は知っている。 私はUnixでSUNを使っていたからCが出来る事は知っている。
Perlを探求したし、Fortranが何のためにあるかも知った。 Javaは完全にマスターしたし、 COBOL のコードを書くのは地 獄でSNOBOLを書くようなものだ。 そして、基本的に象形文字は嫌いなのでAPLは使わない。 神はこれらの言語を全て知っている。 ここで名前を出さなかったものも知っている。
でも、神はスズメが落ちても肉体を再度(再帰)得られるようにしたし、 32bit wordでは砂は数えられなかった。 神 がLispを望まなければ、世の中はどうなっていたと思う？ そして神は大小全ての生き物をLispで書いた。
Do n't search the disk drive for man.c ,
When the listing 's on the wall .
And when I watch the lightning burn Unbelievers to a crisp , 神は6日間で仕事を終えなければならなかった。 だからこそLispで書いた。 そうだ。神には〆切りがあったんだ。 だからLispで全部書いたんだ。

The Polynesians , scattered as they were over 1,000 islands across the central and southern Pacific Ocean , were master navigators who tracked their way over a huge expanses of ocean without any of the complex mechanical aids we associate with sea fairing .
They did n’t have the astrolabe or the sextant , the compass or the chronometer .
They did however have aids of a sort , which though seemingly humble , were in fact the repositories of an extremely complex kind of knowledge .
Called Rebbelibs , Medos . and Mattangs , today we call them simply “ Stick Charts . ”
There are three kinds of stick charts .
The “ MATTANG ” or “ WAPPEPE ” is a small , square shaped chart which shows wave patterns around a single island or atoll and was used for teaching purposes only .
The “ REBBELIB ” is a general wave navigational chart mapping an entire chain , showing the relationships between the islands and the major ocean swells .
The “ MEDO ” covers only a few islands and is useful for specific voyages .
The charts were made by men from thin strips of coconut frond midribs or pandanus root .
They were then bound together with coconut sennit in geometric patterns depicting sea currents around the low lying atolls .
Small money cowrie shells or coral pebbles indicated islands and curved sticks represent wave patterns .
They were not carried on a voyage and the adult navigator gauged the wave patterns represented in the Stick Charts entirely by his sense of touch .
“ He would crouch in the bow of his canoe and literally feel every motion of the vessel . ”
As with ripples in a pond they “ concentrated on refraction of swells as they came in contact with undersea slopes of islands and the bending of swells around islands as they interacted with swells coming from opposite directions . ”
A fascinating aspect of the charts is that they varied so much in form and interpretation that they were “ readable ” only by the specific navigators who constructed them .
Evidently the knowledge contained in each was a closely guarded secret .
Wikipedia says : “ The stick charts are a significant contribution to the history of cartography because they represent a system of mapping ocean swells , which was never before accomplished .
They also use different materials than is common in other parts of the world .
They are an indication that ancient maps may have looked very different , and encoded different features from the earth , than the maps we use today . ”
Use of stick charts and navigation by swells apparently came to demise after World War II , when travel between islands by canoe halted .
They continue to be made in Polynesia , though very few people are able to use them as navigation aids .
They are made and sold instead as tourist souvenirs .

A district court ruled that the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's 2006 raid of the Congressional office of embattled Louisiana Democratic Representative William Jefferson was unconstitutional .
The court will also require the FBI to return all privileged materials seized to Jefferson .
" The review of the Congressman 's paper files when the search was executed exposed legislative material to the Executive , " according to the ruling from the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit , reports AP's Matt Apuzzo .
Jefferson was indicted in June on 16 counts stemming from a public corruption investigation .
He pleaded not guilty on all charges , and his trial is set for January 2008 .
The FBI referred all questions to the Justice Department , which had not yet replied at press time .
Jefferson 's attorney expressed his satisfaction with the ruling in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" We are pleased with the DC Circuits ruling that the unprecedented search conducted by the FBI violated Congressman Jeffersons rights under the Speech or Debate clause of the United States Constitution , " Trout stated .
" [ T ] he court ruled that the Congressman had an absolute right to review his records first and shield privileged legislative material from review by the executive branch . "
Trout went on to take a shot at the Justice Department , implying that it had broken the law .
" Todays opinion underscores the fact that the Department of Justice is required to follow the law , and that it is bound to abide by the Constitution , " he said .
And , he made it clear that Jefferson had no plan to back down , stating that , " We are confident that as this case moves forward , and when all of the facts are known , we will prevail again and clear Congressman Jeffersons name . "
From the " we live in a cave on a distant planet " department comes Official Meeting Facilities Guide 's magazine " OMFG " .
Now right there on the cover it indicates that they have a website ( also omfg.com ) which 1 .
I am surprised was not already taken by me , and 2 . might indicate that maybe somebody involved would be internet savvy enough to realize that the name you have chosen is horrible .
They were probably sitting at the boardroom table kicking around ideas for a name , and had them narrowed down to " LOL " , " WTF " , " STFU " , and " ROTFLMAO " before finally just going with the classic " OMFG " .

Edwards calls Ann Coulter ' she - devil ' RAW STORY
Published : Saturday August 18 , 2007
Print This Email This " Former Sen . John Edwards on Friday fired the latest round in his ongoing verbal feud with Ann Coulter , calling her a ' she - devil ' at a public event before quickly adding that he should n't engage in name - calling , " according to a blog post at ABC News .
Excerpts : Edwards , D - N.C. , was railing against the right - wing media -- including Fox News and Rush Limbaugh -- when he reminded a crowd in Burlington , Iowa , that his wife stood up to Coulter in a public spat earlier this summer .
" We know these people .
We know their game plan .
They 're going to attack us personally , " Edwards said .
" They attacked Elizabeth personally , because she stood up to that she - devil Ann Coulter .
I should not have name - called .
But the truth is -- forget the names -- people like Ann Coulter , they engage in hateful language . "
In front of a Republican - leaning crowd on Chris Matthew 's " Hardball " earlier this year , Coulter received an unexpected phone call from Elizabeth Edwards , asking the " journalist " to raise the level of public discourse in America above personal attacks .
" In the South , when somebody does something that displeases us , we like to ask them politely to stop doing it , " said Edwards .
" I 'd like to ask Ann Coulter too .
If she 'd like to debate on issues , on positions -- we certainly disagree with nearly everything she said on your show today -- but it 's quite another matter for these personal attacks . "
The call came on the heels of a " Good Morning America " appearance where Coulter was asked about her homophobic cutdown of the former North Carolina Senator a few months ago .
" So I 've learned my lesson .
If I 'm going to say anything about John Edwards in the future , " she replied .
" I 'll just wish he had been killed in a terrorist assassination plot . "

I tried out TiVo Desktop on my Mac and it was kind of cool .
It lets you play music on your TiVo that ’s streamed from your computer .
But my mac already streams music from my Linux server and TiVo desktop wanted to serve up real mp3s and not re-broadcast streams–so none of my music would play .
I found some articles and discovered the TiVo Desktop is just a http daemon plus some mdns stuff .
Sounds easy enough !
I installed mdns- scan ( thank you Debian ) which reports :
+ David Caldwell 's Photos on black._tivo-photos._tcp.local + David Caldwell 's Music on black._tivo-music._tcp.local
I copied /etc/ avahi / services / ssh.service to /etc/avahi/services/tivo.service .
I then changed the name to “ Lovely Music ” , “ _ssh._tcp ” to “ _tivo- music._tcp ” and picked a port out of the air : 8000 .
I reloaded the avahi daemon and wham , the “ Lovely Music ” shows up on the TiVo .
Yay !
The rest is just http on port 8000 that spews XML .
That should be fairly easy to do …
…. Time Passes ….
And 8 hours later I say , “ Fairly easy ? ” .
Actually it turned out to be pretty easy .
The main problem I had was that the %$ #@ !
TiVo had died on me and would n’t play any music , not even from the official TiVo Desktop .
I had to reset it to make it work again .
Of course , I kept thinking it was something I was doing wrong and so I kept implementing more and more of the protocol .
For 4 hours .
Grrr… .
Avahi
Turns out mdns - scan does n’t give enough info to really get it working .
I used avahi - discover which dumped the txt records that were needed .
In the end my avahi services file looked like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " standalone= 'no ' ?><!--*- nxml-*-->
<!
DOCTYPE service - group SYSTEM " avahi- service.dtd " > <!-- See avahi.service ( 5 ) for more information about this configuration file --> < service - group > < name > Lovely Music</ name > < service > < type>_tivo-music._tcp</type > < port>8001</port > < txt-record>protocol=http</txt-record > < txt-record> path=/tivo.cgi/music</txt-record > </ service > </service - group >
The path , < port > and < name > can be anything you want .
I ’m not sure about protocol .
Here ’s the corresponding one for the photo sharing :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " standalone= 'no ' ?><!--*- nxml-*-->
<!
DOCTYPE service - group SYSTEM " avahi- service.dtd " > <!-- See avahi.service ( 5 ) for more information about this configuration file --> < service - group > < name > Beautiful Photos </ name > < service > < type>_tivo-photos._tcp</type > < port>8001</port > < txt-record>protocol=http</txt-record > < txt-record>path=/tivo.cgi/photos</txt-record > </ service > </service - group >
http server
I set up port 8001 on apache and then wrote tivo.cgi .
I wrote it in the least general way possible and so I do n’t plan on publishing it–it just would n’t be of much use without specific perl data files that I already had lying around .
They actually are for the Philips Streamium server that I heavily modified .
And so I wanted to share them instead of putting a whole bunch of work into reinventing the interface …
I could publish my simple test server , if anyone is interested …
Photos
I have n’t looked too much at the photo sharing yet , but it looks exactly like the music sharing at first glance .
In fact , you can see in the avahi configs I pointed photos and music to the same tivo.cgi .
Only I do n’t really check for / music or / photo yet and so a couple times I accidentally selected the photo option from the TiVo menu and it came up with a list of my music folders in the thumbnails ( with the correct names and everything ) .
So I think it really is the same .
Protocol
The protocol is pretty simple .
The tivo will send a request like this ( each CGI parameter is on it ’s own line for clarity and horizontal space conservation ) :
/tivo.cgi/music?Recurse=No & Filter=x-container%2Ffolder , x-container%2Fplaylist , audio%2F* & SortOrder=Type , Title & ItemCount=0 & Details =Basic & Format=text %2Fxml
The server should respond with something like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < TiVoContainer > < Details > < Title > Top </ Title > < ContentType>x-container/tivo-music</ContentType > < SourceFormat>x-container/tivo-music</SourceFormat > < TotalItems>2</TotalItems > </ Details > < ItemStart>0</ItemStart > < ItemCount>0</ItemCount > </ TiVoContainer >
The TiVo will then repeat the request with a higher ItemCount :
/tivo.cgi/music?Recurse=No & Filter=x-container%2Ffolder , x-container%2Fplaylist , audio%2F* & SortOrder=Type , Title & ItemCount=2 & Details =Basic & Format=text %2Fxml
This time the server should give some < Item > s :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < TiVoContainer > < Details > < Title > Top </ Title > < ContentType>x-container/tivo-music</ContentType > < SourceFormat>x-container/tivo-music</SourceFormat > < TotalItems>2</TotalItems > </ Details > < Item > < Details > < Title > Flac</ Title > < ContentType>x-container/folder</ContentType > < SourceFormat>x-container/folder</SourceFormat > </ Details > < Links > < Content > < Url>/tivo.cgi/25</Url> </ Content > </ Links > </ Item > < Item > < Details > < Title> dsongs </ Title > < ContentType>x-container/folder</ContentType > < SourceFormat>x-container/folder</SourceFormat > </ Details > < Links > < Content > < Url>/tivo.cgi/26</Url> </ Content > </ Links > </ Item > < ItemStart>0</ItemStart > < ItemCount>2</ItemCount > </ TiVoContainer >
The TiVo will now show a menu with 2 items ( “ Flac ” , and “ dsongs ” ) .
If you select “ Flac ” it will send a new query the same as the the first but to / tivo.cgi/25?Recurse=No& ... etc .
So far I ’ve only shown < Item > s that were folders .
Here ’s what a song looks like :
< Item > < Details > < Title > Way Out -></ Title > < SongTitle > Way Out -></SongTitle > < SourceBitRate>320</SourceBitRate > < AlbumTitle > The Middle Of Nowhere </ AlbumTitle > < ArtistName > Orbital</ArtistName > < AlbumYear > 1999</AlbumYear > < ContentType>audio/mpeg</ContentType > < SourceFormat>audio/mpeg</SourceFormat > </ Details > < Links > < Content > < Url >
http://10.0.0.1:8080/db/730f0108/01-iTunes-320.mp3</Url> </ Content > </ Links > </ Item >
Note that the URL can point anywhere –to another port on my server in this case ( running Apache : : MP3 plus some transcoding extensions I wrote –that ’s why the directory is labeled “ Flac ” but we ’re pulling mp3s out of it ) .
I do n’t show it in this case , but there are also < Duration > and < MusicGenre > tags .
I do n’t know if they are order dependent or not , but I copied the TiVoDesktop server which puts them after < SongTitle > and < AlbumYear > respectively .
The next thing that can happen is if you scroll through a list that has more than 8 items in it .
When it needs to get the next set of items it issues something like this :
/tivo.cgi/22?Recurse=No & Filter=x -container%2Ffolder , x-container%2Fplaylist , audio%2F* & SortOrder=Type , Title & AnchorItem=%2Ftivo.cgi%2F3 & AnchorOffset=-1 & ItemCount=1 & Details =Basic & Format=text %2Fxml
So they added 2 new parameters : AnchorItem and AnchorOffset .
< rant >
Whoever made up this part of the protocol was drunk .
Notice that AnchorItem is given as a URL instead of an offset .
This means if you have a list of < Item > s you have to search through them to find the URL of the AnchorItem .
You could use a hash table to efficiently look for it but then you still need the original list so you can get the next 7 items .
So for no good reason ( that I can tell ) this part of the protocol complicates your life .
</rant >
Anyway , once you ’ve found which < Item > the AnchorItem is referring to , you need to iterate AnchorItem by AnchorOffset +
1 . Yes , +1 .
That ’s why they almost always pass - 1 as AnchorOffset .
Lovely .
One other “ interesting ” thing : ItemCount can be negative .
If you scroll up through a list it ’ll start sending you negative counts .
I deal with this like this :
if ( $ count < 0 ) { $ start += $ count ; $ count = - $ count ; }
I also then make sure to clip $ start and $ count so they are within the list of items on that container .
When you select a track to play the TiVo will ask for details on just that item like this :
/tivo.cgi/4?Command=QueryItem & Url=http%3A%2F%2F10.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fdb%2F730f0108%2F01-iTunes-320.mp3
The response looks like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < TiVoItem > < Item > < Details > < Title > Way Out -></ Title > < SongTitle > Way Out -></SongTitle > < SourceBitRate>320</SourceBitRate > < AlbumTitle > The Middle Of Nowhere </ AlbumTitle > < ArtistName > Orbital</ArtistName > < AlbumYear > 1999</AlbumYear > < ContentType>audio/mpeg</ContentType > < SourceFormat>audio/mpeg</SourceFormat > </ Details > < Links > < Content > < Url >
http://10.0.0.1:8080/db/730f0108/01-iTunes-320.mp3</Url> </ Content > </ Links > </ Item > </ TiVoItem >
That ’s just a standard < Item > wrapped in a < TiVoItem > tag .
That is enough to set up a hierarchy , have the TiVo be able to maneuver around and play music .
I wanted shuffle though so I enabled it in the TiVo expecting it to just jump around in the folders randomly .
Nope .
It sends this :
/tivo.cgi/1?Recurse=Yes & Filter=audio%2F * & SortOrder=Random & RandomSeed=1172006919 &RandomStart=http%3A%2F%2F10.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fdb%2F0511ce12%2F02-iTunes-320.mp3 &AnchorItem=http%3A%2F%2F10.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fdb%2F5f103b07%2F04-iTunes-320.mp3&ItemCount=1 & Details=Optimal & Format=text %2Fxml
RandomSeed and RandomStart are constant once you ’ve started some music playing with shuffle enabled on the TiVo .
Essentially
It sends you the last song it played in AnchorItem and expects you to return a new song to play in < TiVoItem > form .
For now I just key off of the SortOrder parameter and give a random item from the folder I ’m in .
This is n’t a good shuffle on small playlists since it will repeat songs while ignoring others , but it was simple .
In fact , the implementation I made only does the bare minimum to work .
I ignore most of the parameters passed in ( like Details and Filter ) but it works just fine ( for now ) .
Debugging
What helped me was pointing towards the TiVo Desktop server on my Mac and submitting test queries .
I ’d also always had the apache access.log open in my Emacs so I could see what the TiVo was trying to ask me .
And if I did n’t understand I ’d recreate the query on the Mac to see what it would do .
I ’ll try to post more later , especially if there is some interest .
Conclusion
I ’m happy I did this .
It is n’t complete but it good enough for me for the time being .
It ’s been working all day ( I ’m listening to music out of my substandard TV speakers as I write this ) .
Deborah Jeane Palfrey first knew something was wrong on a trip to Germany .
She suddenly found her bank card was not working any more .
Then , back in her hotel room , a journalist from a gossip website called her .
He had been leaked a court document detailing Palfrey 's alleged sex empire in Washington DC , serving the rich and powerful with a ring of beautiful , university - educated call girls .
Her assets had been seized by the government .
As Palfrey struggled to understand what was happening , the journalist wanted to know if she was ashamed of herself .
The ' DC Madam ' scandal had just been born .
It is a story that has gripped Washington 's usually staid political classes .
Palfrey stands accused of running a prostitution ring for more than 13 years .
It is a charge she denies , maintaining her girls dealt out only massages and erotic role - play .
She made them all sign agreements not to engage in illegal behaviour .
Palfrey has vowed to identify the men who used her services to prove her story , and she has years of phone records to help her .
All across the Washington area there are now thousands of nervous , powerful - often married - men .
But the DC Madam story is much more than a titillating guessing game .
The scale of her operation exposed a dark underside of Washington life .
Often decried as a dull government town , it has shown how sex and prostitution are key to how Washington works .
From Nasa to the Pentagon to the State Department , officials of all levels were using Palfrey 's girls .
The saga has also revealed a deep hypocrisy , showing how powerful men talk publicly of their ' family values ' and then have escorts visit them in hotel rooms .
As Rob Capriccioso , editor of Big Head DC , a Washington news and gossip website , says : ' Tawdry sex is everywhere in Washington . '
It is not a scandal that is going to go away .
Last Sunday , as President Bush sat in St John 's Church in Lafayette Square for the morning service , the Rev Luis Leon remarked on Palfrey 's case in his sermon .
' Here in Washington DC a lot of people get in trouble on this one , ' Leon said .
When the President 's priest is talking about a sex scandal , you know trouble is brewing in Washington .
Palfrey 's clients came from all walks of life .
There is a Bush administration economist , a prominent company chief executive , Nasa officials , men who work at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , lobbyists for Republicans and Democrats , the commander of an air force squadron and at least five other military officers .
So far the identities - of perhaps up to 10,000 men - have remained secret .
Only two have been exposed .
One was Harlan Ullman , a military expert and the author of the ' shock and awe ' strategy used in Iraq .
The other was State Department official Randall Tobias , who , ironically , is a leading advocate of fighting prostitution abroad .
He has now resigned .
The one thing all the men have in common was that they once rang Pamela Martin and Associates , the cover name for Palfrey 's operation , which advertised , like hundreds of other ' massage ' services in Washington , online or in local newspapers .
Calls were rerouted to Palfrey 's home in California - specifically to a phone in her laundry room , where she sometimes battled the sound of her washing machine as she took down details of her client 's desires .
She ran a network of about 130 girls .
One was a legal secretary , another a University of Maryland academic and another an instructor at a naval academy .
They charged $ 300 an hour .
It was lucrative , but not a goldmine .
Over 13 years she earned $ 2 m .
That 's enough to get very comfortable with , but hardly a fortune .
The surprising truth of the DC Madam is how ordinary her operation was .
Compared to the high - octane glamour of Hollywood 's famous madam Heidi Fleiss , or New York 's blueblood procuress Sydney Biddle Barrows , Palfrey was very Washington : subdued , respectable and modest .
That modesty is displayed during her court appearances , where she has eschewed fashionable clothes , wearing navy blue outfits and subdued makeup .
' She looks like she should be wearing little white gloves .
She 's a soft - spoken woman .
I curse more than her , ' said Lee Mirabel , a radio host who acts as her spokeswoman .
Palfrey would send out weekly messages to her girls , offering advice like a corporate newsletter .
' Nail colour is to match lipstick colour , ' she suggested .
She also said girls should use ' fat cream for the thighs ' .
But the missives also acknowledged the legally shaky side of the business .
She warned of an investigation by a Virginia vice squad officer , advising girls to burn or shred evidence of their client meetings within 24 hours .
' Destroy the data immediately !!!!!!!' , she demanded .
Palfrey had good reason to be worried .
She had been caught before .
She was arrested in California in 1990 for running a smaller escort service .
She ended up disappearing during her trial , leaving a long note with her lawyer saying the idea of prison was ' an absurd and unthinkable horror ' .
But she was caught on the Canadian border the next year and served 18 months in jail .
Not that it deterred her .
She started Pamela Martin and Associates - where she was known as ' Miz Julia ' - in 1993 , shortly after she was released .
Her luck held out longer the second time around .
She ran her business without incident until 2004 , when - unknown to her - a tip - off to the tax authorities alerted them to her activities .
It is believed to have come from someone angered by discovering his girlfriend was one of Palfrey 's escorts .
For two years detectives investigated the business , finally descending on it in October last year .
But investigators combing through her home did not notice a huge pile of phone records .
In total they weighed 21kg and recorded more than quarter of a million phone calls dating from the Clinton years through to the current Bush administration .
The records were in Palfrey 's hands - the police had been looking for ' a little black book ' , unaware that Palfrey did not have one .
Now she is using those lists to show the DC establishment who used her service that she will not go quietly .
' She has always realised the depth and breadth behind the names on her lists , and she has effectively used her own power in order to try to come out on top , ' says Capriccioso .
One of Palfrey 's missives is more telling than beauty tips .
' Congress is back in session , ' she enthused to her girls .
' This always helps to boost business ! '
For the truth exposed by the DC Madam - and largely ignored by the American press so far - has been how ingrained the sex industry is in Washington .
Escort services operate openly .
In the metro area of the city an online search reveals more than 8,000 adverts for escort services .
' That 's more escort services than there are McDonald's , ' says Mirabel .
In many ways Washington represents a perfect market for a booming sex industry .
Being a government - dominated town , it is heavily male - many rich , powerful and middle - aged .
It is home to major international organisations , such as the World Bank , that are full of well - paid workers away from their home countries , where prostitution might be more socially acceptable .
Or , like many visiting diplomats or businessmen , they might simply be lonely .
Washington also plays host to the Pentagon and the huge military support structure that surrounds it .
Many of the calls on Palfrey 's list come from Pentagon City numbers .
The five - star Ritz - Carlton ( one of the most common numbers on Palfrey 's lists ) is nearby .
' It is going on unabated .
There are brothels and services of every type , ' says Bill Keisling , a crime writer and friend of Palfrey .
Palfrey 's attempts to publicise those who used her services has led many to accuse her of blackmail .
But the real story of victimhood is not the men who may be exposed or already have been .
The real victim here is Brandy Britton , one of Palfrey 's girls who was arrested by local police just as the investigation reached full swing .
Britton , a former lecturer in sociology and biology , was also a call girl , entertaining clients in her suburban home .
Her arrest threw her into the full glare of the media .
She could not take the exposure and the mother - of - two hanged herself in January .
' The press ruined her , ' says Keisling .
Others who have had their private lives exposed in the Washington media know how bad it can feel .
' One day you 're just living your life , then suddenly it 's everyone 's business , ' says Jessica Cutler , a former junior Senate aide whose blog about her numerous affairs in Washington became a scandal when her identity was revealed .
She was fired .
But then the DC Madam scandal is , at its heart , about hypocrisy .
It is about the Washington movers and shakers sweating out the prospect of Palfrey 's court case .
It is about the public face of a city whose political denizens exhort others to standards they clearly fail to meet themselves .
' We think of ourselves as faithful to our Puritan founders , but the US regularly loses its innocence with scandals like this , ' says Bruce Gronbeck , an expert on political scandal at the University of Iowa .
Palfrey is not giving up .
She recently turned over about 20 per cent of her client list to ABC News .
She claims she did it to enlist its help in identifying her clients so they could exonerate her ; it is a disingenuous argument .
ABC 's main investigative reporter , Brian Ross , concluded the names they found were not newsworthy enough to publish - yet it still devoted a prime - time show to highlighting the case and its exclusive interview with Palfrey .
Palfrey has barely begun .
She will find other ways to get the names into the public domain .
Many wo n't blame her .
' I never named names , but if she 's getting in trouble , so should her clients , ' says Cutler .
Palfrey has been selling interviews on eBay .
She has also handed over a whole new section of her list to a group of Washington investigative writers and there is the coming court case in which she will be defended by Preston Burton , the lawyer who once represented Monica Lewinsky .
That seems fitting .
' She 's decided to fight this until the end , ' says Mirabel .
The story of the DC Madam may have only just begun .

Jon Carroll
For a long time , I 've had a lot of trouble understanding this sub - prime lender thing .
It just could n't be real .
I figured it must be some higher economics that I , as a high school graduate , could not hope to understand .
Here 's the way it seemed to me :
Guy walks into a lending institution and says , " I 'd like to buy a house .
I have no assets , no job and only one form of identification , a Cody , Wyo. , library card . "
Lender : " Of course you want to have a house .
It 's the American dream .
Heck , I own a house , and as you can see I 'm wearing a suit that cost more than your car .
And I know you want security for your family .
So how much do you need ? "
Borrower : " Did you hear the part about my current financial situation ? "
Lender : " This is America !
Everyone deserves a break , a second chance , a piece of the pie .
I do n't even want to know the details .
Do you have a dollar in your pocket ? "
Borrower : " Sure ! "
Lender : " That 's your down payment !
Simple as that .
Now , how big a mortgage do you want ? "
Borrower : " Uh , $ 200,000 ? "
Lender : " Two hundred K ?
In this market ?
Are you kidding ?
Let 's make it 600 K .
You can get a nice little starter house in a marginal neighborhood for that .
And here 's the best part :
For the first year , your payments are only $ 49.95 a month .
After that , rates and payment schedules change , but that 's a whole 12 months away and in between , you 'll be the envy of your friends .
Shake , partner . "
Now , who on God 's earth thought that was a good idea ?
Could n't even the dullest adult ( like , say , me ) see disaster coming a mile away ?
It did not take a particular kind of genius to forecast despair and heartbreak .
But the lending institution wanted the mortgage because it could sell it to another company that would use the full value of the mortgage as collateral to get a loan to take over U.S. Plumbing and Parrots ( USP&P ) , a publicly held company .
And everyone would pretend that of course the loan was going to be repaid , that it was a rock - solid investment , and everyone could trust everyone and all the birdies in the trees sing your favorite melodies .
In fact , not a negative word was heard from the people passing by .
And the borrowers !
I can kind of understand the dynamic , using a frat - boy brand of logic .
" Hey , we get this great crib right now for peanuts , and the payments will get huge at some point but , dude , by then we 'll be in Mazatlan .
My brother ! "
And then there 'd be tribal - recognition finger waggling , and they 'd own a house .
Or rather , they'd be entitled to live in a house that someone else owned , but they 'd still get to be called homeowners and deduct the interest paid from their income taxes , provided they had income .
Come to think of it , maybe that 's what the lenders were thinking about too : Mazatlan .
As long as the fragile bubble did not burst , they would make a lot of money and purchase , through a dummy corporation , a very large house in Mazatlan .
What they were doing was not illegal - indeed , it could even be seen in benign social terms , as lowering the barriers to home owning or some damn thing - but , when everything fell apart , people might get mad and the lenders might want to be in Mazatlan , where they could surf the same beaches as the people who borrowed money from them .
Not surfing the beaches would be anybody who took this subprime lending stuff seriously .
That would include young families who somehow thought their house came with magic beans , and the holders of stock in subprime lending companies , who also believed in magic beans , plus an unknown number of citizens who invested in some fund somewhere that was trying to show a high rate of return by purchasing subprime mortgages .
" What 's safer than real estate ? " they would say .
" They 're not making any more land . "
It 's a seductive line , but it 's just another line , much like " I 'll call you in the morning . "
And then everybody runs around for a while singing Bruce Springsteen songs , and stocks go tumbling and people sell at a loss because people mutter " dot- com , dot - com " to themselves with great regularity while waiting for their broker 's
Web page to reload , and finally the business page has something to write about .
I know I must be missing something , because it can't be this simple .
The fundamentals are sound , we are told , and the Fed is sanguine , and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing just fine , so settle down , little children , as you sleep on your aunt 's sister 's couch .
It 's all a big adventure .

I know the lead singer , his name is Peter Brooke - Turner .
He 's a lovely guy but I 've never quite gotten my head round the fact that someone who stands around six foot seven , chose to play the smallest guitar in the world .
I asked him about the Jools Holland appearance and he said it was filmed in November ( what you mean you thought it was live ? ) and that some bloke came over to wish him luck then wandered off .
It was Eric Clapton .

The annual Perseid meteor shower is expected to put on a great show this year , peaking in mid-August with a display of dozens of shooting stars each hour .
The Moon will be out of the way , leaving dark skies for good viewing as Earth plunges through an ancient stream of comet debris .
Little bits , most no larger than sand grains , will vaporize in Earth 's atmosphere , creating sometimes - dramatic " shooting stars . "
" It 's going to be a great show , " said Bill Cooke of NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
" The Moon is new on August 12 , which means no moonlight , dark skies and plenty of meteors . "
How many ?
This year the Perseid meteor shower could deliver one or two visible streaks every minute during peak times , Cooke said in a statement yesterday .
Urban skywatchers will see fewer due to local light pollution .
The meteors in this shower all appear to emanate from the constellation Perseus .
The best times to watch will be late night Aug. 12 through dawn Aug. 13 .
" The August Perseids are among the strongest of the readily observed annual meteor showers , and at maximum activity nominally yield 90 or 100 meteors per hour , " said Joe Rao , SPACE.com 's Skywatching columnist .
" However , observers with exceptional skies often record even larger numbers . "
Observing tips
To see the show , one need only find a comfortable spot with a clear view of the northeast horizon , away from local lights .
A dark rural location is best .
Lie back on a blanket or lounge chair and scan the entire sky .
In the late evening , starting around 9 p.m. local time , sharp - eyed observers might see " earthgrazing " meteors that skim the northeast horizon .
" Earthgrazers are long , slow and colorful , " Cooke said .
" They are among the most beautiful of meteors . "
But do n't expect more than a handful in an hour , he said .
Later and during the overnight hours , the shooting stars will be higher in the sky as Perseus rises .
Some skywatchers enjoy counting the number of meteors they see per minute , per hour or during a 15 - minute interval and comparing notes .
Telescopes and binoculars are no help , as the meteors move too swiftly and are best observed with the naked eye .
The cosmic rivers of debris have been laid down for millennia by the comet Swift - Tuttle , which passes through the inner solar system every 130 years .
Perseid meteoroids are exceptionally fast , entering Earth 's atmosphere at roughly 133,200 mph ( 60 kilometers per second ) relative to the planet , slamming into the air like bugs hitting a windshield .
Rolling Stone has the audio from Jann Wenner ’s interview with John Lennon , conducted in December of 1970 .

Three and a half hours of interviews .
( CNN ) -- Americans may need passports to board domestic flights or to picnic in a national park next year if they live in one of the states defying the federal Real ID Act .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says there are no plans for a federal database of drivers ' information .
The act , signed in 2005 as part of an emergency military spending and tsunami relief bill , aims to weave driver 's licenses and state ID cards into a sort of national identification system by May 2008 .
The law sets baseline criteria for how driver 's licenses will be issued and what information they must contain .
The Department of Homeland Security insists Real ID is an essential weapon in the war on terror , but privacy and civil liberties watchdogs are calling the initiative an overly intrusive measure that smacks of Big Brother .
More than half the nation 's state legislatures have passed or proposed legislation denouncing the plan , and some have penned bills expressly forbidding compliance .
Several states have begun making arrangements for the new requirements -- four have passed legislation applauding the measure -- but even they may have trouble meeting the act 's deadline .
The cards would be mandatory for all " federal purposes , " which include boarding an airplane or walking into a federal building , nuclear facility or national park , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the National Conference of State Legislatures last week .
Citizens in states that do n't comply with the new rules will have to use passports for federal purposes .
" For terrorists , travel documents are like weapons , " Chertoff said .
" We do have a right and an obligation to see that those licenses reflect the identity of the person who 's presenting it . "
Chertoff said the Real ID program is essential to national security because there are presently 8,000 types of identification accepted to enter the United States .
" It is simply unreasonable to expect our border inspectors to be able to detect forgeries on documents that range from baptismal certificates from small towns in Texas to cards that purport to reflect citizenship privileges in a province somewhere in Canada , " he said .
Chertoff attended the conference in Boston , Massachusetts , in part to allay states ' concerns , but he had few concrete answers on funding .
The Department of Homeland Security , which estimates state and federal costs could reach $ 23.1 billion over 10 years , is looking for ways to lessen the burden on states , he said .
On the recent congressional front , however , Chertoff could point only to an amendment killed in the Senate last month that would 've provided $ 300 million for the program .
" There 's going to be an irreducible expense that falls on you , and that 's part of the shared responsibility , " Chertoff told the state legislators .
Bill Walsh , senior legal fellow for the Heritage Foundation , a Washington - based conservative think tank that supports the Real ID Act , said states should n't be pushing for more federal dollars because , ultimately , that will mean more federal oversight -- and many complaints about cost coincide with complaints about the federal government overstepping its bounds .
" They are only being asked to do what they should 've already done to protect their citizens , " Walsh said , blaming arcane software and policies at state motor vehicle departments for what he called " a tremendous trafficking in state driver 's licenses . "
The NCSL is calling Real ID an " unfunded mandate " that could cost states up to $ 14 billion over the next decade , but for which only $ 40 million has been federally approved .
The group is demanding Congress pony up $ 1 billion for startup costs by year 's end or scrap the proposal altogether .
Everyone must visit DMV by 2013
The Real ID Act repealed a provision in the 9/11 Commission Implementation
Act calling for state and federal officials to examine security standards for driver 's licenses .
It called instead for states to begin issuing new federal licenses , lasting no longer than eight years , by May 11 , 2008 , unless they are granted an extension .
It also requires all 245 million license and state ID holders to visit their local departments of motor vehicles and apply for a Real ID by 2013 .
Applicants must bring a photo ID , birth certificate , proof of Social Security number and proof of residence , and states must maintain and protect massive databases housing the information .
NCSL spokesman Bill Wyatt said the requirements are " almost physically impossible . "
States will have to build new facilities , secure those facilities and shell out for additional equipment and personnel .
Those costs are going to fall back on the American taxpayer , he said .
It might be in the form of a new transportation , motor vehicle or gasoline tax .
Or you might find it tacked on to your next state tax bill .
In Texas , Wyatt said , one official told him that without federal funding , the Lone Star State might have to charge its citizens more than $ 100 for a license .
" We kind of feel like the way they went about this is backwards , " Wyatt said , explaining that states would have appreciated more input into the process .
" Each state has its own unique challenges and these are best addressed at state levels .
A one - size - fits - all approach to driver 's licenses does n't necessarily work . "
Many states have revolted .
The governors of Idaho , Maine , Montana , New Hampshire , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Washington have signed bills refusing to comply with the act .
Six others have passed bills and / or resolutions expressing opposition , and 15 have similar legislation pending .
Though the NCSL says most states ' opposition stems from the lack of funding , some states cited other reasons for resisting the initiative .
New Hampshire passed a House bill opposing the program and calling Real ID " contrary and repugnant " to the state and federal constitutions .
A Colorado House resolution dismissed Real ID by expressing support for the war on terror but " not at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties of citizens of this country . "
Privacy concerns raised
Colorado and New Hampshire lawmakers are not alone .
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation say the IDs and supporting databases -- which Chertoff said would eventually be federally interconnected -- will infringe on privacy .
EFF says on its
Web site that the information in the databases will lay the groundwork for " a wide range of surveillance activities " by government and businesses that " will be able to easily read your private information " because of the bar code required on each card .
The databases will provide a one - stop shop for identity thieves , adds the ACLU on its Web site , and the U.S. " surveillance society " and private sector will have access to the system " for the routine tracking , monitoring and regulation of individuals ' movements and activities . "
The civil liberties watchdog dubs the IDs " internal passports " and claims it would n't be long before office buildings , gas stations , toll booths , subways and buses begin accessing the system .
But Chertoff told legislators last week that DHS has no intention of creating a federal database , and Walsh , of the Heritage Foundation , said the ACLU 's allegations are disingenuous .
States will be permitted to share data only when validating someone 's identity , Walsh said .
" The federal government would n't have any greater access to driver 's license information than it does today , " Walsh said .
States have the right to refuse to comply with the program , he said , and they also have the right to continue issuing IDs and driver 's licenses that do n't meet Real ID requirements .
But , Walsh said , " any state that 's refusing to implement this key recommendation by the 9/11 Commission , and whose state driver 's licenses are as a result used in another terrorist attack , should be held responsible . "
State reaction to Real ID has not been all negative .
Four states have passed bills or resolutions expressing approval for the program , and 13 states have similar legislation pending ( Several states have pending pieces of legislation both applauding and opposing Real ID ) .
Chertoff said there would be repercussions for states choosing not to comply .
" This is not a mandate , " Chertoff said .
" A state does n't have to do this , but if the state does n't have -- at the end of the day , at the end of the deadline -- Real ID - compliant licenses then the state cannot expect that those licenses will be accepted for federal purposes . "

July 25 , 2007  --
He was born to be wild -- but only after a hot shower and room service .
The Discovery Channel has issued a statement in response to an investigation into its popular series " Man vs. Wild , " following allegations that the show 's host , Bear Grylls , had a little help battling the wild : a motel .
" Discovery Communications has learned that isolated elements of the ' Man vs. Wild ' show in some episodes were not natural to the environment , and that for health and safety concerns the crew and host received some survival assistance while in the field , " the network stated .
The series ' production company , Diverse Television , is cooperating with British television 's Channel 4 , which carries the program under a the name " Born Survivor : Bear Grylls . "
Channel 4 confirmed that Grylls had spent the night indoors on at least two occasions when the series had led viewers to believe he was spending the night in the wild .
Sort of like a modern day Tarzan , Grylls is airlifted into the wild with only a few survival tools , such as a flint or water bottle .
The reality show hunk , who has appeared on several talk shows to the screaming delight of women of all ages , served in the British Special Air Services .
On the show , he reportedly survives for several days with no outside assistance .
Grylls has been filmed stranded in the deadly swamps of the Florida Everglades , paragliding onto the edge of the Andes to follow rivers into the Ecuadorean jungle and demonstrating how to make a snow cave , find water in deep tunnels and avoid frostbite in Iceland 's arctic environment .
But if there 's a warm bed waiting nearby , just how impressive are these stunts ?
Among the Grylls grievances is an episode supposedly set on a deserted island ( actually Hawaii ) that shows him building a raft , which was actually constructed and then disassembled by show consultants so that the host could easily put it together .
And though Grylls claims to be a horse wrangler , another charge maintains that the wild horses Grylls happened upon in the Sierra Nevada were not so wild , and were in fact from a trekking station .
The Discovery Channel gave no indication it was ditching the show entirely .
Instead , the show will be tweaked .
" Moving forward , the program will be 100 percent transparent , and all elements of the filming will be explained upfront to our viewers , " Discovery said in its statement .
" In addition , shows that are to be repeated will be edited appropriately .
Bear Grylls is a world - class adventurer and a terrific talent . "
No word on what " transparent " means or how fans of the series will react , but perhaps Discovery should add a disclaimer to the show : Survival made possible by hotel stay and dramatization of events .
This is treason , against all three nations , and tyranny against the people .
This diabolical manipulation is going on secretly behind the backs of citizens who have absolutely no public forum , information or input or choice .
This is the corporatist New World Order , the elite plan for global domination .
After global government is set up , the next stage is concentration camps and mass graves .
Do n’t believe it ?
Stop being foolish .
Study a bit of history and you will learn that when leaders act like masters instead of public servants , with hubris instead of humility , genocide is not far away .
In fact , it is already ongoing and you will see it if you just do a little investigating .
This cruel reality must be faced and faced now by all those who care about life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
The elites have declared war on humanity .
We just have to fight this very aggressively with everything we ’ve got because it is truly a matter of life and death .
Everyone : Mexican , American and Candian , Left , Right and Center , can see how and why this is bad for all of us and can get behind political actions to stop the SPP .
So we can support each other ’s movements even if we disagree on some issues , because we agree that maintaining national sovereignty is basic to maintaining political freedom and independence .

Secretive SPP confab to be protected by 25 km military cordon , forums blocked
Infowars.net | Jul 25 , 2007
by Steve Watson
The US army is to enforce a huge security perimeter around the upcoming North American Union meeting in Canada this August as well as cracking down on expected protests , having already shut down a public forum due to take place close to the event .
The Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting in Montebello , Quebec on August 20 and 21 is to be policed by American forces , who along with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) and the Sûreté du Québec ( SQ ) have already refused to allow the Municipality of Papineauville , which is about six kilometres from Montebello , to rent a community centre to the Council of Canadians action group who were planning to hold a public forum the night before the confab to express their concerns about the meeting and the issues being discussed .
“ It is deplorable that we are being prevented from bringing together a panel of writers , academics and parliamentarians to share their concerns about the Security and Prosperity Partnership with Canadians , ” said Brent Patterson , director of organizing with the Council of Canadians .
“ Meanwhile , six kilometres away , corporate leaders from the United States , Mexico and Canada will have unimpeded access to our political leaders . ”
The Council of Canadians has also been told that in addition to the 25 km perimeter in Montebello , there will be checkpoints in nearby areas , and vehicles carrying more than five people will be turned back .
A whole host of other Canadian activist groups are scheduling protests despite the military cordon .
According to journalist and NAU researcher Jerome R. Corsi , the protesters believe that as many as 10,000 people could assemble in Quebec to demonstrate .
One particular activist group , Canadian Action Party , has taken issue with US troops coordinating operations for the confab on Canadian soil while denying access to Canadian citizens .
CAP ’s leader said , ” Bad enough that our RCMP and the Quebec provincial police force would apply offensive Canadian law to prevent a legitimate meeting of dissenting citizens .
Totally untenable that a foreign army assumes jurisdiction on our land .
But this we knew from the Binational Planning Agreement begun in 2002 that saw Canada crawl on its belly and permit the USA military to enter our land whenever it deems necessary . ”
“ Does anyone still believe that our federal leaders have not thrown away our sovereignty ?
That from Chretien ( Liberal ) to Martin ( Liberal ) to Harper ( Conservative ) , the Prime Ministers of our land have not been committing treason behind closed doors ?
How otherwise would it be possible that a proud , sovereign , and free nation would see a foreign army on its soil interfering with the right of Canadians to assemble and to speak ? ”
Elite lobbying group the Council on Foreign Relations seeded the plan for a “ North American Advisory Council ” which eventually became the SPP .
It comes as no surprise to NAU researchers that the latest SPP meeting will be a highly secretive and guarded affair given that CFR documents have revealed that the group wants to “ establish private bodies that would meet regularly or annually to buttress North American relationships , along the lines of the Bilderberg conferences . ”
Internal SPP documents released under the FOIA have also shown that a wide range of US administrative law is being re-written in stealth under this program to “ integrate ” and “ harmonize ” with administrative law in Mexico and Canada , in a similar fashion to moves that have become commonplace within the EU .
The documents contain references to upwards of 13 working groups within an entire organized infrastructure that has drawn from officials within most areas of administrative government including U.S. departments of State , Homeland Security , Commerce , Treasury , Agriculture , Transportation , Energy , Health and Human Services , and the office of the US Trade Representative .
During the upcoming SPP meeting an advisory Council created last year known as the North American Competitiveness Council will meet on issues including border regulation and competitiveness in the automotive , transportation , manufacturing and services sectors .
The council is expected to meet annually with security and prosperity ministers and will engage with senior government officials on an ongoing basis .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is scheduled to host the Quebec summit which Mexican President Felipe Calderon and US President George W. Bush also planning to attend .
The highest elected officials within the US , Canadian and Mexican governments are meeting together with advisory bodies staffed by senior private sector representatives yet the public are being forcibly denied any access to the event in addition to a pathetic blackout on behalf of the corporate media which still ridicules anyone who suggests the North American Union plan even exists .

Petraeus and Crocker to testify publicly on Iraq
The White House made clear today that the top U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Iraq will testify publicly before Congress next month , easing a brewing spat between the White House and the Democratic - controlled Congress over the possibility of closed - door - only sessions .
The administration is required by law to deliver a full report to Congress on President Bush ’s troop surge by Sept. 15 , a move that is expected to escalate the next round of congressional debate over ending the war .
“ General [ David ] Petraeus and Ambassador [ Ryan ]
Crocker will testify to the Congress in both open as well as closed sessions prior to the Sept. 15 report , ” said Gordon Johndroe , the spokesman for the National Security Council .
“ They will report to Congress , and more importantly , they will report to the American people on what they see on the ground there , ” Johndroe told reporters in Crawford , Texas , where the president is vacationing .
Johndroe denied reports that the White House was considering having the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador there give only closed - door briefings , accusing Democrats of “ trying to start a fight where there really is n't one . ”
The much - anticipated report will contain assessments of the situation on the ground in Iraq from Petraeus and Crocker , as well as Admiral William J. Fallon , commander of U.S. Central Command , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
Though Johndroe put to rest any speculation that the two men would not testify publicly , the incident still did not sit well with some Democrats on Capitol Hill .
“ The fact that the White House was even entertaining the idea of keeping the Petraeus and Crocker testimony secret is unacceptable , ” said Rodell Mollineau , a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
“ We will continue to put pressure on this administration to be frank and honest about the reality in the ground in Iraq . ”

BBC science reporter
Dr Venter says the research brings him closer to creating synthetic life
Dr Craig Venter says in the journal Science that his team successfully transplanted an entire genome from one bacterium cell to another .
He says he hopes eventually to use the technique to create designer microbes , which could produce artificial fuel or help clean up toxic waste .
Dr Venter was a pioneer in mapping the human genome .
Organic tools
The ultimate plan is to stitch together artificial chromosomes , proteins and other building blocks with the aim of jumpstarting their designer microbe to life .
But Dr Venter concedes that this may be a long way away , but he says he has taken an important key step towards that goal .
His team , essentially , snatched the body of another life - form and invaded it with a new genetic code .
This , he says , will be a key tool in testing the artificial chromosomes - or DNA bundles - he plans to make .
" What 's in this paper is the result of taking a native chromosome from one species , " Dr Venter explained .
" That chromosome was transplanted , inserted through the cell walls , the cell membrane of a second species and , after several days of growth and cell division , the original chromosome in the cell disappears and we have cells containing only the transplanted chromosome . "
Different views
But there are those who are worried about what Dr Venter is doing .
Some fear the technology could be used to create biological weapons or simply that something unforeseen may emerge from the laboratory .
Others are concerned that his institute 's efforts to patent research could restrict scientific advances elsewhere .
But Dr Venter says he is doing nothing that other institutes do not already do .
" Over the last several years we have had to develop novel techniques and approaches that have not existed before because this field has not existed before , " he said .
" The Venter Institute and the Synthetic Genomics Company are doing what most major institutions do - that is we file patents on these unique techniques . "

Golden monkeys live in forest areas of China
Simona Mainini , who is also a qualified architect , believes the move may be a first in animal enclosure design .
" It 's very experimental .
We do n't have any books on feng shui for monkeys , " Ms Mainini told AP news agency .
Feng Shui , an ancient Chinese practice , focuses on arranging objects and spaces to promote health and happiness .
' Extra step '
" We just have to assume that Darwin is correct and that there is a connection and what is good for humans is good for monkeys , " Ms Mainini - who is reportedly being paid $ 4,500 ( £ 2,300 ) - said .
She said she had already made some changes to a planned enclosure to maximise " good energy " .
One of the added features would be a water feature to " soften , with moisture , the harsh energy " , she said .
The zoo plans to spend just over $ 7 m ( £ 3.6 m ) to build the enclosure that is expected to open later this year .
It says the enclosure will have the feel of a Chinese village .
" We thought it would be more authentic if we went that extra step and made sure it was done with good Feng Shui , " said principal architect Charles Mays .
The three golden monkeys - a male and two females - are expected to stay at the zoo for 10 years .
Golden monkeys , which weigh up to 17kg ( 37lb ) , have light - blue faces , long hair and make a cat - like meow .
The natural habitat of the endangered species is forest areas of China 's Sichuan , Gansu , Shaanxi and Hubei provinces .
So , Does Anyone Even Use All These Darn CPU Instructions ?
April 27 , 2007
That ’s the question I found myself asking earlier this month when I was writing a simple compiler for an OCaml dialect called MinCaml .
I do n’t know if you ’ve ever taken a look at the Intel IA32 instruction references , but there are two volumes of detailed descriptions of all the functions one of these CPU provides : about 600 in total !
As this compiler backend was my first real go at writing out assembly ( though I ’d read quite a lot of it before ) I found the task of potentially learning all these instructions extremely intimidating , and wished I had an assembly language “ cheat sheet ” where I could go to find out the most common ( and hence probably the most useful ) instructions .
So , today I got around to writing a little program to use UDis86 to scan all the binaries in C : \Windows \System32 and my Cygwin / bin directory and spit out some instruction counts .
Now , before we see the results let me first say that my sample has a bias in that it ’s all precompiled stuff that will be designed to take advantage of only the lowest common denominator of the target CPU instruction sets .
This means that the distribution below will probably be quite different than if you scan , say , your machine - specific Gentoo installation .
Right , onto the big monstrous Excel pie chart :
I ’ve also uploaded my raw data to my personal site , along with the program I used to get the results for anyone who is interested .
In the finest traditions of top 10 lists everywhere , let ’s give a quick rundown of the most popular instructions :
add : is anyone really suprised by this ?
mov : again , it ’s fairly hard to get work done without moving data around push / pop : these instructions are commonly used for setting up / destroying function stack frames , hence their popularity despite IA32s register orientation invalid : do’h !
These are from areas of code where udis86 just barfs :-) .
Their high ranking could mean a lot of instructions are in use that it ca n’t deal with , or ( more likely ) it is trying to disassemble executable regions of the binary that just do n’t have anything useful in them cmp : the absolute bedrock of branching on the IA32 , but what is suprising is that it ’s so much higher than jz .
Are there really that many pure numeric comparisions in programs ?
dec/inc : I ’m fairly suprised that dec beats inc here , especially since sub is so much lower than add in my data : does anyone have a theory ?
xor / or : xor no doubt clocks in so high because of the “ xor reg , reg ” idiom used to zero out registers , but or is quite popular too for something which is really only good for bit flags and the odd if expression …
Well that was fun , in a geeky sort of way !
I ’d be quite interested in knowing the reasons behind some of the oddities above : maybe another blog entry is in order … ?
Edit : an experienced reverse engineer , t_w , commented on Reddit that my count for add was quite high , and that it might be caused by counting junk code .
It turns out that the byte sequence 0x0000 disassembles to an add instruction , which skews my results since the null byte is common padding for executable . text sections .

According to a UN report , Rubinstein said that " Israel today was an apartheid State with four different Palestinian groups : those in Gaza , East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Israeli Palestinians , each of which had a different status . "
Isolation Strategy UN summit : Boycott Israel Yaakov Lappin United Nations conference at EU parliament compares Israel to apartheid South Africa UN summit : Boycott Israel
The report quoted Rubinstein as condemning the security fence , saying that " even if the wall followed strictly the line of the pre-1967 border , it would still not be justified .
The two peoples needed cooperation rather than walls because they must be neighbors . "
On Friday , the Zionist Federation released a press release , saying " Rubinstein 's participation in this weekend 's Zionist Federation conference in London has been cancelled by mutual agreement . "
" The ZF regularly holds meetings where a wide variety of views are expressed , and while there is no question that Rubinstein has every right to express his views about Israel , it was mutually agreed that his participation in the Zionist Federation conference became untenable , " the statement said .
Andrew Balcombe , Chairman of the ZF , said : " Criticism of Israeli policy is acceptable .
However , by using the word ' apartheid ' in a UN conference held at the European Parliament , Danny Rubinstein encourages the demonisation of Israel and the Jewish people .
I believe he was naïve to attend the UN conference . "
Ynetnews was unable to reach Rubinstein for comment .
Adam Mouchtar , Director of Bnei Brith 's European Union Affairs Office , attended the conference , and said he was " surprised and disappointed " by Rubinstein 's comments .
Earlier , he told Ynetnews : " This is a conference of Israel - haters , " adding that delegates were clearly guided by a single agenda : " To prove that Israel is a racist apartheid state , and therefore Israel should be boycotted internationally , as South Africa was . "
Rubinstein was also slammed for his comments by the Geneva - based UN Watch organization , headed by Hillel Neuer , which said in a statement , " That a leading Israeli journalist - presented by the UN as a member of the Haaretz editorial board - would participate and grant legitimacy to a Soviet - era enterprise born out of the ' Zionism is Racism ' canard , whose sole aim is to assault Israel morally , legally and financially , was disturbing enough .
But that he would full - throatedly join the jackals , calling Israel an ' apartheid state , ' is a scandal . "

A museum like no other
Here at Ars Technica we 've written about the US creationist movement and its attack on science quite regularly .
From attempts to alter the way science is taught in different states across the US to statements from potential presidents , there 's no denying that creationists garner a lot of column inches .
So when I found out that they were building their answer to a science museum about an hour 's drive away , I knew that I 'd have to go and take a look .
Editor 's note : Inevitably , a story on a sensitive topic such as this invites speculation as to our motives .
Let it be known that Ars Technica 's staff represents a wide range of religious backgrounds , political views , and opinions , ( though we must admit that none of us are young - earth creationists ) .
The entrance to the Creation Museum in Petersburg , KY
Last weekend was the first weekend the Creation Museum in Petersburg , KY , ( near Cincinnati ) has been open to the public , and I , your intrepid reporter , braved the crowds to see what the fuss was about .
Built at a cost of $ 27 million , it 's an imposing building — not a particularly attractive one , though — with 60,000 square feet of space inside .
With a budget as large as theirs , I 'd have sent some of that money to Frank Gehry or Richard Meier , but then I 'd not be building a creationist museum in the first place .
That 60,000 square feet also managed to swallow the attendees quite easily ; the parking lot may have been full , but there was never a scrum .
First off , I must confess that I found the place very slick .
They evidently got a good graphic design team to put together the displays , and the animatronics and vignettes were well done .
The museum boasts that it had an ex-Universal Studios executive work on the presentation , and it's on a par with the better modern museums I 've been to .
The message , on the other hand , I can't agree with .
Designed for a fundamentalist Christian crowd , the Creation Museum is no friend to those who do not hold to its creationist tenets .
Presumably to avoid labels of anti-Semitism , the museum takes it easy on Judaism .
So far , no surprises .
But then we get to its handling of the science and truly step through the looking glass .
To begin with , the museum presents real science alongside its version ; an aviary containing finches is the first thing to greet you as you began your tour .
The finches were a profound influence on Darwin and his theory of natural selection and are still studied by evolutionary biologists today .
Another display contained poison frogs .
This was of particular interest to me , since they claim the reason poison frogs are n't poisonous in captivity is due to the Almighty .
I 'm fairly sure it 's due to the lack of poisonous mites in their diet , but there you go .
There were posters explaining just how coal could be formed in a few weeks as opposed to over millions of years and how rapidly the Biblical flood would cover the earth , drowning all but a handful of living creatures .
The flood plays a big part in the museum 's attempt to explain away what we see as millions of years of natural processes .
There was also an explanation as to why , with only one progenitor family , it was n't considered incest for Adam and Eve 's children to marry each other .
Apparently there was less sin back then , and therefore fewer mutations in their DNA .
Evidently sin , not two copies of the same recessive trait , gives rise to congenital birth defects .
As you walk through the museum , the contorted reasoning to explain the formation of the Grand Canyon in hours or the rapid creation of thousands of breeds of dogs in a matter of weeks is augmented by what can only be described as a house of horrors about the dangers of abortion and drugs and the devil 's music .
A wall is covered in articles from newspapers and magazines showing what happens when society lives without the museum 's brand of fundamentalist Christianity as its guiding light .
Stem cell research , abortion , and homosexuality are center stage .
Their representation of the modern world consists of a a seedy - looking alley , replete with rats , trash , and a church being demolished .
It might have worked better if they 'd set it to Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones , but I 'm not sure Mick and boys would have gone for that .
" No Heaven .
No Hell .
Just Science .
Inside the crusade against religion . "
Surprisingly , I did n't get much of a Flintstones vibe .
I was expecting many more displays with Adam and Eve and T. Rex , whom we learn was a vegetarian in the days of yore , but with a couple of exceptions , dinosaurs and humans were separated by at least a few feet .
There also did n't seem to be that many dinosaurs in general .
They may have been outdoors in the park , but it was raining by this point and there was only so much more I could take .
There was , however , a saddled dinosaur at the exit for small children to ride .
Other exhibits included a take on Noah's Ark , including how all the animals got peacefully onto the boat two by two .
Noah gathered them together , it seems , but the Lord made them walk the gangplank .
Notice how the vegetarian velociraptors ignore Eve
It was certainly an eye - opening way to spend an afternoon , but not one I could recommend to anyone in good conscience , if for no other reason than I can think of many better ways to spend $ 20 .
If anyone wants to see more , I 've put a virtual tour up on Flickr .
What every little kid wants — a triceratops with a saddle .
Meanwhile , the founder of the museum , Australian Ken Ham , is being investigated by a former Chief Magistrate in his home country for deceptive conduct and other wrongdoings in relation to the Australian church organization he was once affiliated with .
This is hot on the heels of the incarceration of that other leading light of the creationist movement , Kent Hovind , who was recently sentenced to a decade in prison for tax evasion .
Prospective jurors screened on missing body issue in Oakland case OAKLAND
Hans Reiser Hans Reiser Image 1 of / 5 Caption Close Prospective jurors screened on missing body issue in Oakland case 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
Attorneys asked prospective Alameda County jurors in the murder trial of computer programmer Hans Reiser on Wednesday whether they were comfortable hearing a circumstantial - evidence case in which the body of Reiser 's alleged victim - his wife - has never been found .
Deputy District Attorney Paul Hora and defense attorney William Du Bois took turns questioning prospective jurors on whether they could be objective about the case , given that Nina Reiser has not been seen since disappearing last September .
Hans Reiser , 43 , who is well known in computer - programming circles as the creator of the ReiserFS file system , has pleaded not guilty to killing his estranged wife , who was 31 when she vanished .
" This case is a little bit different than other cases , " Hora told prospective jurors in the Oakland courtroom of Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman .
Usually , there 's a body , an autopsy and a cause of death , but not so in this case , Hora noted .
Du Bois told prospective jurors that he would argue for acquittal because " there is no direct evidence of a homicide , let alone that there even was a homicide . "
One man made it clear Wednesday that he did n't want to be on the panel .
" I 'm uncomfortable about this , " the man told Hora .
Pressed by the prosecutor for an explanation , the man said , " Just this whole show , that 's all .
You 're not going to like what I have to say . "
The judge excused the man after he concluded by saying , " I just do n't think I 'd be fair . "
Nina Reiser was last seen Sept. 3 , 2006 , at the home her estranged husband shared with his mother on Exeter Drive in the Oakland hills .
Prosecutors theorize that he killed her there that day and hid the body .
The couple 's two children were in the house when Nina Reiser was there , but Reiser 's mother was not , authorities said .
Nina Reiser 's 2001 Honda Odyssey was found six days after she disappeared about 3 miles from the home , groceries askew in the back seat , police said .
Investigators have said they found small amounts of Nina Reiser 's blood in the Exeter Drive home as well as in Hans Reiser 's Honda Civic CRX .
Friends of Nina Reiser held a vigil for her Tuesday at Montclair Park in Oakland .
Prosecutors say the couple 's children are now with their grandmother in Russia , where Nina Reiser was born .
Du Bois has suggested that she could be alive and with her children .
The jury - selection process continues this month and next , and opening statements in the trial are scheduled for Oct. 29 .

【発音】bα ' :( r ) f
Being an Ubuntu / Debian user ( yes , I use and advocate both ) , I have fallen in love with the Advanced Packaging Tool , also known as apt .
Before Ubuntu , I played in the world of RPM hell , with distros such as Red Hat itself , Mandrake ( as it was called back then ) , and even SuSE .
I would find some piece of software , try to install it , only to find that it would choke , saying that it relied on some certain dependencies .
I would install the dependencies , only to find conflicting versions with newer software .
Hell indeed .
So when I discovered the Debian way of installing software , I wondered why no one had mentioned it to me before .
It was heaven .
This is the way to software , I thought .
So , as any new user to the world of apt learns , apt - get is the way to install software in your system .
After working on a Debian - based system that uses apt , such as Ubuntu , you also learn the various tools :
apt - get : Installing and removing packages from your system , as well as updating package lists and upgrading the software itself .
apt - cache : Search for packages in the package list maintained by apt on the local system
dpkg -
Used for various administrative tasks to your system , such as reconfiguring Xorg .
Those are probably the first few tools that you learn while on a Debian - based distro , if you plan on getting down and dirty at any length .
But the buck does n't stop there .
You need to memorize , and learn other tools , if you are to further administrate your system .
These include :
apt - listbugs :
See what bugs are listed on a software package before you install it .
apt - listchanges :
Same thing as apt - listbugs , but for non-bug changes .
apt -rdepends :
Tool for viewing dependency trees on packages .
deborphan - Look for orphaned dependencies on the system left from removing parent packages .
debfoster - Helps deborphan identify what package dependencies you no longer need on your system .
dselect - Curses interface for viewing , selecting and searching for packages on your system .
There 's even more : apt-cdrom , apt - config , apt - extracttemplates , apt - ftparchive , apt - key , apt- mark and apt - sortpkgs .
If any of you have noticed , that is 16 different tools that you need to become familiar with , if you are to start learning about your Debian - based distro .
I do n't know about you , but does n't that seem a bit bass - ackwards ?
I mean , when I 'm using OpenSSH , for example , other than scp , all of the functionality of OpenSSH is filed under one tool : ssh .
So , would n't you think that all the functionality of apt would be under one tool , namely just ' apt ' ?
Further more , apt - get has a big problem that has n't really been addressed until only just recently .
The problem is in removing packages .
You see , apt - get does a great job of indentifying what dependencies need to be installed when you want a certain package , but it fails miserably when you want to remove that package .
If dependencies were required , ' apt - get remove ' will remove your packages , but leave orphaned dependencies on your system .
Psychocats .net has a great writeup on this very phenomenon , by simply installing and removing the package kword .
The solution ?
Aptitude .
Now , before I continue , I want to say that yes , I am aware of ' apt - get autoremove ' finally being able to handle orphaned dependencies .
This is a step in the right direction , for sure .
However , apt - get , with its many other tools , is an okay way of doing things , if you like to learn 16 different tools .
Aptitude , as I will show you , is one tool for them all .
Aptitude is the superior way to install , remove , upgrade , and otherwise administer packages on you system with apt .
For one , since it 's inception , aptitude has been solving orphaned dependencies .
Second , it has a curses interface that blows the doors off of dselect .
Finally , and most importantly , it takes advantage of one tool , doing many many functions .
Let 's take a look :
aptitude : Running it with no arguments brings up a beautiful interface to search , navigate , install , update and otherwise administer packages .
aptitude install : Installing software for your system , installing needed dependencies as well .
aptitude remove : Removing packages as well as orphaned dependencies .
aptitude purge : Removing packages and orphaned dependencies as well as any configuration files left behind .
aptitude search : Search for packages in the local apt package lists .
aptitude update : Update the local packages lists .
aptitude upgrade : Upgrade any installed packages that have been updated .
aptitude clean : Delete any downloaded files necessary for installing the software on your system .
aptitude dist - upgrade : Upgrade packages , even if it means uninstalling certain packages .
aptitude show :
Show details about a package name .
aptitude autoclean : Delete only out - of - date packages , but keep current ones .
aptitude hold :
Fix a package at it 's current version , and do n't update it .
Are we starting to see a pattern here ?
One command with different readable options ( no unnecessary flags ) .
And that 's just the tip of the ice berg .
It gets better .
For example , when searching for a package using aptitude , the results are sorted alphabetically ( gee , imagine that ) and justified in column width format .
Heck , it will even tell you which one you have installed on your system already , instead of haphazardly listing the packages in some random , unreadable format , like apt - cache .
I 've already mentioned it , but running aptitude with no options will pull up a curses application for you to navigate your apt system .
If any of you have used it , you know that it is far superior to dselect ( talk about a shoddy application ) .
Aptitude makes searching for packages , updating them , removing them , getting details and other necessary tools , easy .
Spend 20 minutes inside the console , and you begin to feel like this is an application done right .
Spend 20 minutes in dselect , and you 'll begin to get massive headaches , and feel lost inside Pan 's Labyrinth .
Aptitude is just superior to apt - get in every way , shape , and form .
Better dependency handling .
Better curses application .
Better options .
ONE tool .
Better stdout formatting .
The list goes on and on .
I see constantly , on forums , IRC and email , the use of apt - get .
We need to better educate our brethren and sisters about the proper use of tools , and show them the enlightened way of aptitude .
I 've been using aptitude since I first learned about it , and will continue to do so the remainder of my Debian / Ubuntu days .
Thanks to GarfieldTech for the inspiration of this post .
Learn aptitude .
Use aptitude .
" You know who 's to blame for violating the rights of the 3,000 victims of 9 - 11 ?
The U.S. "
-- Bill O'Reilly , Radio Factor 9-11-07
And on 9 - 11 yet .
Bill 's rationale :
We knew that Al - Quaeda was out there .
We knew they had attacked us before .
And we did nothing .
There are many who do believe that , but to have the guts to say it on 9 - 11 ?
Well that just about nails it .
Bill is now officially a member of the Blame - America - First crowd .
But you have to wonder he would choose one of our country 's most sacred days to make his claim .
Even Rosie O'Donnell would have selected a better time to express that notion .
Gotta hand it to you Bill , even with the blowback you 'll receive from those who think the terrorists are to blame for the 9 - 11 attacks , you still said what you believe : that America has the blood of its own countrymen on its hands ..
You got big ones , my friend .

Ask yourself a very simple question .
Why is the FAKE NEWS media continually expending resources to defame , debunk , and cast as a conspiracy , for , as they say , a nobody who started on 4 chan ?
Why did the FAKE NEWS media attempt to cast blame of recent events on the ' Q ' movement ?
Was it an attempt to silence ?
ALL FOR A LARP ?
Are we subject to the Hatch Act ?
Think Executive Branch // etc.Acceptable ' turn on ' comms ?
Cannot point to any particular candidate or party prior to Nov 7 ?

I hit college and I struggled at first because I had never studied in high school and because I had attended a very mediocre suburban public high school .
My cohorts had gone to mostly private college prep schools ; my high school 's guidance counselor did n't know the difference between Cornell and Bucknell .
I persevered in my overachieving ways and ended up being Phi Beta Kappa , graduating with a 4.0 by retaking two classes that I had gotten B's in my freshman year .
I went to a top ten law school and made the law review .
I interned for two years at the Chicago office of a major Milwaukee firm and made more in 12 weeks during the summer than my parents made all year .
I REALLY thought that I was hot shit .
I graduated and without even considering other offers , joined the same firm and immediately got put on the fast track for partner .
I worked 80 + hours a week for nearly four years , never taking a vacation , seldom seeing friends , and literally never doing anything even remotely enjoyable .
Making partner was the light at the end of the tunnel .
This was the early 80's , the " me " generation , and $ 200 k a year awaited me if I just carried on a little while longer .
I made partner just after I turned 30 , much to the chagrin of some other associates .
I had sealed the deal by getting one very large client to switch to our firm through some of those vaunted ivy league connections .
I firmly believed that I was better than most of the rest of my peers because of my background , superior intellect , and tireless work ethic .
I continued to work very hard , and it made me hard .
I did n't like people , my friends annoyed me and I grew even more distant .
My father told me that I had become a bit of an asshole .
I thought that making partner would be a reprieve , but it was just the opposite .
I had earned my keep and let everyone know it .
I paid cash for a Mercedes and bought a big home just to show everyone how much I had made it .
Two years after making partner , I suffered a massive heart attack and nearly died .
I spent nearly a month in the ICU .
I had triple bypass surgery and a lengthy recovery .
I got some cards , but the only people who came to see me in the hospital were my parents .
I had been such an ass to my own brother that he would n't even send a card .
It is sad to say that it took something like this to get me to quit smoking , quite drinking to excess , to start exercising ( I had gained nearly 40 pounds ) , and to realize that I was completely alone in life .
I had no friends , no significant other , and no prospects .
I was a partner in a relatively prestigious law firm .
I had nothing .
I asked to take a brief sabbatical upon my return , but it was denied .
I worked 40 - 50 hours a week for a while and was criticized by senior partners for my lack of work ethic and inability to bring in new business .
I ended up leaving the firm the following spring and going to work for a client .
The pay was less than one third of my previous compensation , but the job was a new kind of challenge and far fewer hours .
I was a little bored at first and felt slightly guilty for not working more hours .
I spent more time with family , reconnected with friends , and met the love of my life .
We were married within the year .
I sold the Mercedes when I bought her ring as a symbol of me giving up that old way of life .
Twenty - some years later , I can say without hesitation that the heart attack was the best thing that ever happened to me .
It literally almost scared me to death .
It is just pathetic that it took something so significant to make me realize how and where my life had gone awry .
Brevity was never my strong suit , for that I apologize , but the point of my post is this : true happiness is far more important than income , IQ , any type of social status , or anything else in this life .
Some of the people who still work at the firm make north of $ 500 k a year now , but never once have I regretted leaving .
Our household income and some sensible frugality allow us to lead a very comfortable life .
My wife went back to work once our two children were in school , and we could probably stop working one of these years but neither of us have any interest in doing so because we both love our respective professions .
My job allows me a great deal of flexibility , too , with eight weeks of vacation and flex time .
I also get to leave two days a week in the fall to team teach a class at a local university .
I never miss my son's football games or my daughter 's recitals .
You can't put a price on that .
If you 're happy being a stoner and living in a studio on the east side , more power to you .
If you love teaching , that 's a wonderful thing and you should stick to it regardless of the income .
The same , too , goes for someone happy with the " chase " of clawing his or her way up the corporate ladder to afford a McMansion in Mequon and membership at an exclusive country club .
Those who do whatever it takes to be truly satisfied in life should n't be criticized , they should be envied .
Better yet , their behavior should be emulated .
I 'm just glad that I woke up before it was too late .
You Fail At The Internet
As we all know , the internet is a series of tubes .
It 's a series of tubes through which information travels , often either sent or received by people with the intelligence of a retarded coconut .
At least , that 's the level of intelligence they project anonymously to the world .
And that , dear readers , is the problem .
The problem stems partly from that very anonymity .
People know that the internet gives them a voice that is n't attached to a face , and which can not be tracked down without serious effort .
That allows them to be total assholes and get away with it .
The rest of the problem is that humans are natural born shit disturbers .
Think about it : how many people do you know who do random shit that does n't make any sense just to see what will happen ?
That is called disturbing shit .
Putting mustard in someone 's coffee instead of honey is disturbing shit .
Giving someone vodka when they ask for water is disturbing shit .
Being an asshole on the internet just to get a rise out of whoever is gullible enough to snap at it is disturbing shit .
Being a shit disturber generally is n't any good for anybody .
People get pissed , and the person disturbing the shit runs the risk of severe pain .
Because of the nature of the internet , disturbing shit there is done anonymously , which is all the more draw toward it because there is n't a real drawback for the person doing it .
What people do n't realize is that given the proper tools , and a little time , you can actually track someone back through the internet to find out who they are and where they live .
The anonymity of the internet is n't as total as you believe it to be , thus you are n't as safe as you think you are .
You can , however , avoid being an internet shit disturber entirely and not risk severe pain and personal damage at the hands of someone with the patience to track you down .
Here are some guidelines for internet use you can follow to ensure you do n't piss someone off to the point of tracking you down and beating the shit out of you , like Jay and Silent Bob did this one time :
Do n't post " First " ·
All you 're doing is wasting a post spot that would be better filled by a picture of you minus your head .
You post " First , " then five people inevitably post to bitch about how you wasted the first post , and then everybody loses .
Fuck you .
Do n't spam ·
Yes , you 're excited about George Lucas marrying a midget Wookie .
No , nobody cares .
Get over it .
Posting it many times is n't going to make us care about it any more .
In fact , it 's going to make us hate it because we hate you .
You spamming immediately lowers the intelligence level of the entire site , because people need to take time out of their busy schedules to see what you posted , decide whether to murder you , and then act upon that result .
Plus you need to realize that George Lucas lost all credibility with Star Wars 2 .
Do n't arbitrarily repost things · Hooray , you found the bunny with a pancake on its head !
Now you need to post it everywhere you possibly can where the thought applies , right ?
WRONG .
Arbitrarily reposting things without knowing where they come from or what they really mean is as stupid as repeating political rhetoric when you 're three .
You may post about Chuck Norris without knowing who he is , but I assure you , he knows where you live and he 's coming for you .
I 've seen to it .
Do n't pass on chain letters · A chain letter is anything that includes something like " If you do n't pass this on to fifteen people in fifteen minutes , your penis will fall off . "
First of all , if you 're stupid enough to believe that then you deserve to have it happen .
More importantly , chain letters are just another form of spam , only worse because it 's not even something you care about !
You 're only passing it on because you have nothing better to do , not because it 's something you concern yourself with .
Have you ever seen a movie with a retarded kid in a schoolroom who keeps yelling things randomly and looks ridiculous ?
That 's you .
If colour is available , do n't abuse it · Very good , you have the ability to write in any colour you want .
Now you can provide appropriate emphasis when there 's something you want to draw particular attention to .
So why are you instead using this ability to write yellow text on a white background ?
That 's just obnoxious .
Basically , using the internet comes down to one simple saying : Just because you can be an asshole , does n't mean you should be an asshole .
And to everyone else , if you find someone doing the shit outlined above , just ignore them .
They 're usually only doing it to try to get a rise out of someone , so by giving them attention you 're merely playing in to their hands .
You 're coming down to their level of stupidity , and they have more experience than you .

Got something to say to me ?
AllOfMp3 , the popular online music store , has been shut down by the Russian government .
Pressure from the United States , and a refusal to enter the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) convinced the Kremlin to take the website down for good .
Before the shutdown AllOfMP3 had nearly 6 million users who were able to download songs and albums for a fraction of the price from authorized alternatives such as the iTunes Store .
MP3s were sold for $ 0.20 per song , or less .
AllOfMP3 has been a thorn in the side of the RIAA and the US government for years .
Last year , U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said that if Russia wants to join the WTO , they should shut down the pirate music website [ AllOfMP3 ] that is robbing U.S. recording companies of sales .
In an interview with P2Pnet , the owners of AllOffMP3 later said that Schwab completely and deliberately mischaracterized AllofMP3 , “ it is irresponsible to use AllofMP3.com as a negotiating instrument in an attempt to extract concessions from Russia ” , thay added .
But now it seems like president Putin has some good news to tell Bush today , a mere coincidence of course .
It is not clear how effective the shutdown of AllOfMP3 will be .
Most users will probably move to MP3 sparks , a similar service with a similar setup , launched by the same company .
This site is not illegal under Russian law because they use a different licensing model .
Last December the Danish ISP “ Perspectiv ” decided to block access to AllOfMP3 for all their users .
In a response , The Pirate Bay , working together with the pro-piracy lobby PiratbyrÃ¥n , decided to block all Perspektiv ’s customers from accessing its site .
Not long after that “ Perspectiv ” reconsidered their position , and their customers were allowed to access the online music store again .
My gut feeling says that these “ grey market ” MP3 sites are just another Hydra .

From Malik Shabazz ( who has taken Malcolm X’s real name ) , General Counsel of the New Black Panther Party :
Will you apologize for being a political prostitute for Bill O’Reilly , a white male chauvinist racist ?
I like the cut of their jib already :
Our 6th Annual No Pants Subway Ride took place on Saturday , January 13 .
Around 300 people participated this year , making it the largest No Pants mission ever .
If you ’re unfamiliar with our No Pants series , check the missions page for write - ups of the previous five installments .
This year ’s ride was loads of fun , and unlike last year , it went off without a hitch .
We had a great group filled with all different shapes , sizes , races , and ages .
Organizing 300 participants
When I arrived at the meeting point I noticed there were three police officers lurking a couple hundred feet away from us .
I figured that might happen , considering the chaos of last year , and the fact that several local papers publicized the info for this year ’s event .
I introduced myself to them , and they were super nice .
They recognized that the cop who stopped us last year made a mistake and were only there to escort us this year and make sure everyone stayed safe .
It was as if we were a parade .
To accommodate the larger crowd this year , I made a few changes to the structure of the mission .
The biggest change was doing away with the pants sellers .
Always a funny punch line to the mission , it was sad to see the pants selling go , but considering how many people lost their pants last year , it just did n’t seem worth it .
This year everyone brought along a backpack ( or purse , briefcase , etc ) and kept their own pants with them .
The other major change is we actually used two separate trains .
Everyone started on one train , and then stop by stop groups of participants would depants and then exit the train and wait on the platform .
In previous years we ’d just run down the platform to the next car , but this year we actually waited five minutes on the platform for the next train to come .
Lucky for us , it was an unusually warm January day .

It was really cool looking out the window as the train pulled into the stations .
Some stops had upwards of fifty pantless riders waiting to board .
If you were seated on the train looking out the window you could only see the people on the platform from the waist up , which made for a funny reveal when the doors opened on their bare legs .
There were several riders who stood out this year .
We had a few businessmen :
We had a Boy Scout
A dude with a bike
Agent Eng came dressed as a priest
Agent Scordelis read Moby Dick
As always we got a variety of reactions from the New Yorkers we encountered .
Most laughed and smiled .
Some scowled .
Some ignored .
By the end , every car on the train was filled with around 30 pantless riders .
At 125th Street , everyone exited the train and moved to the downtown tracks to take the train back to our starting point .
There was a drummer on the platform and as folks waited an impromptu dance party broke out .
Pantless people danced to the drummer ’s beat while trying ( unsuccessfully ) to coax him to remove his own pants .
The ride back down was just as much fun .
I switched cars at each stop , and it was tons of fun to see the different reactions in each of the ten cars .
When we returned to our meeting point and exited the subway , most folks chose to keep their pants off .
By far the warmest January in the history of No Pants , it really was quite comfortable walking around pantless outside .

VIDEO :
We do n’t have too much video this year , mostly because I figured we already have enough No Pants footage from all the year ’s past .

Scientists have engineered viruses to attack and destroy mega-colonies of potentially harmful bacteria called biofilms .
The work is one of the latest potential applications to emerge from synthetic biology , a burgeoning field that aims to change the genomes of organisms on large scales to make them more useful to humans or to even craft new life forms from scratch .
“ Our results show we can do simple things with synthetic biology that have potentially useful results , ” said study team member Timothy Lu , a doctoral student in the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology .
The engineered bacteria - attacking virus , or “ phage , ” was built using a “ plug and play ” library of genes .
The same approach could be used to build viruses custom tailored to target specific bacteria species , the researchers say .
“ The library could contain different phages that target different species or strains of bacteria , each constructed using related design principles to express different enzymes , ” said study leader James Collins , a biomedical engineer at Boston University .
Bacterial cities
The finding , detailed in the July 3 issue of the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could lead to industrial “ cleaners , ” such as phages to clear slime in food processing plants or new types of phage - based antibiotics for humans or livestock .
Biofilms form when large aggregates of bacteria , often of several species , bind together using adhesive molecules to form a slimy layer .
Biofilms can form almost anywhere , even on your teeth if you do n’t brush for a day or two .
They are often resistant to many types of antibiotics , and when they accumulate in hard - to - reach places , such as the insides of food processing machines or medical catheters , they can become persistent sources of infection .
Lu and Collins inserted a gene that produces an enzyme called dispersin B ( DspB ) into the genome of T7 , a virus that attacks the bacteria Escherichia coli .
DspB , recently discovered in sewer phages , is capable of degrading a biofilm ’s molecular scaffolding , or “ extracellular matrix . ”
The researchers tested their engineered T7 phage on E. coli biofilms and found that it eliminated 99.997 percent of the microbes , which is far better than the phage ’s non-engineered cousin .
From the ground up
While the new research involves tweaking the genomes of known organisms , other synthetic biologists aim to create a synthetic microbe with the minimum gene set necessary for life .
Researchers led by biologist J. Craig Venter announced recently they had overcome a significant hurdle toward this goal .
The team showed that a cell could be brought to life , or “ booted up , ” using only naked DNA from another species .
Their next step is to craft a synthetic genome and insert it into a surrogate cell , which could then reproduce .
Venter has hinted that his team is mere months away from announcing the first synthetic life form .
A dinosaur bone bed in southwest Edmonton that served as a feeding area for the direct ancestor of Tyrannosaurus rex has revealed that two dinosaurs , thought to have lived in different eras , actually lived at the same time .
Scientists digging for bones at the site this year discovered fossils of Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus this year .
" We were n't expecting it , " said Dr Phil Currie , a world - renowned paleontologist with the University of Alberta Faculty of Science .
Until this find in Edmonton , the Saurolophus and Edmontosaurus had only been found at different levels in the rocks near Drumheller .
In Drumheller , Saurolophus fossils are never found in the same localities as Edmontosaurus .
According to Currie , finding fossils of both plant - eating species together " means they were here at the same time .
It 's a new discovery . "
Currie and his team of students and volunteers from BP Canada Energy Company also found a lot of teeth from Daspletosaurus , a meat - eating dinosaur from the tyrannosaurus family and a direct ancestor of Tyrannosaurus rex .
The finding means Daspletosaurus used the spot as a feeding area .
Like most other meat - eating dinosaurs , Daspletosaurus replaced their teeth every year and a half to two years .
The cycle would begin as their teeth loosened .
Just like humans , a new tooth would grow and their body would dissolve away the root of the old tooth leaving them with a loose crown .
" Daspletosaurus could n't really take their little hands and wiggle their teeth , " explained Currie .
" When they were feeding on big dinosaurs , the loose teeth would fall out and get mixed in with the bones of the animals they were eating . "
Currie and his team also found tooth marks on some of the bones .
" All Tyrannosaurus had really powerful jaws .
They could bite through bone , " said Currie , who also expects to eventually find Albertosaurus fossils in the bone bed .
Albertosaurus is another meat - eating dinosaur that lived in the same area and time - the late Cretaceous period between 80 and 73 million years ago - as the others .
Currie calls the bone bed site one of the best sites in the world .
" This is the kind of thing you see in some of the best dinosaur sites in the world .
There are a few sites in China where we have thick bone beds like this . "
Research on the site will continue for many years .
While there are many Edmontosaurus bone beds from Alaska to South Dakota , Currie says the animal really has n't been studied much .
" We do n't even know how many species we 're dealing with .
We 're not sure how long it lived , we 're not sure what kind of environments it lived in .
There 's a whole bunch of questions relating to the Edmontosaurus that we can solve if we put the time into it , " he said .
He added that Phil Bell , an MSc student who is doing his thesis on this material , will study the bone bed to see what else it reveals .
BP Canada is partnering with the U of A to fund the university 's Palaeontological Field School program , contributing $ 90,000 over three years .
BP employees from around the world participate as volunteers in the field school 's summer dig program at the Edmonton site as well as sites near Grande Prairie and Dry Island Provincial Park .
Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards today said he would ask Americans to give up their SUVs , as he set out his plans to curb carbon emissions .
At a forum held by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Florida , Mr Edwards said he believe Americans were " actually willing to sacrifice " .
He said " one of the things they should be asked to do is drive more fuel efficient vehicles . "
When asked if this meant telling voters to give up their SUVs the former senator said " yes " .
The majority of polls place Mr Edwards third among the Demcoratic candidates , behind Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Mr Edwards was clearly popular with the group , several times drawing standing ovations , including once when he said weapons and equipment used by the US military needed to be made in the United States .
He said tanks and ammunition for M16 rifles are being made in other countries .
" If your tax dollars are being used to produce the products that keep America safe , that provide defence for the American people , those jobs should remain in the United States of America , " he said .
He also said as president he would ask residents to conserve energy and said the US needs to focus on being a leader in creating alternative energy .
He said he wants a national cap on carbon dioxide emissions that is lowered each year .
" We are the worst polluter on the planet .
We are 4 % of the world 's population , we 're putting out 25 % of the world 's greenhouse gas , " Mr Edwards said .
" America 's going to have to change . "
Epicatechin is found in grapes
The Salk Institute study could lead to further tests to see if epicatechin also works on humans .
The study , published in the Journal of Neuroscience , suggests it improves blood flow in the brain - especially in combination with extra exercise .
However , nutritionists warn chocolate is high in fat and sugar , which may undo any potential benefits .
We 'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables , with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter , without any noticeable improvement in memory
Spokesman , British Nutrition Foundation
This is not the first study to find a link between ' flavanol ' chemicals in certain foods and health benefits - other studies claim that cardiovascular health can be improved by including them in the diet .
The researchers , led by Dr Henriette van Praag , working with chocolate firm Mars , compared mice fed a typical diet with those fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin .
Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day and then , a month later , were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water .
Those that both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice .
The epicatechin - fed mice who did not exercise also showed enhanced memory , but to a lesser degree .
Human studies
The mice on the special diet appeared to have greater blood vessel growth in certain parts of their brain , alongside more mature brain nerve cells .
Chocolate is another source
Dr van Praag said : " A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals - and then humans , combined with mild exercise . "
Dr Mark Mattson , from the US National Institute on Ageing , said : " This is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory - enhancing effects , suggesting it may be possible to optimise brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation . "
However , a spokesman for the British Nutrition Foundation said that while there was some evidence that diets rich in flavanols could be beneficial in humans , often when flavanols such as epicatechin were given on their own , no benefits could be spotted .
She added : " We 'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables , with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter , without any noticeable improvement in memory . "
Endangered , hunted , smuggled and now abandoned , 5,000 of the world 's rarest animals have been found drifting in a deserted boat near the coast of China .
The pangolins , Asian giant turtles and lizards were crushed inside crates on a rickety wooden vessel that had lost engine power off Qingzhou island in the southern province of Guangdong .
Most were alive , though the cargo also contained 21 bear paws wrapped in newspaper .
According to conservation groups , the haul was discovered on one of the world 's most lucrative and destructive smuggling routes : from the threatened jungles of south - east Asia to the restaurant tables of southern China .
The animals were found when local fishermen noticed a strange smell emanating from the vessel , which did not have any registration plates , on Tuesday , the Guangzhou Daily reported .
When coastguard officials boarded the 25 - metre craft , it was reportedly deserted and stripped of identification papers .
They found more than 200 crates full of animals , many so dehydrated in the tropical sun that they were close to death .
The animals - which weighed 13 tonnes - were taken to port , doused with water and sent to an animal welfare centre .
" We have received some animals , " said an office worker at the Guangdong Wild Animal Protection Centre .
" We are waiting to hear from the authorities what we should do with them . "
According to the local media , the cargo included 31 pangolins , 44 leatherback turtles , 2,720 monitor lizards , 1,130 Brazilian turtles as well as the bear paws .
Photographs showed other animals , including an Asian giant turtle .
All of these south - east Asian species are critically endangered , banned from international trade and yet openly sold in restaurants and markets in China 's southern province of Guangdong , which is famous for its exotic cuisine .
The accidental discovery highlights the negative impact that the growing power of Chinese consumption is having on global conservation efforts .
According to wildlife groups , China is the main market for illegally traded exotic species , which are eaten or used in traditional medicine .
Pangolins are in great demand because their meat is consider a delicacy and their scales are thought to help mothers breastfeed their babies .
As a result of demand , the pangolin populations of China , Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia have been wiped out .
With traders moving further and further south , the animal is declining even in its last habitats in Java , Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula .
It is a similar story for many species of turtle , tortoise , frog and snake .
Despite China 's international commitments to get to grips with this illicit activity , the trade is booming .
Border controls are lax , and smugglers know that fines are usually far lower than the potential rewards .
As a result , raids and seizures of banned products occur regularly .
One recent raid on a restaurant in Guanghzou turned up 118 pangolins , 60kg of snakes and 400 kg of toads .
Traffic - an organisation that monitors and tries to prevent the smuggling of endangered species - welcomed the fact that China 's authorities had reacted swiftly to rescue the animals but said much more needs to be done to prevent similar cases .
" Unfortunately , this is all too common .
This trade is a far bigger threat to these species than habitat destruction , " said Chris Shepherd , senior program officer with Traffic Southeast Asia .
" The vigilance on the border has to be improved , cooperation with source countries needs to be strengthened , there should be better monitoring of dealers , and the people violating the laws must be penalised severely . "
Despite the ban on pangolins , many restaurants offer their meat .
The Chaoxing restaurant in Shenzhen said yesterday that pangolin was available but was only suitable for large dining parties .
" The animal is very big - about 10kg , " said a waitress contacted by telephone .
" We serve it in hotpot .
That is the tastiest way . "
According to recent reports in the Chinese media , the price of 1kg of pangolin served in Guangdong or Yunnan is between 600 and 800 yuan per kilogram ( between £ 43 and £ 50 ) .
A Guangdong chef interviewed last year in the Beijing Science and Technology Daily described how to cook a pangolin .
" We keep them alive in cages until the customer makes an order .
Then we hammer them unconscious , cut their throats and drain the blood .
It is a slow death .
We then boil them to remove the scales .
We cut the meat into small pieces and use it to make a number of dishes , including braised meat and soup .
Usually the customers take the blood home with them afterwards . "

The EU 's highest court today ruled that it was unlawful to order European airlines to hand over information about transatlantic air passengers to the US government .
The European court of justice ruling said the US did not provide adequate protection for air passengers ' privacy .
Under the Passenger Name Records agreement , reached in May 2004 , EU airlines have been obliged to give Washington 34 items of information about passengers flying to the US .
The details include names , addresses , all forms of payment and contact telephone numbers .
The ruling , which gives the European commission and member states four months to find a solution , maintains the legality of the agreement until September 30 " for reasons of legal certainty " .
The court ruled that the decision by the council of ministers - the decision - making body that represents national governments - to sign the agreement had lacked an adequate legal basis .
" Consequently , the court annulled the council decision approving the conclusion of the agreement and did not consider it necessary to consider the other pleas relied on by parliament , " a court statement said .
The US and European airlines said the ruling would have no immediate impact on transatlantic air travel and left time to find an agreed solution to the data transfer issue .
US and commission officials said they were confident a fresh agreement could be reached .
Stewart Baker , the assistant secretary of state for the Department of Homeland Security , said he expected " a solution that will keep the data flowing and the planes flying " .
Franco Frattini , the commissioner with responsibility for security , said the US and EU needed " continuity " .
European airlines played down the impact of the ruling , saying there should be no short - term effect on travellers .
US officials insisted that the transfer of personal details was essential in the fight against terror following September 11 .
They had warned that failure to agree a deal on passenger data would mean prolonged delays for air passengers from Europe because more processing would be required on their arrival in the US .
The judges today said the agreement had to be annulled because existing EU data protection law only covers commercial data and not that used for security purposes .
Graham Watson , the Liberal Democrat leader in the European parliament , led the campaign against the legislation and welcomed the result .
" Today 's judgment vindicates the four - year campaign that I and my colleagues led in the European parliament to protect the privacy of airline passengers , " he said .
Stewart Room , the head of data protection at Rowe Cohen solicitors , said there was no authority within EU law for the original deal .
" The starting point is that the European directive on data protection does not extend to matters of public security , " he said .
" Consequently , it is unlawful for the commission , or anyone else in the EU , to make the passenger records available to a government under that directive .
It had to fail because the commission does not have the legal authority . "
Mr Room said bilateral agreements between European governments and the US could be one way to circumnavigate the EU rules - something the Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford said MEPs would be alert to .
However , he questioned whether the data would be useful and whether there was still the political will to push through more information collection projects .
" Law and order agencies are sucking in more data than they can process , " he said .
" There may be some quality data within the information , but you end up in a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees .
" There has to be a real question as to whether the government still has the will to carry this forward in the light of the controversy over other massive data collection projects , such as the introduction of identity cards . "
The deal on " processing and transfer of personal data " on transatlantic flights was backed by EU governments and the European commission .
It meant complying with US anti-terrorist legislation requiring that all airlines operating flights to , from or across US territory provide the authorities with electronic access to all passenger data in their reservation and departure control systems .
The verdict could pose a major problem for individual European airlines .
They may face the threat of sanctions from Washington if they refuse to cooperate with the US electronic passenger information requirements , or sanctions from their national data protection authorities if they do .
I was 4 1/2 months pregnant , and my mind was on anything but what color I would paint the nursery or the lullabies I would sing to my newborn son .
Rather than basking in the glow of impending motherhood , I was drifting into darkness and despair .
At times , I was seized with horrible thoughts - that the baby was dead or would die - and my terror of losing him kept me from bonding with my unborn child .
Ashamed and afraid , I told no one about what was happening to me .
In recent years , celebrities like Brooke Shields have helped shine the media spotlight on the problem of postpartum depression , or PPD , and Washington has taken notice .
In May , after Shields testified about her own battle with the disease , Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey introduced a bill that supports screening for PPD during the first year of postnatal checkups .
As I would soon learn , though , antepartum depression , which occurs during , not after , pregnancy , is a kind of orphan disease in the media , with few celebrities willing to adopt it as a cause .
It 's as if most people can accept a mother who becomes depressed after giving birth , when the reality of caring for a newborn sets in .
However , in this " post - feminist " world of family values , it seems far too taboo to dissect feelings women may have about being pregnant in the first place .
As a result , depressed pregnant women often stay silent , putting themselves and their babies at risk .
A series of recent studies , including one at Mass General last January , is finally shedding some light on the problem .
What researchers now know is that one in five pregnant women may be suffering from depression , experiencing symptoms ranging from self - doubt to obsessive thoughts of suicide .
Like PPD , antepartum depression may be partly due to the hormonal shifts that occur during pregnancy , but myriad factors can contribute to the problem , including relationship difficulties and a lack of support from family and friends .
In my case , the circumstances of my pregnancy were not exactly ripped from the pages of a storybook ( although I wonder how many pregnant women actually experience that fairy tale of nine months of joyous anticipation ) .
My husband and I were struggling in our marriage , and my pregnancy , at age 40 , came as a surprise .
Despite my situation , I knew from the beginning that was meant to have this child .
So for the first few months , I did what I thought a good mother - to - be should : I cut out caffeine and sugar and became a gold - star customer of Amazon , ordering books with encouraging titles like Great Expectations and The Happiest Baby on the Block .
But as the days passed , nothing could distract me from the darkness rolling in .
I started having panic attacks , usually when I could n't sleep , and I knew I was in trouble .
By that point , I 'd done the research .
I understood that taking an antidepressant could cause my son to have withdrawal symptoms after his delivery and birth defects ( two studies in The New England Journal of Medicine last month said the risk of birth defects is low when antidepressants are used in early pregnancy ) .
Part of me also worried about admitting I was anything but unambiguously thrilled about being pregnant .
In the end , though , I decided that trying to uphold the myth of an unwaveringly happy pregnancy would take a greater toll on my unborn son and me than admitting I was depressed .
In April , I started on a low dose of Zoloft and began reaching out to family , friends , and all those involved in my child 's and my own well - being .
I wish that more depressed pregnant women were encouraged to come forward and that their doctors were there to support them .
Now with just a month and a half until my due date , I am finally starting to climb out of my dark hole of despair .
Hope , the most essential part of all to giving birth , is slowly returning .
I have read that being pregnant is the closest you 'll ever get to the other side , with the soul inside of you straddling the worlds of darkness and light .
Even in my most difficult moments , I have always felt this joy radiating from the life within me , as if someone , somewhere , sensed I was in trouble and sent in reinforcements .
Every day I feel a little more of that joy as my son and I move closer to the light .

Mr Obama is considered to be a serious rival to Hillary Clinton
Mr Obama , a Democrat , said on his website he had formed an exploratory committee , which would allow him to raise money and hire staff for the run .
He is one of his party 's rising stars , having electrified the 2004 Democratic convention with a powerful speech .
He opposed the war in Iraq and has a solidly liberal Senate voting record .
In a video announcement posted on his website , he said Americans wanted to move beyond partisan politics to find common - sense solutions to problems .
" Politics has become so bitter and partisan , so gummed up by money and influence , that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions , " he said .
" We have to change our politics , and come together around our common interests and concerns as Americans . "
Personal history
Mr Obama , 45 , has generated unusual excitement in Washington since he was elected in 2004 , even being described as a " beach babe " after he was photographed visiting family in Hawaii .
BARACK OBAMA Born 4
Aug 1961 in Hawaii Studied law at Harvard Worked as a civil rights lawyer in Chicago Elected to the US Senate in 2004
Profile : Barack Obama
His 2004 convention speech touched on his personal history as the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman from Kansas , hailing America as a land of opportunity for giving his father a chance to study there .
He said he would make a formal announcement on 10 February as to whether or not he would run for president .
Mr Obama is considered one of few Democrats who could snatch the party 's 2008 nomination from fellow Senator Hillary Clinton .
She has not yet declared her candidacy .
Former vice - presidential candidate John Edwards is thought to be the strongest Democratic contender to have declared he is running for president .

The thousands of normal website usability guidelines therefore apply to them , as do this year 's top ten design mistakes .
But weblogs are also a special genre of website ; they have unique characteristics and thus distinct usability problems .
One of a weblog 's great benefits is that it essentially frees you from " Web design " .
You write a paragraph , click a button , and it's posted on the Internet .
No need for visual design , page design , interaction design , information architecture , or any programming or server maintenance .
Blogs make having a simple website much easier , and as a result , the number of people who write for the Web has exploded .
This is a striking confirmation of the importance of ease of use .
Weblogs ' second benefit is that they 're a Web - native content genre : they rely on links , and short postings prevail .
You do n't have to write a full article or conduct original research or reporting .
You can simply find something interesting on another site and link to it , possibly with commentary or additional examples .
Obviously , this is much easier than running a conventional site , and again indicates the benefits of lowering the barriers to computer use .
As a third benefit , blogs are part of an ecosystem ( often called the Blogosphere ) that serves as a positive feedback loop :
Whatever good postings exist are promoted through links from other sites .
More reader / writers see this good stuff , and the very best then get linked to even more .
As a result , link frequency follows a Zipf distribution , with disproportionally more links to the best postings .
Some weblogs are really just private diaries intended only for a handful of family members and close friends .
Usability guidelines generally do n't apply to such sites , because the readers ' prior knowledge and motivation are incomparably greater than those of third - party users .
When you want to reach new readers who are n't your mother , however , usability becomes important .
Also , while readers of your intranet weblog might know you , usability is important because your readers are on company time .
( As an example , see IBM 's use of intranet blogs — among the ten best intranets of 2006 . )
Usability Issues
To reach new readers and respect your existing readers ' time constraints , test your weblog against the following usability problems .
1. No Author Biographies
Unless you 're a business blog , you probably do n't need a full - fledged " about us " section the way a corporate site does .
That said , the basic rationale for " about us " translates directly into the need for an " about me " page on a weblog : users want to know who they 're dealing with .
It 's a simple matter of trust .
Anonymous writings have less credence than something that 's signed .
And , unless a person 's extraordinarily famous , it 's not enough to simply say that Joe Blogger writes the content .
Readers want to know more about Joe .
Does he have any credentials or experience in the field he 's commenting on ?
( Even if you do n't have formal credentials , readers will trust you more if you 're honest about that fact , set forth your informal experience , and explain the reason for your enthusiasm . )
2. No Author Photo
Even weblogs that provide author bios often omit the author photo .
A photo is important for two reasons :
It offers a more personable impression of the author .
You enhance your credibility by the simple fact that you 're not trying to hide .
Also , users relate more easily to somebody they 've seen .
It connects the virtual and physical worlds .
People who 've met you before will recognize your photo , and people who 've read your site will recognize you when you meet in person ( say , at a conference — or the company cafeteria if you 're an intranet blogger ) .
A huge percentage of the human brain is dedicated to remembering and recognizing faces .
For many , faces work better than names .
I learned this lesson myself in 1987 when I included my photo in a HyperCard stack I authored that was widely disseminated on Mac- oriented BBSs .
Over the next two years , countless people came up to me and said , " I liked your stack , " having recognized me from the photo .
Also , if you run a professional blog and expect to be quoted in the press , you should follow the recommendations for using the Web for PR and include a selection of high - resolution photos that photo editors can download .
3. Nondescript Posting Titles
Sadly , even though weblogs are native to the Web , authors rarely follow the guidelines for writing for the Web in terms of making content scannable .
This applies to a posting 's body text , but it 's even more important with headlines .
Users must be able to grasp the gist of an article by reading its headline .
Avoid cute or humorous headlines that make no sense out of context .
Your posting 's title is microcontent and you should treat it as a writing project in its own right .
On a value - per - word basis , headline writing is the most important writing you do .
Descriptive headlines are especially important for representing your weblog in search engines , newsfeeds ( RSS ) , and other external environments .
In those contexts , users often see only the headline and use it to determine whether to click into the full posting .
Even if users see a short abstract along with the headline ( as with most search engines ) , user testing shows that people often read only the headline .
In fact , people often read only the first three or four words of a headline when scanning a list of possible places to go .
Sample bad headlines :
What Is It That You Want ?
Hey , kids !
Comics !
Victims Abandoned
Sample good headlines :
Pictures from Die Hunns and Black Halos show
Office Depot Pays United States $ 4.75 Million to Resolve False Claims Act Allegations
( too long , but even if you only read the first few words , you have an idea of what it 's about )
( too long , but even if you only read the first few words , you have an idea of what it 's about )
Ice cream trucks as church marketing
This last headline works on a church - related blog .
If you 're writing an ice cream industry blog , start the headline with the word " church " because it 's the information - carrying word within a context of all ice cream , all the time .
In browsing weblog headline listings to extract these examples , I noticed several headlines in ALL CAPS .
That 's always bad .
Reading speed is reduced by 10 % and users are put off by the appearance of shouting .
4. Links Don't Say Where They Go
Many weblog authors seem to think it 's cool to write link anchors like : " some people think " or " there 's more here and here . "
Remember one of the basics of the Web : Life is too short to click on an unknown .
Tell people where they 're going and what they 'll find at the other end of the link .
Generally , you should provide predictive information in either the anchor text itself or the immediately surrounding words .
You can also use link titles for supplementary information that does n't fit with your content .
( To see a link title in action , mouse over the " link titles " link . )
A related mistake in this category is to use insider shorthand , such as using first names when you reference other writers or weblogs .
Unless you 're writing only for your friends , do n't alienate new visitors by appearing to be part of a closed clique .
The Web is not high school .
5. Classic Hits are Buried
Hopefully , you 'll write some pieces with lasting value for readers outside your fan base .
Do n't relegate such classics to the archives , where people can only find something if they know you posted it , say , in May 2003 .
Highlight a few evergreens in your navigation system and link directly to them .
For example , my own list of almost 300 Alertbox columns starts by saying , " Read these first : Usability 101 and Top Ten Mistakes of Web Design . "
Also , remember to link to your past pieces in newer postings .
Do n't assume that readers have been with you from the beginning ; give them background and context in case they want to read more about your ideas .
6 . The Calendar is the Only Navigation
A timeline is rarely the best information architecture , yet it 's the default way to navigate weblogs .
Most weblog software provides a way to categorize postings so users can easily get a list of all postings on a certain topic .
Do use categorization , but avoid the common mistake of tagging a posting with almost all of your categories .
Be selective .
Decide on a few places where a posting most belongs .
Categories must be sufficiently detailed to lead users to a thoroughly winnowed list of postings .
At the same time , they should n't be so detailed that users face a category menu that 's overly long and difficult to scan .
Ten to twenty categories are appropriate for structuring many topics .
On the main page for each category , highlight that category 's evergreens as well as a time line of its most recent postings .
7. Irregular Publishing Frequency
Establishing and meeting user expectations is one of the fundamental principles of Web usability .
For a weblog , users must be able to anticipate when and how often updates will occur .
For most weblogs , daily updates are probably best , but weekly or even monthly updates might work as well , depending on your topic .
In either case , pick a publication schedule and stick to it .
If you usually post daily but sometimes let months go by without new content , you 'll lose many of your loyal — and thus most valuable — readers .
Certainly , you should n't post when you have nothing to say .
Polluting cyberspace with excess information is a sin .
To ensure regular publishing , hold back some ideas and post them when you hit a dry spell .
8. Mixing Topics
If you publish on many different topics , you 're less likely to attract a loyal audience of high - value users .
Busy people might visit a blog to read an entry about a topic that interests them .
They 're unlikely to return , however , if their target topic appears only sporadically among a massive range of postings on other topics .
The only people who read everything are those with too much time on their hands ( a low - value demographic ) .
The more focused your content , the more focused your readers .
That , again , makes you more influential within your niche .
Specialized sites rule the Web , so aim tightly .
This is especially important if you 're in the business - to - business ( B2B ) sector .
If you have the urge to speak out on , say , both American foreign policy and the business strategy of Internet telephony , establish two blogs .
You can always interlink them when appropriate .
9. Forgetting That You Write for Your Future Boss
Whenever you post anything to the Internet — whether on a weblog , in a discussion group , or even in an email — think about how it will look to a hiring manager in ten years .
Once stuff 's out , it 's archived , cached , and indexed in many services that you might never be aware of .
Years from now , someone might consider hiring you for a plum job and take the precaution of ' nooping you first .
( Just taking a stab at what 's next after Google .
Rest assured : there will be some super - snooper service that 'll dredge up anything about you that 's ever been bitified . )
What will they find in terms of naïvely puerile " analysis " or offendingly nasty flames published under your name ?
Think twice before posting .
If you do n't want your future boss to read it , do n't post .
10 . Having a Domain Name Owned by a Weblog Service
Having a weblog address ending in blogspot.com , typepad.com , etc. will soon be the equivalent of having an @aol.com email address or a Geocities website : the mark of a naïve beginner who should n't be taken too seriously .
Letting somebody else own your name means that they own your destiny on the Internet .
They can degrade the service quality as much as they want .
They can increase the price as much as they want .
They can add atop your content as many pop-ups , blinking banners , or other user - repelling advertising techniques as they want .
They can promote your competitor 's offers on your pages .
Yes , you can walk , but at the cost of your loyal readers , links you 've attracted from other sites , and your search engine ranking .
The longer you stay at someone else 's domain name , the higher the cost of going independent .
Yes , it 's tempting to start a new weblog on one of the services that offer free accounts .
It 's easy , it 's quick , and it 's obviously cheap .
But it only costs $ 8 per year to get your personal domain name and own your own future .
As soon as you realize you 're serious about blogging , move it away from a domain name that 's controlled by somebody else .
The longer you delay , the more pain you 'll feel when you finally make the move .

SIGMUND
Freud died 68 years ago today , and it remains uncertain whether he is what W. H. Auden called him , “ a whole climate of opinion / Under whom we conduct our differing lives , ” or whether he is completely passé .
It ’s still not clear whether Freud was the genius of the 20th century , a comprehensive absurdity or something in between .
Our confusion about Freud is something he predicted — and also provoked — particularly in his later work , now largely unread , which is preoccupied with the question of authority .
It sheds light on our confused attitudes toward Freud , who always strove for cultural authority .
But more important , books like “ Totem and Taboo ” and “ Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego ” illuminate our collective difficulties with power and particularly with the two scourges of today ’s world , fundamentalist religion and tyrannical politics .
Probably the best way to understand Freud ’s take on authority is to consider the mode of therapy that he settled on midway through his career .
We might call it “ transference therapy . ”
Over time , Freud came to see that his patients were transferring feelings and hopes from other phases of their lives onto him .
Frequently they sought from him what they ’d sought from their parents when they were children .
They wanted perfect love , and even more fervently , it seems , they wanted perfect truth .
They became obsessed with Freud as what Jacques Lacan , the French psychoanalytic theorist , liked to call “ the subject who is supposed to know . ”
Patients saw Freud as an all - knowing figure who had the wisdom to solve all their problems and make them genuinely happy and whole .

Let 's talk about cleaning .
Cleaning is a drag .
I hear there are people out there that actually like to clean , but I am not one of them , even though I used to work as a housecleaner .
The good thing about having that job is , I learned to clean very quickly and efficiently .
Now , I pass that knowledge along to you , Curbly readers !
Here 's how to clean like a maid :
The mantra of the company I worked for was top to bottom , left to right .
This way you could easily walk into any room and know exactly where to get started .
The work was divided into " wet rooms " ( bathrooms and kitchens ) and " dry rooms " ( living room , dining room , bedrooms ) .
If we were lucky and were n't understaffed , we'd go out with a partner and one person would do the " wet rooms " and the other person would do the " dry rooms " .
One " wet room " and one " dry room " would be " deep cleaned " each cleaning .
I still clean my house in the same manner .
I try to clean on a weekly schedule , and " deep clean " on a rotating basis .
I start with the " wet rooms " first , as I hate cleaning them the most .
Getting it out of the way means it 's all downhill work from that point on .
On cleaning " wet rooms " :
** Maid 's Tip * *
Keep all your cleaning supplies in a tray you can easily carry from room to room .
You 'll need a blue shop rag , some white rags ( I use cloth diapers ) , an all purpose spray cleaner ( I like Formula 409 ) , a glass cleaner , a heavy - duty all - purpose cleaner ( such as Simple Green ) , a floor cleaner ( I typically use Mop N Glo ) , a good toilet bowl cleaner , and a duster .
In bathrooms , I start first with putting the toilet bowl cleaner in the toilet to let it sit while I 'm doing everything else .
Then ( in any room ) knock down cobwebs and dust light fixtures .
Spray counters , tubs , and sinks .
Spray the dirtiest parts first , then move around the room wiping everything down from left to right .
Only bother to wipe down the mirror if it 's smeary .
If you want your fixturesto really shine , use glass cleaner on them .
Run your duster along the baseboards and cabinet fronts , then swish the toilet .
Sweep the floor .
Toss down some Mop N Glo , wipe it up , and you 're finished .
This is probably obvious , but make sure you do n't use the same rag in the kitchen as you do in the bathroom .
E. coli is a bad , bad thing .
** Maid 's Tip * *
Cleaning your microwave is easy peasy .
Put a bowl of vinegar and water in the microwave , and cook on high for 3 minutes .
Then just wipe out the microwave with a rag .
The vinegar will take care of that funky popcorn / bacon smell combo most everyone 's microwave has , and the steam will soften even the most funky funk that 's in your microwave .
On cleaning " dry rooms " :
Dry rooms are a breeze .
Knock down cobwebs , dust light fixtures .
Dust all other furniture and picture frames , moving from left to right .
( Our bosses at the maid service would occasionally come behind us and check our work - the place they got us most was by doing the " white glove " test on the tops of picture frames .
Do n't forget the picture frames ! )
Change the sheets if you 're in a bedroom .
Run your duster along the baseboards , then vacuum .
** Maid 's Tip * *
There is no good , fast way to dust an area that has lots of knickknacks and tchotchkes on it .
My personal design aesthetic keeps me from having those kinds of little items , but if you must have them , only bother to dust those suckers when you 're " deep " cleaning .
Trust me on this one . ;)
By using this method and making sure you keep up with it weekly , you can clean extremely quickly .
I can clean my entire 1200 square foot house in about 45 minutes this way .
Знаменитый творец голых массовок , американский фотограф Спенсер Туник продолжает победное шествие по городам мира .
В минувшие выходные , пришедшиеся на Всемирный день натуриста , он завершил съемки в Амстердаме .
Если совсем недавно в Мехико , накануне конкурса " Мисс Вселенная " , Спенсер раздел одновременно 18.000 человек , то в столиц е
Голландии он решил не ставить рекордов массовости мероприятия и попытался использовать особенности городской архитектуры .
Фотографии отличались особой художественной изобретательностью .
На одной – модели выстроены по оттенку кожи , на другой – они словно парят над водой ( их удерживает дугообразный легкий мостик ) , на третьей – тела образуют живой холм , на четвертой – выставлены , как в огромной витрине , на гостиничных балконах .
Фантазия художника разгулялась в самом свободном городе Европы .
Съемки начались в полночь и были закончены в воскресенье на рассвете .
Накануне очередного " голого велопробега " , который в этом году голландцы решили устроить в пригород е
Наймегена 9 июня , Спенсер Туник сделал серию фотоснимков местных нудисток верхом на самом экологичном транспорте .
На амстердамских съемка х Тунику обнаженными позировали около 2.000 человек .
Экспозиция его работ , сделанных в Голландии , будет выставлена в центре Амстердама с 23 июня до начала августа .
Это будут большие снимки – в человеческий рост .
До сих пор мэрии городов , в которых работал фотохудожник , не были до такой степени благосклонны к его творчеству .
Rush Limbaugh , he ’s got the life .
His days flick through the slot like postcards from paradise .
Where most gab - show hosts report for duty at radio studios where candy bars get stuck in the vending machine and the carpeting is a certain industrial shade of indifference , Limbaugh — a man , a mission , a mighty wind — has carved out his own principality in Florida ’s Palm Beach , a lion preserve where he can roam undisturbed .
Drinking in the rays , puffing on those big - shot cigars , riding the range in a golf cart — he ’s got the complete Jackie Gleason how - sweet - it - is package deal .
But just as the Great One suffered from melancholia aggravated by alcohol , Limbaugh ’s indulgence in his own creature comforts has n’t been able to insulate him from the demons within .
An addiction to painkillers reduced this human boom box of self - sufficiency and strict enforcement —
” If people are violating the law by doing drugs , ” he once lectured on his syndicated TV show , “ they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up ” ( up the river , that is ) — to the furtive , needy ploys of any other junkie who finds the medicine cabinet running dry .
After he entered rehab , his third wife , Marta , reportedly vacated the luxury estate ( they would later divorce ) , leaving Rush a Tarzan without his Jane in what the Palm Beach Post in 2004 called his “ $ 24.2 million , 36,500 - square - foot secluded monster at 1495 N. Ocean . ”
Secluded for now , but perhaps after this god of the airwaves shucks his mound of flesh so that his soul can meet Reagan ’s in Republican Heaven ( where all the angels look like June Allyson ) , his compound can be converted into a tourist attraction — a combination museum , shrine , gift shop , and spiritual mecca modeled on Elvis ’s Graceland , Dolly Parton ’s Dollywood .
Aging dittoheads can make pilgrimages to pay their respects , rekindle fond memories , and gape reverently at the silenced TV where Rush watched the game he loved so much and understood so little , football .
For us non-dittoheads ( that is , the unconverted ) , a more fitting memorial to Mount Rushbo might be a diorama of the environmental destruction that he did so much to enable in his multi-decade reign of denigration .
Global warming ’s most popular denialist , talk radio’s most imitated showman , conservatism ’s minister of disinformation , he has injected millions of semi-vacant American skulls with a cream filling of complacency that has helped thrust this country into the forefront of backward leadership .
He has given Republican lawmakers the rhetorical cover fire to do nothing but snicker as the crisis emerged and impressed itself on the rest of the world .
He conscripted concern for nature as just another weapon in the Culture Wars .
May the grasses of his favorite golf courses go forever yellow and dust storms whip from the sand traps .
From Teddy Roosevelt , who made wilderness protection a priority and created national parks , bird sanctuaries , big - game refuges , and national forests , to Richard Nixon , under whose bad - moon presidency the Environmental Protection Agency was formed and the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed , the Republican Party carried a tradition of conservation that crumbled under Ronald Reagan , for whom nature was mostly a scenic backdrop whose resources could be exploited out of camera frame .
Reagan ’s selections of James Watt for the Department of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch for the E.P.A. put bureaucratic vandals in positions of stewardship , and in 1987 he vetoed re-authorization of the Clean Water Act , a veto that fortunately was overridden .
It is a measure of how awful the George W. Bush administration has been on the environment that some activists miss the old , upfront hostility of the Reagan era , when at least the political and corporate machinations took place in open daylight .
“ Unfortunately , now , ” lamented Daniel Weiss , an environmental activist ( quoted by Amanda Griscom in her article for online ’s Grist ) , “ our leaders are much more savvy — and far more insidious .
They undo laws in the dead of night . ”
Under Bush II , environmentalists no longer need to be engaged , because they ’ve been so stridently marginalized and stigmatized as a pantheistic kook cult practicing socialism under the guise of Gaia worship .
This was largely Limbaugh ’s doing , and now every right - wing pundit from Cal Thomas to Michael Savage croaks the same tune .
It was Limbaugh who inscribed the term “ environmentalist wackos ” into the political lexicon and hung the “ loser ” tag on them .
He caricatured the fight for wildlife preservation — a broad - visioned tradition that spans from Henry David Thoreau to John Muir to Rachel Carson to Edward Abbey to David Brower — into something weedily hippie - dip .
In his 1992 debut , The Way Things Ought to Be , Limbaugh fobbed himself off with a faux barefoot humility over how far he had come in his Horatio Alger saga , the book ’s cover photo presenting him as a chubby - cheeked cherub with a grinning hint of mischief — a “ lovable little fuzzball , ” to use his own pet phrase .
“ I am in awe of the perfection of the earth , ” he proclaimed inside , a perfection crafted by the Creator who made us all , draping the stars in the firmament like the ultimate interior decorator .
For all his wide - eyed wonderment , Limbaugh fashioned himself as less naïve than the stereotypical “ long - haired maggot - infested FM - type environmentalist wacko ” whom he professes to have reasoned with over the plight of the spotted owl , Rush ’s ineluctable train of logic leading to the final junction : “ If the owl ca n’t adapt to the superiority of humans , screw it . ”
It was during this early , jaunty period of Rush ’s fame that the theme music for his “ Animal Rights Update ” was the title song from Andy Williams ’s Born Free punctuated by gunfire and animal sounds — the perfect soundtrack for Dick Cheney hunting porn .
Limbaugh acknowledged in The Way Things Ought to Be that there were “ some decent environmentalists ” out there , they were n’t all maggot - infested mulletheads , but portrayed even the sincere ones as socioeconomic parasites .
“ You and I and the vast majority of other people work for a living , ” he wrote .
“ Most of the people running environmental groups do n’t work . ”
They simply pass around the collection plate to support their cushy lifestyles .
As demonization goes , that ’s pretty mild .
To Driveby Liberal Mediaâ „ ¢ , it might just look like Keith Olbermann 's beating the TV Factor ratings - on his Bill 's birthday yet - is getting to the Nospinster ....
Like a former leader of the pride , the beaten old lion is losing his power - and his sexual appeal to the under - 65 year old lionesses - to a younger , more virile young leader .
But that 's not what is driving the Nospinster bat - crazy .
It 's more .
Big time more .
Big time " Al Franken will be doing an ' I 'm good enough ' back - flip in the Minnesota senatorial campaign snow " more .
The buzz around the watering hole is that the Big Cat may be losing his radio gig and it's got to be driving him off the deep end .
It 's always rather pathetic when the lion becomes the wildebeest and drinking from the dried up Kool Aid waterhole makes him even more vulnerable ... and sad .
The air , thick with inside - the - loop chatter telling of the Bill O'Reilly 's Radio Factor 's possible demise , Bill 's patience , what little he had to begin with , is wearing as thin as his mane .
No longer the hunter , he knows all too well the prey 's sorry plight as Bill 's dropped all pretense of fair and balanceness , going whole warthog against the Democrats and any other group or person who has any connection to the left : Mediamatters , Moveon , Dailykos , Tim Robbins , Rosie O'Donnell , NY Times , Frank Rich , George Soros , et al .
Hysterical , one - note scapegoating , similar to some columnist (s ) I know who seems to have a sick infatuation with reporting every single hypocritical misrepresentation delivered by Bill .
Attractive guy , the writer , but still , a bit neurotic .
But now Bill 's also going after his own Fox Consultants who refuse to kowtow to the lead he 's fed them .
Bill 's outrage has been so over the top , the altitude has caused a dearth of oxygen to the brain , his exasperation with the rapid plunge into humiliating radio failure affecting common decency and respect / even for his paid - for Fox News friends .
Like Geraldo ...
or Co-Host Lise Weihl for questioning Bill for being wrong again .
On Thursday Bill had spent an hour on the radio railing against the NY Times for giving MoveOn.org a " hateful - smear site " discount because the Times and MoveOn are in bed with each other .
This before he had the journalistic civility to first speak with the Times advertising department ; a call that would have revealed that what MoveOn got , any right wing advocacy group would have gotten the same rate or better .
By TV Factor showtime , Bill had found out his reporting boner , yet still found it necessary to begin his open salvo making the same erroneous claim .
Only after building a good lather did he bring up the actual Times advertising policy .
His attempt to slam the left nearly lay waste to Fox Consultant Jane Hall ( and reminded her that he could turn off her microphone as he had done once before when she got out of hand ) who refused to buy into Bill 's fiction , reminding him that the Times policy had nothing to do with ideology .
His outrage grew , shouting her down as Hall had one of those , " I do n't get paid enough to get humiliated like this " looks .
Lately , out - of - control has become O'Reilly status quo
No matter how you feel about him , rarely does Fox News mate Sean Hannity ever lose his cool .
He 's a professional .
He pitches his game , but knows it 's going to last at least nine innings .
Bill , might look strong in the first inning or two , firing 100 mph over the backstop , but he 's thrown his arm out before he 's gotten through the batting order once .
Like Joseph McCarthy , Bob Grant and Wally George before him , Bill 's divisive histrionics along with an aversion to fact - based truth will soon leave him a flamed - out asterisk on the ass of broadcast infamy .
Yet while the possibility of losing his radio spot seems to signal an accelerating slide into broadcast past , the old lion wo n't give up easy .
He 'll continue to swing wildly at imagined enemies of mankind and Christmas , but , if I might milk the proverbial , feline - istic metaphor , Bill 's claws are now as dangerous as a recently - neutered pussycat waving its anesthetized claw .
It 's cute but it wo n't be drawing any blood .

" We forget at our peril that markets make a good servant , a bad master , and a worse religion . "
- Amory Lovins
If you do much of your work on a computer , whether working at home or in an office , you might feel that you 're part of the economic avant - garde .
Indeed , you are .
In fact , you 're in the front ranks of the next sector moving on . . . to another country .
If your job could possibly be done at home , does it really matter if the home is in Boston or Belfast or Singapore ?
You are a part of the Almost Gone economy .
What got me thinking about jobs with one foot in the ocean was seeing that a few economists have finally come around to wondering about the impact of globalization on American workers .
In fact , one prominent practitioner of the dismal science , Alan Blinder , made it personal this year .
He put together a list of " highly offshorable " jobs and there on his list was economists .
( Envisioning how they 'd move overseas : Financial firms could hire consulting firms staffed by Indian and Chinese economists .
And someday , when we moved past the greatest barrier to free trade ever erected , faculty tenure , classes would be online from the London School of Economics . )
Yes , the invisible hand has been replaced by the invisible hook , slipping into the collar of those who 've been telling us for decades that the freer the trade the better off we all are .
Also on Blinder 's list were accounting clerks , computer programmers , actuaries , film editors , mathematicians , graphic designers , and on and on .
If it can be done on a computer , it 's part of the Almost Gone economy .
( " Newspaper columnist " is not on the list , by the way .
I suspect that 's only because there 's not enough money in it . )
So what have economists done to help ?
They yammer on about " comparative advantage , " that old argument that if each country does what it is naturally most suited to do , that the world will be a better , more prosperous place .
Okay , but here 's the question :
What is the comparative advantage of the United States ?
There was a time when we were out front because of our technology , our collective knowledge , our access to capital of both the monetary and intellectual variety .
That advantage we have given away .
It was easier for intellectuals to be sanguine about globalization when it meant sending assembly - line jobs overseas .
After all , from an office at the Economics Department at Princeton , a job on the assembly line seemed mind - numbingly awful , and the solution rolled so easily off the tongue : retraining .
But now , what do you retrain an economist , graphic designer , or actuary to do ?
If manufacturing is gone -- and much of anything involving a computer goes too -- well , what does that leave ?
The service industry , of course .
From graphic designer to Sandwich Artist at Subway .
But economists ?
What will we do with them ?
They do n't have the social skills for the service industry .
Maybe they could work security .
What troubles me is that economists have taught us all to accept the inevitability of jobs being lost .
If you mention any restrictions on the gutting of the American economy , economists do an immediate Pavlov , drooling " Smoot - Hawley " and " Great Depression . "
So it falls to me to offer a few suggestions .
First , we need to stop being accomplices in the dragging down of the retail sector .
What I 'm going to say hurts me personally , as a regular Internet shopper , but it 's time for tax on online sales .
We need to stop putting the people who invest in the local economy at a competitive disadvantage .
Then , we need to remove as many obstacles to employment as possible , getting our employers out of the jobs done by governments elsewhere in the world , such as providing healthcare .
Finally , we need to find ways to make imports do their share for the economy .
Let 's start by making our country safer , inspecting every container that arrives in the country .
That would raise the cost of imports in time and money , without starting a tariff war .
And best of all , it would do so while providing lots of solid security jobs for those retrained economists , letting them make up for all that they 've done by ignoring the problems of globalization .

ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Two U.S. car thieves failed to make their getaway in a car they had just stolen because they could n’t figure out how to use its manual transmission , a witness said on Wednesday .
The teenagers armed with a gun approached a man outside a pizza restaurant in Marietta , Georgia , late on Monday .
They stole his wallet and the keys to his Honda Accord , got into the car but could n’t make it start because it had stick shift , according to John Williamson , 18 , a restaurant employee .
“ The kid was just sitting in the car trying to start it but he had no idea what to do .
He looked dumbfounded .
The only thing he had going was the radio , ” said Williamson who witnessed the scene .
While the thief was trying to start the car , restaurant employees called the police who arrived and caught the teenagers as they tried to escape into nearby woods .
Unlike many parts of the world , the majority of cars in the United States are automatic and many drivers are unused to driving “ stick shift ” vehicles , in which a clutch pedal must be depressed to change gear .
The Desk ...
So it has been a while since I presented a new large scale model / sculpture .
Could it be that Eric has burned out on LEGO building ?
Not exactly .
The projects are just getting larger ...
In April of 2000 while on a business trip I received a near - frantic email from someone with an unusual request .
It seems that she represented a fellow with a company in Seattle ( no , NOT Microsoft ) .
Turns out that last September this guy was hired , and in his contract of employment it stipulated that he wanted a desk made out of LEGO .
The hiring company evidently really wanted to hire this guy because their Human Resources department did n't scoff at the idea .
Sure , he could have a desk made out of LEGO bricks .
That was September 1999 .
It was now seven months later , and the availability of LEGO desks was starting to dawn upon the company .
Their employee had no such desk .
And he wanted his desk .
Fortunately , that 's where I come in .
I 'm not exactly sure how my name came up ( Todd , thank you for the one referral I saw ) , but evidently when the emailing woman inquired on the Internet , she was given my name .
' Can you build us a desk out of LEGO ?
A full - sized desk , strong enough to hold a computer , with working drawers and everything ?'
' Sure .
I can build you a desk . '
We then flushed out the details .
Brick costs were calculated .
Designs were FAXed .
Glue was discussed ( oh... so much glue ) .
Time schedules were planned .
In mid-June I finally received the down payment to cover cost of bricks ( about $ 2000 , if you 're curious ) .
I began buying and building .
A few weeks later I had the desk built .
I had one more business trip on the West Coast to attend to , but when I returned , it was at the beginning of August and I now had to do the most painful thing in my LEGO career ...
I had to take one last , proud look at this desk ... and I had to then take it apart , one piece at a time and then glue each piece back together .
All 35,000 pieces or so .
Actually , that 's not quite accurate .
Before I started taking it apart , I had to first roll the desk upside - down so that I could start disassembling from the bottom on one side and reassembling ground up on the other side .
A few minor design changes also had to be accommodated during the rebuilding / gluing phase , but slowly and tediously -- row by row -- I built the desk again .
With glue .
About 7 pounds of glue when it was all said and done .
About 7 pounds of highly toxic , nauseous glue .
Three weeks later it was complete .
Again .
Now it just has to be shipped to Seattle ( which is gonna cost several hundred dollars ) .
What fun .
Here are some facts about The Desk :
Approximately 35,000 LEGO bricks were used .
This includes almost all the pieces from 32 Blue Tubs ( #3033 ) , almost 300 (! ) small baseplates ( 8x16 studs ) , and 63 blue plate packs from LEGO Shop - at - Home .
A few other pieces were also bought from private collectors ( 226 tiles so the drawers could slide , et cetera ) .
The desk weighs about 120 pounds , I think .
I have not actually weighed it ... but I think that is close .
About 7 pounds of glue were used .
Brand : Oatey , All - Purpose ( PVC , CPVC , ABS ) Glue .
The desk has the following dimensions ( inches , WxHxD ) : 60 " x 29.5 " x 30 " .
It has 7 working drawers ( six small , one large ) .
It has a folding lid in the top that conceals a hole for computer cables to drop through .
Yes , the top is bumpy -- studs up .
I offered to make the top smooth , but the client specifically requested otherwise .
Whatever .
I also offered to build a retractable keyboard tray in the front , but that was not wanted .
Nor a mosaic of the company logo on the top or sides .
Yes , I was paid to build the desk .
Do n't ask how much .
It was worth my time .
The most interesting thing about this project was not the design of it ( it was actually rather straightforward in my mind ...
I mean ... it 's a desk .
Not too fancy ... and drawers are n't hard at all ) .
No , the part that took the most thought was the economy of pieces .
While this desk was obviously costing the company a pretty penny , they still had a budget to consider , so I had to design the color scheme such that the bricks were used in a proportion which matched the Blue Tub distribution as closely as possible .
I planned it pretty well , evidently , because in the end I had less than one Tub 's worth left ( except for those pesky 1x1 s ... about 2400 of which I used decoratively on the top ) .
I 'm not gonna go into the trouble I discovered while gluing such a large model together ( distortion of bricks , warping , etc ) .
It all worked out in the end .
And it should only take about a week for the glue - fumes to clear .

A drunken schoolgirl kneed and kicked a man in the groin because he mispronounced her name , a court has been told .
Megan Jane Conroy , then 17 , from Sandstone Point north of Brisbane , sobbed in the dock in the Brisbane District Court as she pleaded guilty to one count of assault occasioning bodily harm .
The court was told she arrived home about 1 am ( AEST ) on May 13 , 2006 , to find the complainant and a group of her mother 's friends celebrating a birthday .
THERE can be no surer way of averting a sexually transmitted infection such as AIDS than avoiding sex .
That much is obvious .
And it is also convenient for religious lobbyists who believe that premarital sex is a sin .
But is it realistic ?
Those lobbyists argue that a popular alternative — known in the jargon as “ abstinence - plus ” — which recommends chastity but also explains how to use condoms , is likely to make things worse by encouraging earlier intercourse .
“ Abstinence - only ” teaching , they reckon , should be more effective .
That , of course , is a possibility .
But it is a testable possibility .
And Kristen Underhill and her colleagues at the University of Oxford have , over the past few months , been testing it .
Their conclusion is that it is wrong .
Abstinence - only does not work .
Abstinence - plus probably does .
Last month Dr Underhill published a review of 13 trials involving 16,000 young people in America .
The trials compared the sexual behaviour of those given an abstinence - only education with that of those who were provided with no information at all or with whatever their schools normally taught .
Pregnancies were as numerous in both groups .
Sexually transmitted diseases were as widespread .
The number of sexual partners was equally high and unprotected sex just as common .
Having thus discredited abstinence - only teaching , Dr Underhill and her colleagues decided to evaluate the slightly more complicated message of “ abstinence - plus ” using 39 trials that involved 38,000 - odd young people from the United States , Canada and the Bahamas .
Their results are published in the current issue of Public Library of Science Medicine .
This tuition — compared , as before , with whatever biology classes and playgrounds provide — reduced the number of pregnancies in three out of seven trials ( the remaining four recorded no difference ) .
Four out of 13 trials found that abstinence - plus - educated teenagers had fewer sexual partners , while the remainder showed no change .
Fourteen studies reported that it increased condom use ; 12 others reported no difference .
Furthermore , in the vast majority of cases , abstinence - plus participants knew more about AIDS and HIV ( the virus that causes the disease ) than their peers did .
And the tuition often reduced the frequency of anal sex ( which brings a greater chance of passing on HIV than the vaginal option ) .
In contrast to the fears of the protagonists of abstinence - only education , not one of the trials found that teenagers behaved in a riskier fashion in either the long or the short term after receiving abstinence - plus instruction .
Unfortunately ( and surprisingly ) only two of the studies addressed the question of disease transmission directly , and the numbers involved were too small to find a statistically significant difference between groups .
Nevertheless , Dr Underhill 's pair of reviews should make informative reading for policymakers .
America 's government earmarks money for abstinence - only teaching , which is matched by individual states .
It should review that policy — which is clearly no better than the alternatives , and is probably worse .
Its generosity to needy foreigners is similarly prescriptive .
Of the $ 15 billion promised over five years by PEPFAR , President George Bush 's personal anti-AIDS initiative , $ 1 billion is reserved for groups that intend to fight AIDS without mentioning condoms .
Though Dr Underhill 's results apply only to North America , they do suggest a need to investigate what happens elsewhere , in case PEPFAR 's policy , too , needs to be reviewed .
A dose of prevention
Teaching people about what they might wear during intercourse is an important way of reducing the chance of them catching HIV .
But teaching them , in addition , about what drugs they could take to reduce that risk may be added to the syllabus in the future .
A vaccine is still a long way off , but four clinical trials — in Peru and Ecuador , Thailand , Botswana and also America — are assessing how well daily anti-retroviral pills , which are normally prescribed to control established HIV infections , prevent the virus infecting healthy people who do dangerous things .
The results of these trials will be plugged into epidemiological computer models to assess the likely effect of various drug- distribution policies .
One model intended to do exactly that has already been built , by Ume Abbas and John Mellors of the University of Pittsburgh .
It is designed to mimic a mature HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa — which it did rather well when the researchers tested its output against data from Zambia , a country in which the epidemic has remained stable for a decade .
Writing in PLoS Medicine 's sister journal , PLoS ONE , Dr Abbas and Dr Mellors describe what happened when they added prophylactic anti-retroviral drugs to the model .
They experimented with different measures of drug efficacy and with different groups of people taking the pills .
Assuming that anti-retrovirals work 90 % of the time and are taken by three - quarters of sexually active people , their model suggests that new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa would be cut by 74 % over 10 years .
Unfortunately , the idea of providing and delivering so many drugs to so many people is logistically implausible .
And even if it could be done , it would cost about $ 6,000 per HIV infection averted — a lot of money in Africa .
However , giving the drug to the 16 % of Africans who behave most riskily would be easier and could lead to a 29 % reduction over a decade at only a tenth of that cost .
A harsh calculation , but a realistic one — unlike expecting teenagers to give up sex because you tell them to .
It occurred to me recently while walking the streets of downtown Orlando that a blank facial expression can actually express more about someone ’s mindset than a face busy with varying expressions .
It becomes candidly evident when you look up at the blank faces walking past you , naturally striving ever so vigilantly to avoid eye contact .
Their face muscles are relaxed , yet their appearance is uninviting .
Even though there appears to be no obvious sign of emotion , most people respond as if there is a clear message being conveyed .
These blank faces of expression seem to communicate a subtle warning for others to keep their distance .
Some of them also indicate that the person is enthralled in deep thought , and disturbing such thought is probably not desired .
If I needed directions and quickly glanced around a public space filled with people , I know I would feel more comfortable interrupting someone already involved in a conversation , rather than taking my chances with the seemingly cold look of a blank , expressionless passerby .
It ’s fascinating how the innocuous act of carrying a blank expression actually startles the people around you .
Yesterday a strange phenomena happened in Omsk region Russia .
Pretty vast territory of Omsk region was covered with a snow that had an unusual color .
It was orange .
Now we have a few photos , mainly screenshots from Russian TV channels .
There is still no one exact explanation about the origin of orange color of this snow .
More high quality photos of the Martian like snowy terrain would follow shortly .
According to Russian officials the orange snow does n’t contain any chemical byproducts or any other elements dangerous to human .
For decades , wildlife filmmakers have been cutting and pasting multiple attacks into a single stalk - and - pounce .
In fact , any particular scene might be made up of shots of three or four different predators taken on different days .
Until now , the false advertising has been a regrettable necessity :
If filmmakers try to follow a high - speed chase by air , the blare of the helicopter blades scares off the action .
But in March , when the BBC series Planet Earth premieres on the Discovery Channel , viewers will see a single wolf hunt from start to finish .
There 's also a bioluminescent light show of a vampire squid deep in the Pacific , a blue bird of paradise dancing in the New Guinea rain forest , and lions attacking elephants at a watering hole in the Botswana desert all brought to you by the humble hi-def digital camera .
Jaded couch potatoes may think they 've seen everything HD has to offer , but Planet Earth will show its full potential .
HD cams capture footage of creatures from thousands of feet away , without subjecting them to intrusive floodlights and loud vehicles .
For situations too dark , too slow , or too fast for HD , the BBC crew turned to gadgets that reveal what the naked eye can't see .
For instance , they used a high - speed cam typically found in automotive crash - test labs to film a split - second shark attack and an infrared security cam favored by banks to track desert animals in the black of night .

The Soviet doomsday device – a giant cobalt bomb rigged to explode were Russia ever nuked , rendering the earth 's surface uninhabitable – gained fictional fame in Dr. Strangelove .
However , P.D. Smith 's Doomsday Men , available in the UK and due for stateside publication in December , tells the story of the real Doomsday device – and it 's still armed .
Fearing that a sneak attack by American submarine - launched missiles might take Moscow out in thirteen minutes , the Soviet leadership had authorized the construction of an automated communications network , reinforced to withstand a nuclear strike .
At its heart was a computer system similar to the one in Dr Strangelove .
Its codename was Perimetr .
It went fully operational in January 1985 .
It is still in place .
Its job is to monitor whether there have been nuclear detonations on Russian territory and to check whether communications channels with the Kremlin have been severed .
If the answer to both questions is “ yes ” then the computer will conclude that the country is under attack and activate its nuclear arsenal .
All that is then needed is final human approval from a command post buried deep underground .
It would be a brave officer , adds Smith , who , having been cut off from his superiors in the Kremlin , could ignore the advice of such a supposedly foolproof system . [...]
We all face the prospect that , if Russia were ever attacked , its strategic nuclear warheads could be launched by a computer system designed and built in the late 1970s .
That quote was from the Times ' review , and Slate 's Ron Rosenbaum recently revisited the book within the chilling context of Russian president Vladimir Putin 's decision to put his country 's nuclear bomber fleet back in the air .
( Are they actually armed ?
Only he knows !
Shiver . )
So what 's this doing on a science blog ?
Well , it 's Friday afternoon , my thoughts are meandering , and earlier I read a review of a God Delusion rebuttal .
Wrote the reviewer ,
... Dawkins ’s first sleight of hand ... dishonestly bundles all religious belief and practice into one crude bag that supposedly equals fanaticism .
This is rather like suggesting that all science is dangerous because it has brought nuclear weapons ....
And that seems like a very valid point , both for being fair to religious people and for keeping our own belief in science from turning to ideological dogma .
After all , if the world is nuked by a Cold War doomsday device because some Islamic fundamentalist group hits Russia with dirty bombs , it 'll be a fetid mix of religious and secular madness that does us in , each happy to use the tools that scientists have provided .

A sharp rise in the international price of vitamin C is focusing fresh attention on the risks of the world 's growing dependence on China for essential food supplies and additives .
China , which exports more than 80 percent of the world 's ascorbic acid – also known as vitamin C and a key food preservative – appears to have cut production over the past several months , pushing prices up by more than 200 percent to a four - year high .
Customers have scrambled for supplies of the additive , found in thousands of processed foods from fruit drinks to organic hamburger rolls , from applesauce to granola .
The production cutback follows a Chinese government drive to enforce pollution limits on chemical and pharmaceutical companies , sources in the vitamin industry say .
The four biggest Chinese vitamin C producers are also facing a price - fixing suit in a New York court .
Since January , prices have risen from $ 3.40 a kilo to $ 11 a kilo , according to industry sources .
The reduction in world supply comes in the wake of a series of scandals surrounding Chinese food and drug exports , some of which have been found to be tainted by poisonous chemicals .
The Chinese have charged that US exports are tainted and have banned some of them as well .
In the wake of the scandals , President Bush on Wednesday appointed an imports safety panel that will report to him in 60 days .
Though there appears to be no reason to believe that Chinese vitamin C is contaminated , the sudden shortage highlights another cause for concern over America 's growing reliance on Chinese food imports .
Only one Western company , DSM of the Netherlands , still makes ascorbic acid , concentrating production in Scotland since shutting down its US plant two years ago .
Chinese firms have driven all other competitors out of business .
" They have virtually captured the lot , unbeknown to most people , " says Leo Hepner , a London - based management consultant to the food and pharmaceutical industry .
" It puts us in a very difficult situation if , say , they stopped making it . "
Even some nutrition experts are surprised to learn that most of the world 's vitamin C is produced in China .
" We may need to figure out how it can be made closer to home , " says Mara Vitolins , director of public health at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston - Salem , N.C. " Our own food supply is sort of vulnerable . "
Ascorbic acid export figures released by the Chinese Customs Administration show that exports dropped by 24 percent in May 2007 from the month before , from 6,537 tons in April to 4,857 tons .
That was 14 percent below the monthly average for the first six months of 2006 .
Production has fallen , say manufacturers , because they are now being forced to abide by environmental standards that were applied only sporadically before .
" Some vitamin C producers have stopped production " to limit the waste water emitted , explains Kong Tai , former CEO and now board member of Jiangshan Pharmaceutical , one of the four big producers .
" In some areas , the authorities limit the total amount of annual pollutant emission , so if you have reached that ceiling you cannot go on producing . "
" The government has gone from turning a blind eye to complete panic and has blitzed the largest companies they can find and told them to do something quickly , " adds David Townsend , the representative in China of DSM , which manufactures vitamins other than vitamin C in China .
" The vitamin C companies have been caught up in this , " he adds .
The Chinese may also have cost pressures .
One of the base materials for ascorbic acid is corn-based .
The US cash price of corn is up 44 percent this year , a result of increased use for ethanol .
Corn starch is used to make a form of glucose , some of which China imports to make vitamin C. China imports some of this base material .
" The Chinese are not insulated from it [ the price rise ] , " says Mr. Hepner .
Pollution controls and corn prices may not be the only factors in the rise , however .
Within the industry , says Mr. Townsend , " it is widely known that prices of the companies here tend to be very similar and price hikes tend to occur at the same time .
Certainly there is something going on … that leads to pushing prices up . "
The four major Chinese vitamin C producers are currently facing an antitrust suit filed in the Eastern District of New York by two US companies as a class action suit .
The suit alleges the four Chinese companies have established a cartel that " has affected hundreds of millions of dollars in commerce in products found in nearly every American household . "
Among court documents are records from the China Chamber of Commerce of Medicine & Health Products Importers and Exporters citing how manufacturers were able to reach a self - regulation agreement to control the quantity and pace of exports " to achieve the goal of stabilizing and raising export prices . "
The chamber makes no secret of its intentions on its website , where its regulations are posted .
Among the organization 's purposes , it says , is to " coordinate the import and export price " of pharmaceuticals " according to government authorization or the common requirements … of member companies . "
" If they are selling in China it is not an issue , but they are selling most of their production on the international market , so they fall under different jurisdictions , " says Townsend .
The Chinese companies named in the current antitrust case and a Chinese ministry have asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit .
That motion is pending .
The plaintiffs ' lawyer , William Isaacson of Boies , Schiller & Flexner in Washington , says the current tightening in supplies " is the same conspiracy that is addressed in our lawsuit and it's obvious it 's continuing . "
" I know nothing about the current situation , " says Joel Mitnick , a lawyer representing the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and a partner at Sidley Austin , a law firm .
He says the allegations in the lawsuit concern actions taken several years ago .
Stephen Bomse of Heller Ehrman in San Francisco , a lawyer for the companies , had no comment .
Ironically , the Chinese became the dominant exporters of vitamin C only after the US Department of Justice charged six Western companies with price fixing in 1999 .
The so - called " vitamin cartel , " which supplied 75 percent of the world 's vitamins , was convicted and ordered to pay $ 1.5 billion in fines and restitution .
Some executives received jail sentences .
One of the largest fines was against Hoffmann - LaRoche of Switzerland .
It eventually sold its vitamin subsidiary to DSM .
Until two years ago , DSM produced ascorbic acid in New Jersey .
But the market was flooded with Chinese - made vitamin C .
The price dropped to as low as $ 2 per kilo .
DSM shifted its production to Scotland .
While the firms of the " vitamin cartel " colluded , the Chinese vitamin C industry was growing .
Chinese leaders decided decades earlier that increased production of vitamins was critical to their countrymen 's health .
Chinese manufacturers were then well placed to take advantage of the breakup of the vitamin cartel , says Peter Kovacs , formerly CEO of NutraSweet Kelco and now a consultant to the food industry .
They moved into the world market , taking market share by cutting prices , he says .
The quick shift this year in the ascorbic - acid market is having a ripple effect on some distributors .
For example , the Shanghai Solidarity Chemical Industry Co. stopped dealing in ascorbic acid in May because the price was so unstable .
" Producers wo n't give you a price , " says Bruce Yin , the firm 's export sales manager .
" If they sign a contract today at one price and then the price rises , they need to re-set the price , so lots of distributors are not doing [ vitamin C ] business anymore . "
DSM , the only Western producer , says its Scottish factory can't keep up with demand .
" We 're getting all kinds of calls from people we have never dealt with , " says Alexander Filz , a spokesman in Basel , Switzerland .
" Something dramatic is going on . "

Teleportation , a concept popularised in the original Star Trek television series , is edging closer to reality through work being conducted by theorists from The University of Queensland and Australian National University .
Researchers from UQ's Australian Research Centre for Quantum Atom Optics ( Dr Ashton Bradley , Dr Simon Haine and Dr Murray Olsen ) and Australian National University ( Joseph Hope ) have proposed a new way of teleporting matter waves .
“ We propose a scheme which allows an atom laser beam to disappear at one location and reappear at another , ” Dr Bradley said .
“ We feel that our scheme is closer in spirit to the original fictional concept , ” Dr Haine said .
“ What differentiates our scheme from what is usually termed quantum teleportation is that our scheme does not require the sender and receiver to share entangled states , as there is no measurement step involved in sending the information .
" In this scheme the sender and receiver require a reservoir of extremely cold atoms , known as a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .
" BEC is a state of matter that occurs when atoms become very cold , ( about 100 billionths of a degree about absolute zero ) .
" Due to a phenomenon known as Bose - Enhancement , all the atoms like to act the same way .
This causes the atoms to act as one macroscopic matterwave , rather than a collection of individual atoms . ”
Dr Haine said that sending a pulse of atoms towards a trapped condensate ( BEC ) and illuminating them with a control laser beam , the atoms from the pulse were stimulated to act the same way as the atoms already trapped in the BEC .
This resulted in the emission of a photon .
As all the atoms in the BEC had a very well - defined momentum , the photons being emitted would follow the same direction and form a signal beam .
" We can arrange the position and momentum of each atom ( quantum information ) to be encoded onto the signal beam by carefully adjusting the intensity and wavelength of the control beam , ” Dr Haine said .
The signal beam is then sent to a second BEC , which is also illuminated with a control laser .
The atoms trapped in the BEC absorb the photon from the signal beam , and in turn are forced to emit the photon into the control beam .
Due to the momentum of releasing the photons , the atoms are kicked out of the BEC .
These atoms contain the quantum information of the original atomic pulse which has been transferred to the new pulse , effectively teleporting the original pulse of atoms .
" Our scheme is quite different from what is usually coined quantum teleportation because it gets around the need for the sender and receiver to share entanglement , as the quantum state to be teleported is never actually measured , " Dr Bradley said .
" As our scheme does n't rely on the quality of the entanglement , it may be possible to achieve more accurate teleportation via this method , " he said .
Dr Bradley said the team would now embark on more detailed calculations , which took into account more complicated effects including the effects of the atoms colliding with each other , which could degrade the fidelity of the teleportation .
Dr John Close at ANU also has plans to implement these experiments and related ones in the next few years .

Kamel Zaki lives in the 254 home community called " The Hamptons " in Sarasota , Florida .
Unhappy about some of the policies of the Homeowners Association , Zaki created a website to call attention to different issues in the community .
For example , Zaki 's website draws attention to the continued use of gas lampposts for every home , that burn night & day .
He wants to be able to change them to a more eco-friendly solar powered lamppost .
The HOA has told him that he has till the end of this month to remove the website , or face fines of $ 100 a day , and then a lien on his home .
Zaki , a retired Chase bank executive who left his native Egypt more than 30 years ago because of " the politics , " is outraged by what he sees as an assault on his freedom of speech .
" Where are we ? " he asked .
" This is America , still , is it not ? "
As it pertains to homeowners associations in Florida 's deed - restricted communities , however , the answer appears to be only a qualified yes .
In the absence of any specific regulatory oversight by the state , legal disputes involving homeowners associations tend to end up in civil court , where the sanctity of the deed restriction is typically upheld .
Zaki is willing to gamble as much as $ 10,000 on hiring legal representation to contest the fine and the Web site ban , but his wife , Eugenia , is nervous , because , as she says , " this is Florida , " and " you never know . "
So why is the Homeowners Association pissed about this website ?
How does it supposedly break the HOA covenant ?
[ HOA ] president John Bennett characterizes as necessary to put a stop to Zaki's " troublemaking " and maintain the integrity of what he called " our covenants . "
By these , Bennett means the basic rules of order that serve as a kind of constitution for The Hamptons homeowners association , including a ban on any commercial use of the property name .
Zaki's
Web site violates this covenant by " trying to sell an idea , " says Bennett -- the idea being that association management is performing inadequately and behaving badly .
This interpretation of the covenant & commercial use is most interesting .
Click on the link to this guy 's website .
There are no ads , and the site itself does n't sell anything .
Under the HOA 's interpretation of the covenant , a letter to the editor of a newspaper complaining about " The Hamptons " could theoretically be a violation .
How about having a clothesline ?
It 's claimed clothes dryers amount to about 6 % of the electricity consumed by households in the United States .
In order to be more efficient , some have tried returning to using the Sun , wind & a piece of rope tied between two points to dry their clothes on their own property .
And yet again , the lawn nazis have problems .
One neighbor asked if it was temporary .
Next came a phone call -- and then a series of letters -- from Brooks Resources .
The first letter , dated June 12 , warned that " laundry lines are not permitted in the Awbrey Butte Subdivision , " adding that " many owners in Awbrey Butte take great pride in their home and surrounding areas . "
Ms. Taylor responded two days later with a letter asserting that the rule is " outdated . "
She requested a change in the rules to " reflect our urgent need and responsibility to help global warming by encouraging energy conservation . "
The Awbrey Butte Architectural Review Committee " appreciates your desire to make a difference for the cause of global warming , " responded Brooks Resources Owner - Relations Manager Carol Haworth .
But she pointed out that homeowners agree to the rules before they buy their homes , " and therefore the ARC is required to uphold those guidelines as they now exist . "
The letter more sternly asked " that you discontinue this practice by July 9 , 2007 , to avoid legal action which will be taken after that date . "
Ms. Taylor responded by pointing out that the subdivision is " blatantly full of noncompliant owners " who display everything from plastic play equipment to exterior paint colors that do n't meet the requirement of " medium to dark tones . "
She added : " Who am I hurting by hanging clothes out to dry ? "
Brooks Resources repeated its threat of legal action , and then advised Ms. Taylor to " develop a plan to screen your outdoor laundry and submit the plan to the ARC for review . "
It also suggested the possibility of formal proceedings to get the rules amended , which would require 51 % of homeowners ' support in writing .
The following month , Ms. Taylor constructed a fabric screen to conceal her clothesline .
The committee , which included Brooks Resources Chairman Michael P. Hollern , gave it a thumbs down .
" It does n't blend with the home or the native surroundings , " says Ms. Haworth .
Mr. Hollern says , " Personally , I think people probably ought to screen their laundry from other people 's view .
If you feel differently , you should probably be living somewhere else . "
I understand that in theory a Homeowners Association is there to protect property values , but how many stories about busy bodies worrying about stupid shit does it take , until having your house as part of a Homeowners Association becomes a detriment to value ?
Stories like these .....
A superior court judge in Arizona vetoed an HOA 's plan to use Association dues to pay for an $ 8.5 million luxury community center , that would have required all homeowners to pay a one - time $ 6,020 payment .
.
Despite record drought & water restrictions , a Homeowners Association in North Carolina told its residents the grass must be green .
Revoked the 2nd Amendment in Tennessee .
Nevada just recently passed an HOA reform bill , that among other things banned HOAs from issuing speeding tickets or from banning the installation of window shutters .
The legislation was in response to incidents like these .....
First : A 30 - year - old woman with a seven - year - old daughter develops a degenerative bone disease , and is therefore forced to have a complete hysterectomy .
Because of this , her cad of a husband abandons her and their daughter .
She can move about her unit only with the use of a walker .
The attorney of record for the association she lives in is John Leach .
The poor girl receives fines , sometimes weekly , sometimes daily .
The offense – her walker makes too much noise .
Second : A 75 - year - old woman who is almost legally blind .
Her unit is in a very modest community .
Due to some trauma in her past , she suffers from what we now call " post - traumatic stress syndrome . "
Her only comfort is her dog .
Attorney John Leach writes to this woman on behalf of the association making a demand that this woman 's dog be taken to a veterinarian and weighed .
The association 's documents specify that no dog can weigh more than 35 pounds .
The dog weighs in at 42 pounds .
The woman is instructed to reduce the weight of the dog or remove it from the property .
The co-captain of a Georgia HOA went into a neighbor 's yard & ripped the flowers out .
The problem ?
The flowers were artificial .
" I just do n't think it 's fair that I can't come home to my yard and decorate it the way I want as long as I follow the covenant .
This is the covenant , I went throught it and I could n't find it , " says Freeman .
" I 'm not absolutely sure what the restrictions are , " says resident Bakia Weaver .
Freeman says she never got a warning about her flowers .
She 's even more upset that some of her neighbors still have their silk flowers in their front yards .
" I 'm taking it extremely personal because their silk flowers are still there and mine are not there , " Freeman says .
The president of the community management company tells Channel 2 that although nothing about silk flowers is written in the covenant , the homeowners association has aesthetic rights which are implied rights to maintain their property value .

The spokesman , Bill Burton , said Mr. Obama ’s broker bought the stocks without consulting the senator , under the terms of a blind trust that was being set up for the senator at that time but was not finalized until several months after the investments were made .
“ He went about this process to avoid an actual or apparent conflict of interest , and he had no knowledge of the stocks he owned , ” Mr. Burton said .
“ And when he realized that he did n’t have the level of blindness that he expected , he moved to terminate the trust . ”
Mr. Obama has made ethics a signature issue , and his quest for the presidency has benefited from the perception that he is unlike politicians who blend public and private interests .
There is no evidence that any of his actions ended up benefiting either company during the roughly eight months that he owned the stocks .
Even so , the stock purchases raise questions about how he could unwittingly come to invest in two relatively obscure companies , whose backers happen to include generous contributors to his political committees .
Among those donors was Jared Abbruzzese , a New York businessman now at the center of an F.B.I. inquiry into public corruption in Albany , who had also contributed to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , a group that sought to undermine John Kerry ’s Democratic presidential campaign in 2004 .
Mr. Obama , who declined to be interviewed about the stock deals , has already had to contend with a controversy that arose out of his reliance on a major campaign contributor in Chicago to help him in a personal financial transaction .
In that earlier case , he acknowledged last year that it had been a mistake to involve the contributor , a developer who has since been indicted in an unrelated political scandal , in deals related to the Obamas ’ purchase of a home .
Two major steps toward putting quantum computers into real practice — sending a photon signal on demand from a qubit onto wires and transmitting the signal to a second , distant qubit — have been brought about by a team of scientists at Yale .
The accomplishments are reported in sequential issues of Nature on September 20 and September 27 , on which it is highlighted as the cover along with complementary work from a group at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies .
Over the past several years , the research team of Professors Robert Schoelkopf in applied physics and Steven Girvin in physics has explored the use of solid - state devices resembling microchips as the basic building blocks in the design of a quantum computer .
Now , for the first time , they report that superconducting qubits , or artificial atoms , have been able to communicate information not only to their nearest neighbor , but also to a distant qubit on the chip .
This research now moves quantum computing from “ having information ” to “ communicating information . ”
In the past information had only been transferred directly from qubit to qubit in a superconducting system .
Schoelkopf and Girvin ’s team has engineered a superconducting communication ‘ bus ’ to store and transfer information between distant quantum bits , or qubits , on a chip .
This work , according to Schoelkopf , is the first step to making the fundamentals of quantum computing useful .
The first breakthrough reported is the ability to produce on demand — and control — single , discrete microwave photons as the carriers of encoded quantum information .
While microwave energy is used in cell phones and ovens , their sources do not produce just one photon .
This new system creates a certainty of producing individual photons .
“ It is not very difficult to generate signals with one photon on average , but , it is quite difficult to generate exactly one photon each time .
To encode quantum information on photons , you want there to be exactly one , ” according to postdoctoral associates Andrew Houck and David Schuster who are lead co-authors on the first paper .
“ We are reporting the first such source for producing discrete microwave photons , and the first source to generate and guide photons entirely within an electrical circuit , ” said Schoelkopf .
In order to successfully perform these experiments , the researchers had to control electrical signals corresponding to one single photon .
In comparison , a cell phone emits about 1023 ( 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ) photons per second .
Further , the extremely low energy of microwave photons mandates the use of highly sensitive detectors and experiment temperatures just above absolute zero .
“ In this work we demonstrate only the first half of quantum communication on a chip — quantum information efficiently transferred from a stationary quantum bit to a photon or ‘ flying qubit , ’ ” says Schoelkopf .
“ However , for on - chip quantum communication to become a reality , we need to be able to transfer information from the photon back to a qubit . ”
This is exactly what the researchers go on to report in the second breakthrough .
Postdoctoral associate Johannes Majer and graduate student Jerry Chow , lead co-authors of the second paper , added a second qubit and used the photon to transfer a quantum state from one qubit to another .
This was possible because the microwave photon could be guided on wires — similarly to the way fiber optics can guide visible light — and carried directly to the target qubit .
“ A novel feature of this experiment is that the photon used is only virtual , ” said Majer and Chow , “ winking into existence for only the briefest instant before disappearing . ”
To allow the crucial communication between the many elements of a conventional computer , engineers wire them all together to form a data “ bus , ” which is a key element of any computing scheme .
Together the new Yale research constitutes the first demonstration of a “ quantum bus ” for a solid - state electronic system .
This approach can in principle be extended to multiple qubits , and to connecting the parts of a future , more complex quantum computer .
However , Schoelkopf likened the current stage of development of quantum computing to conventional computing in the 1950 ’s , when individual transistors were first being built .
Standard computer microprocessors are now made up of a billion transistors , but first it took decades for physicists and engineers to develop integrated circuits with transistors that could be mass produced .

The strictness of Packer trips some people up , especially function declarations requiring a terminating semi-colon .
This is not a habit for many JavaScript programmers .
In this case I recommend using Julien Lecomte ’s compressor first and then running the code through Packer for base62 compression .
Remember that base62 compression is only necessary if you ca n’t use gzip .
If you ca n’t use gzip compression for some reason , then Packer with base62 encoding turned on , is the next best thing .
Scripts compressed with Packer are unpacked using one pass of a RegExp on most platforms .
However , this still introduces an overhead for larger scripts .
The “ Decode ” button on the Packer page will tell you how long the decode time is , typically 0 – 200 milliseconds .
The next release of Packer will improve the decode time by about 10 % .
Compressors with more complex compression algorithms can have very high decode times .
Both the YUI compressor and Packer use scoping wisely so that variable names are substituted with “ a ” , “ b ” and “ c ” etc all the way down .
This produces patterns that lead to more optimal gzip compression rates .
These JavaScript compressors are capable of shrinking variable and argument names :
The most efficient way to serve compressed JavaScript is to first run your code through a JavaScript compressor that shrinks variable and argument names , and then serve the resulting code using gzip compression .

Comment : # 1 You forgot the qooxdoo generator .
It is also capable in renaming variables to shorter ones like the other tools listed .
The generator is a python script which is easily installable cross-platform ( just require a standard python installation ) .
As it is based on a full - blown tokenizer and treegenerator it also safely supports semicolon - less code and regular expressions – areas where others often fail .
Another great feature is the string optimizer which lay out strings to a centrally stored array .
This dramatically improves the runtime performance in IE .
For further details have a look in the corresponding documentation .
Comment : # 2 “ it also safely supports semicolon - less code and regular expressions ”
The page you link to says “ The current implementation automatically removes comments , new lines , indents and other additional whitespaces from your files .
It keeps advanced code fragments like regular expressions , strings , … You just to make sure to add semicolons after each command . ”
Comment : # 3 I ’d love to see a comparison matrix among these three stripping libraries , various code bases and sizes , and their resultant gzip compressed sizes .
I ’ve been using Dojo ’s ShrinkSafe ( since it ’s as agnostic about my syntax as a browser ) , and it does variable renaming with an _hexadecimal strategy .
I ’m curious how it stands against Packer and YUI compressor .
I can offer my assistance with the ShrinkSafe part .

Can someone else comment on this ?
Comment : # 9 Note : there are some trap in the shrinking of variable name .
We should pay attention to the “ eval ” and “ with ” statement .
In generally , “ eval ” may refer to any variable in the outer functions which make all those names unchangable , and all var name in the scope of “ with ” statement can not be shrink , because it may refer to the property of the withObj .
Some compression tools have problems in eval and with , so please consider JSA — a great product form my friend Jingdw .

Comment : # 10 FYI : I have a LZ77 - algorithm - based JavaScript compressor : http://demo.java2script.org/lz77js/
In most cases , this compressor compresses JavaScript at the ratio of 40%~60 % .
It can be used as a general compressor with JavaScript options turned off .
It is not designed to compressed large JavaScript ( >200 k ) .
Large JavaScript ’s decompressing takes too much time on concatenating the original string .
gzip is recommended for large JavaScript .
Comment : # 11 @Observer : Yes , this is not really needed in nearly any cases .
Infact I do n’t know about a case where a missing semicolon results into problems .
It is always better to have some .
This is more or less meant as a suggestion .

Comment : # 14
A feature request I have for all JS compressors would be the ability to upload multiple files so that variables declared in one may map up to variables defined in other files when the compressors automatically rename the variables .
Yes , I know that for optimal compression one should have only one JavaScript file per page , but this is not always possible .
Where I work we use the Prototype Window Class , which creates stylized iframes to give our popup an XP - like look .
These are instances where an iframe will reference a variable defined in the main window using top , which would obviously be renamed to a different variable name if we ran each JS file through the compressor on an individual basis .
Comment : # 15 I use a lint - tool to check for comma’s .

Comment : # 19 @ 12 Some gzipped Files do n’t working in IE .
Then a failure message appears and the window closes .
Comment : # 20 I pulled together this nice simple script that is based off the PHP port of the packer , and the web application demo that comes with YUI - Compressor , to make something that i dubbed , “ yui - packer ” .
It ’s a simple script , that runs your scripts through the yui compressor which magically compresses your scripts ( to some extent ) before running it through the packer algorithim .

Comment : # 24 @ Johann
There are two basic problems that one might encounter :
– HTML pages may only partially appear , or the pages may not appear at all .
– Your HTTP connection may stop responding .
Comment : # 25 @antimatter15 : The following safeScript ( ) function I ’ve put together does what I think you were aiming for and is fully cross - browser ( including IE 4 & NS 4 ) : function safeScript ( code ) { return ( /\(.*\) \s*\{( [ \w\W\s ] *)\}/).exec(new Function ( code ) .toString ( ) ) [ 1 ] ; }
Comment : # 26 Nice work , but it ’s got a flaw ( though not an outright bug ) .
This version of Packer does not correctly handle for / in syntax , like the following : for ( key in data ) // do something with key “ key ” is not recognized as a new variable name and left as is .
Comment : # 27 Nice tips .
I only moderately use JavaScript .
Do you normally compress all of your code on only when it reaches a certain size ?
Seems like compression would add more overhead then its worth with smaller files .
Comment : # 28 Hello Dean , I have used MooTools compressed with your packer using eval .
Now I experienced Unresponsive script prompts occasionally on my site in FireFox .
Since I just used the variable shrinking and remove unnecessary whitespace / comments ( without eval ) , I have not since seen the error .
So does this mean eval can mean longer execution times , even though the file is smaller ?
Thanks !

Comment : # 32
You say those three packers are capable of shrinking variables , but when inputting a simple line of javascript : function t( ) { var blah =4 ; } None of them ( not even packer 3.0 ! ) shrink the “ blah ” variable ??
I would expect it to become : var a=4 ;
Or something like that …
Comment : # 33 @ Thany – Packer does shrink the blah variable .
The output is : function t( ) {var a=4}
Comment : # 34 Jordy / Jediknil .
Do you mean that it ’s not rewriting the key variable to a shorter ( a ) variable ?
In that case , it is because you ’re not using “ var ” to create the variable .
As such the variable you ’re making is global , and therefore not shrunk .
A variable defined in the start of a for loop is also accessible to the rest of the script on its level , so something like : var test = [ 0,1,2 ] ; for ( var key in test ) {} ; alert ( key ) ;
Will result in an alert with a 2 .
In my experience , I ’ve not come upon a case where Packer appears to handle these incorrectly .
But then I ’ve not used it that extensively .

I have some problems to find the difference between a regular expression and operator of a division .

How I can to know / b> 1 ) a=a / is not a regexp ?
Should I the find the char after this ( if is not a comment ) and , if it ’s not a quotes , number or var , I accept this as a regexp ?
or is there a way shorter ?

Comment : # 42 I used to be one of those people that wrote code with lines of 100 + characters long .
Just putting all on one line so that every line break would be preceded by a semicolon .
Recently I finally bought the argument of that being a bad habit because of readability
So now my scripts contain multiple string concatenations that could be merged easily saving a hefty ( ahum ) 3 bytes each .
Perhaps packer 3.1 could support this Example : var blah =
‘ Some string that spans ‘ + ‘ multiple lines but could be ‘ + ‘ merged into one long string when ‘ + ‘ packed … ’;
To become : var blah =
‘ Some string that spans multiple lines but could be merged into one long string when packed …’;
Thanks

Reliance on abstinence - only sex education as the primary tool to reduce teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases — as favored by the Bush administration and conservatives in Congress — looks increasingly foolish and indefensible .
The abstinence - only campaign has always been driven more by ideology than by sound public health policy .
The program ’s tight rules , governing states that accept federal matching funds and community organizations that accept federal grants , forbid the promotion of contraceptive use and require teaching that sex outside marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects .
At least nine states , by one count , have decided to give up the federal matching funds rather than submit to dictates that undermine sensible sex education .
Now there is growing evidence that the programs have no effect on children ’s sexual behavior .
A Congressionally mandated report issued this month by the Mathematica Policy Research firm found that elementary and middle school students in four communities who received abstinence instruction — sometimes on a daily basis — were just as likely to have sex in the following years as students who did not get such instruction .
Those who became sexually active — about half of each group — started at the same age ( 14.9 years on average ) and had the same number of sexual partners .
The chief caveat is that none of the four programs studied continued the abstinence instruction into high school , the most sexually active period for most teenagers , so it is not known whether more sustained abstinence education would show more effectiveness .
The Lobby and U.S. Middle East Policy
The lobby 's political power is important not because it affects what presidential candidates say during a campaign , but because it has a significant influence on American foreign policy , especially in the Middle East .
America 's actions in that volatile region have enormous consequences for people all around the world , especially the people who live there .
Just consider how the Bush administration 's misbegotten war in Iraq has affected the long - suffering people of that shattered country : tens of thousands dead , hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes , and a vicious sectarian war taking place with no end in sight .
The war has also been a strategic disaster for the United States and has alarmed and endangered U.S. allies both inside and outside the region .
One could hardly imagine a more vivid or tragic demonstration of the impact the United States can have - for good or ill - when it unleashes the power at its disposal .
The United States has been involved in the Middle East since the early days of the Republic , with much of the activity centered on educational programs or missionary work .
For some , a biblically inspired fascination with the Holy Land and the role of Judaism in its history led to support for the idea of restoring the Jewish people to a homeland there , a view that was embraced by certain religious leaders and , in a general way , by a few U.S. politicians .
But it is a mistake to see this history of modest and for the most part private engagement as the taproot of America 's role in the region since World War II , and especially its extraordinary relationship with Israel today .
Between the routing of the Barbary pirates two hundred years ago and World War II , the United States played no significant security role anywhere in the region and U.S. leaders did not aspire to one .
Woodrow Wilson did endorse the 1917 Balfour Declaration ( which expressed Britain 's support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine ) , but Wilson did virtually nothing to advance this goal .
Indeed , the most significant U.S. involvement during this period - a fact - finding mission dispatched to the region in 1919 by the Paris Peace Conference under the leadership of Americans Henry Churchill King and Charles Crane - concluded that the local population opposed continued Zionist inroads and recommended against the establishment of an independent Jewish homeland .
Yet as the historian Margaret Macmillan notes , " Nobody paid the slightest attention . "
The possibility of a U.S. mandate over portions of the Middle East was briefly considered but never pursued , and Britain and France ended up dividing the relevant portions of the Ottoman Empire between themselves .
The United States has played an important and steadily increasing role in Middle East security issues since World War II , driven initially by oil , then by anticommunism and , over time , by its growing relationship with Israel .
America 's first significant involvement in the security politics of the region was a nascent partnership with Saudi Arabia in the mid-1940s ( intended by both parties as a check on British ambitions in the region ) , and its first formal alliance commitments were Turkey 's inclusion in NATO in 1952 and the anti-Soviet Baghdad Pact in 1954 .
After backing Israel 's founding in 1948 , U.S. leaders tried to strike a balanced position between Israel and the Arabs and carefully avoided making any formal commitment to the Jewish state for fear of jeopardizing more important strategic interests .
This situation changed gradually over the ensuing decades , in response to events like the Six - Day War , Soviet arms sales to various Arab states , and the growing influence of pro-Israel groups in the United States .
Given this dramatic transformation in America 's role in the region , it makes little sense to try to explain current U.S. policy - and especially the lavish support that is now given to Israel - by referring to the religious beliefs of a bygone era or the radically different forms of past American engagement .
There was nothing inevitable or predetermined about the current special relationship between the United States and Israel .
Since the Six - Day War of 1967 , a salient feature - and arguably the central focus - of America 's Middle East policy has been its relationship with Israel .
For the past four decades , in fact , the United States has provided Israel with a level of material and diplomatic support that dwarfs what it provides to other countries .
That aid is largely unconditional : no matter what Israel does , the level of support remains for the most part unchanged .
In particular , the United States consistently favors Israel over the Palestinians and rarely puts pressure on the Jewish state to stop building settlements and roads in the West Bank .
Although Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush openly favored the creation of a viable Palestinian state , neither was willing to use American leverage to make that outcome a reality .
The United States has also undertaken policies in the broader Middle East that reflected Israel 's preferences .
Since the early 1990s , for example , American policy toward Iran has been heavily influenced by the wishes of successive Israeli governments .
Tehran has made several attempts in recent years to improve relations with Washington and settle outstanding differences , but Israel and its American supporters have been able to stymie any dÈtente between Iran and the United States , and to keep the two countries far apart .
Another example is the Bush administration 's behavior during Israel 's war against Lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
Almost every country in the world harshly criticized Israel 's bombing campaign - a campaign that killed more than one thousand Lebanese , most of them civilians - but the United States did not .
Instead , it helped Israel prosecute the war , with prominent members of both political parties openly defending Israel 's behavior .
This unequivocal support for Israel undermined the pro-American government in Beirut , strengthened Hezbollah , and drove Iran , Syria , and Hezbollah closer together , results that were hardly good for either Washington or Jerusalem .
Many policies pursued on Israel 's behalf now jeopardize U.S. national security .
The combination of unstinting U.S. support for Israel and Israel 's prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory has fueled anti-Americanism throughout the Arab and Islamic world , thereby increasing the threat from international terrorism and making it harder for Washington to deal with other problems , such as shutting down Iran 's nuclear program .
Because the United States is now so unpopular within the broader region , Arab leaders who might otherwise share U.S. goals are reluctant to help us openly , a predicament that cripples U.S. efforts to deal with a host of regional challenges .
This situation , which has no equal in American history , is due primarily to the activities of the Israel lobby .
While other special interest groups - including ethnic lobbies representing Cuban Americans , Irish Americans , Armenian Americans , and Indian Americans - have managed to skew U.S. foreign policy in directions that they favored , no ethnic lobby has diverted that policy as far from what the American national interest would otherwise suggest .
The Israel lobby has successfully convinced many Americans that American and Israeli interests are essentially identical .
In fact , they are not .
One of the hot new features introduced with Windows 95 was the Windows Registry .
The Windows Registry offered a centralized database - like location to store application and system settings .
No more plain text .INI files splattered all over your system .
Instead , issue a few easy API calls and your application settings are safely nestled away deep inside the registry hive .
But after living with the Windows Registry for more than a decade , I 'm starting to wonder if we were better off with those .INI files .
I understand the need to store truly system - wide settings in one place .
Let the operating system store settings however it deems fit .
The real problem with the registry is that it was exposed to the outside world .
Instead of being a secure , central hive for only the most essential and global settings , over time the registry has slowly become a trash heap of miscellaneous junk settings for every rinky - dink application on the planet .
Woe to the poor computer user who naively attempts to manipulate the filesystem without first supplicating to the Registry Gods .
Manipulating the filesystem is utterly obvious , completely intuitive , and unfortunately also the fastest way to break an application in Windows .
You have to reconcile almost everything you do in the filesystem with that opaque , unforgiving binary blob of data known as the Windows Registry .
For instance , when I upgrade and reinstall Windows , most of the games I have installed on my secondary drive are instantly broken because they store cd-key and ( redundant ) path information in the registry .
The game vendors ' support teams will tell you to reinstall all your games and patches .
Personally , I 'd rather search forums and spelunk through the registry to manually recreate the two or three registry keys the game is looking for .
My life would be a heck of a lot easier if per-application settings were stored in a place I could easily see them , manipulate them , and back them up .
Like , say ... in INI files .
There is an alternative , though .
If Windows applications were n't so busy mindlessly piling all their settings on the registry garbage dump with everyone else , they could elect to follow the new , much saner Windows Vista conventions for storing application - specific data :
/ Users/Jeff/AppData/Local /Users/Jeff/AppData/LocalLow /Users/Jeff/AppData/Roaming
Local and LocalLow are for bits of application data that are truly machine - specific .
Roaming is for non-machine specific settings that will follow the user .
That 's where the lion 's share of the application settings will be .
It 's all explained in the Roaming User Data Deployment Guide ( Word doc ) .
However , these are still user - specific settings , obviously , as they 're under the / Users folder .
I can't find any new Windows filesystem convention for system level , non-user - specific settings .
I suppose that 's still Ye Olde Registry by default .
It is possible to write Windows applications that do n't use the registry in any way .
These are some of my favorite applications .
But they 're also the most rare and precious of all applications in the Windows software ecosystem .
Over time , it 's fair to say that I 've grown to hate the Windows Registry .
How do I hate it ?
Let me count the ways :
The registry is a single point of failure .
That 's why every single registry editing tip you 'll ever find starts with a big fat screaming disclaimer about how you can break your computer with regedit .
.
That 's why every single registry editing tip you 'll ever find starts with a .
The registry is opaque and binary .
As much as I dislike the angle bracket tax , at least XML config files are reasonably human - readable , and they allow as many comments as you see fit .
.
As much as I dislike the angle bracket tax , at least XML config files are reasonably human - readable , and they allow as many comments as you see fit .
The registry has to be in sync with the filesystem .
Delete an application without " uninstalling " it and you 're left with stale registry cruft .
Or if an app has a poorly written uninstaller .
The filesystem is no longer the statement of record -- it has to be kept in sync with the registry somehow .
It 's a total violation of the DRY principle .

The filesystem is no longer the statement of record -- it has to be kept in sync with the registry somehow .
It 's a total violation of the DRY principle .
The registry is monolithic .
Let 's say you wanted to move an application to a different path on your machine , or even to a different machine altogether .
Good luck extracting the relevant settings for that one particular application from the giant registry tarball .
A given application typically has dozens of settings strewn all over the registry .
What 's depressing about all of this is how prescient the UNIX conventions are in retrospect .
How many billions of man-hours could we have saved by now if some early Windows NT 3.0 or 3.5 developers had decided to turn off public access to the registry , and transparently redirected the public registry API calls so they followed simpler , UNIX - like filesystem storage conventions instead ?
The black piece of paper can power a small light
They have produced a sample slightly larger than a postage stamp that can store enough energy to illuminate a small light bulb .
But the ambition is to produce reams of paper that could one day power a car .
Professor Robert Linhardt , of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , said the paper battery was a glimpse into the future of power storage .
The team behind the versatile paper , which stores energy like a conventional battery , says it can also double as a capacitor capable of releasing sudden energy bursts for high - power applications .
While a conventional battery contains a number of separate components , the paper battery integrates all of the battery components in a single structure , making it more energy efficient .
Integrated devices
The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
" Think of all the disadvantages of an old TV set with tubes , " said Professor Linhardt , from the New York - based institute , who co-authored a report into the technology .
" The warm up time , power loss , component malfunction ; you do n't get those problems with integrated devices .
When you transfer power from one component to another you lose energy .
But you lose less energy in an integrated device . "
You can implant a piece of paper in the body and blood would serve as an electrolyte
Professor Robert Linhardt
The battery contains carbon nanotubes , each about one millionth of a centimetre thick , which act as an electrode .
The nanotubes are embedded in a sheet of paper soaked in ionic liquid electrolytes , which conduct the electricity .
The flexible battery can function even if it is rolled up , folded or cut .
Although the power output is currently modest , Professor Linhardt said that increasing the output should be easy .
" If we stack 500 sheets together in a ream , that 's 500 times the voltage .
If we rip the paper in half we cut power by 50 % .
So we can control the power and voltage issue . "
Because the battery consists mainly of paper and carbon , it could be used to power pacemakers within the body where conventional batteries pose a toxic threat .
" I would n't want the ionic liquid electrolytes in my body , but it works without them , " said Professor Linhardt .
" You can implant a piece of paper in the body and blood would serve as an electrolyte . "
But Professor Daniel Sperling at University of California , Davis , an expert on alternative power sources for transport , is unconvinced .
' More difficult '
" Batteries and capacitors are being steadily improved , but electricity storage is much more difficult and expensive than liquid fuels and probably will be so forever , " he said .
" The world is not going to change as a result of this new invention any time soon . "
Professor Linhardt admitted that the new battery is still some way from the commercial market .
" The devices we 're making are only a few inches across .
We would have to scale up to sheets of newspaper size to make it commercially viable , " he said .
But at that scale , the voltage could be large enough to power a car , he said .
However , carbon nanotubes are very expensive , and batteries large enough to power a car are unlikely to be cost effective .
" I'm a strong enthusiast of electric vehicles , but it is going to take time to bring the costs down , " said Professor Sperling .
But Professor Linhardt said integrated devices , like the paper battery , were the direction the world was moving .
" They are ultimately easier to manufacture , more environmentally friendly and usable in a wide range of devices , " he said .
The ambition is to produce the paper battery using a newspaper - type roller printer .
1 GUNKANJIMA ( Japan ) : the Ghost ( and forbidden ) Island
Gunkanjima is one among 505 uninhabited islands in the Nagasaki Prefecture about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki itself .
The island was populated from 1887 to 1974 as a coal mining facility .
The island ’s most notable features are the abandoned concrete buildings and the sea wall surrounding it .
It is known for its coal mines and their operation during the industrialization of Japan .
Mitsubishi bought the island in 1890 and began the project , the aim of which was retrieving coal from the bottom of the sea .
They built Japan ’s first large concrete building , a block of apartments in 1916 to accommodate their burgeoning ranks of workers , and to protect against typhoon destruction .
In 1959 , its population density was 835 people per hectare for the whole island , or 1,391 per hectare for the residential district , one of the highest population density ever recorded worldwide .
As petroleum replaced coal in Japan in the 1960s , coal mines began shutting down all over the country , and Hashima ’s mines were no exception .
Mitsubishi officially announced the closing of the mine in 1974 , and today it is empty and bare , which is why it ’s called the Ghost Island .
Travel to Hashima is currently prohibited .
2 SURTSEY ( Iceland ) :
The emerging island
Off the coast of Iceland on the morning of 14 November 1963 , the crew of a lone fishing trawler spotted an alarming sight .
Off to the southwest of the Ísleifur II , a column of dark smoke was rising from the water .
Concerned that it could be another boat on fire , the captain directed his vessel towards the scene .
Once there , however , they found not a boat but a series of violent explosions producing ash .
This was an unmistakable indication of a volcanic eruption taking place underwater , close to the surface .
Very aware of the potential danger but eager to watch , the crew kept their boat nearby .
It was indeed a remarkable event that they would witness a small part of over the course of that morning : the formation of a brand - new island .
Although now quite visible , the eruption lasted for much , much longer than the Ísleifur II would have been able to watch .
After several days , the volcano had broken the water ’s surface , forming an island over 500 meters long and 45 meters tall .
Even though the rough tides of the North Atlantic might have soon eroded the new island away , it was named Surtsey , meaning ‘ Surtur ’s island ’ – Surtur ( or Surtr ) being a fire giant of Norse mythology .
The island proved to be tenacious , however .
The eruption was ongoing and Surtsey increased in size more quickly than the ocean could wear it down .
In the meantime two other nearby volcanic eruptions produced the beginnings of islands , but neither lasted very long .
By April 1964 , though , the most violent parts of the eruption were over and Surtsey remained .
It was fairly clear that it was going to be a permanent island – or at least as permanent as anything can be in geology .
The explosions returned in August 1966 , and only stopped when the entire eruption finally came to an end in June 1967 .
Since then , the volcano has lain dormant .
The island was left 174 meters tall and about 2.8 square kilometers in size .
At 33 kilometers south of the mainland , it also marked the new southernmost point of Iceland .
3 PALM ISLANDS ( Dubai ) : the palm - shaped man-made island
The Palm Islands in Dubai are the three largest artificial islands in the world .
They are being constructed by Nakheel Properties , a property developer in the United Arab Emirates , who hired the Dutch dredging and marine contractor Van Oord , one of the world ’s specialists in land reclamation .
The islands are The Palm Jumeirah , The Palm Jebel Ali and The Palm Deira .
The Islands are located off the coast of The United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and will add 520 km of beaches to the city of Dubai .
The first two islands will comprise approximately 100 million cubic meters of rock and sand .
Palm Deira will be composed of approximately 1 billion cubic meters of rock and sand .
All materials will be quarried in the UAE .
Between the three islands there will be over 100 luxury hotels , exclusive residential beach side villas and apartments , marinas , water theme parks , restaurants , shopping malls , sports facilities and health spas .
The creation of The Palm Jumeirah began in June 2001 .
Shortly after , The Palm Jebel Ali was announced and reclamation work began .
In 2004 , The Palm Deira , which will be almost as large in size as Paris , was announced .
Palm Jumeirah is currently open for development .
Construction will be completed over the next 10 - 15 years .
4 SEALAND ( Principality ) : World ’s smallest island
The Principality of Sealand is an island and a micronation located on HM Fort Roughs , a former Maunsell Sea Fort located in the North Sea 10 km ( six miles ) off the coast of Suffolk , England , in what is claimed as territorial waters using a twelve - nautical - mile radius .
Since 1967 , the installation has been occupied by associates and family of Paddy Roy Bates , a former radio broadcaster and former British Army Major , who claims that it is a sovereign and independent state .
Critics , as well as court rulings in the United States and in Germany , have claimed that Roughs Tower has always remained the property of the United Kingdom , a view that is disputed by the Bates family .
The population of the facility rarely exceeds ten , and its habitable area is 550 m2 ( 5920 sq ft ) .
Sealand ’s claims to sovereignty and legitimacy are not recognised by any country , yet it is sometimes cited in debates as an interesting case study of how various principles of international law can be applied to a territorial dispute .
5 EASTER ISLAND ( Polynesian triangle , Chile ) : world heritage site and one of the most isolated inhabited islands in history
Easter Island is one of the world ’s most isolated inhabited islands .
It is 3,600 km ( 2,237 miles ) west of continental Chile and 2,075 km ( 1,290 miles ) east of Pitcairn .
Nowdays , it is a Chilean - governed island , and is a world heritage site with much of the island protected by the Rapa Nui National Park .
First settled by a small party of Polynesians , Easter Island is one of the youngest inhabited territories on Earth , and for most of its history it was the most isolated inhabited territory on Earth .
Its inhabitants the Rapanui have endured famines , epidemics , civil war , slave raids and colonialism ; have seen their population crash on more than one occasion , and created a cultural legacy that has brought them fame out of all proportion to their numbers .
6 MALDIVE ISLANDS : the paradisiac island nation with 1,192 islets
The Maldives is an island nation consisting of a group of atolls in the Indian Ocean .
The Maldives is located south of India ’s Lakshadweep islands , and about seven hundred kilometers ( 435 mi ) south - west of Sri Lanka .
The Maldives ’ twenty - six atolls encompass a territory featuring 1,192 islets , roughly two hundred of which are inhabited by local communities .
Originally the inhabitants were Buddhist , but Islam was introduced in 1153 .
It later became a Portuguese ( 1558 ) , Dutch ( 1654 ) , and British ( 1887 ) colonial possession .
In 1965 , the Maldives obtained independence from Britain ( originally under the name “ Maldive Islands ” ) , and in 1968 the Sultanate was replaced by a Republic .
However , in thirty - eight years , the Maldives have seen only two Presidents , though political restrictions have loosened somewhat recently .
The Maldives is the smallest Asian country in terms of population .
It is also the smallest predominantly Muslim nation in the world .
7 THE WORLD ISLANDS ( Dubai ) : man -made islands in the form of a world map
Ever wish the world was smaller ?
The World is a man-made archipelago of 300 islands in the shape of a world map .
The World is being built primarily using sand dredged from the sea .
Each island ranges from 23,000 m2 to 84,000 m2 ( 250,000 – 900,000 square feet or 5.7 –21 acres ) in size , with 50 – 100 m of water between each island .
The development will cover an area of 9 km in length and 6 km in width , surrounded by an oval breakwater .
The only means of transport between the islands will be by boat and helicopter .
Prices for the islands will range from $ 15 - 45 million ( USD ) .
The average price for an island will be around $ 25 million ( USD ) .
Dredging started in 2004 and as of March of 2007 The World is around 90 % complete .
According to the National Geographic Channel ( The Best of Megastructures ) the overall price for the World is $ 14 Billion US Dollars .
8 ALCATRAZ ISLAND ( USA ) : home to the first lighthouse on the Pacific Coast
Alcatraz Island ( sometimes informally referred to as simply Alcatraz or by its pop-culture name , The Rock ) is a small island located in the middle of San Francisco Bay in California , United States .
It served as a lighthouse , then a military fortification , then a military prison followed by a federal prison until 1963 , when it became a national recreation area .
The first European to discover the island was Juan de Ayala in 1775 , who charted the San Francisco Bay and named the island “ La Isla de los Alcatraces ” , which means “ Island of the Pelicans ” .
The discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought thousands of ships to San Francisco Bay , creating an urgent need for a navigational lighthouse .
In response , Alcatraz lighthouse # 1 was erected and lit in the summer of 1853 .
Because of its natural isolation in the middle of a bay , surrounded by cold water and strong sea currents , Alcatraz was soon considered by the U.S. Army as an ideal location for holding captives .
Alcatraz was the Army ’s first long - term prison , and it was already beginning to build its reputation as a tough detention facility by exposing inmates to harsh conditions and iron fisted discipline .
Due to rising operational costs because of its location , the Military Department decided to close this famous prison in 1934 , and it was subsequently taken over by the Department of Justice and later became the famous federal prision and finally a recreation area .
Not a good day for Cheney over at the Libby trial ( which is being liveblogged at FDL by Marcy Wheeler aka " Emptywheel " ) .
The prosecution blames Cheney for the Plame leak ( with Libby lying to cover for his boss ) , while the defense blames -- the White House ( I guess the vice - president works out of an office in Iowa or something ) .
From Marcy 's quick notes on the defense 's opening statement :
Mr. Libby was not concerned about losing his job .
He was concerned about being set up .
He was concerned about being the scapegoat .
Mr. Libby said to the VP , " I think the WH , people are trying to set me up , people want me to be the scapegoat .
people in the WH want me to protect Karl Rove . " [...]
Cheney made notes of what Libby said .
Notes show Libby telling VP that he was not involved in leak .
[ oops , Wells , accidentally said , " not involved in leak to Karl Rove . "
Cheney 's note : " Not going to protect one staffer and sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others . "
The person who was to be protected was Karl Rove .
Karl Rove was President Bush 's right hand person .
Karl Rove was the person most responsible for making sure Bush stayed in office .
He had to be protected .
No matter which story you choose to believe -- the prosecutors or the defense -- they both paint a bleak picture for the administration .
A veritable cornucopia of incompetence .
It must be tough being a winger today .
The early revelations are so explosive , in fact , that the " R " word is being thrown around regarding Cheney .
Norah O'Donnell is asking Andy Card and Leon Panetta if the president is going to have to ask Dick Cheney to resign as a result of what 's being alleged at the Libby Trial .
( They both punted . )
As Digby notes , this will stir the Right Wing Noise Machine into action .
If that 's the beltway chatter , look for the Republican noise machine to go into high gear .
I 'll be expecting to hear rumors of Patrick Fitzgerald 's affinity for bestiality starting tomorrow --- mostly from Mary matalin , Dick Cheney 's most vicious attack dog , who will be snarling like a caged beast over this ( and thus will show herself an expert on the subject . )
Emptywheel 's book on the whole sordid affair , Anatomy of Deceit , ships next week .
( It 's the first book from Vaster Books , a joint venture between me and FDL's Jane Hamsher . )
For Northeastern University computer scientists Gene Cooperman and Daniel Kunkle , Rubik ’s Cube is n’t a game — it ’s the ultimate combinatorial puzzle , and their solution promises to improve all our lives .
When a Rubik ’s speed champion solves the cube , he ’s just solving one version of many possible mixed - up states the cube could be in .
But what ’s the quickest way to solve any possible cube ?
The answer is n’t easy , Kunkle points out :
The cube has 43 quintillion possible states , and evaluating them all is a big task .
One such computation took 8,000 central processing unit hours ( equal to running a home computer for an entire year ) and generated 120 terabytes of data .
“ The basic line of attack is to break it down into subproblems , and then you prove those optimally , ” says Kunkle .
He and Cooperman used supercomputers and mathematical group theory to solve all possible states of the cube in 26 moves .
Granted , that ’s not exactly an earth - shattering improvement over the previous record of 27 moves .
But Cooperman and Kunkle say their particular method for searching and enumerating states of the cube can be applied to even bigger problems .
The methods they used to explore the countless routes to a Rubik ’s Cube solution could also be used to identify the best flight schedule or the fastest way to route phone calls .
Report to ISSE meeting in Warsaw : Nationalism and internationalism in Poland
By Marius Heuser
7 June 2007
The following contribution by Marius Heuser , a member of the executive committee of the Socialist Equality Party ( Germany ) , was delivered at the first meeting of the International Students for Social Equality ( ISSE ) in Poland on May 19 in Warsaw .
We meet here today to discuss the war in Iraq , the preparations for war against Iran and above all the need for an internationalist and socialist perspective against war .
I will concentrate my remarks on the latter issues , and in particular the experiences with nationalism in Poland , because this question has played a central role in the discussions I have held at universities here .
The Iraq war is a brutal and cruel war .
An estimated 655,000 Iraqis have been killed up to June 2006 as a result of the war and occupation .
In addition , more than 3,400 American soldiers have died .
The names Fallujah and Abu Ghraib have become international synonyms for torture and contempt for human rights .
At the same time , all the reasons stated for the war — the allegations of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq ’s supposed links to Al Qaeda — have turned out to be absurd lies fabricated in order to provide a pretext for the war .
There can be no talk of a struggle for democracy under such conditions .
In reality , the Iraq war represents the attempt to strengthen the supremacy of the US and its allies in the Middle East and the Caspian region through military means .
These regions have the world ’s largest oil fields and will therefore play a crucial strategic role over the next several decades in the struggle of the great powers for the redivision of the world .
The ruthless actions of the US arise directly from its economic weakness .
The former linchpin of world capitalism now rests on unstable and fragile capital inflows from other countries , has an unprecedented level of indebtedness , and increasingly relies on various forms of financial speculation and manipulation .
Washington is using its military superiority to compensate for this weakness and strengthen its position against its competitors .
This driving force is also the reason that the disaster in Iraq has not diminished the danger of an escalation of violence .
On the contrary , the danger is increased .
The US cannot reconcile itself with a defeat in Iraq under any circumstances .
It plans to pre-empt this through a possible military strike against Iran , in an attempt to bring the entire region under its control .
Only a few weeks ago , US Vice President Dick Cheney made clear threats against Iran when he spoke aboard an aircraft carrier stationed in the Persian Gulf .
He said that the US would use all means possible to prevent Iran from developing an atomic bomb .
The claim that Iran would soon be able to build an atomic bomb inevitably recalls the lies with which the Bush administration justified the war against Iraq .
The aircraft carrier from which Cheney made his speech is a component of the military threat the US has assembled against Iran and was only stationed in the Persian Gulf together with other forces in December last year .
The attack on Iraq brought the American elite into fierce dispute with its European and Asian competitors .
A military strike against Iran , however , poses a much more serious threat to the vital interests of China , Russia and Europe .
These powers have close trade relations with Iran and fear they might completely lose their influence in the Middle East .
The conflicts that might result could unleash a new world conflagration and inevitably presage an international arms race .
Mankind is threatened by a worldwide outbreak of military violence such as has not been seen since the bloody events of the First and Second World Wars .
The fundamental cause of war lies in the geopolitical and economic tensions resulting from the reactionary system of capitalist nation states .
The United States is not the only country that is pursuing its broad expansionistic interests around the globe .
The race for control of resources between the various capitalist powers — the US , Japan , Australia , Russia and the European powers — is seriously aggravating inter-imperialist contradictions .
The Polish government of the Kaczynski brothers unreservedly supports Washington ’s war policies , even against the will of the vast majority of its own population .
With 900 Polish soldiers already in Iraq , some 1,188 Polish soldiers will be stationed in Afghanistan by the end of May .
Further Polish troops are fighting in Lebanon against Hezbollah .
The decision to approve an American anti-missile defence system being stationed on Polish soil again shows the government ’s loyalty to the US .
When in February of this year , the then - Defence Minister Radek Sikorski spoke out somewhat too harshly against his American negotiation partners , he was immediately suspended from office .
Solidarity with the US enables the Polish elite to push through their own interests in Europe .
The country , however , faces a dilemma :
On the one hand , since 1989 the Polish economy has been closely tied to the European Union , which accounts for 75 percent of all imported goods and 60 percent of exports .
In order to meet future energy requirements , Poland is dependent on gas and oil that largely comes from Russia .
On the other hand , the EU and Russia threaten Polish efforts to become an eastern European regional power .
The Warsaw elite fears that a united Europe partnered with Russia would condemn Poland to insignificance .
This is why Poland has tried to develop its influence in eastern Europe since 1989 .
The massive support given to the so - called Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the constant attacks on Belarus are examples of this .
The energy conference held last weekend has again made clear this dilemma .
President Putin ’s invitation on the same day that was extended to the Kazhak president Nazarbayev made clear that Russia will not accept Poland ’s plans for a pipeline that circumvents Russia under any circumstances , and that it also has the means of preventing such a development .
The gulf between the desires of the Polish ruling elite and its material influence in Europe drives Poland into the arms of the US .
It humbly goes along with every step of the world power in the hope that this will increase its weight in respect to its neighbours .
Against a background of intensifying international contradictions , the Polish government hopes to secure more room for manoeuvre in Eastern Europe .
Its simultaneous economic dependence on the EU explains the incessant zigzag course of Polish policy , which swings back and forth between European unification and aggressive demarcation .
With the Kaczynski brothers , extremely nationalist forces from within the Polish elite have now taken over the helm .
Like Putin , they strive for national consolidation , to prevent the sell - off of Polish enterprises and pursue an aggressive foreign policy .
The victims of such a policy are not only the Iraqi , Afghani and perhaps soon Iranian civilians , but also the Polish workers themselves .
The Kaczynskis have often compared their politics with those of the brutal dictator Jozef Pilsudski and thereby express their contempt for fundamental democratic principles .
When the constitutional court recently declared unconstitutional their so - called “ lustration law ” ( in post - Stalinist Europe this term generally signifies a process of vetting those in public life to see if they had collaborated with the former regime ) , the prime minister rushed to denounce the judges themselves as ex-informers , and then proceeded to change the constitution .
The Kaczynskis are using the law to reorganisethe entire state apparatus and control the media .
Attacks on democratic rights are always aimed at breaking the resistance of the masses .
The pro-war policies of the Polish elite can only be financed through harsher attacks on workers ’ social rights .
Therefore , it comes as no surprise that the Kaczynskis are essentially maintaining the austerity measures of the previous government , despite various reformist appeals .
In the preparation for this meeting , I held many discussions with students in Warsaw , the result of which made me decide to place the emphasis of my contribution on the Polish question .
Many students were very open towards our internationalist perspective .
However , there were also very many who argued from a very nationalist point of view .
A student from the Politechnika expressed this very clearly ; he told me that he was for the Iraq war because it was good for Poland .
He explained : “ I am a Pole .
What is good for Poland is also good for me . ”
He could not be more wrong .
Polish history has repeatedly shown that this nationalist orientation has proved to be a dangerous trap for workers .
More than once , the Polish population has had to pay a bitter price for the grandiose fantasies of the Polish elite .
Towards the end of the nineteenth century , a fierce debate consumed the Polish and international socialist movement concerning the programme of Polish socialism .
The newly formed Socialist Party of Poland ( PPS ) held the position that it was the task of Polish socialists to support the national bourgeoisie in their fight against Russian Czarism and for an independent Poland .
Only such a struggle , the PPS explained , can push back Czarism , ensure capitalist development takes place in Poland and so create the basis for socialism and the liberation of the workers .
In contrast , the Polish Marxists — and above all , Rosa Luxemburg — held the view that economic developments left no room for the bourgeois - democratic emancipation of the Polish nation .
Since the Polish economy was inseparably bound up with the Russian , Poland ’s national bourgeoisie had no interest in independence from Czarism .
It could not resolve the tasks of the bourgeois - democratic revolution .
From this fact , Luxemburg concluded that the allies of the Polish workers in the fight against Czarist suppression were not the Polish bourgeoisie , but the Russian workers .
In her doctoral thesis on the industrial development of Poland in 1898 , Luxemburg closes with the sentence : “ The capitalist fusing of Poland and Russia is engendering as its end result that which has been overlooked to the same degree by the Russian government , the Polish bourgeoisie , and the Polish nationalists : the union of Polish and Russian proletariats as the future receiver in the bankruptcy of , first , the rule of Russian Czarism , and then the rule of Polish - Russian capital . ”
Thus , two completely different outlooks confronted each other in Poland ’s socialist movement :
The social patriots in the PPS wanted to establish a bourgeois Polish nation state , while the Marxists understood that for the workers there could only be progress in a common struggle of the Russian and Polish workers ’ movements .
How deep these differences were could be seen in 1905 , when revolution broke out in Russia , and Poland was also shaken by violent mass strikes .
After the great Russian general strike in December 1905 , Daszynski , the chairman of the PPS in Galicia , wrote an open letter in the Cracow edition of the social democratic newspaper Vorwärts in which he turned angrily against any general strike on Polish soil : at a time when Czarism is crumbling , the Poles should concentrate on their own goal , national independence .
In this situation , he wrote , it would be an error to weaken one ’s own bourgeoisie .
For its part , this bourgeoisie certainly did not deviate one moment from its support for the Czar .
Thereafter , the social patriotic movement , led by Pilsudski , assumed ever more reactionary forms .
The socialist movement , however , grouped itself increasingly around the thought of Luxemburg .
After the First World War , the situation fundamentally changed .
The October Revolution in Russia had swept away Czarism and with it Russian capitalism .
The unexpected war defeat of both Germany and Russia offered the Polish nationalists an opportunity to reconstitute Poland as a nation state .
Did this mean that Luxemburg ’s analysis had been disproved ?
Did it show that the Polish state was viable ?
The opposite was the case .
The events that followed completely confirmed the core of Luxemburg ’s ideas .
The social patriots had always proceeded on the basis of the impossibility of a socialist revolution in Russia .
Therefore , they regarded the Polish bourgeoisie as their natural ally .
Now , after this revolution had arrived , their leaders turned not to the Russian workers ’ state , but instead supported the bourgeoisie to prevent the spreading of the revolution to Poland .
Pilsudski became the leader of the Polish state and endeavoured primarily to repulse the influence of the Soviet workers ’ state and establish an eastern European federation under Polish supremacy .
To this end , he forced Russia into war .
He did not stand alone but was able to rely on substantial support from the Western powers , in particular France and England .
The fact that this support proved relatively limited was largely due to the resistance of the workers ’ movement in these countries .
The development of the Polish nation state was thus closely linked with the Russian revolution .
From the beginning , this shaped its character .
There can be no talk of a progressive bourgeois democratic development of Poland in the interwar years .
The country did not develop as an independent capitalist power , nor did the population enjoy fundamental democratic rights .
Pilsudski fought not only against the first workers ’ state in Russia , but also against the workers ’ movement in his own country .
After leading a military putsch in May 1926 , he brutally suppressed all serious political opposition .
The Polish Communist Party had to operate under conditions of illegality .
Finally , Pilsudski established concentration camps for political opponents and collaborated with Hitler from 1933 onwards .
In view of this history , one naturally asks oneself , why 80 years later , do the Kaczynskis seek to revive Polish nationalism with express reference to Pilsudski ?
In view of the barbarism of Pilsudski ’s state , could not the Polish Communists have won the masses , educated in the spirit of Luxemburg , easily to an internationalist perspective ?
It was the increasing nationalism of the Soviet Union that saved Polish nationalism .
With Stalin , a bureaucratic layer had taken power in the Soviet Union , which was absolutely hostile to socialism and in particular to internationalism .
The interests of the bureaucracy were not bound up with the world revolution , but rather with the stabilisation of its own privileged position .
Successful socialist revolutions in other countries would have inevitably placed a question mark over the power of the bureaucracy , which owed its influence to the economic backwardness of Russia and the temporary isolation of the Soviet Union .
Via the Comintern , the bureaucracy tried to control the Communist Parties of all countries and to subordinate them to the interests of Russian foreign policy .
In Poland , the Stalinist interventions were particularly violent , culminating in the dissolution and physical destruction of the Polish Communist Party in 1938 .
The support for Pilsudski’s May putsch by the Polish CP was a direct result of Stalin and Bukharin ’s “ two - stage theory , ” which was now Comintern policy .
According to this theory , in underdeveloped countries the communist parties had to support the national bourgeoisie in the struggle for independence and relinquish any socialist demands for the time being .
This was nothing more than a return to the positions of the social patriots .
In the following years , the Polish CP was victim of numerous purges .
Starting from the mid-1930s , as part of the politics of popular frontism , it was obliged to subordinate itself to the nationalist bourgeois forces around Wincenty Witos in the struggle against Pilsudski .
This development was only possible after the heritage of Rosa Luxemburg had been destroyed and every critical voice had been removed from the CP .
The CP , which was dissolved in 1938 , was finally just a shadow of its former self .
The Stalinists had smashed the internationalist traditions of the communist movement in Poland .
The state that was established after 1945 under Stalinist control was just as nationalist as the Soviet Union .
The bureaucrats placed in power in Eastern Europe were a miniature version of the Soviet bureaucracy , to which they were completely subservient .
The numerous crimes committed by the Stalinist bureaucracy against the Polish people — the liquidation of the CP leadership on charges of so - called Trotskyist deviation , the lingering of the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw until the Nazis had suppressed the workers rebellion , the redivision of Poland and the brutal resettlement of the population , and much more — laid the basis for anti-communism and the convoluted nationalist resentments against the Soviet Union .
Above all , however , it resulted in the growing influence of the Catholic Church .
The Trotskyist perspective , which expressed the interests of the workers , remained completely suppressed .
At that time , the Fourth International called for the Polish workers as well as the workers of the Soviet Union and the other Eastern Bloc countries to overthrow the bureaucracy in a political revolution , in order to construct socialism on the basis of the social ownership created by the October Revolution .
Such a political revolution was only conceivable as part of and directly linked to the fate of the socialist world revolution .
Polish workers paid dearly for the absence of such an internationalist perspective .
They continually came into violent economic and political conflicts with the ruling bureaucracy , but their leaders led them time and again into a national dead - end .
These conflicts found their greatest expression in the strike movement of 1980 - 1981 .
The workers ’ demands went far beyond economic questions and included the right to strike , the freedom of the press and the abolition of the privileges of the bureaucracy .
The workers of the other Eastern Bloc countries were called upon to show solidarity .
However , cut off from the Marxist tradition , the workers were unable to develop these demands into a political programme for the overthrow of the bureaucracy .
Nevertheless , this movement essentially threatened Stalinist rule .
Not only were the bureaucrats themselves anxious , but also the intellectuals and the church , which had gathered around the movement as leaders or advisors .
These forces , which included the Kaczynskis at that time , had no interest in the workers ’ egalitarian demands .
They only wanted to ensure they got their own slice of the national cake .
From the beginning , their perspective was nationalist in orientation and opposed the interests of the workers .
The more violent the conflict between the workers and the government , the closer these middle layers moved to the bureaucracy .
The advisors feared an independent movement of the workers more than the prisons of the Stalinists .
They wanted to prevent the movement spreading to the other Eastern Bloc countries and thus endangering not only Stalinist rule but also their own ambitions .
The imposition of military rule by General Jaruzelski was only the logical consequence of these politics .
Only eight years later , the Stalinists and the Solidarity leaders and advisors sat at a round table , in order to restore capitalism in Poland and establish themselves as the new ruling class .
The consequences of these policies are well known to you all .
Poland experienced a tremendous social decline in the following years .
Vast parts of the country today experience bitter poverty , the health system is in ruins and Polish soldiers are fighting everywhere in the world for profits and oil .
Today , the interests of Polish workers are even more directly linked with the interests of the international working class than in Rosa Luxemburg ’s times .
The international interdependence of the production process has undermined any attempt to defend workers ’ rights on a national basis .
In all countries in the world , the old national workers ’ organisations have been transformed into open opponents of the workers .
If a Polish worker wants to fight today for higher wages , he or she is immediately confronted with the need to fight for higher wages in the Ukraine , in Russia and in China because otherwise the manufacturing plants will simply be moved there .
To defend even their most elementary rights means workers today are dependent on an international perspective .
This is certainly the case for a movement against war , which must be international at its core .
The policy of the Kaczynskis stands in the opposite tradition and shows once more the logical consequences of Polish nationalism .
In a situation in which the capitalist world system , and in particular its former powerhouse the US , is in a deep crisis , in which the inter - imperialist tensions are appreciably intensified and in which social contradictions are increasing in every country , a democratic development in Poland on a capitalist and national basis is impossible .
Since 1989 , no government in Poland has been able to stay in office for an extended period of time .
From one legislative period to the next , the workers have said no to the government and increasingly stay away from the elections .
The government ’s extreme social attacks cannot be reconciled with democracy .
In the last elections , turnout sank to 40 percent , and as the strongest party the PiS received the support of barely 10 percent of the electorate .
Now , following the logic of this development , the Kaczynskis are seeking to change the rules and establish authoritarian forms of rule .
Workers are confronted with increasingly right - wing politics but at the same time see no alternative within the political system — because there is no alternative to these right - wing policies on a national and capitalist basis !
It is a ridiculous venture that politicians from all camps like Kwasniewski , Walesa and Borowski are now seeking to form a “ democratic ” bloc in order to oppose the Kaczynskis .
The present government is the product of the politics of these same people .
It is the logical consequence of a policy that for 18 years has stood completely contrary to the interests of the masses .
Poland ’s greatest problem is not the Kaczynskis , but the complete absence of a political alternative .
But this fact confronts workers in every country in the world .
While ever more people find themselves directly opposed to social cuts , to attacks on democratic rights and brutal wars , they see themselves confronted with an absolute lack of any alternative .
Our task consists of developing this alternative .
And as should have become clear from my talk , this can only proceed on the basis of a close study of history and an analysis of contemporary capitalism .
The Polish workers must understand themselves to be part of the European and international working class and revive the best traditions of the pre-Stalinist Polish Communist Party by taking part in the building of a European section of the Fourth International .
This demands above all a conscious reckoning with Polish nationalism .
