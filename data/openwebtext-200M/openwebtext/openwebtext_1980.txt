Ceramic jars onboard a 2,400 - year - old shipwreck , with starfish and sponges growing on them .
DNA analysis shows these jars held olive oil flavored with oregano and possibly wine .
Genetic analysis has revealed the contents of an ancient shipwreck dating back to the era of the Roman Republic and Athenian Empire .
The cargo was olive oil flavored with oregano .
Beyond discovering ingredients for Italian salad dressing on the sea floor , such research could provide a wealth of insights concerning the everyday life of ancient seafaring civilizations that would otherwise be lost at sea .
An international team of U.S. and Greek researchers investigated the remains of a 2,400 - year - old shipwreck that lies 230 feet ( 70 meters ) deep , roughly a half - mile ( 1 kilometer ) off the coast of the Greek island of Chios in the Aegean Sea .
The shipwreck 's contents , revealed in early 2006 , has now been more fully analyzed .
By deploying a robot to the wreck to collect two amphoras — two - handled earthenware jars often used by ancient Greeks and Romans — they were able to obtain DNA samples by scraping the insides of the ceramics .
Many archeologists specialize in the analysis of amphoras , which were used for shipping wine , oil , spices , grapes , olives , grain , nuts , fish and other commodities .
Amphoras in a shipwreck can often reveal the age and nationality of the wreck , and at times they even hold their original contents , shedding light on ancient trade across the Mediterranean .
The study of amphoras can also be frustrating .
After centuries underwater , their contents have usually been washed away and researchers are " just left with empty bottles , " said researcher Brendan Foley , a maritime archaeologist and historian of technology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts , who helped lead a 2005 expedition that explored and recovered two amphoras from the Chios wreck .
Surprise
Foley and his colleagues identified the DNA contents of one amphora as olives and oregano , suggesting it held olive oil mixed with oregano , they announced recently .
This came as a surprise , since Chios was well known as a major exporter of fine wines in antiquity , and archeologists had assumed that any cargo from that area would have been wine .
The other amphora the researchers analyzed may indeed have contained wine , although the DNA evidence they found there as yet remains uncertain .
" This is the first time that we 've taken a jar like this that had no visible remains in it and known for sure what was in it , " Foley told LiveScience .
The amphora that held the oregano - flavored oil was of a style distinct to Chios .
That style made up roughly two - thirds of the more than 350 amphoras found on the wreck , suggesting the ship had sunk while outbound from the island , possibly due to strong fluke winds common near there .
" The fact that we detected DNA of olives may mean that Chios exported more than wine , " Foley said .
" Their agricultural production might have been more sophisticated than we 've suspected . "
The oregano may have done more than just flavor the oil .
" If you go up into the hills of Greece today , the older generation of women know that adding oregano , thyme or sage not just flavors the oil , but helps preserve it longer , " Foley said .
The ancient Greeks may have used herbs — and the antioxidants in them — to intentionally help preserve the oil , and possibly accidentally helped preserve the DNA the researchers sampled more than two millennia later .
Window to history
If the researchers ' technique works on other containers , " we can begin to trace the agricultural production of different regions through time and their trading networks , " Foley said .
" We can see what crops were grown where and when , and this will give us an entirely new look at the ancient economy .
We can see what they were growing , what they were eating and how they prepared and preserved foods . "
Such insights into ancient crops could even yield insights into the climate of that period .
The technique used to analyze ancient cargo DNA has its limits , the scientists stressed .
For instance , it probably cannot reliably identify fish products , since any evidence of that could be contamination from the marine environment .
It also remains to be seen whether this method can be used on amphoras stored in museums for years , whether it works on ceramics excavated from land sites , or whether it will only work on amphoras freshly salvaged from the ocean .
The scientists hope to go back and study a few dozen more amphoras from a variety of wrecks next year .
Foley and his colleague Maria Hansson at Lund University in Sweden will detail their current findings in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Archeological Science .
Yet Sweden ’s gleaming wind park is entering service at a time when wind energy is coming under sharper scrutiny , not just from hostile neighbors , who complain that the towers are a blot on the landscape , but from energy experts who question its reliability as a source of power .
For starters , the wind does not blow all the time .
When it does , it does not necessarily do so during periods of high demand for electricity .
That makes wind a shaky replacement for more dependable , if polluting , energy sources like oil , coal and natural gas .
Moreover , to capture the best breezes , wind farms are often built far from where the demand for electricity is highest .
The power they generate must then be carried over long distances on high - voltage lines , which in Germany and other countries are strained and prone to breakdowns .
In the United States , one of the areas most suited for wind turbines is the central part of the country , stretching from Texas through the northern Great Plains — far from the coastal population centers that need the most electricity .
In Denmark , which pioneered wind energy in Europe , construction of wind farms has stagnated in recent years .
The Danes export much of their wind - generated electricity to Norway and Sweden because it comes in unpredictable surges that often outstrip demand .
In 2003 , Ireland put a moratorium on connecting wind farms to its electricity grid because of the strains that power surges were putting on the network ; it has since begun connecting them again .
Photographs of Signs Enforcing Racial Discrimination :
Documentation by Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photographers
Photographers working for the Farm Security Administration Historical Section ( later transferred to the Office of War Information ) were encouraged to document continuity and change in many aspects of life in America during the years the unit was in operation .
They were particularly encouraged to photograph billboards and signs as one indicator of such developments .
Although no documentation has been found to indicate that photographers were explicitly encouraged to photograph racial discrimination signs , the collection includes a significant number of this type of image , which is rarely found in other Prints and Photographs Division collections .
This reference aid includes all the known images of discrimination signs found in the Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information file of photographic prints .
This list was compiled in response to frequent patron requests for such images .
The list is updated as additional images are discovered .
Photographic copies of the images may be ordered through the Library of Congress Duplication Services ( 202-707-5640 ) .
When placing orders , the reproduction number should be cited .
The Library of Congress is unaware of any restrictions on the use of the images .

Back in the 60s and 70s , the VW Micro- bus had quite the hippie reputation , with flower power and home - grown pharmaceuticals being part of the mystique that helped make the real original minivan a 1960s icon .
For the owner of a 1958 double panel restoration project , the drug connection hit a little close to home .
When checking out the undercarriage of his new purchase , TheSamba forum member Joshua B. found 14 LBS of marijuana stashed away .
While we can't provide an exact street value of such a find ( if you can , let us know in the comments ) we can assume that it 's a hell of a lot more than the value of this rusted out old groove - mobile .
If you plan on trying to contact Joshua about his find , do n't bother , he already disposed of it .
If anything , we can say that marijuana definitely kills enough brain cells to forget all about storing 14 LBS of chronic under a VW , which does n't seem like something someone would ordinarily forget about .
It does n't take Fred , Velma , and Shaggy to figure out that these forgetful smugglers are total rejects .
Thanks for the tip , Aaron !

This morning , Rep. John Yarmuth ( D - KY03 ) stood up on the House floor and to ask President Bush a couple of questions .
Note the delicate sensibilities of the North Carolina congressman who does n't like throwing Bush 's own phrase back at him :
Download Download
With brave American soldiers dying in record numbers , I have two questions for the President -- just whose posteriors are we kicking and how do you know ?
With Sunnis and Shiites killing themselves and each other , plus an incompetence Maliki government , we do n't know who we 're fighting , much less where we 're kicking them .
And while we 're tied up in Iraq , Al Qaeda thrives in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
So the President 's turn of phrase will go to the blooper hall of fame with other Bush Golden Oldies like last throes , links to Al Qaeda and Mission Accomplished .
There was a time when America 's success meant defeating Nazis , tearing down communism 's Iron Curtain and walking on the moon .
Supportng our troops meant honest safeguards , not trash talk .
How low have our standards fallen when the President points to the debacle he created and says , this is what I 'm proud of .
Most americans believe in a country that 's capable of much higher standards , and if America were really " kicking butt , " the President would n't need to say anything , every one would know it .
I yield back .
In 1999 , as the nation was still coming to grips with the tragedy at Columbine High School , then - House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) took to the floor to identify what he saw as the real culprit : science classes .
“ Our school systems teach the children that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized [ sic ] out of some primordial soup , ” DeLay said .
Young people learn modern biology , DeLay said , which in turn makes them feel insignificant , which in turn leads to violence .
This was , of course , one of the more loathsome comments made by one of Congress 's more despicable people , but after yesterday ’s shootings at Virginia Tech , it was only a matter of time before someone who shares DeLay ’s worldview stepped up to assess yesterday ’s tragedy the same way .
Enter Ken Ham , a leading creationist activist , who leads an outfit called Answers in Genesis .
“ We live in an era when public high schools and colleges have all but banned God from science classes .
In these classrooms , students are taught that the whole universe , including plants and animals — and humans — arose by natural processes .
Naturalism ( in essence , atheism ) has become the religion of the day and has become the foundation of the education system ( and Western culture as a whole ) .
The more such a philosophy permeates the culture , the more we would expect to see a sense of purposelessness and hopelessness that pervades people ’s thinking .
In fact , the more a culture allows the killing of the unborn , the more we will see people treating life in general as ‘ cheap . ’ ”
Ham , it ’s worth noting , wrote this yesterday .
He could n’t even wait 24 hours before connecting the massacre and biology classes .
When Google Moon was released last year , it was a bit of a joke .
Google Earth , but for the Moon .
Zoom in far enough and the familiar lunar craters were replaced with swiss cheese .
The time for silliness is over , Google Moon has gotten an update , and they ’re making it a serious learning tool this time around .
The website incorporates photographs from orbiters and the Apollo missions to let you zoom in and out , exploring the Moon .
Head over to Google Moon , and follow along .
You can change the view between Charts , Apollo , Visible and Elevation .
All of the Apollo landing sites are marked on the map , so you can click each one to get more information .
Zoom in all the way , and you do n’t see swiss cheese anymore .
Instead you see the most detailed images available from NASA showing high resolution details about the landing sites .
Each landing site has more than 10 additional detailed place markers , showing points of interest about the mission .
For example , click on the Apollo 16 mission , and the interface informs you there are 21 additional place markers .
Click to zoom in , and you can see all the little markers .
Click on any one and you ’ll see more details , such as interesting rocks , craters , and landing spacecraft .
Some of the detailed views are just photographs , but others are panoramas that you can scroll around to see the landscape from the astronauts ’ point of view .
Very cool !
There are also some landmarks with audio clips and video clips .
All in all , the site feels like an educational CD - ROM .
And that ’s part of its problem – it ’s not really an atlas of the Moon , and more of a presentation of the Apollo missions .
Many of those lunar craters have names .
There are plenty more interesting features on the Moon than just the Apollo landing sites .
I ’d love to see some of that information incorporated as well .
They could also bring in images from other spacecraft , like ESA ’s SMART - 1 to provide better coverage in some areas .
My other concern is that it does n’t really work if you zoom all the way out .
Instead of seeing a nice view of the whole Moon , there ’s a confusing set of repeating images showing the same portions of the Moon over and over again .
Google Maps does the same thing with the Earth , but still , it should look like you ’re zooming into the Moon .
Anyway , enough of my review , check it out at http://www.google.com/moon
Original Source : NASA News Release
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Human rights groups have filed a lawsuit in France alleging that former U.S. defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld allowed torture at U.S. - run detention centers in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The plaintiffs , which include the French - based International Federation of Human Rights Leagues ( FIDH ) and the U.S. Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , say Rumsfeld authorized interrogation techniques that led to rights abuses .
The United States says it does not torture , though it has authorized several methods widely condemned by rights groups such as exposure to extreme temperatures and ‘ waterboarding ’ , or simulated drowning .
“ We will only stop once the American authorities involved in the torture program are brought to justice , ” CCR chief Michael Ratner said in a statement posted on the FIDH Web site .
“ Donald Rumsfeld must understand that he has nowhere to hide .
A torturer is an enemy of humanity , ” he added .
The plaintiffs argue in their filing , which was also posted on the FIDH Web site , that French courts have universal jurisdiction -- allowing them to try foreigners in cases that occurred abroad -- under the 1984 Convention Against Torture .
They said Rumsfeld was visiting France on Friday and called for him to be detained .
“ Rumsfeld ’s presence on French territory gives the French courts the authority to try him , in that he ordered and authorized torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment on detainees at Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib and elsewhere , ” the FIDH said in its statement .
The Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq hit the headlines in April 2004 when details of the physical abuse and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers were made public , badly damaging the reputation of the U.S. military .
Former prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are suing Rumsfeld and 10 military commanders for alleged torture and violations of their religious rights during their detention there .
The CCR and FIDH have already filed suits in Germany in 2004 and 2006 in a bid to have Rumsfeld tried for rights abuses .
Both were rejected by the courts , though an appeal is due to be heard in the second case next week , the groups said .
The German - based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights was also a party to the French case .
One transaction , involving the medical diagnostics company Dade Behring , took place in 1999 as Mr. Romney was leaving the firm , and the other , involving KB Toys , occurred about two years later .
Bain and its co-investors extracted special payments of over $ 100 million from each company , enabling Bain to make a healthy profit even before re-selling the businesses — a practice known as “ getting back your bait . ”
Lenders say Bain is one of the firms that has taken the most in such payments , which companies usually make by taking on additional debt .
Both Dade Behring and KB
Toys soon suffered dips in their business .
Unable to meet the burden of their debts , each filed for bankruptcy and laid off thousands of workers .
Bain Capital spokesmen have said the company did nothing improper .
Mr. Romney , who remains an investor in Bain Capital , said he had not been involved in those decisions but acknowledged that such payments became part of the buyout business “ very early on . ”
“ It is one thing that if I had a chance to go back I would be more sensitive to , ” Mr. Romney said .
“ It is always a balance .
Great care has got to be taken not to take a dividend or a distribution from a company that puts that company at risk . ”
He added that taking a big payment from a company that later failed “ would make me sick , sick at heart . ”
Mr. Romney ’s rivals in the Republican primary , courting business support , have shown little interest in the casualties of his Bain career .
But Mr. Romney acknowledged that Democrats inevitably will .
He said he felt confident he could persuade voters to see past such attacks , just as he did when he was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002 .
Running Bain Capital , he said , has more in common with being a candidate , governor or even president than many people realize .
The job of a chief executive also involves persuading fractious constituencies — investors , bankers and even “ people who want your job ” — to pull together , he said .
“ There is a popular conception that being a C.E.O. you have no boss and that people just do what you tell them to do , like the captain of a ship , ” he said .
“ Nothing could be further from the truth . ”
Here is another example based on the same two crop circles above :
The following is a piece put together by Richard and which includes a channeling by me .
As the Chinese would say , we live in interesting times ....
Carolyn Crop Circle predicts the coming of the Christ child
After you have read this , I ask that you share this message with as many people as possible .
A copy of it is available at http://www.metatronminutes.net/Crop_circle_predicts.htm and as a downloadable pdf from the Articles page at http://www.metatronminutes.com/
I am about to share with you a profound channeling .
It has to do with the unfolding of an event which may or may not already be in your awareness .
This event is widely known as Ascension .
Ascension involves a transition in consciousness for the inhabitants of planet Earth and the planet itself .
For many of you , this will come as a surprise .
For others , it is a term with which you are familiar ; however what it means may be a little unclear .
For others , you may have a clear view of what you believe it means , however most of us have been subject to a lot of disinformation about it and , frankly , the specifics have not been available to fully understand - until now .
There have been many messages from many places about Ascension .
What is different about this one is that it is directly associated with a crop circle pattern that was laid down on July 22 , 2008 at Avebury Manor in England .
http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2008/aveburymanor2/aveburymanor2008b.html
Taken from the above page at www.cropcircleconnector.com
Those who have analysed this pattern have realised it is telling us something about December 2012 , the time of the ending of the Mayan Calendar , including the arrival of a comet that , according to the crop circle site , our astronomers are as yet unaware of .
For some of you , the idea that crop circles are not manmade and carry messages for humanity will come as a surprise .
If so , I suggest you browse www.cropcircleconnector.com and see for yourself the extraordinary patterns that are being laid down .
You will quickly realise these patterns are not , for the most part , manmade and if you want to examine these phenomena in more detail , I highly recommend Star Dreams .
How come these extraordinary messages receive no mainstream publicity ?
I 'll leave you to reflect on that question as a thread by which you may begin to pull your perceived reality apart .
If you are unfamiliar with the ending of the long cycle Mayan Calendar in December 2012 , here is a link to some pages on this site : MAYAN DATA
The arrival of comets has a deep sub-conscious pull for mankind as they have been seen and understood over the millennia as messengers alerting us to great change .
And so it is with this one .
And now , to the channeling .
We have the explanation that Lord Metatron was going to provide to us in relation to the Crop Circle .
The comet coming in relation to , around the time of , Jeshua 's birth .
I am being directed to Galactic Centre .
And of course looking at our galaxy , not from the inside but from the exterior , I see a bulge , which looks like a line going through it .
They wanted to show me that first .
And then they 're taking me inside .
I am standing there in the black hole which is right outside of Galactic Centre .
And in 2012 there 's all this energy being fed into Galactic Centre through the black hole .
I 'm tracing where it 's coming from .
There 's a whole string .
Energy is like being ... it 's coming from a constellation of stars .
I do n't know how far it is - in another dimension .
It is other life that is held in black matter .
We 've talked about this , the yin and the yang , the plus and the minus .
So black matter is life just like us except it is the opposite electrical field .
And so this energy is coming from a very advanced constellation .
Actually it 's three constellations set up in the pattern that we are familiar with - the triangle .
And it is the cycle .
They 're sending the energy through this black hole into Galactic Centre .
2012 , December - the date that that energy comes through the black hole is not the same date that the child will be born .
Even though it might seem that it should be instantaneous it is not .
There is a lag period from the time that it comes through the black hole .
No .
It is not that .
From the time that it is discharged from this triangular configuration and then moves through the black hole and then into Galactic Centre .
And it is that energy that comes through in December that transforms Earth .
Not only Earth but it imprints our entire solar system .
And so all the planets are shari ng in this energy pattern .
The other planets in our solar system , they imprint this energy also .
Of course the energy comes through the sun .
I 'm seeing the 28th .
The child to be born on the 28th .
Energy comes through the sun and joins that moment .
It will repeat what happened earlier when the solar wind stopped ( 1999 ) http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast13dec99_1.htm.
The electrons that are the solar wind will stop .
It will stop for three days , as that energy which came through the black hole imprints Earth .
And of course it will imprint all of the other planets .
The planets , each of them imprinting in some fashion their energy .
Because each planet has a different energy , you know , and a different purpose .
And during those three days this energy will completely alter the particles on Earth .
They will be transformed .
It will be like an explosion into eve ry particle on Earth , and human beings even , where the electrons will have more space in between them .
The planet will be re-patterned .
And there will be many who will not be able to withstand the change in the energy pattern because they have done no preparation .
And if their bodies have not been cleared and they are filled with , as you call it , stuck energy from the past , they will perish during those three days .
It 's not a punishment mind you .
It 's just that they will not - the physical - will not be able to be supported with the change in the energy .
Just because this energy has come does not mean that every soul who is here on this planet will survive .
They all have the opportunity to ascend .
But those who have not worked on this process will not survive the pressure against the physical .
The changing in the cells will be too much for them .
Those who have prepared or have been attempting to prepare will have cells that are crystalline .
Those who have not prepared at all , their cells will be carbon based and they will not be able to survive under this ( he is showing me this great pressure that will be exerted upon it ) great pressure .
They will die from it .
And those who are of the dark , who have no intention of moving towards the light , will not be able to exist in these energies either .
And so the good news is everyone has the opportunity to ascend .
And the good news is those who perish will reincarnate in another place where the energies will be similar .
This is the justice of the moment , in a sense .
Those who have worked will receive their reward .
Those who have not will receive also what they did n't give .
Each will have their own result .
And so what the crop circle is telling you is that this great change has to do with Galactic Centre .
The energy comes through because of all the alignments .
It is simply the alignments that allow the energy to come in on a straight line to come to Earth .
It is like a lock , where you need a key to unlock the lock .
And that is what 2012 is .
This giant clockwork in the cosmos has lined up in a certain fashion for the energy to come through .
And as this process unfolds , and as in so many things in life , humanity has always been warned .
Warnings are not always dire things .
Warnings can sometimes be an announcement of the most profound , of the most powerful and yet of the most sublime .
And this is what this child is .
Powerful and sublime .
Is n't that not what love is actually ?
The most powerful ?
The most sublime ?
The little child , the little child , one day , they say was born in Bethlehem so long ago .
This little child will not be born in Bethlehem .
But this little child will come in 2012 and the comet will proclaim his coming .
So you might say , in essence , this is his comet .
And those who watch the sky will remember that it was once called the Star of Bethlehem but since this child will not be born in Bethlehem then there is this comet announcing his birth .
Channelled by Carolyn Evers
You may listen to the channeling at : http://www.metatronminutes.net/Recordings/Crop_circle_predicts_the_coming_Christ_child.mp3
I encourage you to do so , as you will experience the energy and the unfolding of this wondrous message .
As I said at the beginning , this is a profound channelling .
It tells of an event which will transform consciousness on this planet as we have known it .
It tells of the coming forth on Earth of an aspect of that great soul that sent forth the one we know as Jeshua or Jesus , the first soul created after the seraphim and cherubim , the one known throughout the cosmos as " The Radiant One " because of his great light .
His birth will trigger the Ascension process on planet Earth .
Please be clear , this not something to fear .
Know that you chose to be present on the planet at this time to participate in this event , even if you may currently have no conscious awareness of it .
I encourage you to visit the crop circle website at http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2008/aveburymanor2/aveburymanor2008b.html and see for yourself what the analysts have come up with about this crop circle .
It correlates powerfully with this channeling .
It is a tangible , real world pointer to what is unfolding .
In fact , I suggest you begin with http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2008/aveburymanor/aveburymanor2008a.html as this shows the first part of this pattern as it was laid down in two stages , the first on July 15th 2008 , the second a week later on July 22nd .
On the 22nd , the second pattern was added and the comet added to the first .
The straight bands that have appeared through the first I understand are the handiwork of the farmer .
Get clear about the truth of this for yourself .
You owe it to yourself to do so .
So how do I go forward ?
As I said earlier , the concept of Ascension may be a complete shock to you .
If you have no connection with spirituality or metaphysics today , if you have your views of who Jesus / Jeshua was and who and what we are shaped by religion , if you have grown up with the version of the scientific paradigm that has been fed to us , as I did , which focuses us on looking at the external world for understanding your reality , or if the whole concept of channeling is foreign to you , my e-book " The Coming Golden Age and How to Prepare for it " - www.thecominggoldenage.com
- may be a good place for you to start as it begins with what modern science is telling us about the nature of our reality and goes from there .
Materials are coming into place to explain and support this unfolding .
The detail behind this message can be found in " The Soul Journey of Jeshua " series - http://www.metatronminutes.com/soul_journey_of_jeshua.html .
Who was the one we know as Jeshua or Jesus really ?
Why did he come ?
Did he plan to be crucified ?
Did he die on the cross ?
Who supported him ?
What has his life and his children with Mary Magdalene got to do with Ascension ( yes , they were married and had children ) ?
What role does the legacy of their children 's DNA leave humanity ?
And much , much more .
This material shatters the deception sold to us by the church about this man and his life .
There is free guidance and support coming forth in the Metatron Minutes newsletters - http://www.metatronminutes.com/newsletter_sign_up.html and a range of articles and protocols can be found at http://www.metatronminutes.com/.
This will continue to expand , so I encourage you to return to it regularly .
Additionally , the material being channeled from Steve Fossett in a series of e-books - www.SteveFossettLives.com - provides further explanation and understanding at the detailed level of what this transition means .
It is some of the material coming forth in these e-books , which exposes the dark plans of the US military and others that the faked crash site recently discovered was set up to discredit .
It will not be long before the truth of this comes forth .
The energies currently flowing to the planet will simply not allow it to remain hidden .
All truths are being revealed and this channeling is an example .
These are powerful , powerful times .
As I said earlier , the message above is not one to be feared .
Rather , it is one to be understood and embraced .
It is a call to action .
We all have some four years , give or take a few days , to prepare .
This is more than ample if you wish to embrace this opportunity .
Simply set your Intention to participate in this wondrous unfolding and be willing to face your fears and doubts .
Be willing to ask why certain events happen to you .
Stand as the creator of your own life , your own reality , as you are that .
There are no victims .
Be prepared to stand as a Sovereign being and bring all you need to be ready to you - and it will be so .
What I have just written will come as a shock to many of you .
The idea that we are responsible for everything that unfolds in our lives is a concept that many struggle to hold .
It is so far from the picture of reality that is fed to us .
When you stand in this place , you will be amazed at the understanding that flows forth .
This stand , however , is the last thing some on this planet wish us to take .
We have all lived countless lifetimes on Earth and in doing so have accumulated patterns of unresolved energy ; energy resulting from traumas and other issues occurring earlier in this life and also in past lives .
When a trauma is repeated over three or more lifetimes , this forms a pattern that you will likely need help to clear .
There are many gifted energy workers ready , willing and able to assist you with this .
This is the stuck energy referred to in the channeling .
These subconscious patterns are major dictators of what is showing up in your current life .
That 's how it works .
In order to give you guidance on how to approach this clearing process , an article will be posted on the Articles page at http://www.metatronminutes.com/ shortly .
I expect it will be in place by early December , 2008 .
Heed this warning
So I encourage you to heed this warning and begin to prepare .
There will be others more powerful than this one .
I speak of one in my e-book .
No -one on the planet will be able to say they were not warned .
That is the way of spirit .
I encourage you to embrace the tools , the knowledge and the protocols coming forth on http://www.metatronminutes.com/ to support you in what are and will continue to be unsettling times .
Unsettling they may be , however you can choose to witness them and allow them to swirl around you without touching you .
Difficult times do not need to be difficult for you .
We are all much greater , more powerful beings than we take ourselves to be .
Now is the time to begin to understand and embrace this .
Some of you reading this will already have been caught up in the financial unwinding occurring , or are struggling financially for other reasons .
Know that it is part of the unfolding of Ascension ( see the article on the website above from Lord Metatron on this subject ) .
Strange though this may sound to many of you , you do not have to participate in this chaos .
You do not need to suffer .
In order to help those struggling with abundance issues in their lives , we are offering a series of free conference calls on this to provide the understanding and skills to master it .
If this applies to you , I suggest you go to http://www.metatronminutes.com/free_manifesting_calls.html and register .
And so it is .
Blessings , joy , love and peace .

The second part of Avebury Manor shows a more detailed view of our solar system near Earth in December of 2012 Apart from farmer 's damage , the old part of Avebury Manor shows one major change : a " comet " entering our solar system on the left .
Then on the right , its new part shows a highly expanded view of lunar orbit ( a crescent Moon circling the Earth ) , close to a dotted oval symbol for " 12 lunar months " .
During month 12 ( or December 2012 ) , our Moon will apparently come close in the sky to a " bright comet " , drawn inside curved tramlines nearby .
Below the new lunar crescent at Avebury Manor , we can see a " double ring " symbol for Earth 's Sun , connected by a long curved line to six other small symbols yet to be identified .
Four bright " stars " appear nearby , close to the old orbit of Pluto .
Looking next at many small symbols near top centre , we can see the crescent symbol for Moon , lying in its twelfth month ( solar or lunar ) next to the same bright comet just mentioned :
Looking finally at many small symbols near bottom centre , we can see a double - ring symbol for Sun , connected by a long curved line to another circle with two small stars enclosed :
By studying our Sun 's path through the sky ( red dashed line ) during December , I was able to work out that those two small stars lie in the constellation Ophiuchus at Right Ascension 17 hours , 22 minutes , or close to our Sun on December 13 as 17 hours , 26 minutes .
Four other stars ( or M8 ) provide a confirming match between the star pattern and the crop picture .
The crop symbol for M8 is shown correctly as a circle plus an extended line , because it is an extended star cluster .
One week later on December 21 - 23 , our Sun lies at a slightly larger R.A. value of 18 hours , 2 - 11 minutes in the constellation Sagittarius .
Four nearby symbols ( not shown ) as " spiral , snail , serpent , crossed box " remain unidentified , but could represent the four constellations bordering Ophiuchus in Earth 's sky .
For example , the " serpent " could be Serpens , while the " snail " was a constellation in ancient times .
Twelve years ago on July 13 , 1996 , we saw a similar astronomical prediction for December 2012 at West Overton : Charles Reed and Janet Ossebaard
This new crop picture seems to confirm the original crop picture shown in 1996 , of a bright comet next to a crescent Moon in December 2012 .
Its importance is that no such prediction can ( or has ) currently been made by conventional astronomical science .
A very similar crop picture appeared at West Overton on July 13 , 1996 .
There next to a galactic centre symbol for " Hunab Ku " , we saw a crescent Moon next to a bright comet in late 2012 .
NOTE ABOUT HUNAB KU : FROM WIKIPEDIA : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunab_Ku
The Hunab ku was invented by Catholic missionaries according to this article .
There we saw ( apparently ) the same new Moon of December 13 , 2012 , lying in Earth 's sky next to the same bright comet .
Both objects will lie close to our Sun during its eclipse of the galactic centre on December 21 - 23 ( which is indicated by a Mayan spiral symbol called " Hunab Ku " ) .
In summary , both of these crop pictures lead us to think that something important may happen one week before the Mayan Long Count calendar ends on December 21 - 23 , 2012 .
At the very least , we should see a bright comet next to a new Moon .
We might even see curved lines or " rays " emerging from the galactic center , as shown at West Overton in the diagram above .

COMMENTS : I think you guys are on the right track with this analysis .
But see if your bright comet is at one of these heliocentric longitudes obtained from T367 .
Comet Event 1 ( The Appearance Of The Comets At The Distance Of The Asteroid Belt : 02/25/07 , Other Comets At Heliocentric Longitudes :
2 : 103.0 degrees ;
3 : 139 degrees ;
4 : 161.5 degrees ;
5 : 195.0 degrees
This may give a clue as to how to understand the crop circle Avebury Manor crop circles of 15 and 22 July 2008 .
Barry Warmkessel
Avebury manor I and II the relation I want to share the following notes which I have on the second crop circle from Avebury Manor .
I want to call the second Avebury circle " The Returning of the Tenth Planet Niburu " In my opinion this is the first crop circle what actually depicts the origin of the makers of these symbols .
One can easily see that the circles are related .
We can see the planets again in the same position as in circle I
Lets start with the planets and the sun .
What is obvious is that the sun , the central point , is approximately 25 % bigger .
The sun has even in his power the planets Mercurius and Venus .
We also can see that on the outside four circles are shown , which are getting bigger in format .
What I see in this picture is that a Big Comet is approaching .
The sun reacts on this Comet and is expanding and so becoming a lot more bigger , but also hotter and hotter .
The planets Mercury and Venus are being burned up .
What will happen with the Earth .
That is explained in the picture beside the planets orbits .
Lets start with the big circle and a small circle with a central circle sticking on this .
I understand that this is the missing planet nr. 10 or Niburu .
Niburu has its own orbit outside our solar system , which is shown .
I see that Niburu also has a moon .
To the right we see an ellips with 11 tiny circles around it .
I think they mean that they own a huge space ship which is heading to a kind of teardrop shaped picture .
I think they mean the sorrow and grief on planet Earth , because of the suns explosion .
So in popular , I understand that they send this space craft to mother Earth .
But if someone else understands this different , then please react .
As follows I will explain the symbols at the left of Niburu 's orbit .
The diamond shaped symbol can be a space ship , but also can mean a laboratory .
Above that symbol we see the symbol of a sperm .
Then follows a turtle and a swirl .
After the swirl I cannot clearly see or understand the next symbol , but the following bigger symbol is very interesting and between that symbol and the orbit of Pluto I cannot anymore see clearly the smaller symbols .
What I understand is that they explain that they brought life ( Diamond and sperm symbol ) , it was a slow process ( the turtle ) , but finally evolution ( the swirl ) took place .
The bigger symbol is at the left planet Earth .
They put Earth in the proper orbit and they will do this again when our sun is changing .
I understand that they will take Earth to a safer place .
Hope
You can bring this message to the crop circle community .

I think it is Planet X . That is a separate object .
" Those who follow the Hopi path ; they hear his ( Massau ?

Sen . Patty Murray By John Froschauer , AP Spc. Travis Virgadamo Army Times WASHINGTON

A record number of soldiers — 109 — have killed themselves this year , according to Army statistics showing confirmed or suspected suicides .
The deaths occur as soldiers serve longer combat deployments and the Army spends $ 100 million on support programs .
ON DEADLINE : Vets ' suicides also being scrutinized " Soldiers , families and equipment are stretched and stressed , " Gen .
George Casey , Army chief of staff , told Congress last month .
The Army provided suicide statistics to Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash .
Her staff shared them with USA TODAY .
Those numbers show 77 confirmed suicides Army - wide this year through Nov. 27 and 32 other deaths pending final determination as suicides .
The Army updated those statistics Wednesday , confirming 85 suicides , including 27 in Iraq and four in Afghanistan .
The highest number of Army suicides recorded since 1990 was 102 in 1992 — a period when the service was 20 % larger than today .
A total of 109 suicides this year would equal a rate of 18.4 per 100,000 , the highest since the Army started counting in 1980 .
The civilian suicide rate was 11 per 100,000 in 2004 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The military has n't erased the stigma surrounding mental health issues , so troubled soldiers often do not seek help , Murray says .
" I want to say I 'm surprised " by the suicide increase , she says .
" But when we 're not doing everything we can to deal with mental health , when we know the Army is under such stress , it 's not a surprise .
It has to be a wakeup call . "
The Army has moved more aggressively in recent years to stem suicides , instituting mandatory training for every soldier about mental health and establishing a program to study its suicides .
Research released by the Army in August shows that almost 70 % of suicides in 2006 were spurred by failed relationships .
The Army continues to improve its suicide - prevention programs , spokesman Paul Boyce said Wednesday .
A hotline number — 800-342-9647 — is also available .
Since Sept. 11 , 2001 , records show that 128 soldiers have killed themselves while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan .
One was Spc. Travis Virgadamo , 19 , of Las Vegas .
His family said he was on suicide watch but was eventually taken off , and his gun was returned .
" That night he killed himself , " says his grandmother , Kate O'Brien , of Pahrump , Nev. O'Brien says her grandson desperately wanted to come home .
" He would say , ' Grandma , pray for me . ' " she says .
" What good is somebody ( to the war effort ) that is under such stress ? "

The world oceans are by far the largest sink of anthropogenic CO2 on our planet .
Until now , they have swallowed almost half of the CO2 emitted through the burning of fossil fuels but scientists are concerned about the ability of the oceans to continue to shoulder this environmental burden as CO2 levels rise .
Current models for the development of the global climate system do not incorporate the reaction of marine organisms nor the processes that they influence .
To investigate the biological processes and their potential changes with time , scientists in a new study made use of an unusual experimental set up in the Raunefjord in Norway .
A series of nine mesocosms , enclosures manufactured from a specialized synthetic material and measuring 10 meters in depth , were used to isolate 27 cubic meters of natural fjord water .
In the experimental design , Ulf Riebesell and his team maintained three enclosures at current CO2 conditions as a control , while they infused CO2 in the remaining mesocosms to simulate predicted concentrations for the year 2100 and the year 2150 .
The critters in the mesocosms responded quickly to the extra serving of CO2 .
The higher the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide , the faster the microalgae incorporated the greenhouse gas via photosynthesis .
Can CO2 act as a fertilizer in the ocean ?
The scientists measured an increased uptake of up to 39 % compared to current rates .
Ulf Riebesell describes the reaction of his team :
“ We expected the organisms to show distinct reactions to changing CO2 conditions .
What really surprised us , however , was the dimension of this effect .
Basically , we can now say that the biology in the oceans is significantly affecting the global climate system . ”
In the final step of the experiment , the scientists wanted to find out what happens with the rapidly proliferating biomass .
Again the experiments in the Raunefjord provided insights : the extra CO2 bound in organic matter sank to depth after the peak of the algal bloom .
The CO2 fertilization of marine plankton can have a positive effect on climate change in the future .
The greenhouse gas consumed by plankton and removed from the surface ocean when the dying cells sink to depth makes way for the uptake of more CO2 .
In a way , the tiny organisms act as a biological conveyer belt for the transport of carbon dioxide out of the surface and into the deep ocean .
What appears to be a blessing for the atmospheric greenhouse effect may prove to be a curse for deep ocean ecosystems .
Decomposition of the increased biomass will consume more oxygen , a major problem for marine animals that occupy deep habitats .
Another consequence of the biological conveyer belt is the accelerated rate of ocean acidification in the deep ocean due to more rapid transport of CO2 to depth .
The authors also expect direct affects on marine organisms based on previous observations .
Planktonic crustaceans that were fed with CO2 - enriched microalgae displayed slower growth rates and were less proliferous .
Ulf Riebesell remarks on the consequences of the study : „ Our results probably represent only the tip of the iceberg .
I am certain that scientists will discover further biological feedback mechanisms in the near future .
It is essential not only to identify and to understand these mechanisms , but also to quantify their effect on the global climate system , now and in the future . “
The experiments in Bergen were conducted in the framework of the research program CARBOOCEAN , funded by the European Union .

Ghost personalities
Ghost modes
Evidence of forward thinking
ghost personalities
I do n't have any problem with any of the ghosts .
Remember , I 'm perfect .
-- Billy Mitchell , world Pac - Man champion
Shadow / Blinky
Blinky begins each level moving at the same speed as all of the other ghosts , but after you 've eaten a certain number of dots , he begins to speed up .
It is customary to refer to this change as the point when he takes on the identity of ' Cruise Elroy ' .
Blinky becomes Cruise Elroy earlier and earlier as you progress to higher and higher levels as illustrated in the following table .
LEVEL ACCELERATES WHEN DOTS REMAINING IS EQUAL TO ... 1 20 2 30 3 40 4 40 5 40 6 50 7 50 8 50 9 60 10 60 11 + unknown
Unlike the other ghosts , Blinky will also tend to follow close on your tail even when you turn and will often still chase you even in scatter mode .
Speedy / Pinky
Pinky , Inky and Clyde always move at the same speed relative to one another so the name Speedy is plainly misleading .
However , the name may have been earned by the fact that Pinky is almost always the first of the ghosts to reverse direction when going in and out of scatter mode .
Pinky seems to have a tendency to go around blocks in an anticlockwise direction unlike Blinky and Clyde who seem to prefer going clockwise .
This means that if Blinky and Pinky reach the opposite side of a block to where you are , they 'll come at you from opposite sides of it .
They can often trap you like this so be careful of this deadly duo .
Bashful / Inky
Inky is dangerous because he 's unpredictable .
Given the same choices , he will often take different turns at different times .
There might be rhyme and reason to his behaviour , but we have n't recognised it yet .
One theory is that Inky 's behaviour depends on his proximity to Blinky almost as if he is too afraid to act on his own ( like some people who never go to a cinema by themselves ) .
Another unconfirmed theory about Inky is that he will often turn off if Pac - Man charges him .
These theories might have emerged as a result Inky 's nickname ( Bashful ) , the same kind of reasoning that has lead many authorities to believe erroneously that Pinky ( aka Speedy ) is actually faster than the other ghosts .
For this reason , we have decided to reserve our judgement until further evidence can be obtained .
Pokey / Clyde
Clyde is either short - sighted or stupid .
He will often turn off rather than approach you .
His heart does n't seem to be in it at all .
A consequence of Clyde 's unwillingness to take part is that it 's often hard to round all of the ghosts up into a single cluster which is nice to do just before eating a power pill .
ghost modes
I felt it would be too stressful for a human being like Pac Man to be continually surrounded and hunted down .
So I created the monsters ' invasions to come in waves .
They 'd attack and then they 'd retreat .
As time went by they would regroup , attack , and disperse again .
It seemed more natural than having constant attack .
-- Toru Iwatani , creator of Pac - Man
Every now and then all of the ghosts will simultaneously cease their pursuit of Pac - Man and head for their home corners .
We call this scatter mode and contrast it with the ghosts ' usual attack mode .
Scatter mode means the ghosts will leave you alone for a while so it's a good opportunity to clean up those awkward areas of the screen .
But be careful , the ghosts do n't stay in scatter mode for long and will only enter it a maximum of four times on the one life and level ( i.e. the count resets after losing a life or when a level is completed ) .
It is particularly important to take advantage of scatters on levels where the ghosts do n't turn blue at all after eating power pills .
The ghosts in their home corners
The moments when the ghosts change in and out of scatter mode are determined by a timer , not by the number of dots eaten and are marked by the ghosts all simultaneously reversing direction .
At the beginning of a level or after losing a life , the ghosts emerge from the ghost - hut already in scatter mode .
This and the second scatter are both 7 seconds long , but the third and fourth scatters are only 5 seconds each .
The attack waves between scatter periods last for 20 seconds each .
The mode sequence is summarised in the following table .
MODE DURATION IN SECONDS scatter 7 attack 20 scatter 7 attack 20 scatter 5 attack 20 scatter 5 attack forever
Be careful of the red ghost because he will sometimes still pursue you while in scatter mode .
This may be related to the Cruise Elroy phenomenon .
When Pac - Man eats a power pill , the ghosts enter blue mode .
During this period , the scatter timer is paused .
When ghosts leave blue mode , they return to whatever mode they were in when the power pill was eaten and the timer count continues .
The ghosts move more slowly while in blue mode and decisions are not made in the same way they are in either scatter or attack modes .
Note that all mode changes are marked by the ghosts reversing direction with the exception of when the ghosts leave blue mode .
Note also that the ghosts do n't actually all reverse at exactly the same time , but within a few time steps of one another .
evidence of forward thinking
Just before ghosts turn a corner , their eyes move to point in the new direction of movement .
This is n't very useful for predicting which way they 'll turn because the information comes so late , but it does indicate that the ghosts decide in advance which way they intend to go .
It is difficult to determine how much in advance decisions are made , but eye movements indicate that , at the very least , decisions are made approximately half a ghost - width before executing a turn .
Interestingly , differences in the look - ahead of individual ghosts could account for why it is easier to shake some ghosts off Pac - Man 's tail by turning corners than it is to shake others .
Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown Military establishments , which under any form of Government are inauspicious to liberty , and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to Republican Liberty .
~ George Washington , Farewell Address
The Department of Homeland Security was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( PL 107-296 ) .
It became operational in January of 2003 .
It is the third largest cabinet department in the federal government , with 180,000 employees and a budget of $ 46 billion .
The mission statement of the Homeland Security Department includes this statement : “ We will prevent and deter terrorist attacks and protect against and respond to threats and hazards to the nation . ”
Why , then , do we need a Department of Defense ?
And conversely , if the mission of the Defense Department is to defend the country , then why do we need a Department of Homeland Security ?
The truth of the matter is that the Department of Defense , which could n’t defend its own headquarters , is misnamed .
Rather than guarding our borders , patrolling our coasts , and protecting our citizens , the DOD is focused on — because of our interventionist foreign policy — invading the next country and fighting the next foreign war .
This is not exactly the picture one gets from DOD 101 : An Introductory Overview of the Department of Defense , found on the Department ’s website .
According to the opening paragraph of DOD 101 , the Department of Defense is America ’s oldest , largest , busiest , and most successful company .
Although the DOD was actually created in 1949 , two of its divisions are in fact quite old .
The War Department was established in 1789 and the Navy Department in 1798 .
In 1947 the Department of War became the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force was created .
These three departments were all united under the umbrella of the Department of Defense in 1949 .
Although the DOD should never be termed a company , it is indeed very large , employing over 1.3 million people on active duty , 669,281 civilian personnel , and 1.1 million in the National Guard and Reserve .
There is also no question that the DOD is quite busy .
But is the DOD America ’s most successful company ?
The DOD failed to protect the country on September 11th , 2001 .
The DOD failed to protect its headquarters on the same date .
The only thing of late that the DOD has been successful at is bombing , maiming and killing foreigners , and spending over $ 200 million a day of the taxpayers ’ money on a failed war .
Under the heading of “ Our Global Infrastructure , ” DOD 101 informs us that The Defense Department manages an inventory of installations and facilities to keep Americans safe .
The Department ’s physical plant is huge by any standard , consisting of more than several hundred thousand individual buildings and structures located at more than 5,000 different locations or sites .
When all sites are added together , the Department of Defense utilizes over 30 million acres of land .
There is no mention of the fact that there are over 700 U.S. military bases on foreign soil .
However , we are told in “ Worldwide Presence ” that “ Department of Defense employees work in more than 163 countries .
450,925 troops and civilians are overseas both afloat and ashore .
We operate in every time zone and in every climate . ”
That is quite an admission .
The presence of U.S. troops in foreign countries is something that I have written about many times ( most recently here ) .
For those critics of mine who continue to deny that my figures are accurate , will you also question this admission by the DOD ?
To show just how large the DOD is , the next section of DOD 101 compares the military budget and the number of DOD employees to the budgets and numbers of employees of Wal - Mart , Exxon - Mobil , GM , and Ford .
But is it a good thing that the DOD spends more money and employs more people than the largest U.S. corporations ?
No one who works for Wal - Mart , Exxon - Mobil , GM , or Ford costs the taxpayers a dime .
The military budget for fiscal year 2006 is stated to be $ 419 billion .
But not only did the DOD actually spend $ 499 billion , economist Robert Higgs has estimated that the true amount spent by the United States on defense during fiscal year 2006 was actually $ 934 billion .
This means that defense - related spending for fiscal year 2008 will actually top $ 1 trillion for the first time in history , accounting for about one - third of the total federal budget .
Under the heading of “ We Hire the Best , ” we are told that “ the Department of Defense mission is accomplished seeking out our nation ’s best and brightest . ”
Is that why the Army has relaxed standards , lowered the physical fitness requirements for women , increased waivers for medical problems , and raised the maximum - age limit to 42 ?
Is that why the Army now accepts lower entrance scores on aptitude tests , grants more “ moral waivers ” to allow convicted criminals to enlist , allows more applicants with gang tattoos , and allows non-citizens to gain their citizenship after only one year of active duty ?
And now it has come to light that military recruiters have helped applicants cheat on drug tests .
According to DOD 101 section “ We Instill Values , ” the core values of the Defense Department are leadership , professionalism , and technical know - how .
Furthermore , “ We constantly build and reinforce core values that everyone wearing a uniform must live by : duty , integrity , ethics , honor , courage , and loyalty . ”
But are these the only values that the military instills ?
There is no mention in this section about other values like mistreating non-combatants , destroying civilian property , torturing prisoners , and not reporting the abuses perpetrated by fellow soldiers .
Not only does DOD 101 compare the Defense Department to a company , it also uses the language of the corporate world .
Under the heading of “ Who We Work For , ” we are informed that the chief executive officer is the president , the members of Congress serve as the board of directors , and the American people are the stockholders .
But what kind of a corporation ever forced people to own its stock ?
The section titled “ Services Train and Equip ” contains some startling admissions .
The Army is said to defend “ the land mass of the United States , its territories , commonwealths , and possessions . ”
But then we are told that the Army “ operates in more than 50 countries . ”
Although our Navy ’s aircraft carriers are “ stationed in hotspots that include the Far East , the Persian Gulf , and the Mediterranean Sea , ” there is no mention of our Navy patrolling our coasts .
The Air Force “ routinely participates in peacekeeping , humanitarian , and aeromedical evacuation missions , and actively patrols the skies above Iraq [ and ] Bosnia . ”
We also read that “ Air Force crews annually fly missions into all but five nations of the world . ”
One would get the impression in reading DOD 101 that the Air Force does n’t do anything related to defending the United States .
The National Guard and Reserve are also mentioned in this section .
In addition to providing “ wartime military support ” and undertaking “ humanitarian and peacekeeping operations , ” the Guard and Reserve “ are essential to , and are integral to the Homeland Security portion of our mission . ”
Here is an admission by the DOD that the security of the homeland is only a portion of its mission .
There is no mention , of course , about reenlistment rates for the Guard and Reserve being at an all - time low because of the war in Iraq .
In the section titled “ Unified Commanders , ” we read about the Northern Command , which “ oversees the defense of the continental United States . ”
But why do we have a European Command , which “ covers more than 13 million square miles and includes 93 countries and territories , to include Iceland , Greenland , the Azores , more than half of the Atlantic ocean , the Caspian sea , and Russia ” ?
There is also a Central Command , which “ oversees the balance of the Mid-East , parts of Africa and west Asia , and part of the Indian Ocean , ” a Southern Command , which “ guards U.S. interests in the southern hemisphere , including Central America , South America , and the Caribbean , ” and a Pacific Command , which “ covers 50 percent of the Earth ’s surface including Southwest Asia , Australia . ”
The longest section in DOD 101 is titled “ September 11 , 2001 : Day of Terror . ”
Here we discover that although “ there are currently 70 nations supporting the global war on terrorism , ” to date “ 21 nations have deployed more than 16,000 troops to the U.S. Central Command ’s region of responsibility . ”
No countries are listed , probably because the “ coalition of the willing ” includes such world powers as Albania , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Bosnia - Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Denmark , El Salvador , Estonia , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Latvia , Lithuania , Macedonia , Moldova , Mongolia , Poland , and Romania .
We are also told that “ though there has been significant progress , the war on terror continues . ”
I do n’t know what the DOD means by progress , unless it is referring to the over 3,700 soldiers who died for a lie in Iraq , the 152,000 veterans who filed disability claims after fighting in the war on terror , the 70 female U.S. soldiers who have now been killed fighting in Iraq , or the estimated 655,000 Iraqis who have died since the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
The next part of DOD 101 is called “ Homeland Security and Homeland Defense . ”
This section contains more lies than any other :
The Department of Defense contributes to homeland security through its military missions overseas .
Ongoing military operations abroad have reduced the terrorist threat against the United States .
The Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense .
I think rather that the Department of Defense contributes to the instability of the world through its military missions overseas .
I believe instead that ongoing military operations abroad have increased terrorism .
And if the Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense , then why do we need a Department of Homeland Security ?
Under the heading “ What We Do , ” the closing paragraph reads : “ Whether it ’s saving lives , protecting property or keeping the peace , the U.S. military stands at the ready to keep America strong and free . ”
Saving lives ?
Protecting property ?
Keeping the Peace ?
Does the Defense Department really think that Americans are that naïve ?
In actuality , the DOD does just the opposite : wasting lives , destroying property , and destroying the peace .
The purpose of the U.S. military should be to defend the United States .
That ’s it .
Nothing more .
Using the military for anything else perverts the purpose of the military .
It is not the purpose of the U.S. military to spread democracy or goodwill , remove dictators , change a regime , fight communism or Islam , train foreign armies , open foreign markets , protect U.S. commercial interests , provide disaster relief , or provide humanitarian aid .
The U.S. military should be engaged exclusively in defending the United States , not defending other countries , and certainly not attacking them .
Now that is real DOD 101 .

Facebook CAPE CORAL , Fla . ( AP ) 
Seven popular antibiotics will be available free from Publix supermarkets for people with prescriptions , even if they have a health insurance provider that would pay for them , the company and Gov. Charlie Crist said Monday .
Fourteen - day supplies of the seven drugs , among the most commonly prescribed , will be available at all 684 of the chain 's pharmacies in five states .
Publix said it is not limiting the number of prescriptions that customers may fill for free .
The prescription antibiotics available under the program are amoxicillin , cephalexin , sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim , ciprofloxacin , penicillin VK , ampicillin and erythromycin .
Dr. Andrew Agwunobi , secretary of Florida 's Agency for Health Care Administration and a pediatrician , said many of the antibiotics are prescribed for children , and he noted that Florida has 3.6 million uninsured people and many who have some insurance but no coverage for prescription drugs .
" So I hope ( Publix stores ) are ready , " Agwunobi said , predicting a heavy response .
The company joins other retailers that offer discounted drug programs , including Target ( TGT ) and Wal - Mart Stores ( WMT ) , but Publix Super Markets officials say the company is the first large regional chain to offer certain drugs at no cost .
Wal - Mart Stores is selling a number of generic prescription drugs for $ 4 in hopes that it can draw more shoppers into its stores who may come for prescriptions and then stay to buy in other departments .
" Health and wellness is crucial to every Floridian 's quality of life and paramount to the vitality of our state , " Crist said .
" We appreciate great partners like Publix Super Markets working to further provide affordability and accessibility to quality prescription drugs for working families and seniors . "
" With health care and prescription costs on the rise , our free prescription drug program will reinforce our commitment to the total health and wellness of our customers and their families , " said Publix spokesman Dwaine Stevens .
Most Publix stores are based in Florida , but it also has stores in Georgia , South Carolina , Alabama and Tennessee .

A lot was said lately about the Vorbis / Theora vs h.264/ AAC situation on the draft of the HTML5 .
As some of you know , video is my main hobby these days ( I care not about operating systems anymore ) , so I have gain some experience on the field lately , and at the same time this has made me more demanding about video quality .
Read on for a head to head test : OGG Theora / Vorbis vs MP4 h.264/AAC .
Yup , with videos .
And pictures .
First things first : the disclaimers .
1 . This is not a scientific test .
Both sides will be arguing about this arcane switch , and the other arcane switch , and “ oh , you should have used another encoder ” , this or that .
I do n’t wanna hear that .
I use the most popular and free front - ends for these encoders : ffmpeg with x264 / faac and ffmpeg2theora .
FFmpeg is a command line front - end to many encoders and itself is used by many GUI front - ends too , so it ’s one of the best utilities for the job .
Ffmpeg2theora on the other hand , is the most popular Theora front - end too .
I did n’t use Ffmpeg for Theora because that implementation is still buggy .
FFmpeg2 theora does a better job .
2 . Tests were done on Windows XP 32 bit because the Ubuntu version of ffmpeg does not bundle AAC for legal reasons .
I used a May 2007 version of Ffmpeg ( the latest version crashes repeatedly on Windows when libx264 is used on HT Intel machines ) , and for ffmpeg2 theora I used the latest version , 0.20 .
3 . I used an HDV .m2t file as source file .
My first idea was to use the lossless intermediate Huffyuv format , but it would be problematic trying to upload this to the osnews server , because the file size would be huge .
So , I went with .m2t , I put two clips side by side on Sony Vegas Pro 8 , and then I exported again as .m2t 1080/60i ( interlaced ) .
Vegas does not re-encode clips that were not edited , so this is as close to “ straight out of the camera ” as possible ( only a few frames at the beginning and the end of each clip were re-encoded by Vegas ) .
Download the source clip here ( unzip it ) .
I did two tests : one for a widescreen QVGA format , and one for a 720 p HD one .
I chose these two sizes on purpose .
One format will show us how the codecs perform in low bitrate , which is super - important for web usage , and the other one will show us how well the codecs perform with HD .
QVGA test
FFmpeg command line :
ffmpeg - deinterlace -y - i " orignal.m2t " - threads 2 -f mp4 - title " h.264 QVGA test " - vcodec h264 - level 41 - refs 2 - loop 1 - deblockalpha 0 - deblockbeta 0 - parti4x4 1 - partp8x8 1 - partb8x8 1 - me full - coder ac - subq 6 - brdo 1 - me_range 21 -s 320x180 -r 30000/1001 - b 320 k - maxrate 450 k - bufsize 5000 k -g 300 - acodec aac - ac 2 - ab 128 k " qvga.mp4 "
Ffmpeg2theora command line :
ffmpeg2theora -- optimize -- deinterlace -- title " Theora QVGA test " - f mpg -v 4.2 -F 30 -x 320 -y 176 - A 128 -c 2 - H 44100 -o " qvga.ogg " " orignal.m2 t "
Download the h.264 video version here , Theora video here ( right click to save ) .
Two things of note here : Ffmpeg2 theora would not let me use the resolution that keeps the correct aspect ratio when downscaled from 1920 × 1080 ( anamorphic 1.3333 ) .
I had to use 320×176 ( direct multiple of 8 ) , instead of the correct 320 ×180 .
FFmpeg / x264 had no problem with that .
The second thing is something that really made me angry : Ffmpeg2theora will upsample the NTSC frame rate of 29.97 to 30 fps .
Well , I do n’t want 30 fps , I want 29.97 .
I am accustomed to view lots of my videos on my TV ( usually by using a PS3 ) , so should a Theora2TV device comes out , I want to be able to have smooth frame rate , without adding pulldown and all the problems that brings .
No matter what trick I tried to do , Theora would keep adding pulldown to 30 fps .
Update :
You can get to 29.97 only by either not specifying it at all , or via 30000:1001 ( instead of 30000/1001 or 29.97 ) .
Now , you probably noticed that I gave a “ videoquality ” of “ 4.2 ” to Theora , while I gave FFmpeg 320 kbps video with a 450 kbps peak rate ( VBR ) .
I did this because Theora would simply NOT do what I asked it to .
It would not stay close to the requested 320 kbps , and so it would create a 550 kb file instead of a 640 kb one .
So I changed the Theora command line , by trying different VBR quality numbers , until I got an output file size that matched that of h.264’s .
Remember , the important thing here to remember is THE WEB .
Bandwidth matters .
So it ’s important to know what kind of quality you get from each codec , for the same file size ( not necessarily the same bitrate ) .
As you can see from the tests , h.264 whooped Theora pretty bad on this test .
Even when I gave the benefit of the doubt to Theora and re-encoded it in 400 kbps , h.264 was still visibly much better .
720p
FFmpeg command line :
ffmpeg - deinterlace -y - i " orignal.m2t " - threads 2 -f mp4 - title " h.264 720 p test " - vcodec h264 - level 41 - refs 2 - loop 1 - deblockalpha 0 - deblockbeta 0 - parti4x4 1 - partp8x8 1 - partb8x8 1 - me full - coder ac - subq 6 - brdo 1 - me_range 21 -s 1280x720 -r 30000/1001 - b 5000 k - maxrate 6000 k - bufsize 15000 k -g 300 - acodec aac - ac 2 - ab 128 k " 720 p.mp4 "
Ffmpeg2theora command line :
ffmpeg2theora -- optimize -- deinterlace -- title " Theora 720 p test " - f mpg -v 4.3 -F 30 -x 1280 -y 720 - A 128 -c 2 - H 44100 -o " 720p-theora.ogg " " orignal.m2 t "
Download the h.264 cabac video version here , Theora video here ( right click to save ) .
Again , a quality number was used for Theora to match h.264 ’s file size at the requested 5 Mbps ( with 6 mbps peak rate ) .
I did two ffmpeg passes , one with the CABAC entropy coding , and one with the CAVLC one ( just change the “ - coder ac ” to “ - coder vlc ” in the ffmpeg code above ) .
CABAC creates better looking video than CAVLC , but it ’s harder to decode ( Quicktime chokes good on it , for example , on my P4 3 Ghz ) .
I usually encode my stuff in CAVLC simply because I might find myself sharing my own videos to people with AppleTVs or slower PCs , so I am trying to play nice .
HD is HD , so even if Theora again performs worse than h.264 , there is enough resolution that the differences might not as obvious as in the QVGA example .
For example , I have an old CRT HDTV , which barely manages well 1080i , so the difference would not be much visible ( heck , on my TV I barely see the difference between Comcast ’s HD channels and progressive DVDs ) .
However , people with big LCDs or Plasmas will be able to see more artifacts — should a device that playbacks Theora on TVs comes to market .
Another interesting tidbit about the 720 p test is the encoding times !
H.264 did 1′.15 ″ for CAVLC and 1′.20 ″ for CABAC on my PC .
Theora took its sweet time and finished at 3′.14 ″ .
Granted , I used two threads on the FFmpeg command line , while it was obvious to me by monitoring my Hyperthreaded CPU that FFmpeg2 theora was single - threaded .
But even if you divide the 3′.14 ″ by 2 , you get 1′.37 ″ , which is still slower than h.264 ’s encoding times .
Now , a last point , CPU utilization during decoding .
Of course , this is implementation - specific , but you know , you gotta test with whatever is popular , no matter if their implementation sucks or not .
So I used VLC and a new version of Media Player Classic .
VLC used on average 65 % of my hyperthraded CPU on CAVLC , 75 % on CABAC and 75 % on Theora .
MPC used 34 % on CAVLC , 43 % on CABAC and 33 % on Theora .
These were rough averages during multiple times of running each video .
Conclusion
I prefer h.264 .
Goodnight everyone .
Ok , ok , not yet goodnight .
Truth is , I prefer open standards and open source and Free Software and what not , over proprietary royalty / patent - ridden solutions .
But pictures ( and videos ) do n’t lie .
Theora is simply not at the same league as h.264 .
Vorbis fairs well compared to the big 3 audio formats , but Theora is visibly worse in comparison .
By their own admission in the past , the Theora developers had to use less efficient algorithms to go around patents .
This sucks of course , but it all comes down to this : do you want an open FOSS solution , or you want the best solution ?
Many readers on OSNews will choose the first option , but their teenager brother would probably choose the second .
Some say that Dirac is better , and it ’s free / open .
But until their developers actually do take the time and commit their implementation to ffmpeg ( instead of only offering patchsets ) , it just does n’t exist for me .
FFmpeg — with all its problems …
Come on , no automatic letterboxing ??– is used by many GUI front - ends , so if they want market penetration , they gotta add their encoder to ffmpeg .
Then , I will give them a whirl too .

A new map of Antarctica which is expected to revolutionise research of the continent 's frozen landscape has been unveiled , scientists said .
Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey , NASA , the US Geological Survey and the US National Science Foundation unveiled the map at a press conference in Washington .
The Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica uses NASA 's state - of - the - art satellite technologies and provides a nearly cloudless view of the continent at a resolution 10 times greater than ever before .
The map has been heralded as the " the most geographically accurate , true - colour , high - resolution views of Antarctica to date , " a NASA spokesman said .
Scroll down for more ...
The map has been released as several territorial claims , including one by Britain , look set to be made .
Andrew Fleming , of the British Antarctic Survey , said : " The mosaic represents an important US - UK collaboration and is a major contribution to the International Polar Year . "
The International Polar Year refers to the scientific programme focused on the Arctic and the Antarctic .
" Over 60,000 scientists are involved in the global International Polar Year initiative to understand our world . "

I have no doubt that polar researchers will find this mosaic , one of the first outcomes of that initiative , invaluable for planning science campaigns . "
Robert Bindschadler , chief scientist of the Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Centre , said : " This mosaic of images opens up a window to the Antarctic that we just have n't had before . "
" It will open new windows of opportunity for scientific research as well as enable the public to become much more familiar with Antarctica and how scientists use imagery in their research . "
" This innovation is like watching high - definition TV in living colour versus watching the picture on a grainy black - and - white television . "
Scroll down for more ...
" These scenes do n't just give us a snapshot , they provide a time - lapse historical record of how Antarctica has changed and will enable us to continue to watch changes unfold . "
Researchers will be able to use the images to plan future scientific expeditions .
To construct the new Antarctic map , researchers pieced together more than a thousand images from three years of Landsat satellite observations .
The resulting mosaic gives researchers and the public a new way to explore Antarctica through a free internet site at http://lima.usgs.gov
Analysis
At some point in the latter decades of the 20th century , someone sat down and thought : would n't it be nice if all the money in the world was controlled by scientists rather than accountants and nice chaps from Eton ?
Now , as we march headlong into the 21st century , full of sub - prime fallout , to a decent approximation , what we 're seeing is just that : a better quality of screwup .
The way banks lend money has changed , and in step with this , so has the way they calculate and manage risk .
I can still leave a deposit on a Porsche
What are the odds ?
Banks use highly complex mathematical models to estimate what is going on and what they should do about it .
In the olden days ( the 1980s ) , when a bank lent you money , it was risking its own capital .
If you ran off laughing , they took the hit .
If you were asking them for a mortgage to buy a house , banks lent up to 75 per cent of the value of the property , and if they really liked you might go from the standard 2.5 multiple of salary , to 3 .
If your wife worked , then tough , and do n't even mention gay couples .
Credit derivatives have made borrowing both cheaper and more flexible , which is mostly good .
Banks have sold off the cashflow from loans for many years , typically in large portfolios to keep the admin costs down and avoid one bad risk being an issue .
This securitisation moves the risk off the books of the bank , and is the basis of a wave of financial innovation , led by banks in London .
Moving risk to those who will take it on for a price is critical to how modern investment banking works , and almost any set of cash flows can be engineered so that they can be sold as a single product .
David Bowie was one of the first to benefit from this .
Whereas Paul McCartney lost control of his music , Bowie borrowed $ 55 m secured against future royalties , and ten years later he now has the songs back with no loss of control .
Bernie Ecclestone raised $ 1.4bn in much the same way , but unlike shares , bonds do n't vote , so he kept control .
So how does this work ?
If a bank has mortgages with a face value of 100 million ( chose a currency , any currency ) , it can be sure it 's going to lose some , but not lose the lot either .
That means you can chop up the risky portfolio into tranches , giving first call on ( say ) 90 per cent which is pretty much risk free , with layers of increasing risk .
Some investors are quite happy to take a lower rate of return , if they can be sure what that rate will be .
So in addition to the risk being concentrated in a smaller group , so is the reward .
But how do you decide where to draw the line ?
Is it 90 per cent or 91 per cent ?
You have to convince both the customer and the ratings agencies , such as S&P or Fitch , that your portfolio really is as safe as you say .
Riskier tranches have higher returns , on average , but with increasing variance , with a bottom " equity " layer which takes the first hit of any losses .
This is potentially the most profitable , but when they go bad these risky layers get called " toxic waste " .
As we 've seen recently a credit rating is not constant .
Not even slightly .
All the hype about perl 5.10 can sound a little intimidating .
User - level pragmata !
Overloadable smartmatching operator !
Thread - safe refkey hashes !
For Pete 's sake , have you heard about lexically scoped pluggable regexp engines ?
It 's enough to make you think that 5.10 's changes are just for the hard - core perl hackers , but it could n't be further from the truth !
The new version of Perl is full of changes that are easy to use and pack lots of useful benefits for doing plain old every day Perl programming .
We 'll look at the new features , small and large , and see why you , too , will love 5.10 .
Via Hilzoy , Peter Beinart writes about his early support for the Iraq invasion .
“ I was willing to gamble , too–partly , I suppose , because , in the era of the all - volunteer military , I was n’t gambling with my own life .
And partly because I did n’t think I was gambling many of my countrymen’s .
I had come of age in that surreal period between Panama and Afghanistan , when the United States won wars easily and those wars benefited the people on whose soil they were fought .
It ’s a truism that American intellectuals have long been seduced by revolution .
In the 1930s , some grew intoxicated with the revolutionary potential of the Soviet Union .
In the 1960s , some felt the same way about Cuba .
In the 1990s , I grew intoxicated with the revolutionary potential of the United States .
Some non-Americans did , too .
“ All the Iraqi democratic voices that still exist , all the leaders and potential leaders who still survive , ” wrote Salman Rushdie in November 2002 , “ are asking , even pleading for the proposed regime change .
Will the American and European left make the mistake of being so eager to oppose Bush that they end up seeming to back Saddam Hussein ? ” I could n’t answer that then .
It seemed irrefutable .
But there was an answer , and it was the one I heard from that South African many years ago .
It begins with a painful realization about the United States :
We ca n’t be the country those Iraqis wanted us to be .
We lack the wisdom and the virtue to remake the world through preventive war .
That ’s why a liberal international order , like a liberal domestic one , restrains the use of force –because it assumes that no nation is governed by angels , including our own .
And it ’s why liberals must be anti-utopian , because the United States cannot be a benign power and a messianic one at the same time .
That ’s not to say the United States can never intervene to stop aggression or genocide .
It ’s not even to say that we can ’t , in favorable circumstances and with enormous effort , help build democracy once we ’re there .
But it does mean that , when our fellow democracies largely oppose a war–as they did in Vietnam and Iraq –because they think we ’re deluding ourselves about either our capacities or our motives , they ’re probably right .
Being a liberal , as opposed to a neoconservative , means recognizing that the United States has no monopoly on insight or righteousness .
Some Iraqis might have been desperate enough to trust the United States with unconstrained power .
But we should n’t have trusted ourselves . ”
Hilzoy adds , wisely , “ It ’s not just that we are n’t the country Beinart wanted to think we were ; it ’s that war is not the instrument he thought it was . ”
I suggest reading Hilzoy ’s post all the way through ; it ’s very good .
But I want to go on to another thought here .
Yesterday I wrote about nonviolent resistance and quoted from an article in the Spring 2007 issue of the American Buddhist magazine Tricycle â€ ” available to subscribers only â€ ” called â€ œThe Disappearance of the Spiritual Thinkerâ€ by Pankaj Mishra .
It begins :
â€ œI NEVER KNEW A MAN , â€ Graham Greene famously wrote in The Quiet American , â€ œwho had better motives for all the trouble he caused .â€ 
After the disaster in Iraq , Greeneâ€™s 1955 description of an idealistic American intellectual blundering through Vietnam seems increasingly prescient .
People shaped entirely by book learning and enthralled by intellectual abstractions such as â€œdemocracyâ€ and â€œnation - buildingâ€ are already threatening to make the new century as bloody as the previous one .
It is too easy to blame millenarian Christianity for the ideological fanaticism that led powerful men in the Bush administration to try to remake the reality of the Middle East .
But many liberal intellectuals and human rights activists also supported the invasion of Iraq , justifying violence as a means to liberation for the Iraqi people .
How did the best and the brightest–people from Ivy League universities , big corporations , Wall Street , and the media–end up inflicting , despite their best intentions , violence and suffering on millions ?
Three decades after David Halberstam posed this question in his best - selling book on the origins of the Vietnam War , The Best and the Brightest , it continues to be urgently relevant :
Why does the modern intellectual–a person devoted as much professionally as temperamentally to the life of the mind–so often become , as Albert Camus wrote , â€ œthe servant of hatred and oppressionâ€ ?
What is it about the intellectual life of the modern world that causes it to produce a kind of knowledge so conspicuously devoid of wisdom ?
What is it about the intellectual life of the modern world that causes it to produce a kind of knowledge so conspicuously devoid of wisdom ?
Wow , that ’s a question , is n’t it ?
Where do overeducated twits like Doug Feith and Paul Wolfowitz and Condi Rice come from , and how the hell did they get put in charge of foreign policy ?
They may be articulate , and they have Ph.D.s and impressive resumes , but they do n’t have the sense God gave onions .
THE POWER OF secular ideas–and of the men espousing them –was first highlighted by the revolutions in Europe and America and the colonization of vast tracts of Asia and Africa , and then with Communist social engineering in Russia and China .
These great and often bloody efforts to remake entire societies and cultures were led by intellectuals with passionately held conceptions of the good life ; they possessed clear - cut theories of what state and society should mean ; and in place of traditional religion , which they had already debunked , they were inspired by a new self - motivating religion : a belief in the power of â€œhistory .â€ 
It took two world wars , totalitarianism , and the Holocaust for many European thinkers to see how the truly extraordinary violence of the twentieth century –what Camus called the â€œslave camps under the flag of freedom , massacres justified by philanthropyâ€ –derived from a purely historical mode of reasoning , which made the unpredictable realm of human affairs appear as amenable to manipulation as a block of wood is to a carpenter .
Shocked like many European intellectuals by the mindless slaughter of the First World War , the French poet Paul ValÃ ©ry dismissed as absurd the many books that had been written entitled â€ œthe lesson of this , the teaching of thatâ€ and that presumed to show the way to the future .
The Thousand - Year Reich , which collapsed after twelve years , ought to have buried the fantasy of human control over history .
But advances in technological warfare strengthened the conceit , especially among the biggest victors of the Second World War , that they were â€œhistoryâ€™s actorsâ€  and , as a senior adviser to President Bush told the journalist Ron Suskind in 2004 , that â€ œwhen we act we create our own reality .â€ 
These are the same people who have pathological confidence in themselves , of course .
As Peter Birkenhead wrote , “ Pumped up by steroidic pseudo - confidence and anesthetized by doubt - free sentimentality , they are incapable of feeling anything authentic and experiencing the world . ”
Perhaps its a class thing ; perhaps these are people who have lived lives so buffered from failure and the consequences of misjudgments that they never learned a healthy respect for failure and the consequences of misjudgments .
History as an aid to the evolution of the human race seems to be most fully worked out by the respected Harvard historian Niall Ferguson .
Writing in the New York Times Magazine a few weeks after the invasion of Iraq , Ferguson declared himself a â€œfully paid - up member of the neo- imperialist gang , â€ and asserted that the United States should own up to its imperial responsibilities and provide in places like Afghanistan and Iraq â€ œthe sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self - confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets .â€ 
In his recent book Colossus : The Rise and Fall of the American Empire ( 2004 ) , Ferguson argues that â€œmany parts of the world would benefit from a period of American rule.â€ 
Ferguson has a regular column at the Los Angeles Times .
And he ’s a classic overeducated twit .
But back to Pankaj Mishra :
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE now how this all began , how , in the nineteenth century , the concept of history acquired its significance and prestige .
This was not history as the first great historians Herodotus and Thucydides had seen it : as a record of events worth remembering or commemorating .
After a period of extraordinary dynamism in the nineteenth century , many people in Western Europe–not just Hegel and Marx–concluded that history was a way of charting humanityâ€™s progress to a higher state of evolution .
In its developed form the ideology of history described a rational process whose specific laws could be known and mastered just as accurately as processes in the natural sciences .
Backward natives in colonized societies could be persuaded or forced to duplicate this process ; and the noble end of progress justified the sometimes dubious means–such as colonial wars and massacres .
Pankaj Mishra is arguing that this view of history is a kind of secular thinking , and it is , but not purely so .
I ’ve been reading Mark Lilla ’s book The Stillborn God : Religion , Politics and the Modern West .
I blogged about this book here and here .
Very briefly , Lilla writes about the nexus of politics and religion in western civilization , particularly since the end of the Reformation and the publication of Thomas Hobbes ’s Leviathan .
I ’m not all the way through it yet .
But he seems to be building an argument that messianic religion as a habit of mind continually re-asserts itself and seeps into secular thought .
So we have public intellectuals who may or may not be followers of religion or believers in God , but who still think in messianic terms .
However , instead of looking forward to the Second Coming , secular messianic thought sees history building toward some politically and economically ideal future as if compelled by natural law .
Some might argue that any kind of messianic thought is religious , but defining religion that way would make Christopher Hitchens the bleeping pope .
Lilla ’s book suffers a bit from a narrow understanding of religion , IMO .
But perhaps that ’s me .
As I wrote a couple of days ago , east Asian religions as a rule think of time and events , cause and effect , as circular rather than linear .
The revered Zen master Dogen Zenji ( 1200 - 1250 ) presents linear time as a kind of delusion ; see Uji .
If you do n’t perceive time and history as linear it ’s hard to be messianic .
However , as I ’ve said elsewhere , certainly Asia has seen its share of mass movements bent on shaping history — China under Mao comes to mind .
Pankaj Mishra continues ,
This instrumental view of humanity , which Communist regimes took to a new extreme with their bloody purges and gulags , couldnâ€™t be further from the Buddhist notion that only wholesome methods can lead to truly wholesome ends .
It is in direct conflict with the notion of nirvana , the end of suffering , a goal many secular and modern intellectuals purport to share , but which can only be achieved through the extinction of attachment , hatred , and delusion .
Indeed , no major traditions of Asia or Africa accommodate the notion that history is a meaningful narrative shaped by human beings .
Time , in fact , is rarely conceptualized as linear progression in many Asian and African cultures ; rather , it is custom and religion that circumscribe human interventions in the world .
Buddhism , for instance , in its emphasis on compassion and interdependence , is innately inhospitable to the Promethean spirit of self - aggrandizement and conquest that has shaped the new â€œhistoricalâ€ view of human prowess .
This was partly true also for many European cultures until the modern era , when scientific and technological innovations began to foster the belief that manâ€™s natural and social environment was to be subject to rational manipulation and that history itself , no longer seen as a neutral , objective narrative , could be shaped by the will and action of man .
It was this faith in rational manipulation that powered the political , scientific , and technological revolutions of the West in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ; it was also used to explain and justify Western domination of the world–a fact that gave conviction to such words as progress and history ( as much ideological buzzwords of the nineteenth century as democracy and globalization are of the present moment ) .
Now we circle back to Peter Beinart and other prominent “ public intellectuals ” :
The great material and technological success of the West , and the growth of mass literacy and higher education , produced its own model of the secular thinker : someone trained , usually in academia , in logical thinking and possessed of a great number of historical facts .
No moral or spiritual distinction was considered necessary for this thinker ; not more than technical expertise was asked of the scientists who helped create the nuclear weapons that could destroy the world many times over .
I should note , to be fair , that Robert Oppenheimer had studied eastern religion , particularly Hindu .
IT IS STRANGE TO THINK how quickly the figure of the spiritually - minded thinker disappeared from the mainstream of the modern West , to live on precariously in underdeveloped societies like India .
It was left to marginal religious figures such as Simone Weil , Reinhold Niebuhr , and Thomas Merton to exercise a moral and spiritual intelligence untrammeled by the conviction that science or socialism or free trade or democracy were helping mankind march to a historically predetermined and glorious future .
But then , as Hannah Arendt wrote , â€ œThe nineteenth centuryâ€™s obsession with history and commitment to ideology still looms so large in the political thinking of our times that we are inclined to regard entirely free thinking , which employs neither history nor coercive logic as crutches , as having no authority over us.â€ [ emphasis added ]
We do n’t often think of history as a crutch .
Maybe we ’ve become a little too obsessed with remembering history so we do n’t repeat it .
Since the invasion of Iraq we ’ve argued whether Iraq is World War II or Vietnam or some other historical relic rattling around in our national attic .
What we do n’t do so much is try to understand Iraq as Iraq .
Of course , we do n’t remember our history as - it - was , either , but as we want to believe it was .
In America , religious and political ideology have always been interconnected , but in recent years we ’ve taken this interconnection to absurd degrees .
For example , the above - mentioned Niall Ferguson argues that America is more productive than Europe because our workers go to church more often than their workers .
This begs the question — why is productivity a more “ religious ” virtue than , say , spending more time away from work to be with family ?
I think what we ’re really seeing here is less about religion and more about voluntary submission to the authority of churches and employers .
But do n’t hold your breath waiting for a public intellectual like Ferguson to make that connection .
That requires thinking outside the box , and our public intellectuals are like a priestly caste charged with maintaining and protecting the box .
Peter Beinart may be trying , however .
“ [ L ] iberals must be anti-utopian , because the United States cannot be a benign power and a messianic one at the same time , ” he said .
Exactly .
But we ’ve got a job ahead of us explaining that to the rest of America .

New law puts most of S.F. off - limits to sex parolees
M&R_245.JPG
A small area near AT&T park is the only place available to sex offenders near the Bay Bridge .
Any area within the circles is not legal .
California has notified 2,700 sex offenders around the state that they must move further from parks and schools because of the new Jessica 's Law .
A map of the city now shows only a few areas sex offenders may live in the south and far eastern parts of the city .

More than 2,700 paroled sex offenders across the state , including nearly 400 in the Bay Area , have been given 45 days to pack up and move or risk going back to prison .
The reason :
They are banned from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park , under a new law California voters approved last fall .
Finding a new home wo n't be easy for many of them , however .
That 's especially true for those living in a big city such as San Francisco , where it 's nearly impossible to find a residence that is n't within 2,000 feet of a school or park .
According to the big laminated map drawn up by the police sex crimes unit at the San Francisco Hall of Justice , only two places in the city seem to meet the new 2,000 - foot stay - away rule : the area around AT&T Park , where condos are going for $ 500,000 and up , and a narrow strip along Ocean Beach .
By the time state agents were done knocking on doors Friday , 46 parolees in San Francisco had been notified they must find new living quarters .
Similar numbers of parolees were notified in San Mateo and Contra Costa counties .
In Alameda County , more than 100 were told to move , and in Santa Clara County the total was about 140 , according to parole officials .
The number of wandering sex offenders could have been even greater , had the courts gone along with state Attorney General Jerry Brown ' sinsistence that the voter - approved initiative , Proposition 83 , be applied to any previously registered offender who moves to a new home .
The courts did n't agree with Brown , however , so 90,000 parolees statewide were exempted .
As it is , only sex offenders paroled since the initiative passed are covered .
But with anywhere from 400 to 700 additional offenders being paroled in California each month and returned by law to the counties where they last lived , it 's just a matter of time before space runs out .
Under the voter - approved initiative , it 's up to the parolees to find new housing - and if they can't , they could wind up back in the slammer .
" That 's the Catch - 22 , " said Phillip Torda , a spokesman for the adult parole division of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Gavin 's grand move : City Hall insiders were n't all that surprised at San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ' sout - of - the - blue call for resignation letters from his administration this week .
After all :
1. Newsom has long had a penchant for making sweeping public pronouncements - it 's the follow - up where he falls short .
2. Newsom has never been comfortable firing anyone one - on - one , so having everyone go on the block as some sort of mass policy play fits his style .
But this play could produce a few unpleasant surprises .
Take the Police Department , for example .
It 's no secret that both Police Chief Heather Fong and some of the civilian commissioners who oversee the department are on the outs with the mayor , and that he might be happy to accept their resignations .
But some police commissioners are appointed by the Board of Supervisors and do n't have to kowtow to Newsom , as panel President Theresa Sparks points out .
Sparks , a board appointee who is no favorite of the mayor 's , also notes that there 's nothing Newsom can do even if his own appointees do n't turn in resignation letters .
Under a law passed by city voters , " the only way we can be removed is by a vote of the Board of Supervisors , " Sparks said .
And if Fong is not a target in the Newsom shakeup ?
Well , the commission might be able to force her out anyway if she hands in a resignation letter , simply by accepting it , Sparks said .
In other words , Newsom may be setting up a dynamic where the commission and not the mayor gets to make the call on the chief .
The can - didate : Looks like San Francisco mayoral candidate Grasshopper Kaplan will be doing his campaigning from jail for the next couple of days .
Grasshopper , a homeless cab driver , was picked up the other day for camping in Supervisor Ed Jew 's driveway .
( Jew 's San Francisco driveway , that is . )
Grasshopper , who has made being homeless an issue , was trying to draw attention to the fact that Jew allegedly did n't live at the house , or even in his district , when he ran for supervisor last year .
Unfortunately for Grasshopper , Jew is definitely living at the 28th Avenue house now , and was n't too happy when he found Grasshopper in the driveway , yelling at a next - door neighbor at 2 o'clock in the morning .
As a result , Grasshopper has new campaign headquarters at the county jail , where he is being held on a variety of charges .
From what we hear , he 's not winning a lot of votes there , either .
He 's been put in a medical unit after throwing a chair against his cell door and dumping his dinner on the floor until he got vegan meals .
Civil ceremony : Oakland City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente 's son quietly wed his girlfriend Sunday in the same Alameda County courthouse where he pleaded guilty earlier this year to a string of rapes and sexual assaults involving prostitutes .
Dad and about a dozen other family members were in attendance for the civil ceremony - as were five sheriff 's deputies who searched the guests and escorted 32 - year - old Ignacio De La Fuente Jr. from his cell to a secure courtroom .
It was the first time Sheriff Gregory Ahern had been asked to allow a prisoner to get married since taking over the job in January , sheriff 's spokesman Sgt. J.D. Nelson said .
" No ( deputy ) overtime was used , " Nelson added .
The bride lives in Redwood City and has lived with the younger De La Fuente for the better part of a decade .
Dad would n't say why the couple chose to tie the knot now .
But those in the know say it would be harder for De La Fuente Jr. to marry after he is sentenced to what is expected to be a 14 - year term in state prison .

TRY THIS .
AT&T announced earlier this year that was planning to introduce content filtering of some sort for all video passing across its network .
Exactly what AT&T was thinking remained unclear : would the company truly attempt to reassemble the fragments of peer - to - peer transmissions , then extract video from all sorts of different codecs , then attempt to match it - in real time - to some database of copyrighted works ?
Would such a thing even be possible ?
It 's still not clear how AT&T plans to deploy its system , but the company is serious about it .
Further evidence of that came today , when a brief Wall Street Journal writeup ( subscription ) pointed out that the company has just invested in Vobile .
Vobile 's core product is a screening technology that it calls " VideoDNA . "
Like other systems of its kind , VideoDNA develops a unique signature from every frame of video .
The signature is meant to be robust enough to survive various transformations and edits , and it can then be used to run matches against incoming content .
Vobile pitches its products as being especially suitable for content tracking and management purposes .
Video - sharing sites could deploy the technology to flag user - uploaded content for possible copyright violations .
But , as Vobile 's site notes , VideoDNA is also quick enough to be deployed on video " when it 's transported over a network . "
AT&T has yet to publicly pick a winning technology ( plenty of other companies are working on similar video identification technology ) , and it has n't even revealed the scope of its plans .
But the interest in video filtering does n't appear to have faded after months of time in which executives could ponder the important questions of just how such a system would work and ( perhaps more importantly ) what customers would think of it .
Based on the complexity of the problem , we suspect that anything initially deployed by AT&T will fall far short of a robust P2P video filter .
But should AT&T truly have its eyes on just such a prize , the company would be in a powerful position to impose its own policies on the entire US , since it owns major parts of the Internet backbone .
It will also be in a plum position when it comes to dealing with the MPAA and with networks like NBC ; both groups have been calling on ISPs to implement exactly this sort of filtering for months .
Vobile , for its part , is also serious about its work .
Earlier this month , it added Gideon Yu to company 's Board of Directors .
Yu is the chief financial officer of Facebook , and also served as the CFO of a little startup called YouTube before it was sold to Google .
Yu calls Vobile 's tech " a revolutionary step forward for the industry . "
We may get a chance to find out just how excited consumers are about this revolutionary step forward if AT&T does end up adopting the Vobile VideoDNA tech .
KRISTOL : Every Democratic presidential nominee is going to the DailyKos convention .
That ’s the left - wing blogger who was not respectable three or four years ago .
The Howard Dean kind of sponsor .
Now the whole party is going to pay court to him and to left wing blogs .
Not a single one is going to the Democratic Leadership Council meeting in a couple of weeks .
That ’s the organization that Bill Clinton was head of in the early ’90s — that was supposed to be the new , more moderate Democratic Party .
The Democratic Party has gone left and it will hurt them in 2008 .
WILLIAMS : What you described as left is now center .
The majority of the American people , 70 percent , want us out of Iraq .
In fact , if you asked Iraqis , 60 some percent of Iraqis say we ’re doing more harm than good in Iraq .
There ’s a center here and I think what you ’re saying is they ’re playing somehow to the left .
In fact , what has happened is that people are frustrated and frustrated when you see this week that the administration has already started spin control on the upcoming September report .
Now all of a sudden November is the new September .
We ’re supposed to wait until November to hear .
When you say her vote is wrong , wait a second , you said this two years ago , you said this five years ago , you said it before 3600 people were dead .
Oh , this is the wrong vote .
When are we supposed to say enough is enough in terms of Iraq ?
Monkeys invest less energy in a task if they see other monkeys receiving better rewards for the same effort , researchers report .
They say that their experiment provides new evidence that non-human primates can feel envy .
The findings could also help explain why humans have such a keen sense of fairness , according to experts .
Previous studies have found that monkeys put less effort into a task when they see cage - mates receiving tastier treats for completing the same task .
But scientists have not felt confident in saying why the poorly rewarded animals slack off .
Some people have suggested the primates that refuse to repeat the task are simply greedy and therefore only willing to work for a bigger reward .
Alternately , it has been proposed that the monkeys stop performing the task because they have received large rewards in the past and feel frustrated by the measly amounts offered in later trials .
To understand the monkeys ’ reluctance to participate in the task , Frans de Waal at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta , Georgia , US , and colleagues decided to try several variations on this experiment .

Fruits of labour
They trained 13 capuchin monkeys ( Cebus apella ) to retrieve a small rock and place it in the experimenter ’s hands .
In exchange for completing this task , the animals received a reward .
Pairs of monkeys were seated beside one another in a test booth , separated by a mesh partition .
In one trial , the monkeys received the same sized cucumber reward for their efforts and 90 % completed the task within 5 seconds .
But then the researchers gave one of the monkeys a grape instead of a cucumber .
To a human this may seem like a minor detail , but monkeys go bananas over grapes , which they far prefer to cucumbers .
When the monkeys given cucumber saw their partners receive this grape reward , they invested less effort in future repetitions of the task , and completed it within 5 seconds only 80 % of the time .
In a third scenario , the monkeys both received the same cucumber reward , but could see a bowl of grapes just beyond their reach .
Under these circumstances , the animals performed the task with the same willingness as when the grapes were hidden .
The researchers say that this rules out the possibility that the primates alter their behaviour out of greed .
Species variation
De Waal ’s team also found that the monkeys exhibited the same patterns of behaviour regardless of whether they had received a grape or cucumber in preceding experiments , discounting the possibility that the animals slacked off out of frustration from unmet expectations .
They say the study “ confirms that capuchin monkeys react negatively to situations in which they receive a less favourable reward than their partner for the same task .
Our control procedures suggest that this response was due solely to the discrepancy between the monkey ’s own and the other ’s rewards and not to individual factors such as greed or frustration . ”
Other experts , however , note that earlier studies have shown that monkeys and chimps do not always care about fairness .
Keith Jensen at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , recently demonstrated that chimpanzees will accept a rotten deal from a fellow chimp .
Jensen says that understanding how non-human primates view fairness can provide clues about how humans evolved a great capacity for cooperation .
But he adds : “ Human cooperation is special ” .

Officer Lora heard the crash from inside his home and ran outside .
He was wearing civilian clothes and was carrying his police - issue 9 - millimeter Glock handgun .
The officer had his badge clipped to the waistband of his jeans , witnesses said .
By the time he arrived at the accident scene , many people had gathered around the minivan , witnesses said .
Officer Lora told investigators that when he approached the vehicle and opened the driver ’s side door , he found that Mr. Arzu was irrational and unresponsive to his questions and commands .
The officer said that it appeared as if Mr. Arzu was intoxicated , and that he failed to produce his driver ’s license .
Witnesses said the two men were heard yelling at each other .
At one point , the officer said , Mr. Arzu reached for the glove compartment .
No weapon was found in the vehicle .
Officer Lora told investigators that Mr. Arzu tried to close the minivan ’s door and then began to drive away slowly , pulling the officer , who was partly in the van , with him .
After finding that he could not free himself , Officer Lora lost his footing and began to shoot , according to the account he gave to the authorities .
After a few moments , he was able to extricate himself from the minivan , and the vehicle continued moving forward for about two blocks before it struck another car , hit the wall of a church and a pole and caught fire .
Mr. Arzu , who was not burned , was killed by a bullet that struck him in the back and pierced his heart , lung and aorta .
Four other bullets were found lodged in the minivan .
Mr. London , Officer Lora ’s lawyer , said that his client , a member of the department ’s Manhattan Traffic Task Force , is a nine - year veteran of the department .
A married father of a 2 - year - old child , he is former marine and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war .
Are you using Windows Vista ?
Then you might as well know that the licensed operating system installed on your machine is harvesting a healthy volume of information for Microsoft .
In this context , a program such as the Windows Genuine Advantage is the last of your concerns .
In fact , in excess of 20 Windows Vista features and services are hard at work collecting and transmitting your personal data to the Redmond company .
Microsoft makes no secret about the fact that Windows Vista is gathering information .
End users have little to say , and no real choice in the matter .
The company does provide both a Windows Vista Privacy Statement and references within the End User License Agreement for the operating system .
Combined , the resources paint the big picture over the extent of Microsoft 's end user data harvest via Vista .
Reading Between the EULA Lines
Together with Windows Vista , Microsoft also provides a set of Internet - based services , for which it has reserved full control , including alteration and cancellation at any given time .
The Internet - based services in Vista " coincidentally " connect to Microsoft and to " service provider computer systems . "
Depending on the specific service , users may or may not receive a separate notification of the fact that their data is being collected and shared .
The only way to prevent this is to know the specific services and features involved and to either switch them off or not use them .
The alternative ?
Well , it 's written in the Vista license agreement .
" By using these features , you consent to the transmission of this information .
Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you . "
The Redmond company emphasized numerous times the fact that all information collected is not used to identify or contact users .
But could it ?
Oh yes !
All you have to know is that Microsoft could come knocking on your door as soon as you boot Windows Vista for the first time if you consider the system 's computer information harvested .
Microsoft will get your " Internet protocol address , the type of operating system , browser and name and version of the software you are using , and the language code of the device where you installed the software . "
But all they really need is your IP address .
What 's Covered in the Vista License ?
Windows Update , Web Content , Digital Certificates , Auto Root Update , Windows Media Digital Rights Management , Windows Media Player , Malicious Software Removal / Clean On Upgrade , Network Connectivity Status Icon , Windows Time Service , and the IPv6 Network Address Translation ( NAT ) Traversal service ( Teredo ) are the features and services that collect and deliver data to Microsoft from Windows Vista .
By using any of these items , you agree to share your information with the Redmond Company .
Microsoft says that users have the possibility to disable or not use the features and services altogether .
But at the same time Windows update is crucial to the security of Windows Vista , so turning it off is not really an option , is it ?
Windows Vista will contact Microsoft to get the right hardware drivers , to provide web - based " clip art , templates , training , assistance and Appshelp , " to access digital software certificates designed " confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information " and to refresh the catalog with trusted certificate authorities .
Of course that the Windows Vista Digital Rights Management could not miss from a list of services that contact Microsoft on a regular basis .
If you want access to protected content , you will also have to let the Windows Media Digital Rights Management talk home .
Windows Media Player in Vista for example , will look for codecs , new versions and local online music services .
The Malicious Software Removal tool will report straight to Microsoft with both the findings of your computer scan , but also any potential errors .
Also , in an effort to enable the transition to IP v6 from IP v4 , " by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals . "
Had Enough ?
I Didn't Think So !
Microsoft has an additional collection of 47 Windows Vista features and services that collect user data .
However , not all phone home and report to Microsoft .
Although the data collection process is generalized across the list , user information is also processed and kept on the local machine , leaving just approximately 50 % of the items to both harvest data and contact Microsoft .
Still , Microsoft underlined the fact that the list provided under the Windows Vista Privacy Statement is by no means exhaustive , nor does it apply to all the company 's websites , services and products .
Activation , Customer Experience Improvement Program ( CEIP ) , Device Manager , Driver Protection , Dynamic Update , Event Viewer , File Association Web Service , Games Folder , Error Reporting for Handwriting Recognition , Input Method Editor ( IME ) , Installation Improvement Program , Internet Printing , Internet Protocol version 6 Network Address Translation Traversal , Network Awareness ( somewhat ) , Parental Controls , Peer Name Resolution Service , Plug and Play , Plug and Play Extensions , Program Compatibility Assistant , Program Properties - Compatibility Tab , Program Compatibility Wizard , Properties , Registration , Rights Management Services ( RMS ) Client , Update Root Certificates , Windows Control Panel , Windows Help , Windows Mail ( only with Windows Live Mail , Hotmail , or MSN Mail ) and Windows Problem Reporting are the main features and services in Windows Vista that collect and transmit user data to Microsoft .
This extensive enumeration is not a complete illustration of all the sources in Windows Vista that Microsoft uses to gather end user data .
However , it is more than sufficient to raise serious issues regarding user privacy .
The Redmond company has adopted a very transparent position when it comes to the information being collected from its users .
But privacy , much in the same manner as virtualization , is not mature enough and not sufficiently enforced through legislation .
Microsoft itself is one of the principal contributors to the creation of a universal user privacy model .
The activation process will give the company product key information together with a " hardware hash , which is a non-unique number generated from the computer 's hardware configuration " but no personal information .
The Customer Experience Improvement Program ( CEIP ) is optional , and designed to improve software quality .
Via the Device Manager , Microsoft has access to all the information related to your system configuration in order to provide the adequate drivers .
Similarly , Dynamic Update offers your computer 's hardware info to Microsoft for compatible drivers .
Event Viewer data is collected every time the users access the Event Log Online Help link .
By using the File Association Web Service , Microsoft will receive a list with the file name extensions .
Metadata related to the games that you have installed in Vista also finds its way to Microsoft .
The Error Reporting for Handwriting Recognition will only report to Microsoft if the user expressly desires it to .
Through IME Word Registration , Microsoft will receive Word registration reports .
Users have to choose to participate in the Installation Improvement Program before any data is sent over at Microsof .
Ever used a print server hosted by Microsoft ?
Then the company collected your data through Internet Printing .
Network Awareness is in a league of its own .
It does not premeditatedly store of send directly information to Microsoft , but it makes data available to other services involving network connectivity , and that do access the Redmond company .
Via Parental Controls , not only you but also Microsoft will monitor all the visited URLs of your offspring .
Hashes of your Peer Name tied to your IP address are published and periodically refreshed on a Microsoft server , courtesy of the Peer Name Resolution Service .
Every time you install a Plug and Play device , you tell Microsoft about it in order to get the necessary device drivers .
The same is the case for PnP - X enabled device , only that Windows Update is more actively involved in this case .
The Program Compatibility Assistant is designed to work together with the Microsoft Error Reporting Service , to highlight to Microsoft potential incompatibility errors .
For every example of compatibility settings via the Compatibility tab , Microsoft receives an error report .
The Program Compatibility Wizard deals with similar issues related to application incompatibility .
File properties are sent to Microsoft only with the item that they are associated with .
You can also volunteer your name , email address , country and even address to Microsoft through the registration process .
A service such as the Rights Management Services ( RMS ) Client can only function in conjunction with your email address .
All the queries entered into the Search box included in the Windows Vista Control Panel will be sent to Microsoft with your consent .
The Help Experience Improvement Program also collects and sends information to Microsoft .
As does Windows Mail when the users access Windows Live Mail , Hotmail , or MSN Mail .
And the Windows Problem Reporting is a service with a self explanatory name .
But is this all ?
Not even by a long shot .
Windows Genuine Advantage , Windows Defender , Support Services , Windows Media Center and Internet Explorer 7 all collect and transmit user data to Microsoft .
Do n't want them to ?
Then simply turn them off , or use alternative programs when possible or stop using some services altogether .
Otherwise , when your consent is demanded , you can opt for NO .
What Happens to My Data ?
Only God and Microsoft know the answer to that .
And I have a feeling that God is going right now " Hey , do n't get me involved in this !
I have enough trouble as it is trying to find out the release date for Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Seven ! "
Generally speaking , Microsoft is indeed transparent - up to a point - about how it will handle the data collected from your Vista machine .
" The personal information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to provide the service (s ) or carry out the transaction (s ) you have requested or authorized , and may also be used to request additional information on feedback that you provide about the product or service that you are using ; to provide important notifications regarding the software ; to improve the product or service , for example bug and survey form inquiries ; or to provide you with advance notice of events or to tell you about new product releases , " reads a fragment of the Windows Vista Privacy Statement .
But could Microsoft turn the data it has collected against you ?
Of course , what did you think ?
" Microsoft may disclose personal information about you if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to : ( a ) comply with the law or legal process served on Microsoft ; ( b ) protect and defend the rights of Microsoft ( including enforcement of our agreements ) ; or ( c ) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees , users of Microsoft software or services , or members of the public , " reveals another excerpt .
And you thought that it was just you ... and your Windows Vista .
Looks like a love triangle to me ... with Microsoft in the mix .
We throw away 6.7 million tonnes of food a year
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
It was considered a crime to waste food during the war , according to 92 - year - old Marguerite Patten .
And she should know , being the woman who helped housewives make the most of their family 's rations during World War II .
Nowadays planning a week 's meals down to the last carrot or saving a few pounds by chopping , mixing and cooking leftovers into a new dinner would seem like too much hard work to a lot of people .
But it 's these lost skills that are to blame for much of the 6.7 million tonnes of food we throw away each year .
A third of all the food we buy is now thrown into the bin and half of it is still perfectly edible , according to the government 's waste reduction agency , Wrap .
You 're throwing away one bag of shopping in three , it says .
This wanton wastage is not only costing us money - up to £ 400 a year - but is hurting the environment : the methane released by decomposing food in landfills is the most potent of greenhouse gases .
Cutting it out would be the same as taking one fifth of cars off the road , says Wrap .
Put simply , we waste too much food and need to return to wartime values of thrift and resourcefulness , says Wrap .
Lucky
But the simple basics of food planning have been scraped into the bin , along with the leftovers , say those who lived through rationing and still live by the lessons it taught them .
" Youngsters do n't seem to know anything about shopping , " says 82 - year - old Maureen Smith .
" They do n't even make a list , they just pluck whatever takes their fancy of the shelf .
It just seems daft to me , you probably end up with a lot of food but nothing you can make a decent meal out of . "
WI was set up to help women make the most of food
" Back then if you did n't use every bit of food you 'd end up with nothing to eat , " she says .
" You were proud to use everything because you felt you were helping the war effort - we all felt we were pulling together .
Using leftovers also felt like getting a free meal and that was satisfying in itself .
" Today people are used to getting whatever they want , they feel entitled to everything and think nothing of throwing stuff away .
I just felt lucky to have a good meal in my belly - I still do . "
Price of progress
The skills of managing the larder - fridges were nothing more than a dream to most - were valued and passed down the generations .
" I just grew up with it , I do n't remember my mum throwing away anything , " says Ruth Bond , who at 55 , was born in the era of post - war austerity .
" It was just part of life and in our psyche - it still is .
The skills were passed down through generations , you 'd sit and watch your mother cook . "
But over the years such skills have become less and less valued , argue some .
There are many reasons for this , often political .
MOST DUMPED FOODS
Bags of salad Fruit Bread Pasta Cheese Source : Wrap
" Teaching proper household skills was n't seen as important for years .
Part of the reason for this was progress , that women were able to get out of the kitchen and into work . "
But one of the costs was home economics slipping off the school timetable and this has been storing up trouble for the future , says Mr Lang .
" Instead of slipping off the timetable , home economics should have been expanded to boys as well as girls .
The problem we now have is that people are being told to plan meals , to use leftovers , to eat more healthily - but who 's going to teach them ? "
Classic recipes
In fact , the subject remains on the school timetable , although under the aegis of design and technology .
Earlier this year , then Education Secretary Alan Johnson promised there would be a greater emphasis on cookery lessons in school , as part of review of the national curriculum .
If teachers are looking for inspiration , they'd be wise to turn to the Women 's Institute .
While popular myth portrays the WI as an army of jam sponge - making middle - aged women , the institution was set up in the early 20th Century to help women make the most of the food they had .
The WI is backing Wrap 's campaign with a list of recipes and tips on how to create leftover dishes such as bubble and squeak , shepherd 's pie , chutney and bread and butter pudding .
" They were basic dishes years back but my grandchildren would have no idea how to make them now , they 'd just buy them already made , " says Mrs Smith .
One thing that has changed for the better is that such dishes are now considered British classics and seen on the menus of the country 's top restaurants and if it 's good enough for Gordon ...
This reminds me of my fathers green potato scones .
Leftover potatoes would be mashed with flour the following day and fried as potato scones .
The following day any leftover potato scones were mashed with leftover peas and more flour to produce his green potato scone mix .
Leftover green potato scones were thankfully discarded .

It 's all very well blaming the loss of skills on schools dropping home economics , but what about learning at home ?
I 'm one of the generation who have n't received any official education in cookery , but I still have ( and use ) the skills that are mourned in your article .
My mother and grandmother took the time to teach me , and I am taking the time to teach my sons in turn .
As a result , my son has been known to guide his pre-school teachers during cookery activities !
Julia , Gloucestershire
The first time I saw ready made bubble and squeak in the shop I knew that I was in another world .
Simple cooking is what is needed to be taught , but the basics are no longer just that .
How many times do you have the correct leftovers to make a traditional leftovers meal , or anything near it ?
But fried rice is much easier and more likely to be found .
To have leftovers you have to make a meal to start with !

Like Ruth , I was born in the post war era and my mother always saved lefovers , usually in little pots in the fridge .
They were recycled into what we unkindly referred to as ' Mud Soup ' ; though it was generally delicious it did look like mud .
Your article does n't mention that many people kept animals , particularly but not exclusively in the country .
A lot of left - overs were recycled to feed the chickens / ducks / goats / pigs which were , in turn , recycled into food .
Part of the modern shopping experience is that there is no connection with where the food comes from so neither is there any connection with where it ends up .
Food exists in a bubble of convenience , outside which everything is taken care of by someone else .
Edward Alport , Colchester , UK
Re-using left - overs is most commendable , but you have to wonder why so many of us have so much food left over .
It would be cheaper , more practical and more sensible to buy less food in the first place .
The current figure ( from organisations such as WRAP ) claims that we waste about 40 % of the food we buy and cook .
Put another way , every household that buys £ 100 of food per week is throwing away £ 40 every week - that 's £ 2000 per year !
To me it 's a no - brainer .
David , Cheshire
Having been raised in the fifties , with home ec classes and my mother 's instruction in cooking , I 'm familiar with all the work that saving money and waste in cooking food requires .
How do you think stay at home mothers spent their time ?
My daughter , a single working mother , simply has n't time for that , no matter how much money it would save .
And , since I work also , I 'm very aware of the small amount of money I can save versus the income I could be earning from the same amount of time .
Great idea , but who are the non-working people who will put it into practice ?
Mara Grey , Langley , WA , USA
Surely if meals were organized so meticulously and people were hungry due to rationing there would n't be any leftovers ?
Oliver Pearmain , Fleet , Hampshire
I wonder how much of this is down to the supermarkets and their " use by " dates .
For instance , my local one suggests that loose cheese should only be kept for two days in the fridge and makes no distinction between soft , listeria ridden , cheeses and harder ones like Cheddar .
Then there 's the prblem of food miles ; veg that I buy from a local farm shop keeps fresher much longer than the stuff from the supermarket which is ready for throwing after a couple of days .
There 's also the attitude of the consumer ; my wife will throw away packets at midnight on the day the " use by " runs out where I think there must be some safety margin built in and often prepare meals with food that is slightly out of date .
I do n't tell my wife and we have n't died yet .

The Yale University experts say that experiments on mice could show why regular exercise can help people suffering from depression .
Writing in the journal Nature Medicine , they say it could lead to more effective drugs .
Mental Health charities in the UK already back exercise programmes as a way of lifting depression .
Mind has long recommended physical exercise as a way of improving mental wellbeing
Marcus Roberts
Mind
While the link between exercise and improved mood is well known , the reasons behind it are not fully understood .
The latest research focuses on an area of the brain called the hippocampus , which is already established as a target for antidepressant drugs .
The team developed a test to see which genes in this region were made more active during exercise , and highlighted one called VGF .
This gene is linked to a " growth factor " chemical involved in the development of nerve cells .
This fitted with their theory that , for depression to lift , changes in the actual structure and links between brain cells are needed , not just changes in the chemicals surrounding the cells .
The next step was to make a version of that chemical , and to test it on mice , where it showed an effect on their behaviour that roughly equated to antidepressant effects in humans .
The researchers believe that a drug based on VGF could offer " possibly even superior efficacy " to current antidepressants .
' Clinically effective '
Marcus Roberts , Head of Policy at Mind , said that , currently , the use of exercise as a treatment for mental health problems should be recommended by doctors .
" Mind has long recommended physical exercise as a way of improving mental wellbeing , and many people who experience mental distress have told us that exercise has hugely benefited their mental health .
" Our own research has shown that outdoor exercise can decrease feelings of depression and increase self - esteem by inspiring a sense of achievement - the evidence is growing that this should be treated as a clinically valid treatment . "
I am a huge Google advocate .
I love their products so much that I use almost every one of them on a fairly regular basis .
Much of my computer based productivity is performed online via Google ’s offerings .
In fact , based on my excessive use , I think Google may know almost as much about me as I do .
I ’m surely not the only G freak out there , because most of my friends and colleagues have an @gmail.com email address too… 😉 something I ’d like to think I had something to do with .
A vast number of articles have been written on the topic of Google ’s privacy policies .
I know because I ’ve probably read most of them .
Many of these articles discuss the specifics how Google stores and secures their user ’s personal information .
Sure , I like to know that my personal data is secure …
But have you ever actually compiled a detailed list of your personal information that Google does know ?
I just did , and it ’s slightly startling !
Here are 16 things Google knows about me and how they acquired the info :
My Full Name –
It ’s in my Gmail headers and a requirement on various Google service signup forms .
My Physical Street Address –
It could easily be pulled from the various Google Maps search queries I ’ve performed .
They could also get it from my Google Adsense or Checkout accounts .
My Phone Number – Gmail used to require a cell phone number for signup verification .
It ’s also in my Adsense and Checkout accounts .
When I ’m Online – Since iGoogle is my homepage , I guess they know every time I open my web browser .
My Latest IP Address – Based on the previous point , I guess they know every time my IP address changes too .
My Popular Interests – My Google Reader and Google Bookmarks is chock full of my favorite news sources , articles , blogs , RSS feeds , online stores , etc .
Toss in my YouTube habits for good measure .
Every Website I Visit – Google is the portal to almost everything I see online .
I also use Google Web History and Google Toolbar for convenience purposes and Page Rank info respectively .
My Daily “ To Do ” List – I usually keep this updated in Google Notebook .
My Schedule – Most of my major appointments and future tasks are entered in Google Calendar .
Who I Know – Even if they are n’t reading my email , they have every entry in my Gmail Contacts , many of whom are Gmail users as well .
What I Say – Between Gmail and Google Talk , let ’s just say Google has clear documentation of what ’s on my mind .
What Stocks I Own – I typically uses Yahoo Finance , but I do have my stock portfolio setup in Google Finance as well because some of the tools are better .
My Bank Account and Routing Number – Associated with my Google Adsense account .
Everything About My Blog – Google Analytics tracks the stats for my blog and Google Webmaster Tools hosts my XML sitemap .
So they know what I ’m publishing , how popular it is , and who ’s reading it .
What I Look Like –
As you can see , I have a photo gallery on my blog .
In addition , I use Google ’s Picasa Web Albums .
Where I Exist Online – This one is obvious .
Since they know my full name , email address , online alias , search history , etc. , all they need to do is plug that information into their own search database and start cross referencing every other site where I have a visible account .
Now take all the information Google has on me , connect the dots and analyze it .
I bet they could tell you more about the historical trends in my life than I could .
Here ’s to hoping that never happens …
A theory of everything ( ToE ) is a hypothetical theory of theoretical physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena .
There have been numerous theories of everything proposed by theoretical physicists over the last century , but as yet none has been able to stand up to experimental scrutiny , there being tremendous difficulty in getting the theories to produce experimentally testable results .
So here are the top 4 most important Theories of Everything nowdays :
1 Superstring theory : “ Everything comes from excited strings ”
Think of a guitar string that has been tuned by stretching the string under tension across the guitar .
Depending on how the string is plucked and how much tension is in the string , different musical notes will be created by the string .
These musical notes could be said to be excitation modes of that guitar string under tension .
In a similar manner , in string theory , the elementary particles we observe in particle accelerators could be thought of as the “ musical notes ” or excitation modes of elementary strings .
In string theory , as in guitar playing , the string must be stretched under tension in order to become excited .
However , the strings in string theory are floating in spacetime , they are n’t tied down to a guitar .
Nonetheless , they have tension .
The string tension in string theory is denoted by the quantity 1 / ( 2 p a ’ ) , where a ’ is pronounced “ alpha prime ” and is equal to the square of the string length scale .
If string theory is to be a theory of quantum gravity , then the average size of a string should be somewhere near the length scale of quantum gravity , called the Planck length , which is about 10 - 33 centimeters , or about a millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter .
Unfortunately , this means that strings are way too small to see by current or expected particle physics technology ( or financing ! ! ) and so string theorists must devise more clever methods to test the theory than just looking for little strings in particle experiments .
String theories are classified according to whether or not the strings are required to be closed loops , and whether or not the particle spectrum includes fermions .
In order to include fermions in string theory , there must be a special kind of symmetry called supersymmetry , which means for every boson ( particle that transmits a force ) there is a corresponding fermion ( particle that makes up matter ) .
So supersymmetry relates the particles that transmit forces to the particles that make up matter .
Supersymmetric partners to to currently known particles have not been observed in particle experiments , but theorists believe this is because supersymmetric particles are too massive to be detected at current accelerators .
Particle accelerators could be on the verge of finding evidence for high energy supersymmetry in the next decade .
Evidence for supersymmetry at high energy would be compelling evidence that string theory was a good mathematical model for Nature at the smallest distance scales .

TENNESSEE COLONY — Ronald Gene Taylor was engaged to be married 14 years ago when Houston police rousted him out of bed on a summer morning and told him he'd been accused of raping a woman who lived nearby .
" They took me to jail that day and I ain't been out since , " Taylor said Friday during an interview at a Tennessee Colony prison where he has been serving a 60 - year sentence for a crime that new DNA evidence shows he did not commit .
He expects to leave Texas for Georgia , once prosecutors follow through on a promise to recommend his release , and finally marry the woman who has waited for him all this time .
" The first thing I am going to do is get to Atlanta to see Jeannette and marry her like I should have years ago , " Taylor said of his fiancee , Jeannette Brown , who has stood by his side throughout his ordeal .
" Knowing that she was there for me all this time was such a blessing . "
Brown , a 51 - year - old nursing assistant , said she never once considered the possibility that Taylor was guilty .
" I know that man , and I know he is not capable of doing something that awful , " she said by telephone Friday from Atlanta .
Freedom now should be just days away for Taylor , whose name was cleared by DNA tests completed this summer .
Next week he will begin the journey from the Coffield Unit to Houston , where a judge is expected to release him on a personal recognizance bond .
Video lineup
Taylor , 47 , is a quiet man with a quick smile whose face is framed with short salt - and - pepper hair more white than when he first was charged in 1993 .
During an hourlong prison interview he spoke of his conviction , time in prison and dreams interrupted .
Taylor was accused of attacking a woman while she slept in her Third Ward home .
Taylor , who lived less than a mile from the site of the rape , was placed in a video lineup after a neighbor told police he had seen him in the area the night of the assault .
The victim identified Taylor and he was charged .
Taylor maintained his innocence .
" I was so sure that the truth would come out that they knew it was not me that I told my lawyer not to even tell me if ( prosecutors ) offered a plea bargain , " Taylor said .
" I did not want to hear it . "
The case went to trial , with the victim 's identification serving as the crux of the case against Taylor .
An analyst from the Houston Police Department also testified , telling jurors that there was no semen on a sheet from the crime scene and that Taylor could not be eliminated as a suspect through DNA testing .
Jurors sentenced Taylor to 60 years .
But 12 years later , with the assistance of the New York - based legal clinic the Innocence Project , Taylor won the right to have the sheet retested .
A private lab , ReliaGene Technologies Inc. , re-examined the samples this summer and found there indeed was semen on the sheet .
The profiles they identified pointed not to Taylor but another man , Roosevelt Carroll .
Taylor is the third man to be exonerated after new forensic evidence discredited the work of the troubled HPD crime lab .
The lab 's analyses have been under scrutiny since late 2002 when news reports and an independent audit uncovered poorly trained personnel and shoddy work in the lab 's DNA division .
Since then , errors have been exposed in the work of four other lab divisions , including those that test firearms and illegal drugs , casting doubt on hundreds of criminal convictions and affecting the criminal justice system in Harris County and statewide .
Harris County prosecutors this week agreed that Taylor is innocent and should be freed from prison .
After Taylor 's release , his lawyers and prosecutors will file paperwork with the state Court of Criminal Appeals , which will determine what to do with his conviction .
Assuming that he later receives a pardon based on innocence , Taylor would be eligible for compensation of $ 50,000 per year of incarceration — likely more than $ 600,000 .
The real rapist
Meanwhile , Carroll , twice convicted of rape , will continue serving a 15 - year sentence for failing to register as a sex offender .
He cannot be prosecuted for the 1993 rape because the time frame for filing charges against him has expired .
Prosecutors have vowed to work so that he stays in prison until 2019 , though he could be paroled in 2010 .
Carroll declined to be interviewed for this story , according to a Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman .
Taylor said he feels no anger toward Carroll .
" If he did it , then he is sick , " Taylor said .
" But it ai n't going to do me no good to think about it .
I just try to spend my time changing things that I can and not worry about those that I can't . "
Still , Taylor finds it hard to reconcile the fact that Carroll was free , and committing other crimes , while he was an innocent man labeled as a rapist in prison .
" Rape is one of the worst crimes you can do , " he said .
" I do n't even understand rape , but I have lived for all these years with that mark . "
His hardship , Taylor said , has helped him have sympathy for the woman whom Carroll appears to have attacked .
During his time at the Coffield Unit , Taylor said he worked jobs such as cooking breakfast " because you have to keep your mind distracted , " and wrote daily letters to his family and fiancee .
When he leaves , he plans to find a way to rebuild his life , likely in Atlanta .
Mostly , Taylor said , he wants to " put away " his prison memories .
One thing , however , that he will be unable to leave behind is his haunting certainty that others are innocent like him but will never get help .
" I would almost bet my freedom that I could show you three or four guys who are in the same situation I was in , " Taylor said .
" But I wonder if anyone will ever help them . "

悪魔の証 明
悪魔の証明という言葉を知っていますか？
何かが「ある」ことを証明するのには、実物を持ってくればいい。
では「ない」ことを証明するにはどうしたらよいでしょうか？
すべての網羅して初めて「ない」ということが言えるのです。
「ある」ことを証明するのに比べ、「ない」ことを証明するのは非常に難しい。 例えば、「ネッシー」が存在しないことを証明しようとしたらどうすればよいでしょうか？
「写真は捏造だったし、これまで信憑性のある物証はみつかっていないんだから 」
ということでは証明できません。「まだ」見つかっていないだけじゃないの？という指摘に
反論する術がないのです。
それこそネス湖を干上がらせて全てを網羅して調査して見るぐらいのことをしないと
「ない」ことの証明をすることができないのです。
さて、プログラムの話に戻ります。intの引数を2個とる場合、その組み合わせは1600京ほどに
なるということを先の稿で述べました。 そして、バグが「ある」ことを証明する場合、バグの例をひとつ探し出せばよいのに対し、
バグが「ない」ことを証明するにはこの1600京のパターンすべてを網羅して検査し、
全て正常に動いたということを提示しなければなりません。
そう、たったintをふたつ引数にとるだけで、バグのないことを完全に証明することが
とてつもなく大変であるということがわかると思います。
1600京という数は、コンピュータで結果を比較するにしても結構な時間を必要とします。
そもそも、結果を比較するプログラムは信用できるの？比較対象となるプログラムにはバグはないの？
そう言い出すと、たったこれだけのプログラムに
バグがないことさえ現実的な工数では証明ができないのです！
「 システムにバグがひとつも存在しないようにテストをしてくれ 」 そうお客さんに言われたら、 テストの工数見積に無量大数人月を記載しても足りないことでしょう。
このような事情から、現実的な手間で、できる限りバグをなくすという方向でIT業界は工夫してきました。
未知のバグについては、いままでの検出数からの推測値を用い、概算をだすような工夫をしたりします。
しかし、これらは0に向かって徐々に近づくことはあっても、決して0にはなりません。
0に近づくに連れ、品質向上にかかる工数は逆数となって爆発的に増えるのです。
また、バグを検出したからといって全てを完全に取り除くまで修正がされるかというと
そうとも限りません。 費用対効果といいますか、そのバグが深刻であればともかく、影響が軽微でかつ修正コストが
高いのであれば修正を見送ることもあります。
オープンソースのプロダクトなどでは、bugzillaなどのトラッキングシステムでバグを管理しています。
リリースがあるたびにこの一覧がクリアになる(その時点で検出されているバグが全て修正される)わけではありません。
もし、検知したバグを全て修正しないと出荷してはいけないという法律を作ったとしたら、
ドッグイヤーとも言われるIT業界の時計は勢いを失い、何十年も同一プロダクトをのんびりと使う
そんな日々が訪れることでしょう。

Shoe manufacturers and retailers are lobbying Congress to repeal a seventy year old tariff that has outlived it ’s usefulness :
WASHINGTON – Footwear manufacturers and retailers are trying to end a Depression - era federal shoe tax , a move they say could save American consumers hundreds of millions of dollars annually and kick - start relatively flat footwear sales .
Trade associations and their members , such as Payless ShoeSource , Nike Inc. and Columbia Sportswear Co. , have been lobbying U.S. lawmakers weekly since the summer to get them to exempt certain categories of footwear , including all children ’s shoes , from the import tariffs that can run as high as 67.5 percent a pair .
(…)
Imposed in the 1930s , the tariffs were designed to protect a domestic manufacturing industry from cheap imports .
But that industry has largely disappeared over the past 20 years , as manufacturing overseas has become easier and cheaper . (…)
Of the 2.4 billion pairs of shoes Americans bought in 2006 , nearly 99 percent were made overseas , mostly in China , according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association .
U.S. shoe tariffs are among the highest in the world , compared with the European Union ’s 17 percent , Japan ’s 10 percent or Chile ’s 6 percent duties , according to the centrist Progressive Policy Institute .
So basically what ’s happening is that the price you ’re paying for shoes if you live in the United States is artificially high because of a tariff imposed in the 1930s to protect an industry that , for the most part , does n’t even exist anymore .
This story also illustrates a point — import barriers are really just a tax on American consumers because , to a large degree , the cost of the tariff will be built into the retail price .
This is especially true in the case of shoes where the market is almost totally dominated by foreign manufacturers so there is limited price competition from American companies .
It is a tax on the poor and middle class .
So where are the nativist trade protectionists on this one ?
Authorities in NSW have placed an immediate ban on a popular craft toy after its beads were found to contain the toxic drug GHB , or fantasy .
The toy " Bindeez " , which took out the 2007 Toy of the Year award at the Melbourne Toy and Hobby fair , contains hundreds of beads which can induce seizures , drowsiness or a coma , if eaten .
All Bindeez goods would be removed from sale , Minister for Fair Trading Linda Burney said today , and households with the toy were urged to remove it from any area where it could be accessed by children .
The Giuliani campaign insisted that it had nothing to do with the ballot initiative ; the Clinton campaign also said it had no involvement , beyond opposing it .
The same can not be said for loyalists of the two camps .
The lion ’s share of the work and money has come from supporters of Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton .
One of Mr. Giuliani ’s top fund - raisers , Paul Singer , a New York City hedge fund executive , donated nearly all the money raised so far in support of the measure — roughly $ 170,000 — to be used to help gather signatures to qualify it for a statewide vote .
Organizers have until Nov. 29 to collect the signatures of more than 400,000 registered voters for the initiative to appear on the ballot next June .
The money for the measure was donated through Take Initiative America , an organization led by a lawyer in Missouri who has also donated to Mr. Giuliani ’s campaign .
A spokesman for the Missouri group , Jonathan Wilcox , was once a spokesman and speechwriter for Bill Simon , a one - time Republican candidate for governor of California and now co-chairman of Mr. Giuliani ’s California campaign .
The effort to topple the measure has been led by Chris Lehane , who first raised the alarm bells when a draft of the initiative began circulating in July and then encouraged Howard Dean , the Democratic Party chairman , and other national Democrats to oppose it loudly .
Mr. Lehane , who worked on Bill Clinton ’s first presidential campaign and was a special assistant counsel in his administration , enlisted various elected officials who support Mrs. Clinton , including the Democratic mayors of Los Angeles , San Francisco and Oakland , and the Democratic leaders of the State Legislature .
Steve Bing , a Hollywood producer who has raised over $ 100,000 for Mrs. Clinton , has also lent his name to the effort .
The bulk of the $ 200,000 in costs for the Democratic side , including television advertisements denouncing the proposal , were paid for by Thomas F. Steyer , a California hedge fund executive who has raised at least $ 100,000 for Mrs. Clinton ’s presidential campaign .
The money for the effort against the ballot measure was donated to a committee , Californians for Fair Election Reform , created by Mr. Lehane and Mr. Steyer .
“ Thank God they did it , and thank God for our activists , ” said Art Torres , chairman of the California Democratic Party .
“ I ca n’t think of any single threat more dangerous . ”

In an exclusive talk with Gizmodo , iPhone Dev Team member Sam said that this move could " open a lot of possibilities for the future , " mainly in terms of the speed of the updates and avoiding sloppy and possibly dangerous binary patches :
Well , all the core members of the team are OK with Open Sourcing it .
Now we are checking to see if the community likes the idea and see if we can grow support for it .
We want to be sure quality software , however , not have a bin -patch - mania of pieces of our hard work by other people .
We are sure that Open Source people will submit their stuff to the tree so the software gets better .
It open a lot of possibilities for the future and anyone will be able to participate with quality code .

A new biker gang is roaming the streets of Richmond Hill , Queens .
This crew of mostly teenagers can be seen riding along 103rd Avenue just west of the Van Wyck Expressway .
The bikes roar , but the booming sound has nothing to do with engines — because there are no engines .
They are ordinary bicycles , not motorcycles , although these contraptions look and sound more like rolling D.J. booths .
They are outfitted with elaborate stereo systems installed by the youths .
“ This one puts out 5,000 watts and cost about $ 4,000 , ” said Nick Ragbir , 18 , tinkering with his two - wheeled sound system , with its powerful amplifier , two 15 - inch bass woofers and four midrange speakers .
It plays music from his iPod and is powered by car batteries mounted on a sturdy motocross bike .
The riders are of Guyanese and Trinidadian background .
In those countries , turning bicycles into rolling outdoor sound systems is a popular hobby .
During the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , several dozen public - housing residents and activists marched to the headquarters of the Housing Authority of New Orleans .
The marchers occupied the offices for hours .
As the military and police surrounded the building , Sharon Sears Jasper , a displaced resident of the St. Bernard housing project , spoke : “ We are not going to stop .
We refuse to let you tear our homes down and destroy our lives .
The government , the president of the United States , you all have failed us .
Our people have been displaced too long .
Our people are dying of stress , depression and broken families .
We demand that you open all public housing .
Bring our families home now . ”
In contrast , the day before , I had asked Mayor Ray Nagin if he made any demands of President Bush as they dined together the previous night .
Bush had just spoken at a school named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , whose issues of race and poverty are starkly laid bare in New Orleans .
Unlike those who had lost their homes , the mayor replied , “ It was n’t a time for demands . ”
Tracie Washington is the president of The Louisiana Justice Institute and a lifelong resident of New Orleans .
She says only a quarter of the more than 5,000 affordable housing units in New Orleans are filled .
“ There is a feeling by our government that public housing of old needs to be dismantled , buildings shut .
We have litigation going right now to change that , but it ’s horribly slow , and it ’s tragic . ”
She describes the plan by which public housing will be converted to “ mixed - income ” developments : “ Some of these developments that are closed down took in no water .
But the decision was made to take advantage of an opportunity .
Hurricane Katrina came .
‘ Look what we can do .
We can keep these people away from here , bring in the bulldozers , tear down this housing . ’ “
It is not just renters .
Private housing is being demolished as well .
Washington described how the city instituted a stunning policy to allow the legal demolition of homes .
Whereas once homeowners would have at least 120 days and several layers of appeals to prevent their homes from being demolished , Nagin instituted an “ Imminent Health Threat Demolition ” ordinance .
He now gives residents only 30 days to stop demolition .
To the tens of thousands of New Orleanians scattered across the country , the city ’s scant notice — a sticker attached to the property plus mentions on a city website and in The Times - Picayune newspaper — is clearly insufficient .
According to The Times - Picayune , in addition to homes being destroyed , liens are placed on properties for the cost of the demolition , setting the stage for the displaced owners to lose their property to the city .
That is why groups like Common Ground Collective , The Louisiana Justice Institute and People ’s Hurricane Relief Fund and Oversight Coalition are taking action , on the streets and in the courts .
According to Common Ground ’s founder , Malik Rahim , of the more than 12,000 people previously in the lower 9th Ward , only about 400 live there now .
Where once there was a dense , vibrant African - American neighborhood , I walked with Rahim through tall marsh grass , vacant lots and destroyed churches and schools .
A few isolated , damaged brick homes remain .
Curtis Muhammad , a longtime resident of New Orleans and a member of People ’s Organizing Committee , believes the economic interests driving the failing reconstruction must be investigated .
“ People see [ Donald ]
Trump down here trying to buy real estate , the big tycoons .
The gated communities are growing faster and faster .
Look at public housing .
They could have knocked that out in a week if they wanted to , cleaned it up .
That ’s a lot of people that they could have just brought home .
You ca n’t explain that . ”
Two years after Katrina , as Bush flew from the bayou to Baghdad , a People ’s Hurricane tribunal — putting every level of government on trial — was wrapping up in New Orleans .
A group was selling a T - shirt there that reads : “ Do n’t believe the hype .
Gulf Coast recovery is not ‘ slow ’ — it is a privatization scheme that takes away our homes , schools , hospitals and human rights . ”
Mission accomplished ?

WEST PALM BEACH , Florida ( CNN ) --
The war on the streets is escalating .
As gangs and other criminals pack more firepower , police departments say they find themselves in an arms race .
Sgt. Laurie Pfeil practices shooting a semiautomatic weapon in Palm Beach County , Florida .
The officers say they need to level the playing field to survive .
And so , on a bright October day about a dozen Palm Beach County sheriff 's deputies brought out their big guns at the local firing range .
Rifles crackled .
Shell casings flew .
Bullets sailed at 3,200 feet per second through paper targets set up a football field 's length away .
The sharpshooters were n't training for a SWAT team .
These were the deputies who patrol the streets and roads from the glittery Gold Coast to the swamps of the Everglades .

The fatal shooting in September of a Miami - Dade police officer by a man using an assault weapon put all South Florida police departments on edge .
Two other officers were wounded by the gunfire .
" It 's not nice we have to arm ourselves like the soldiers in Iraq , " said Sgt. Laurie Pfeil , who supervises a sheriff 's road patrol in Palm Beach County and is now certified to carry a semiautomatic AR - 15 rifle on the job .
It 's the civilian version of the military 's M - 16 used by U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
" We are like soldiers .
It is a war , " says Sgt Pfeil .
Across the country , at least 62 police officers have been gunned down this year -- a record pace , said Robert Tessaro , the associate director for law enforcement relations for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
As a result , the Brady organization supports police officers arming themselves with high - powered weapons " to protect themselves and their communities , " he said .
" We 're having more than one officer shot and killed a week .
It 's just outrageous that officers are being targeted , " he said .
" It 's something I think all Americans should be outraged about . "
Although the gun lobby disagrees , Tessaro lays the blame squarely on lawmakers who allowed the assault weapons ban to expire in 2004 .
Cops are being trained on semiautomatic weapons , which fire a single shot at a time and are more accurate .
Some semiautomatic weapons can fire with pinpoint accuracy from as far as 100 yards away .
The magazines used by law enforcement typically carry 20 or 30 rounds , adding to the ability to better respond under fire .
Designed to shoot from the hip , fully automatic assault rifles such as the AK - 47 can spray at a rate of up to 600 rounds a minute .
There 's no doubt that urban street warfare , aided by a proliferation of cheap automatic weapons , has come even to Palm Beach County , once high society 's vacation mecca and a retirement destination for northern snowbirds .
Assault weapons have been used to kill eight people and wound 25 here over the last two years .
Authorities estimate there are about 160 gangs who boast around 7000 members .
" They do n't have .38s anymore .
They have AK - 47 s .
... They have automatic weapons now , " said Sgt. Pfeil .
So the Palm Beach Sheriff 's office , like many others across the county , is training and arming everyone on the force with semiautomatic assault weapons .
Many officers say it 's about time .
" It 's different now .
It 's shootings on a weekly basis .
Ten years ago , that just did n't happen , " said Pfeil .
" They do n't get out and run from us anymore .
They stop , and they 're shooting at us . "
Miami's police department also is in the process of arming every officer with an assault rifle .
" It 's a little bit embarrassing that we 're engaged in this , but what is the alternative ? " said Miami police Chief John Timoney .
He said gangs , in particular , are getting their hands on high - powered weapons with apparent ease .
" The streets of South Florida are being flooded by AK - 47s and assault weapons from old Soviet bloc countries .
It 's driven the price down , making the availability greater , " said Chief Timoney .
The Miami police department evidence room has seized AK - 47s , AR - 15s and an assortment of other automatic and semiautomatic weapons piled on shelves from floor to ceiling .
Chief Timoney says he started noticing an increase since the federal assault weapon ban lapsed in 2004 .
Since then , he says homicides in the city of Miami involving assault weapons have been up -- 18 percent last year and 20 percent this year .
The Miami Police Department said 15 of its 79 homicides last year involved assault weapons , up from the year before .
So far this year , 12 of 60 killings have involved the high - powered arms .
Tessaro said he recently attended a conference for the International Association of Chiefs of Police .
Among the crime scene tape , squad cars , and other law enforcement gear offered for sale was the latest in high - powered assault weapons .
But it takes time and money to arm everyone .
In the case of Palm Beach Sheriff 's office , about one - third of its deputies carry assault weapons .
It could take a year to get everyone equipped .
Some officers are n't waiting .
Palm Beach Sheriff 's deputy Carl Martin bought his own AR - 15 and passed the required training .
When his department offered him one of their weapons , he gave it up to someone else who was on the waiting list .
" Because there 's not enough to go around , " he explained .

US To UK : It 's Legal For Us To Kidnap Your Citizens Posted by Pile ( 7481 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
America has told Britain that it can “ kidnap ” British citizens if they are wanted for crimes in the United States .
A senior lawyer for the American government has told the Court of Appeal in London that kidnapping foreign citizens is permissible under American law because the US Supreme Court has sanctioned it .
The admission will alarm the British business community after the case of the so - called NatWest Three , bankers who were extradited to America on fraud charges .
More than a dozen other British executives , including senior managers at British Airways and BAE Systems , are under investigation by the US authorities and could face criminal charges in America .
Until now it was commonly assumed that US law permitted kidnapping only in the “ extraordinary rendition ” of terrorist suspects .
The American government has for the first time made it clear in a British court that the law applies to anyone , British or otherwise , suspected of a crime by Washington .
Legal experts confirmed this weekend that America viewed extradition as just one way of getting foreign suspects back to face trial .
Rendition , or kidnapping , dates back to 19th - century bounty hunting and Washington believes it is still legitimate .
The US government ’s view emerged during a hearing involving Stanley Tollman , a former director of Chelsea football club and a friend of Baroness Thatcher , and his wife Beatrice .
The Tollmans , who control the Red Carnation hotel group and are resident in London , are wanted in America for bank fraud and tax evasion .
They have been fighting extradition through the British courts .
During a hearing last month Lord Justice Moses , one of the Court of Appeal judges , asked Alun Jones QC , representing the US government , about its treatment of Gavin , Tollman ’s nephew .
Gavin Tollman was the subject of an attempted abduction during a visit to Canada in 2005 .
Jones replied that it was acceptable under American law to kidnap people if they were wanted for offences in America .
“ The United States does have a view about procuring people to its own shores which is not shared , ” he said .
He said that if a person was kidnapped by the US authorities in another country and was brought back to face charges in America , no US court could rule that the abduction was illegal and free him :
“ If you kidnap a person outside the United States and you bring him there , the court has no jurisdiction to refuse — it goes back to bounty hunting days in the 1860s . ”
Mr Justice Ouseley , a second judge , challenged Jones to be “ honest about [ his ] position ” .
Jones replied : “ That is United States law . ”
He cited the case of Humberto Alvarez Machain , a suspect who was abducted by the US government at his medical office in Guadalajara , Mexico , in 1990 .
He was flown by Drug Enforcement Administration agents to Texas for criminal prosecution .
Although there was an extradition treaty in place between America and Mexico at the time — as there currently is between the United States and Britain — the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that the Mexican had no legal remedy because of his abduction .
In 2005 , Gavin Tollman , the head of Trafalgar Tours , a holiday company , had arrived in Toronto by plane when he was arrested by Canadian immigration authorities .
An American prosecutor , who had tried and failed to extradite him from Britain , persuaded Canadian officials to detain him .
He wanted the Canadians to drive Tollman to the border to be handed over .
Tollman was escorted in handcuffs from the aircraft in Toronto , taken to prison and held for 10 days .
A Canadian judge ordered his release , ruling that the US Justice Department had set a “ sinister trap ” and wrongly bypassed extradition rules .
Tollman returned to Britain .
Legal sources said that under traditional American justice , rendition meant capturing wanted people abroad and bringing them to the United States .
The term “ extraordinary rendition ” was coined in the 1990s for the kidnapping of terror suspects from one foreign country to another for interrogation .
There was concern this weekend from Patrick Mercer , the Tory MP , who said : “ The very idea of kidnapping is repugnant to us and we must handle these cases with extreme caution and a thorough understanding of the implications in American law . ”
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the human rights group Liberty , said : “ This law may date back to bounty hunting days , but they should sort it out if they claim to be a civilised nation . ”
The US Justice Department declined to comment .

" Frictionless Machines from Rollers & Bands "
by Harry Walton
As basic as the lever or pulley , the simple concept called " Rolamite " promises a revolution in mechanical design .
What 's a Rolamite ?
It looks like a simple gadget made with two rollers and a steel band , but it 's much more .
As basic as the wheel , the lever , or the hinge , it is the only elementary machine discovered this century .
Its use will be widespread --- in everything from switches , thermostats , and valves to pumps and clutches , and as almost frictionless bearings .
The Rolamite concept is the invention of Donald F. Wilkes , a Sandia Corp. engineer who was studying a suspensions system made with a bent elastic band fastened to opposing surfaces in an S shape .
He found that the center of the loop could be moved horizontally with amazingly little resistance ( To try it , clamp one end of a steel tape to a table and another section to a ruler held horizontally above it ) .
But the band can provide no positive mechanical action .
In a flash of genius , Wilkes inserted two rollers , large enough to overlap and so key themselves in , and the Rolamite principle was born .
The rollers may move in a fixed frame or one of the horizontal frame members may move on the rollers , travel being limited by the length of the band .
As the rollers are pushed to the right , for example , they turn in opposite directions , but are always in rolling contact with the band .
Nothing slides , rubs , or slips ; it is always the same points that come into contact between roller and band .
And a rolamite unit never needs lubrication .
Prepackaged Energy
What about band - flexing ?
It would seem that takes energy , creating friction .
But that energy is prepackaged when the band is installed under tension .
Bending of one part of the band is accompanied by straightening of another , which supplies the needed energy .
In tests , Rolamite devices display friction of an amazingly low order --- one to ten percent of that in the best ball and roller bearings of similar capacity .
The Rolamite units closest to production are designed for light loads and such jobs as opening and closing contacts or valves or performing mechanical operations .
A rolling frame member might carry control studs , fluidic valves , or printed circuit contacts on its outer surface .
Tricks with Bands & Rollers
Instead of being uniform , bands can introduce more or less resistance at some point of roller travel .
Holes of various shapes can be punched in them to make action easier at a predetermined point and to a precise degree .
Bimetallic elements and springs , even cloth , plastic , or rubber bands can be used .
Such modification can produce a snap action , sudden braking , latching , and other control functions .
A sharply bent band can act as a detent .
Rollers can be fitted with bulges or rubber stops for positive braking .
The rollers can be of different sizes .
If one is smaller , it turns faster than the other and you have a speed - changing device .
Extra rollers may be added , always two at a time .
They may be spool - shaped with a moving table between them .
Even square and triangular rollers are possible .
Fascinated by the possibilities , Wilkes and other Sandia people have doodles up Rolamite light switches , fishing reels , vibrationless sanders , clutches , a greatly improved toilet valve , an odometer , a reciprocating variable - speed tool drive , and even a pellet - shooting toy gun .
There 's no end in sight .
Basic rolamite uses a flexible band of steel or other material curled in an S shape and forming a freely moving loop .
Two rollers are then inserted and the band is put under tension .
Roller cluster moves along band with amazingly little friction .
By making cuts in bands , roller action can be that of snap - action switch , a thermostat ( when a bimetallic band is used ) , or any of at least 50 other devices .
It can support a traveling table for example .
Square and triangular rollers are even possible .

" The Amazing Rolamite --- It Opens the Door for 1000 Inventions " by Norman Carlisle
One night in September 1966 , a lean young , sandy - haired engineer named Donald Wilkes went into his garage workshop in Albuquerque NM to try an idea .
What came out several hours later has been hailed as the first truly elementary mechanical invention of the 20th century .
Dubbed the Rolamite , it 's an almost frictionless bearing with countless applications in modern devices ranging from toasters to space vehicles .
Engineers say it will take its place alongside the wheel , lever , and spring as a fundamental discovery of major significance .
Basically , the Rolamite consists of two rollers held in a track on opposite sides of an S - shaped band of springy metal , the rollers glide effortlessly in the track because the band moves with them as they roll along .
Since the band and rollers are both moving at the same speed , there is no slip or drag between them and therefore virtually no friction .
The device is so versatile it can function as a switch , a valve , a pump , a fuse , a thermostat , a force amplifier , a clutch , a speed changer , a brake , a pressure - sensing control , a solenoid , a fire alarm a --- you name it and it 'll do it .
How could such a fundamental principle remain so long undiscovered ?
That was the first question I tossed at Donald Wilkes as I interviewed him recently in his equipment - crammed laboratory at Sandia Corp. , the nuclear weaponry development center that Western Electric runs for the AEC .
" It 's hard to believe " , answered the 37 - year - old inventor , who has been an avid PM reader since he was a boy .
" The amazing thing is that a caveman has all the materials for making a Rolamite .
Logs could have served for rollers and vines for the bands . "
So how had Wilkes come to invent the Rolamite ?
In the course of his missile work at Sandia , he had tinkered together a suspension system that particularly intrigued him .
It consisted of a flexible metal band fastened in an S shape between two parallel surfaces .
It was responsive to movements , all right --- too responsive .
" Wiggly and wobbly " , Wilkes describes it .
On that now - momentous night , Wilkes was relaxing in his living room when it hit him .
How about putting rollers in the curves of the S ?
He jumped up and rushed out to his workshop .
From his stock of scrap he fashioned a simple track and inserted a strip of beryllium copper he'd been carrying around in his pocket .
From these components , he made the first Rolamite .
Now , Wilkes wondered , what would happen when he tipped the thing so that the rollers moved ?
Would the rollers slide along the curves of the band , or would the band move right along with the rollers with no slipping ?
Wilkes knew that if the band slipped he had nothing .
Again and again Wilkes tried it , his excitement growing .
The rollers moved smoothly and the band went right with them .
There was no detectable slip .
The next morning he hurried to his lab to machine a more sophisticated model .
Sensitive tests confirmed the observations made with the first crude model .
There was no slipping and , therefore , little friction .
As development work went on , Wilkes and fellow researchers discovered that an almost infinite number of variations could be made by changing the shape , size and structure of the bands , rollers and tracks .
Take the band , for example .
So long as it's under the same tension throughout its length , the rollers are stable at any point in the track .
It takes just as much force to push them one way as the other way .
But if you cut a slot in the band , you weaken it at that point , creating what is called a force bias --- the rollers are made to " prefer " a particular point in the band .
To understand the effect of a slot in the band , think of the two loops of the S as springs that each exert a force against the other .
Like a coiled watch spring , the band wants to lie flat and thus stores energy when it is forced to bend around the rollers .
When one of the loops is weakened by having a slot cut in it , the other loop overpowers it and " unwinds " , pulling the rollers with it .
By cutting a long , tapered slot in the band , the rollers can be made to move the entire length of the track under their own power since the band becomes progressively weaker toward the widest end of the slot .
In a typical application , Wilkes visualizes a Rolamite with a slotted band to lick one common household annoyance --- the leaky toilet valve .
The leakiness usually results from the failure of the ball float and lever mechanism to generate enough pressure to close the water - supply valve .
The force generated in a slotted Rolamite lever would close the valve with 30 times the strength of present valves .
Rollers can be Different Sizes
Wilkes ' first Rolamite used equal - sized rollers , but he soon found that one roller in a pair could be a giant , 10 or more times bigger than its companion .
With rollers of different sizes , you get a remarkably simple speed changer that can be used in any number of mechanisms .
Perhaps the oddest discovery is that the rollers need not be round .
Sandia researchers have tried triangular , hexagonal , oval and polygonal rollers .
The basic principles of the Rolamite still apply just as with round rollers .
The different shapes of rollers give the Rolamite many additional functions .
For instance , a rectangular roller can be designed to lodge against a stop in a braking mechanism .
A lot of variations are possible in the track , too .
For example , a track wider at one end makes the Rolamite a powerful force amplifier --- energy is released when the rollers slip into the wider portion of the frame .
This energy can actuate a variety of mechanisms , such as a firing pin or a switch .
There are other advantages , too .
Many Rolamited devices would never need a drop of oil .
Then there 's smoothness of operation .
The steady , uniform operation of a Rolamite can take the jerks out of pop -up toasters , power sanders and a host of other devices .
There 's cost .
Wilkes estimates that the Rolamite will actually reduce costs in 75 % of its applications .
The Rolamite does not require close tolerances , so they 're cheaper to make .
Finally , there 's the all - around toughness .
Extreme heat , cold or exposure to weather wo n't affect Rolamite operation .
But , I wondered , does n't all that flexing of the band cause it to wear out eventually ?
Does n't metal fatigue cause it to break ?
Those were questions that bothered Sandia engineers too , at the beginning .
Now they 've quit worrying .
The beryllium copper bands used in Rolamite have proved to be so sturdy that they show no sign of metal fatigue after 1,000,000 flexures .
At that rate , the engineers figure , the band in a Rolamited home light switch operated 10 times a day would last 300 years .
A Rolamited bathroom scale used five times a day would not wear out in 600 years .
You 'll never see the first applications of Rolamite because they 're tucked away in secret weaponry made by Sandia engineers .
But hundreds of industries are embarking on crash programs to adapt the Rolamite .
Because Rolamite was developed with the help of tax dollars , it is available to the public .
The Atomic Energy Commission will grant a royalty - free license for its manufacture to anyone interested .
Wilkes himself now heads a new company set up to speed the Rolamite revolution along .
" We 've just begun to scratch the surface " , Wilkes says .
" Just wait until the independent inventors get going . "
How the Rolamite Works
Basic Rolamite consists of two rollers in a track with an S - shaped band of springy metal between them .
As the rollers move , the band unwinds off one and winds onto the other simultaneously .
Because the rollers and band are always traveling together at the same speed , there is no friction between them and they move with little effort .
The two loops of the S are constantly fighting each other to unwind and lie flat .
So long as the band is uniformly springy , the loops balance each other and the rollers remain at rest .
When you cut a tapered slot in the band , the band gets progressively weaker as the slot gets wider .
The portion of band curled around the upper roller is always stronger than the portion around the lower roller .
The upper loop thus overpowers the lower one and unwinds , pulling the rollers with it .
This is one of a number of ways a Rolamite can be made to provide motion of its own .

Rolamite : A New Mechanism by Donald W. Wilkes
Part 1 : Nature of the Device
The Rolamite geometry , developed over the past year by the author , forms a simple mechanical design element which may , with variations , be used to advantage in a multitude of applications in place of traditional elements such as gears , pistons , pumps , switches , springs , levers , latches , brakes , clutches , and valves .
From Basic Idea
The basic rolamite geometry , Figure 1 , also shown diagrammatically on the next page , consists of two rollers mounted inside a parallel - surface channel and held together in a free - rolling cluster by a flexible band under tension .
This arrangement constrains the rollers to counter - rotate without slipping as the cluster moves along the channel , thereby providing the close - couples geometry which can be exploited to perform many functions .
The two - roller cluster is free to transverse from left to right , practically without friction .
Surface velocities between the rollers and the band are equal ; hence there is no sliding friction , at least on a macroscopic scale .
Tests on models have shown that coefficients of friction as low as 0.0005 are achievable .
This is about an order of magnitude better than the best ball or roller bearings .
Figure 1 : The Basic Rolamite Mechanism ~
An S - shaped band of springy metal ( represented by the white strip ) is constrained by two guides and two rollers .
The rollers are free to move , the band winding off one and on onto the other at the same time .
The band itself must be under the other one at the same time .
The band itself must be under tension , thus the ends usually are permanently fastened in some manner .
There is virtually no friction .
Since the band and rollers are moving at the same speed , and there is no slippage between them , since the band tension creates a tight wrap - around .
Each half of the S tends to unwind , but since they are balanced the cluster remains at rest unless an outside force acts on it .
This equilibrium can be disturbed by changing portions of the band ( varying width , thickness , performing , etc. ) and the cluster will then move by itself .
To Sophisticated Applications
Out of this basic arrangement , an almost unlimited variety of mechanical devices can be developed .
Force amplification , detenting mechanisms , braking and clutching , sequencing , pumping fluids , temperature sensing , electrical contacts -- the list could go on and on .
There are , however , three distinct areas for its use : ( a ) those where the geometry not only forms the heart or essence of the device , but also provides most of the necessary additional functions as well ; ( b ) where the geometry forms the backbone but not the whole mechanism ; and ( c ) where the device would be used as a separate subcomponent building block for use in other systems .
Table 1 shows applications for these three areas .
Consideration of the following attributes may help the designer to realize the rolamite 's possibilities : ( a ) its low coefficients of friction , which enable most devices to operate sensitively and reliably for long periods of time with a minimum of lubrication ; ( b ) its ability to produce many types of force - deflection characteristics ; ( c ) its capability of providing a great many mechanical and electromechanical functions ; ( d ) its applicability to countless distinct devices ranging from kitchen appliances to outer space instrumentation ; ( e ) its adaptability for use in components of all sizes -- large to microminiature ; ( f ) its simplicity , which allows the design of complete mechanical and electromechanical assemblies with very few piece - parts --- rarely more than 10 ; ( g ) its applicability to modern manufacturing techniques such as chemical etching and continuous - strip processing ; and ( i ) its relative freedom from critical manufacturing tolerances .
High - speed set - up or step - down ratios can be obtained from the rolamite geometry .
High torques can be transmitted without slippage because the normal forces and tensions can be made relatively large without introducing severe frictional losses , and normal bearing reaction friction losses are not present .
Consider the rolamite inertial odometer ( doubly integrating accelerometer ) shown as in Figure 2 .
This type of device is capable of inertially measuring up to several miles of vehicle travel in a single stage and , because of the low coefficients of friction , doing it very accurately .
Most other types of inertial odometers ( such as the spur gear arrangement shown above as Figure 3 ) must support the flywheel element or its equivalent in bearings in the acceleration field , making it very difficult to keep frictional influences negligible .
However , in the rolamite odometer no friction is added to the cluster by the vehicle acceleration .
In addition , the rolamite can accomplish 220 - to - 1 or 300 - to - 1 speed step - ups in a single stage , whereas three stages of spur gearing would be required .
Figure 2 : Rolamite Inertial Odometer ~
By attaching a small rolamite roller to a large heavily rim-weighted flywheel , the linear acceleration of the roller centerline can be very small compared to vehicle acceleration .
Since this type of device is a doubly integrating accelerometer , vehicle displacement is proportional to cluster displacement .
A typical value is 8.5 x 204 ; thus if the driving roller in the figure move 2 inches , it would represent a vehicle travel of 2.7 miles ( 2 " x 8.5 x 104 ) .
Because of low friction , it can be done very accurately .
Figure 3 : Conventional Inertial Odometer ~
Here the flywheel is supported in bearings which , when subjected to acceleration forces , become friction bound .
In order to scale down motion , many gear stags are needed , further compounding the friction problem .
And accuracy suffers .
The Production Factor
The rolamite geometry forms a mechanical suspension system capable of achieving substantial reductions in friction in the realm of extremely low bearing pressures .
Devices based on the rolamite concept may be dramatically simple and easily microminiaturized , tolerant of production variations , and inherently capable of a great many of the functions required in electromechanical devices ( Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : Using the Rolamite Principle
Rolamite devices can produce any type of force - deflection characteristic .
Without adding more parts to a device , it is possible to obtain constant force levels , positive and negative spring constants , second order and higher force curves , detenting actions , etc. , in any desired combination .
These forces may be highly localized or distributed .
Reasonably , sharp step functions and sinusoids are also obtainable .
The negative spring characteristics obtainable with the rolamite geometry are of particular interest .
In the past the designer has been limited to the use of permanent magnets , buckling helical springs , and other rather indirect and imprecise methods , difficult to analyze and not accurately predictable , to achieve sharp breakaway or hair - trigger action .
With rolamite , negative spring - constant or other negative force - deflection action can be achieved in exactly the right way with no additional parts .
This opens up new fields for mechanical amplifiers , oscillators , and motion detectors , and may permit cheaper mechanical devices to replace magnets in many applications .
With rolamite the designer can incorporate the precise amount of viscoeleastic damping or coulomb friction desired , either continuously or as a function of displacement ; he may directly clutch or brake a roller or both rollers , or provide overriding action or a local uncoupling ; produce sequencing , extremely high direct speed or torque changes , maximum - minimum limit - stops , squeezing , latching , insertion , pullaway action , and recording .
The Beauty of the Band
It is indeed fortuitous that the key element in the rolamite geometry is the band , because , of all the engineering materials , thin metals are second only to tiny wires ad whiskers in excellence of mechanical properties , while concurrently they are optimal for one of the best manufacturing processes available --- chemical etching .
This single element can provide forces , electrical circuitry , electrical contacting , programmed fluid resistance , sliding , latching , releasing , differential detenting , sequencing , maximum - minimum recording , differential action , sealing , metering , insulating , viscoelasticity , bimetallic behavior , etc .
Although the band profile can be complex , the chemical - etching process requires only that a few master patterns be generated .
Hence many of the aforesaid functions are obtainable at a low cost .
The suspension , bearing , and force features of rolamites are definite advantages .
More important , however , is the versatile way the rolamite geometry can produce nearly all known mechanical and electromechanical functions in a wide variety of combinations using very few piece - parts ( usually 4 to 10 ) .
This design versatility and economy stems from the many types of motion directly obtainable from the cluster , manufacturing tolerance and adjustability , and the simple , adaptable elements used .
Although the rolamite geometry looks somewhat less promising for recirculating rotary speed changes and bearings , the lessons learned from the rolamite geometry relative to tip guidance , rolling separators , friction control through the angle of repose , and the value of compliant behavior could well point the way to greatly improved high speed rotary devices , ones which could operate without lubrication for long periods of time and which could be more economically manufactured than existing devices .
Part 2 : Engineering
When the roller cluster is locked between the guide surfaces by sufficient band tension , and permitted to roll enough to relive forces induced by the tensioning process , the roller axes are perfectly parallel with each other and with the guide surfaces ; therefore , the entire geometry is placed with its preferred minimum energy state ( pure rolling state ) because the tension in the band is at a minimum .
This rolling state is assured by the laws of flexure so that there need be no slippage between the band and rollers or between the band and guide surfaces as the locked geometry is rolled .
Since the band tensions and the elastic strains induced in the band when it is bent around the rollers are equal and opposite , and because the rate at which strain energy is entering and leaving the band area adjacent to each of the rollers is constant , no net axial force is exhibited by the cluster --- that is , the cluster is essentially in neutral equilibrium at any position along the horizontal x-axis within the confines of the band and the guide surfaces .
This balance is independent of the roller diameter .
Figure 5 : Notation Used With basic Rolamite Geometry ~
The band tensions T acting through distance S set up a force couple which is balanced by the reaction force couple , N x A. the cluster is at equilibrium at any position , but free to move .
The parameters for defining the rolamite geometry are shown in Figure 5 , where
T = band tension
N = normal reaction force
S = spacing between guide surfaces
A = axial spacing ( spacing between roller centerlines ) measured parallel to the guide surfaces
Alpha = repose angle of the cluster
Gamma = contact angle of the cluster
T = band thickness ( assumed constant )
The external normal reaction forces N appear on the cluster at points A and B to balance out the force couple introduced by the band tension .
Suspension Analysis
Constraints : Constraints are imposed on the geometry for several reasons : ( a) Most commonly , the desire to insure fully elastic behavior in the band without any plastic deformation ; ( b ) some minimum endurance limit on the number of cycles the geometry may undergo ; or ( c ) the limitation of some feature in the locking cluster geometry .
For simplicity , the following analysis is limited to cases where the band thickness t is constant throughout the working portion of the band .
In order to insure fully elastic behavior or some minimum endurance level for the band , the maximum strain induced by the combined effects of bending to conform with the roller diameter , and all other axial strains induced by initial tensioning , induced loadings , or through Poison 's ratio effects due to normal loadings , must be kept below some maximum level .
(1) E* > E fmax + E T + E L + Y EN
Where
E* ( Epsilon * ) = design strain limit
Epsilon E Fmax = maximum tensile fiber stress induced by bending around rollers
Epsilon E T = strain induced by tension
Epsilon E L = tensile strain induced by loading
Epsilon E N = normal compressive strain
Y ( Gamma ) = Poisson 's ratio
In most situations , flexural strains are strongly dominant and if E Fmax is set at about 70 % of E* , a safe initial design estimate will emerge without a detailed consideration of the other terms until the design is approaching final form , at which time it will be easy to include approximations of these other terms .
To further simplify the following discussion , the assumption will be made that the band is perfectly flexible , that is , it has not flexural stiffness .
The constraints imposed by the free - rolling locked cluster are : First , s - 3t ( Figure 1 ) must be greater than the diameter of the largest roller , or interference will occur .
Mathematically stated , this constraint is :
(2) ( s - 3r ) > d 1
where
d 1 > d 2
Additionally , ( s - 3t ) must be smaller than the sum of the roller diameters , or the cluster will not lock .
Thus ,
(3) ( s - 3t ) < ( d 1 + d 2 ) .
Static Equilibrium : Cluster equilibrium requires that the moment induced by the nonaligned band tensions T must be counteracted by an equal and opposite moment induced by normal forces N , as shown in Figure 5 .
This requirement is expressed as
(4) TS = NA
and
(5) N/T = S /
A
where
S = s - 2 ( t / 2 ) = s - t
Tight Geometry : A real band has flexural stiffness , and a real rolamite arrangement need not be tight in order to present a true rolling geometry .
An infinite tension would be required to pull a real band into true parallel tangency with a pulley , which is of course impossible because of the finite ultimate strength .
The rolamite geometry is different because the moment introduced by band tension may be countered by the guide surface reactions to give an essentially tight geometry .
An essentially tight geometry occurs when the tangent lines between the band and the guide surfaces and the band and rollers fall inside the contact interface area between the rollers , band and guide .
This occurs when the tension is of the order of
(6) T ~> EI /tR '
where
E = tensile modulus of elasticity
I = cross-sectional area moment of inertia
T = band thickness
R = rolling radius
The exact tension for functionless tightness depends upon the elastic moduli of the materials involved .
While it is usually possible to add sufficient band tension to produce an essentially tight geometry , the amount of tension required to do this is usually too high to allow really sensitive behavior ; therefore most rolamites use geometries which exhibit some degree of looseness .
Figures 6 / 7 : Loose Geometry Parameters ~
The arrangement is very tolerant of surface roughness , out - of - sound rollers , jamming caused by particles , and thus requires less manufactured precision .
Loose Geometry : Figures 6 and 7 show a typical loose geometry and define the parameters used to describe it .
The unsupported length of the band is inversely proportional to the applied tensile couple , whereas the normal reaction force is direcly proportional .
A complete analysis exists which permits prediction of these parameters , given certain initial conditions , but is too detailed for inclusion in this article ( see reference at beginning of paper ) .
For the loose geometry interaction , early all of the equations and analyses previously presented must be modified or qualified , or at least applied literally only when acting within certain limits .
First ,
A* replaces A in these formulas and represents the axial distance between two outer contact lines between the guide surface and band .
The loose geometry also introduces it the cluster a degree of compliance which minimizes the effects of surface roughness , permits the cluster to accommodate minor variations in rollers ( such as out - of - roundness ) without balking , allows the cluster to ride up over particulate contamination without jamming , and in many ways reduces the criticality and degree of manufacturing required .
Rolling Friction : Friction coefficients for the rolamite geometry are designed as the ratio of the frictional force measured at one or the other roller centerline divided by the normal reaction force generated by the band tension .
The friction coefficients measured to date on various loose rolamite configurations using typical engineering materials without lubrication and with 0.205 - inch to 0.500 - inch roller diameters , have fallen in the range 0.0004 to 0.0016 , with 0.0008 the expected value in ...

Part 3 : Applications
Any desired proportion of the above seemingly paradoxical attributes may be achieved with a single device .
Rolamite devices can accommodate significant surface irregularities without jamming , roll over small foreign particles , and accept minor imperfections in their own geometry .
Abnormally high forces and torques of unpredictable , infrequent , or sporadic nature such as may arise in accidents or rarely encountered environmental situations can be accommodated because of the band compliance ; hence , the geometry is tolerant .
However , after a perturbation has passed , the geometry will aggressively return to its lowest friction state .
A rolamite suspension can be designed to be very tolerant ( soft , flowing , almost fluid in action ) , moderately tolerant ( but well controlled ) , or completely intolerant ( uncompromising , invariable ) .
Force Amplification :
There are many methods of rapidly extracting kinetic energy which have been imparted to the roller cluster by internal means such as springs , or by external means such as acceleration .
Most of these methods permit the attainment of high force levels during the rapid deceleration of the roller cluster .
Some of these methods make it possible to retain or entrap the high force levels .
In addition , some of the methods tend to minimize , and some tend to maximize , frictional processes during the deceleration phase .
Figure 13 : Offset Channel Force Amplification results from a change in geometry which in effect redcues distance A and thus increases the normal force N. Care must be taken not to make S too large or the rollers will unlock .
Typical methods of force amplification include the use of various types of wedging for the rollers and of offset channels .
Figure 13 illustrates a configuration for obtaining normal force amplification caused by the sudden increase in guide surface spacing and by wedging under the high forces of deceleration .
The moment equations for the initial and final states are
(8) TS 1 = N i A i
and
TS f = N f A f
Here , if the geometry is made correctly , the initial band tension can equal the final band tension , or , from Equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) ,
( 10 ) N i A i / S i = N f A f / S f
from which the ratio of final to initial normal force can be found :
( 11 ) N f / N i = A i S f / A f S i
Evaluating A i and A f :
( 12 ) A = { [ d 1 + d 2 / 2 + t ] } cos alpha
( 13 ) N f / N i = S f cos alpha i / S i cos alpha f
A s =>
A f , cos A f => 0 and N f / N i => infinity .
Practically ,
Af cannot get too small or the rollers would be able to unlock because of the elastic deformation associated with Nf .
This explains the force amplification resulting from sudden reductions in the axial roller spacing .
The force attained through the rapid deceleration by wedging can best be estimated from the total energy supplied to the roller cluster by assuming a stopping distance delta .
Here
( 14 ) F w ~ W / delta
where
F w = wedging force
W = input energy to cluster
Delta = deceleration distance
Slipping between the band guides and rollers would be precluded by the high contact angle .
Friction locking , if desired , may also be obtained .
Figure 14 : Detent Designs which hold or position the cluster until a breakaway force can suddenly release it .
There are many methods of providing adjustment and just a few are shown .
Rear roller detenting is preferred because the band provides a smooth radius to roll out of the groove and the tendency to jam is less .
Conversely , front roller detenting is better when very high breakaway levels are needed .
Detenting Mechanisms :
There are many methods of detenting , that is , holding or positioning the roller cluster until some desired breakaway force or energy level is experienced , and then suddenly releasing the cluster .
A few types of detents are shown in Figure 14 .
A guide surface slot is one of the simplest types of detents and its breakaway level may be adjusted by varying the distance the roller is permitted to drop into the detent or by adjusting the band tension .
Figure 15 : Roller - Flat Detenting utilizes the normal force for breakaway .
It is a function of tan 0 ( providing 0 is small ) .
Adjustable stop can also be applied to this type to partially rock the roller forward ( i.e. , reducing 0 ) .
Figure 16 : Negative Spring Detent force opposes weight .
The screw is turned until the desired breakaway level is reached .
Thereafter the energy surplus causes a fast breakaway .
Another method of detenting shown in Figure 15 is to flatten an area on the surface of one roller so that the normal force induced by the band tension at the point of tangency of the roller and guide surface can be used to provide a breakaway force level .
The rear roller is the preferred location for frictional locking to occur during breakaway .
If desired , an adjustable stop can be used to rock the roller forward and partly out f the detent notch to diminish the breakaway level for calibration purposes .
One such arrangement is shown in Figure 16 .
Accurate and repeatable breakaway level detent action is obtained by using detents which are provided by a negative spring - constant region containing the desired force level .
Negative spring constants may be achieved by such means as cutouts in the band or preformed curves .
Of course , the steeper the negative slope region , the sharper the breakaway action .
Once the set force level is exceeded , there is clearly an excess of force .
Figure 17 : Disc Braking wedges a bar against the wall ( or the other roller in the inter - roller version ) .
The forces involved in the sudden deceleration are at a minimum .
If braking were to occur on the lower wall ( cluster moves to left ) , the roller would attempt to roll up on the bar and severe damage could result .
Braking & Clutching : Stopping the roller cluster directly by over - roller or inter-roller braking ( Figure 17 ) is primarily useful I a high - shock situation in which the cluster must not impact against the end of the device .
For example , in over - roller braking , the bar wedges between the upper side of the roller and the wall , providing quick friction braking .
Gradual friction braking would be useful in extremely high axial shock or acceleration situations .
Gradual braking can minimize the loading on the side walls , rollers , and end caps after an extremely high kinetic energy level has been attained by the cluster ( See Figure 18 ) .
Figure 18 : Gradual Braking is similar but uses a compressible pad instead of a rigid bar .
It minimizes the loading on the walls and rollers when extreme speeds are reached by the cluster .
Figure 19 : Band Tension Clutch is the simplest form .
When the pin is removed , the tension is released and the rollers are free to rotate in place .
Figure 20 : End - of - Stroke Decoupling is shown here with one roller part of a flywheel .
The shaft socket is not a necessity but it does reduce friction .
A positive stop is provided for the upper roller to prevent wedging .
The simplest form of friction clutch is one based on controllable release and reapplication of band tension , as shown in Figure 19 .
Another version of this clutch can be used to decouple the rollers at the end of a stroke .
This is also depicted in Figure 20 in a situation where one of the rollers functions as a flywheel .
Decoupling at the end of a stroke may be necessary so that the rotary kinetic energy will not have to be rapidly absorbed , or it may be desirable to use this rotary kinetic energy to accomplish some other task .
Figure 21 : Dual - Action Overriding Clutch ~
Forcing the top roller to the left , or lower to the right , causes jamming and the cluster becomes friction - locked , but in a rollable attitude .
The asterisked forces are used for release .
The use of a high contact angle ( gamma ) for the cluster and a relatively stiff band only lightly tensioned permits attainment of overriding clutching action for the cluster .
This capability is depicted in Figure 21 .
Driving or forcing the top roller to the left or the bottom roller to the right causes the rollers to jam with a tendency to further increase gamma .
Jamming causes the normal force N to increase , as predicted by Equation ( 15 ) , and the geometry becomes friction - locked in a rollable attitude ( FT or B is the driving force applied to the top or bottom roller ) .
( 15 ) N = T T or B tan gamma
and , since tan gamma , for gamma's very close to 90 degrees , is very large , N will be large ; consequently , the frictional forces will be large even if F T or B is relatively small .
On the other hand , driving or forcing the top roller to the right or the bottom roller to the left by the forces designated by an asterisk in the figure causes the rollers to tend to decouple and decrease gamma .
The only torque required to turn the rollers is that required to overcome the frictional torque between the loose band and rollers .
The coupling or decoupling forces can be applied in any way to the rollers , not necessarily by means of drums or tongues as shown .
The coupling forces must at least permit rotation , but the decoupling forces can be applied so as to preclude gross rotation .
However , considerable force would have to be provided initially to break the friction coupling to achieve decoupling if at least a small amount of rotation were not permitted .
Sequencing , Recording & Limiting :
The rolamite geometry can be used to insure that a certain combination of input function types , signatures , directions , or amplitudes be experienced by the device in the proper sequential order for output to be permitted at some later time .
Figure 22 / 23 : Sequencing by means of a short tongue feed through , in ( 1 ) the tongue is on the rear roller ; ( 2 ) passing through ; ( 3 ) the tongue has popped up ; ( 4 ) end of the stroke .
Reversing the cluster can go back to ( 3 ) but no farther since the erect tongue will not pass between rollers .
The photo shows several short tongues and also a long tongue used to move the cluster .
There are some distinct ways in which the geometry can provide the sequencing behavior .
One method utilizes the short - tongue feed - through arrangement shown in Figure 22 .
In the initial position , position 1 , the short tongue is on the left or rear roller ; in position 2 , the tongue is just passing through between the roller ; in position 3 , the tongue has popped up again ; in position 4 , the end of the cluster stroke , the tongue can be used for contacting or some other function .
Upon reversal , the cluster may return to position 3 , but is not permitted to go any farther because the erect tongue will not pass through the rollers .
Combination of this action with a specially shaped force - deflection bias provided by the band , and possibly additional detenting action , could provide a very sophisticated sequencing routine , like that of Figure 23 .
Figures 24 / 25 : Simple Speed Changers ~
The photo demonstrates how the speed ratio can be changed using the same guideways .
Sketch ( b ) shows an inertially restrained speed changer .
Figure 26 / 27 : The photo is a model of a variable surface velocity selector in which there are seven linear speeds available in addition to cluster speed .
The drawing shows an inertially driven oscillator with variable surface speed and amplitudes .
Figure 28 : Multiple Roller Cluster arrangement which provides many different relative rotational velocities all moving at the same linear speed .
Multiple clusters also can serve to increase the total wetted perimeter of the band so that more travel with a force bias can be achieved , or to increase the number of sequencing functions one short tongue can perform .
Speed Changing : Figures 24 - 28 show a few of the speed - change possibilities .
Single - stage speed changes have been successfully demonstrated in which step - up and step - down rations as high as 300 to 1 were used .
Both linear speed ratios and angular velocity ratios are available according to rolamite arrangement or usage .
Types of Motion : Cycloidal types of motion which are available provide excellent sources of contacting , cutting , counterbalancing , and instrument indicator actions and can approximate almost every type of planar curve .
Certain portions of the trajectories exhibit extremely high mechanical advantages as well .
The roller counter - rotation can provide ideal action for fusing , aligning , valving , etc. , or can be employed to permit either response to or rejection of angular acceleration inputs ( See Figure 29 ) .
Figure 29 : Types of Motion such as cycloidal and trochoidal are available by attaching parts to the rollers .
Path 1 is on the surface of the roller .
Paths 2 , 3 , and 4 show the effect of an increasing radius and illustrate the motions of points on a flywheel , for instance .
Counter - rotation can also be used to provide counter - balancing with respect to all inertial inputs .
Because cluster motion in either direction provides both clockwise and counterclockwise motions , the designer has additional flexibility in solving his problems .
The inertia - to - mass ratio can be regulated by roller design to produce cluster behavior approaching that of a point - mass on the one extreme , or can be maximized by employing rollers with flywheel proportions to provide long - range inertial odometer behavior .
Pumping Fluids :
The conventional cluster becomes a very effective frictionless piston if a rectangular tube with a small side clearance is used to house and provide guidance surfaces for the cluster .
The band tension provides normal forces which neatly seal the rollers at the three contact zones of Figure 10 , A , B , and C . Side - guidance surfaces in the channel prevent tip leakage in two of the three short leakage path areas and permit the device to work in any orientation without appreciable wear or friction .
By using a collapsible tube in conjunction with the band , as shown in Figure 30 , a much smaller displacement of fluid per inch of cluster stroke may be obtained .
Figure 30 : Pumping Arrangement using a collapsible tube squeezed between the rollers .
Note that in the photo the band is not continuous as though it were with respect to the tube .
The pumping stroke is applied to the loose end moving it to the right .
The spring provides the return force .
In an actual pump , of course , check valves would be needed .
Any desired fluid displacement per inch of stroke is easily obtained by roller sizes and tube diameters .
Sensing Temperature Change :
If the band is suitably made of bimetallic materials , the cluster can be made to respond sensitively to temperature changes induced environmentally , internally by dissipation of electrical energy , etc .
The low rolling friction of the cluster permits high band tensions to be used without introducing appreciable friction , so that the output force or energy from a bimetalically driven device can be sizable .
Tow useful methods of accomplishing thermally induced bimetallic driving of clusters are shown in Figures 31 - 33
Figure 31 : Single - Band Thermostat employs a bimetallic portion of the band to counteract the triangular cutout .
Figure 32 : Two - Banded Thermostat uses a bimetallic strip fastened to one roller opposing a spring - loaded band .
Figure 33 : Snap - Action
Thermostat has a full band , but this cut - out yields a negative spring constant .
The bimetallic element looks like Figure 32 but actually is preformed and thus tends to move the cluster to the left .
At a high enough temperature this tendency is insufficient and the cluster snaps to the right .
Electrical Contacts :
Many of the means for locally amplifying forces while also permitting some relative sliding are suitable for electrical contacts .
The combination of high force and sliding action insures that the contact surfaces penetrate through and scrub off oxide films , contaminants , and particles which would prevent clean repeatable contacting : Figure 34 .
Figure 34 : Cross - Curved Band ~
In going from A - A to B - B the tape flattens out , undergoing a sliding action with high unit forces at the edges .
Since the curvature with respect to the guide surface at E - E is in the opposite direction , the same action does not take place .
Figure 35 / 36 : Side -Buckling Contact Electrical Switch utilizes the action described in Figure 34 .
This continuous wiping motion cleans oxides and contaminants , thereby providing dependable electrical contact .
Figure 36 : Cut -Out Roller Contact ( right ) ~
During the scrubbing phase , differential sliding occurs because the point of contact is no longer the rolling radius of the roller .
Figure 37 : Contact Orientations ~
Repulsive opens by itself if the driving force is removed .
Neutral stays closed but opens easily .
Locking requires considerable force to open .
In addition , the high - contact pressures help insure low ohmic contacting .
Figure 35 shows one arrangement for achieving this action .
With the cutout roller contact of Figure 36 , the roller centerline need not lift up to achieve contact engagement .
Once the unbacked portion of the band begins to touch the contact block and is deflected inward , differential sliding occurs since the contact point is no longer at the rolling radius of the roller .
This insures that contact scrubbing action will take place .
Three orientations of the contact block relative to the final rest position are of interest .
One gives a repulsive contact ( one which tries to open itself if the driving force is removed ) , one gives a neutral contact ( one which will stay closed but which will open very easily ) , and one give a latching contact ( one which requires considerable force to open ) : Figure 37 .
Part 4 : Hardware
Bands :
Bands for use in rolamite geometries may be made of any material which is strong under tensile loading and flexible enough to undergo the required number of cluster movement cycles ( Figure 38 ) .
Usually this also means that the flexing cycle should not permit plastic behavior unless such behavior is to damp out oscillations .
In any situation , however , the active regions of the bands will necessarily be thin relative to the roller diameters with the ratio of t/d < 0.020 in most cases .
If the flexural and tensile properties only are important , the best performance will be given by band materials which yield the highest ratios of yield stress divided by the tensile modulus of elasticity .
For a given thickness of band , such materials would insure the lowest maximum stress ; or if maximum tensile strength is needed , they would permit using the strongest band without obtaining plastic behavior .
Maximizing this ratio does not necessarily minimize the frictional losses displayed by the rolamite cluster .
Flexural hysteresis losses can be minimized by using a material which exhibits minimal internal damping while displaying a high ratio of yield stress divided by the tensile modulus of elasticity .
And then selecting roller diameters , shapes , widths , etc. , which permit minimizing the ratio of t/w where w is the band width .
Rolling friction losses can be minimized by employing high modulus materials for the rollers , guides and bands , by using the best available surface finishes , by reducing the coefficient of sliding friction between the rollers and guide surfaces and the band , by using dry lubricants , surface coatings , oxides , etc. , and by using the lowest band tension consistent with performance requirements .
To date , all of Sandia 's rolamite devices use metal bands or plastic - metal composite bands where insulated electrical conductors must be provided within the active portion of the band but several devices with plastic bands of Mylar , Kapton , and Teflon - impregnated woven fiberglass have operated satisfactorily .
Not only must the band material be carefully selected but also the exact condition of the material must be controlled if a consistent repetition of behavior of subsequent units is to be achieved .
Sandia has found that several of the age - hardening spring metals in their fully cold - worked and age - hardened state best fill the present rolamite component needs by offering high yield strengths while retaining enough elongation to eliminate a critical crack propagation situation .
Spring metals used include such alloys as beryllium copper 25 and 17 - 7 PH stainless steel .
The bands may be shaped by standard processes such as machining or chemical etching , or controlled electroforming .
In general , those methods which do not raise burrs or cause thickness variations are preferable even if the width definition is not highly refined .
In the axial force equation the thickness terms appears raised to the third power while only the first power of width applies .
Therefore , whether axial forces are to be generated intentionally or not , variation in the band EI ( where I is the cross- section area moment of inertia for the band ) introduced by the band material fabrication process will result in axial force variations .
In addition to the variations which are useful in or near the working portion ( that portion which is actually permitted to flex as the cluster moves between its two limiting positions ) , several other types of features become useful only in regions of the band well removed from the working portion .
These features may provide structural attachment , positioning , electrical circuitry , electrical circuit termination , electrical contacts , electrical connector pins or sockets , electrical cabling , electrical connectors , mechanical fastening , auxiliary side bands , commutating contacts , potentiometer resistive elements , and lateral compliance .
Having these features provided by the band can insure fabrication and assembly advantages over separate piece - parts .
The structural portion of the band can be made of material of any required thickness and joined to the thin active layer or layers by means such as spot welding or silver soldering , which would leave metal interfaces conductive , or through use of insulating adhesives and additional plastic films if desired .
By having these additional layers provided only where they are needed , many additional processing steps are eliminated and a minimum amount of material wastage occurs .
By adding these layers as continuous strips to a full - width backing layer , special flexible strip laminates are obtained , permitting the band patterns to be arrayed transversely very closely spaced .
Thus , a very efficient manufacturing process becomes possible for the automated production of highly sophisticated rolamite bands which are capable of replacing a great umber of individual parts .
Rollers :
Although not quite as subject to variations as the bands , the rolamite rollers may have several different configurations other than the simple straight right circular cylinders shown thus far .
Such changes would allow the ratio of inertia to linear inertia to be varied , for example .
Figure 38 :
Figure 39 :
Multiple threads could be used to provide two regions of clearance between rollers and guide surfaces .
Circumferentially grooved rollers could be used for attaching , adjusting , stopping , or coupling adjacent clusters .
Single and double hubs could be used for weight and inertia control .
Single and double cups could also be used for weight control and to provide room inside rollers for some useful purpose .
Flanged rollers could provide guidance and permit sustained operation in the presence of side loads .
Parallel Support Geometry : Parallel plates and channel forms allow access to the rollers , rectangular tubes provide good strength - to - weight ratios and band attachment and alignment characteristics .
Cutaway tubes combine several of the foregoing attributes .
Compliant guide surfaces allow automatic tightening of the band and provide cluster compliance ( Figure 40 ) .
Figure 40 :
Several useful features may be incorporated in the support geometry .
Notches may be used for detenting , decoupling , clutching , etc. barriers or bumps are useful for stops or energy level detents .
Changes in level are used in detenting and in changing the cluster repose angle .
Divergence in the support can provide gradual changes in cluster tension , axial force , etc. Undulations allow soft detenting and slow decoupling .
Wedges provide braking actions and force amplification or attenuation .
Summation
The rolamite geometry is adaptable to modularity , microminiaturization , and a very broad calibration of forces .
Additionally , it can utilize the highly desirable advantages of multiple - use laminates , which may be the first step toward the ultimate in manufacturing efficiency --- one - piece mechanisms for continuous - strip processing techniques .
Good performance has been attained in the many devices and prototype mechanisms assembled to date .
Yet the rolamite technology is in its infancy and much remains to be learned if the full potential of rolamite is to be exploited .
Most of the instrumentation and testing methods required to record completely and accurately rolamite behavior , particularly in microminiature sizes , are either nonexistent or in the early stages of development .
It is clear , however , that the use of the rolamite geometry is an effective way to design electromechanical weapon components and that the rolamite geometry can be used to advantage in many applications , including electromechanical weapons components , biomedical components , household devices , toys , and so on .

Abstract --
A roller - band device which substantially eliminates or minimizes sliding friction ; the device having a plurality of rotatable members in a guideway with generally equidistantly spaced walls , with each wall supporting and restraining one of the rotatable members and separated from each other less than the summation of the diameters of the rotatable members , and a flexible band between the guideway walls having a portion disposed between the rotatable members at leas partially encompassing at least one member , the band holding the members with generally parallel axes and providing rolling motion between each element of the device .
Background of the Invention
In prior electro - mechanical and mechanical devices which transferred one form of motion or energy into another such as bearings , gear systems , condition sensitive switches , etc. , the accuracy , efficiency , and sensitivity as well as the life of the devices have been limited by the degree or amount of sliding friction inherent in the device or sliding friction resulting from structural inaccuracies in the elements used in the device .
In attempting to compensate or minimize sliding friction losses , compromises in construction are sometimes made which contribute further limiting factors in efficiency and sensitivity of the device under some operating conditions .
Attempts to minimize friction often resort to lubrication of the moving parts with various liquid , gaseous or solid lubricants .
These lubricants may create forces which are detrimental to the operation of certain devices under highly sensitive operating conditions .
The lubricant may contaminate critical areas within the housing or a portion thereof and require packing or sealing materials to prevent contamination and thus create other friction losses .
Further , under extreme operating conditions such as high and low temperatures and prolonged storage , lubricants may not perform in the desired manner and may effect either partial or complete device failure .
The efficiency of land bearing surfaces has always been limited by the ability to fabricate precision surfaces or dimensions .
For instance , in bearings such as roller - bearings , misalignment of rollers results in end frictional losses and attempts to provide closer alignment with caging frequently results in additional frictional loses therebetween .
If the losses in adjacent roller ends can be minimized , surface roughness on the rollers may cause additional losses which may substantially exceed any attainable rolling coefficient of friction , thus placing a lower limit on overall efficiency .
In devices such as accelerometers or G - switches , attempts to increase the accelerometer 's sensitivity by decreasing sliding friction between the various elements of the device may also decrease the force applied between the electrical contacts closed by the devices reactions an acceleration force since this force is generally dependent upon opposing sliding members .
Further , such devices generally may not be adjusted to respond accurately to a relatively wide range of acceleration force due to unpredictable and variable frictional losses between the device 's members .
Prior electrical potentiometers are also dependent and limited y sliding frictional forces between the contacts or contacts and resistance material .
Any attempt to decrease the sliding frictional force to increase component life or sensitivity may result in a decrease in resistance linearity .
The problem became particularly acute in modern microminiaturized technology since the adverse effects of any friction may be greatly amplified relative to the size and forces available to activate the device .
It has been shown that the friction force approaches a constant level for normal loading under about 10 grams , which makes it hard to achieve a reasonable driving force to friction ratios in microminiature devices .
Further , it is difficult to fabricate these devices so that they can perform multiple functions or provide a complex response to a predetermined or desired situation , environment or event .
For instance , it may be desirable that a G - switch have one or more open or closed electrical contacts in its quiescent state , be accurately adjustable over a given range of acceleration force , be capable of sensing whether the acceleration force continued for at least a given period ( and if not have automatic reset capabilities ) , be stable over long periods of time and over wide ranges of operating conditions , have one or ore open or closed electrical contacts in its activated state , provide latching in its activated state , and be relatively sensitive to load components not on the sensitive axis .
It is desirable in this area of technology that a mechanism or apparatus be capable of modular construction , e.g. , that the mechanism be constructed of standardized parts that can be assembled to perform a wide range of functions depending of the particular parts used and the environment in which the device is used .
Using a given module , a wide range of devices can be fabricated using mass production techniques to perform a wide range of functions without providing separate tooling and production facilities for each device .
Such modular construction can provide commensurate per unit tie and cost savings while permitting the facility to be converted in a minimum of time to the production of another modular device performing an entirely different function .
Sliding friction may be decreased by further precision fabrication , closer tolerances and the use of such sophisticated techniques such as air bearings .
However , there is generally both a financial and a technology limit to these approaches and the devices become increasingly sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature , moisture and surface contaminations such as with dirt or dust .
Since rolling coefficients of friction are considerably lower than sliding coefficients of friction , it is desirable to provide electro - mechanical or mechanical devices having only rolling friction losses .
Rolling coefficients of friction have been measured as low as about 0.00001 to 0.00002 for right circular cylinders whereas roller bearings and ball bearings have attained coefficients of friction of only about 0.001 to 0.005 due to the loss mechanism noted above and several others which have not been mentioned .

Detailed Description
By way of introduction , the mechanism shown in Figure 1 , which may be referred to as a " roller - band " device , illustrates various features and principles of this invention .
As shown , roller - band device 10 includes a group or pair of adjacent rotatable members or rollers 12 and 14 supported between equidistantly spaced restraining surfaces or walls 16 and 18 of a guideway by a flexible , tensioned band or ribbon 20 .
Band 20 extends in generally S - shaped configuration partially around members 12 and 14 and may be held under tension by suitable fasteners 22 and 24 , such as screws or bolts , which attaché band ends at opposite extremities of the guideway on opposing walls .
The guideway walls 16 and 18 are supported at either end by end blocks or walls 26 and 28 .
The summation of the diameters of the rotatable members is at least slightly greater than the distance between walls 16 and 18 of the guideway .
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 , rotatable members 12 and 14 may be right circular cylinders of any convenient length .
Tension band 20 in this embodiment may be a flat elongated band of any convenient constant width and any convenient thickness .
For purposes of illustration , tension band 20 is shown with exaggerated thickness since generally it may be from about 0.0002 to 0.004 inch thick for instrumentation usage .
The guideway , which includes walls 16 and 18 , may also include side walls ( not shown ) depending on the application of the invention .
As shown rotatable members 12 and 14 are in an initial position with member 14 and the corresponding contiguous portion of tension band 20 in latch or detent 30 in wall 18 .
If a predetermined force function is applied in the direction of the arrow ( for example by acceleration of the device toward the left ) which is sufficient to overcome the forces of tension band 20 , inertia of members 12 and 14 and band 20 , the coefficient of friction ( e.g. , rolling friction ) , and the band tension holding roller 14 in detent 30 , member 14 may be released from the detent .
If this force function or some lesser force ( now only dependent on the band tension friction and inertial forces ) continues , members 12 and 14 may continue to roll along the guideway until the force function is discontinued or members 12 and 14 may continue to roll along the guideway until the force function is discontinued or member 14 reaches energy barrier 32 .
If sufficient force is applied over the travel of the rollers to raise the kinetic energy above some threshold provided by the combination of height and width of the barrier and the increased tension placed n tension band 20 , the members may roll over barrier 32 and drop into latch or detent 34 as shown by the dashed representation of the rotatable members and tension band .
In order to unlock the roller - band device in a reverse direction , a force would have to be applied in the opposite direction to overcome both detent 34 and barrier 32 .
Roller - band device 10 may operate a switch contact or microswitch 35 or be provided with electrical contacts on the ends of either member 12 or 14 and on the appropriate wall of the guideway , or tension band 20 can be used as an electrical contact and another contact provided within detent 34 in wall 18 so that an electrical circuit is completed when member 14 reaches detent 34 .
thus , the roller - band device shown in Figure 1 may be used to measure or sense a force or combination of forces and the integration of the forces over a given time determined by the length of the guideway .
Such devices can be released from detent 30 and rolled over barrier 32 with an accuracy of plus or minus a fraction of a percent of predetermined force levels .
With the general construction and operation of the Figure 1 type of device in mind , reference will now be made to the simplified roller - band device of Figure 2 in order to explain more of the principles of the device .
As in Figure 1 , roller - band device 42 includes a group or pair of adjacent rotatable members 44 and 46 supported between equidistantly spaced walls 48 and 50 of a guideway by a flexible tension band 52 .
Rotatable members 44 and 46 are shown in an initial position adjacent end wall 47 , with the band 52 shown departing from contact with walls 48 and 50 at contact " lines " or lines of tangency 54 and 56 .
As the band 52 is looped or threaded around members 44 and 46 and fastened under tension by suitable means to diagonally opposite ends of walls 48 and 50 of the guideway , the band tension produces a torque which urges the rotatable members firmly toward their respective restraining walls 48 and 50 and holds their axes parallel to each other , the combined effect of band tension and restraining walls being to urge the rollers firmly toward each other .
With the rollers in the noted initial relationship , the position of the contact lines or zones may be varied to an extent by changing the tension of the band .
By way of explanation , it appears that the force ( F ) to effect movement of the rotatable members contributed by any one of the three rolling contact zones ( at contact lines 54 and 56 and between rollers 44 and 46 ) is equal to the coefficient of rolling friction ( mu , u ) times the applied normal force ( N ) at that zone induced by the tension band and inertial forces .
At any one zone :
(1) F = uN
so for the entire geometry , the total frictional force ( F t ) :
F t = u 1 N 1 + u 2 N 2 + u 3 N 3
The normal force ( N ) results from the tension applied to the band and the inertial forces of the system .
Since the inertial forces of the rotatable members and band and the coefficient of friction are relatively small , the tension applied to the band may be the primary variable used to control or predict ( F ) .
Since the tension band 52 is shown bent around a portion of each member 44 and 46 in opposite directions , energy stored elastically in the S - shaped part of the band applies opposite resultant forces which emanate from the axes of each rotatable member , likewise the axial components of these forces
Fb in opposition in the direction of each band parallel to the guideway walls at each contact line or zone is defined by the following formula where force is measured at the center of one or the other where :
(3) F b = WEh3 / 12R2
where
W = width of band at line contact ,
E = modulus of elasticity of band at line contact ,
R = radius of rotatable member , and
h = thickness of band at line contact .
If the band parameters W , E and h are equal at both zone or lie contacts 54 and 56 and the radius of the members are equal , the opposing forces ( Fb ) will be equal and the roller - band device will be in a state of equilibrium or rest in the absence of any external forces .
The direction and magnitude of these forces are essentially independent of the band tension .
Because one or more of the parameters of the band may be different at line contacts 54 and 56 ( defined as positions 1 and 2 respectively ) :
(4) F b1 / F b2
resulting in an unbalanced force ( F r ) being applied to the rotatable members .
If for instance force F b2 is larger than the force F b1 , the force bias ( F r ) will be applied to the rotatable members in the direction of the arrow .
If the width ( W ) of the band is varied , the formula for the unbalanced forces becomes :
(5) F 1 = ( W 1 - W 2 ) Eh3 / 12R2
The other variables , E , h and R , may be varied to apply a force bias to the rotatable members .
Axial forces may be introduced by employing a band with preset loops or curves .
These loops or curves may be formed by conventional tempering or cold forming processes .
Forces may also be introduced by varying the material longitudinally in the band by laminating or connecting together various materials along the band by conventional processes .
Figures 3a to 3l illustrate various tension band configurations which provide various band width combinations at the line contacts with the guideway walls showing the resulting force bias ( Fr ) applied to the tension band and consequently the rotatable members .
The tension band configurations in Figures 3a to 3l will be applied to the roller - band device 42 shown in Figure 2 .
IT will be assumed , for purposes of illustration , that the vertical axis of the force diagram in each of the drawings crosses tension band 52 at contact line 56 adjacent member 46 and that a portion of band 52 which partially encompasses member 44 is contiguous with the end wall of roller - band device 42 .
In Figure 3a , tension band 52a has a uniform width throughout this length .
Since the width of the band at line contacts 54 and 56 are equal , the resulting force ( Fr ) is zero as shown in the force diagram .
This is the same configuration described with reference to Figure 1 .
In Figure 3b , tension band 52 b has a rectangular cutout 60 b which begins to the left of line contact 56 in Figure 2 and continues around rotatable members 46 and 44 , stopping just short of line contact 54 .
The distance of contact this represents is also the maximum travel the geometry can undergo without passing out of the force zone .
Using Equation 5 above , cutout 60 b generates a constant resulting force ( Fr ) in the opposite direction of the arrow in Figure 2 ( a positive force ) for the time in which the cutout 60b is adjacent the line contact 56 .
Using tension band 52 b with the roller - band device 42 of Figure 2 , the roller - band device may be used to measure forces , such as acceleration forces , in the direction of the arrow and the period of the force .
If a negative force which is greater than the force of the band cutout is applied to the roller band device , the members and band may rotate may rotate along the guideway for the duration of the force .
If the force continues for a time sufficient to allow the members to move to a second position having line contacts 62 and 64 as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2 which are beyond the cutout , the resulting force bias on the tension band will be zero and the tension band will be in a state of equilibrium .
If the force does not continue for a sufficient time to allow the members and tension band to reach line contacts 62 and 64 , the force bias will cause the members and tension band to return to its initial position against the end wall .
Roller - band device 42 with tension band 52b may also be used as a condition sensing switch by positioning the rotatable members and band to the right of line contact 56 with cutout 60 b still adjacent to the line cutout and physically holding the member in that position by a condition sensing means such as a fusible material or a releasable magnetic latch ( not shown ) .
Should the desired condition occur , the conditioning means may release the members and allow them to return under the tension band force bias to the end wall of the device and thus energize a switch ( not shown ) .
Such a device may be used , for example , as a circuit breaker or a circuit fault sensor .
In Figure 3 c , tension band 52 c is tapered at a uniform rate throughout the entire length of the tension band .
Since the difference in width of the tension band at the line contacts for each rotatable member will be the same along the entire length of the guideway , the resulting force ( Fr ) is constant .
The tapered band force is not limited by the length of the contact of the band with the rollers as in cutout 60 b in Figure 3b .
Using mechanical latching such as that shown in Figure 1 and the concepts described with reference to Figure 3b roller - band device 42 , having tension band 52 c , may perform the same functions as band 52b .
It will be apparent that tension band 52 c may have a uniform width and a uniformly tapered cutout throughout its length to provide the same force bias .
In Figure 3d , tension band 52d includes a complex cutout 60d , a portion of which may be adjacent line contact 56 in configuration shown in Figure 2 , and a second cutout 58d , which may be adjacent line contact 62 and member 44 as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2 .
Cutout 60d provides a similar positive force bias as cutout 60 b in Figure 3 b except that the force bias has three force levels with step changes between each level .
Cutout 58d provides a negative force bias which may function as a latch similar to mechanical detents or latches 30 and 34 in Figure 1 .
The step function force bias generated by cutout 60d may perform the same function as mechanical detent 30 in Figure 1 .
In Figure 3e , tension band 52e includes a pair of triangular cutouts 58e and 60e .
The base of triangular cutout 58e may be adjacent line contact 54 at one end of the force bias while the base of triangular cutout 60e may be adjacent line contact 64 .
the combined force bias generates a curve similar to a positive spring constant having a stable position where the force bias crosses the force diagram axis , e.g. , where the apexes of the triangular cutouts are both simultaneously adjacent to a line contact about midway between line contacts 54 and 62 and 56 and 64 respectively .
A roller - band device using tension band 52e may be used , for example , as a shock absorber or vibration damper .
In Figure 3f , tension band 52f includes a triangular cutout 60f having its apex adjacent to line contact 56 .
The resulting force bias , like Figure 3e s similar to a positive spring constant exhibited by a helical spring .
In Figure 3g , the generally concave tapered band width configuration shown produces a parabolic shaped force bias , thus providing both a positive and negative spring constant type force curve .
In Figures 3h , 3i and 3 j , various cutouts and band width changes in tension bands 52h , 52 i and 52 j generate force biases which are similar to a negative spring constant force pattern .
These cutouts and width changes operate on roller - band device 42 in the same manner as shown in Figures 3e , 3f and 3g and described above .
By positioning the line contact of either tension band 52h , 52 i or 52 j adjacent rotatable member 46 along the force bias curve , a wide range of forces can be measured by roller - band device 42 using a single tension band geometry .
Figure 3 k illustrates an arbitrary force bias which may be generated by a tension band such as band 52 k merely by selecting the force bias desired and then design an appropriate cutout or cutouts .
In Figure 3l , the two series of circular cutouts in tension band 52l generate a generally sinusoidal force bias .
Such a force bias may be used to provide multiple stable or detent positions for rotatable members 44 and 46 .
By choosing one or more of the cutout or band width configurations illustrated in Figures 3a to 3l or variations and combinations thereof , any desired force bias may be generated with roller - band device 42 .
There are some applications where it may be desirable to use a primary force biased or non-biased tension band and rotatable member pair in conjunction with one or more secondary tension bands with or without their own rotatable members having separate force biasing to obtain a desired composite force biasing .
The additional secondary tension bands may act as a pusher or damping on the primary tension band .
Another typical force bias will be illustrated in Figure 8 which may be used in particular applications of the principles of this invention .
For most applications it is preferable to provide the desired force biasing with cutouts rather than vary the outside dimension of the tension band since the cutouts can be formed more precisely with conventional techniques such as photographic etching processes .
The tension band may be of a wide range of flexible materials or combination thereof depending on the particular application of the roller - band device such as plastics , metals , alloys , laminates , insulators , viscoelastic materials , etc .
Typical materials include aluminum , stainless steel , beryllium - copper - plastic laminates , polyethylene terepthalate ( sold under the trademark " Mylar " ) and polyimides ( sold under the trademark " Kapton " ) .
In some applications it may be desirable to use a temperature sensitive bimetallic tension band which will generate or modify force biasing in response to temperature variations .
Figures 4a and 4b illustrate a tension band having multiple electrical conductors embedded therein .
Tension band 34 includes a main body or portion 36 which may be made of a suitable solid or laminated material .
A pair of aligned conductors 38 and 40 and conductor 41 may be embedded in or laminated between the insulating material of portion 36 .
Any number of conductors , having a desired length , may be embedded within a tension band such as band 34 depending on the required electrical circuits or connections determined by the particular application of the device ( See the description of tension band 172 in Figure 10 ) .
If it is desired to make contact with either of conductors 38,40 or 41 through the tension band walls , the insulating material of portion 36 may be removed or separate contacts fastened to the tension band at the point of desired contact .
In order to provide flexibility and shock resistance in the tension band itself so as to maintain the desired tension , ring or maze type cutouts or corrugations may be provided at the band ends or the band may be made of an elastic material .
The rotatable members or rollers may be any suitable hollow or solid cylindrical shape such as a right circular cylinder or right prism and variations thereof .
In most application , hollow or solid , right circular cylindrical , rotatable members may be sued ( see Figures 1 , 10 and 13 ) since they provide a continuous rotating movement .
The rollers may also be made with one or more spring biased members which may be urged outwardly against the side walls of the guideway to eliminate the need to precisely control roller lengths as is needed in some cases .
Also , in some application desired force patterns , detenting , latching , etc. , may be obtained by using alternate or complex rotating member shapes .
The rotatable members may also be formed in a spool shape as shown in Figures 5d and 10 .
Figures 5a through 5c illustrate several typical roller - band devices , rotatable members 66 , 68 and 70 , in addition to the right circular cylindrical type shown in Figures 1 and 2 , all partially encompassed by tension bands 67 , 69 and 71 and supported on guideway walls 72 .
Rotatable member 66 is generally a right circular cylinder having a flat portion 74 .
Rotatable members 68 have generally equilateral triangular polyhedron shapes while the members 70 have generally triangular polyhedron shapes with one curved portion 75 .
As member 66 rotates with its band onto a flat portion of the member , such as portion 74 , the roller - band device assumes a generally stable position representing slightly decreased band tension and may function as a detent or latch until a sufficient force in either direction can rotate the member off the flat portion .
Various combinations of detents and latches may be incorporated in the device with this technique .
As can be seen in Figure 5 , flat portion 74 may provide additional compliance in the device depending on the band tension to remove the criticality in the tension setting procedure or provide shock absorbing ability .
A block 78 may be positioned on the inner wall surface of guideway wall 72 so that a rotatable member and tension band can be rotated over the same .
As the rotatable member , such as member 66 , rotates over block 78 the normal force ( N ) introduced by band tension , may be essentially recovered .
If the block is actually two or more contact points the normal force may be shared equally among the contact points because of the compliance provided by the flat portion 74 .
The small amount of slipping induced by the slight reduction in radius at the flat portion serves to remove oxide films or contaminants and assure clean contacting .
In flat portion 74 is positioned adjacent block 76 , additional wiping may be provided between the contacts as well as a greater detenting or latching force or a repulsive force created depending on the relative positions of portion 74 , block 76 and the center of member 66 .
Where extreme sensitivity is required , complimentary spool - shaped rotatable members 77 and 78 may be used as shown in Figure 5d .
Members 77 and 78 are shaped so that the members do not have surfaces contacting opposing surfaces of tension band 79 .
The configuration shown tends to reduce or substantially eliminate the detrimental effects of any surface roughness on members 77 and 78 .
Surface roughness effects may also be substantially eliminated by either increasing the band tension to cause plastic deformation of the members and smooth out surface roughness or decreasing band tension so that the members ride on the peaks of surface roughness .
Spool - shaped member 78 may also be used where it is desired to decrease the mass of the roller - band device and the resulting inertial forces .
The rotatable members may be made of a wide range of materials with or without coatings depending on the application of the roller - band device and any force bias contribution desired from the member .
Typical materials which may be used are metals such as beryllium , aluminum , stainless steel , brass , beryllium - copper alloy and tungsten carbide or insulating materials such as alumina , structural plastics , and rubber .
The guideway or housing supporting or restraining walls may be made of any suitable material depending on the application of the roller - band device such as conventional insulating materials and metals or alloys .
Where the tension band is used as an electrical conductor , the guideway may be coated with a layer of insulating material .
The guideway tension band supporting walls can be provided with various detenting , latching , sears and electrical contacts as shown in Figures 1 and 5 to perform a wide range of functions with respect to the tension band and rotatable members .
The guideway side walls may be provided with grooves or orifices to provide fluid damping in an enclosed roller - band device between opposite sides of the tension band and rotatable members .
Further , the guideway side walls may be provided with sears , wedges , electrical contacts , magnetic actuated pin latches , etc. , depending on the particular applications of the roller - band device .
While roller supporting walls are shown in the drawings as generally equidistantly spaced from each other , either as flat parallel members or as flat arcuate members , they may be of diverging or converging relationship with respect to each other , so long as the distance between them is at their effective operative portions not greater than the sum of the effective diameters of the rollers .
In some specific application requiring special or complex force bias functions , the guideway supporting walls may be defined as the surfaces generated by passing two parallel lines of equal length along two planar non-intersecting lines wherein said parallel lines are perpendicular to said plane .
The end walls may also included various latching and detenting mechanisms as well as adjusting screws for positioning or releasing the tension band and rotatable members in or from a force bias .
The end walls may be made of any suitable material depending on the application of the roller - band device and function as performed by the end wall .
Various modifications , forms and combinations of rotatable members , tension bands , and guideways and their associated mechanisms will be described hereinafter in connection with the following embodiments of the roller - band device .
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the present invention in one form of a G - switch or accelerometer .
A pair of adjacent rotatable members 80 and 82 are shown held under tension in an initial position between guideway supporting walls 84 and 86 , sidewalls 88 and 90 and end walls 92 and 94 by tension band 96 .
Tension band 96 may be held under tension by suitable fastening means such as screw 98 .
Tension band 96 includes a complex cutout 100 and a rectangular cutout 101 .
Cutout 100 is positioned as shown along the contact line of member 80 and tension band 96 with wall 84 .
Cutout 101 is positioned so that when member 80 and the band rotate past cutout 100 , cutout 101 will be adjacent the contact line between member 82 and tension band 96 and wall 86 in the device 's final position .
Tension band 96 also includes a pair of oppositely facing U - shaped cutouts 102 and 104 leaving a pair of tongue - like extensions 106 and 108 intermediate the sides of the tension band 96 .
Tongues 106 and 108 extend away from members 80 and 82 due to the curvature of tension band 96 as shown in Figure 6 .
Tongue 108 , in the initial position of the roller - band G - switch , rests against the end of adjusting screw 110 which is threaded through end wall 92 .
The position of members 80 and 82 in the guideway may be adjusted by screw 110 so as to position the contact line of member 80 and tension band 96 along the desired portion of the triangular portion or negative spring constant of cutout 100 .
Tongue 106 is positioned on tension band 96 so that the tongue contacts the flat contact 112 when the roller - band device is in its final position in the same manner as block 78 in Figure 5 .
Electrical leads are connected as shown to screw 98 , screw 110 and contact 112 to provide an initial closed circuit between screw 98 and screw 110 and an initial open circuit between screw 98 and contact 112 .
It will be apparent that walls 84 and 86 may be either made of or coated with an insulating material ( not shown ) .
In the roller - band device 's final position , there will be a closed circuit between screw 98 and contact 112 .
In Figure 8 , the resulting force bias created by cutouts 100 and 101 and tongue 106 is shown by the solid line 114 .
The force bias generated by cutout 100 includes dotted line 116 and the negative spring constant portion of line 114 as well as the constant positive return force portion of line 114 .
Cutout 101 generates the negative force bias or latching force portion of line 114 designated by 118 .
Tongue 108 generates a pushing force against the rotatable members , shown by dotted line 120 so as to insure a clean breakaway from the initial position after long term storage .
This compliant stop forces the rollers to roll forward a small amount from the initial position to reach the breakaway force level .
The negative spring constant ensures a snap action release .
When the roller - band switch is accelerated in the direction of the arrow a force or " set - back " is experienced in the opposite direction .
If the force is sufficient to overcome the rolling friction force ( Ft from Equation 2 ) the rotatable members and tension band may begin to roll from their initial position determined by screw 110 and compliant tongue 108 .
If the force continues and is greater than the force bias generated by cutout 100 , the rotatable members and tension band may continue to roll down the guideway .
If the force is maintained for a time exceeding the time necessary for the rotatable members and tension band to traverse the guideway so that the contact line between member 82 and wall 86 is over cutout 101 , the roller - band switch may be locked in position with tongue 106 in contact with electrical contact 112 .
If the force is not maintained for the necessary time , the force bias generated by cutout 100 may reset the roller - band device to its initial position .
A roller - band device has inherent directional sensitivity along the longitudinal axis of the guideway .
The deice is relatively insensitive to extraneous side loads or forces because of the counteracting balanced forces between the tension band and rotatable members in the direction of the normal forces ( N ) so that for side components of force perpendicular to the roller axes but less than the total resultant normal force on both surfaces constant and only small changes in mu associated with the nonlinearity of mu versus load are experienced .
This normal force creates friction between the members , tension band and guideway which acts to prevent such force components parallel to the roller axes from displacing the rollers laterally which is also aided by the band 's side stiffness .
Lateral motion may be substantially eliminated by positioning blocks or guides 122 ( Figure 7 ) along the periphery of members 80 and 82 on sidewalls 88 and 90 .
Since the guides 122 are along the periphery of members 80 and 82 at the position of lowest relative velocity between each member and the guides , the sliding friction introduced may be kept minimal .
If rollers with equal mass moments of inertia are used they will not respond to rotational acceleration components about the roller axes .
It will be apparent that the switch may be modified to be sensitive to rotational acceleration components about the roller axes by using rotatable members having different inertias .
Figure 9 illustrates a roller - band switch or accelerometer which has been modified to measure both a G - level and velocity change .
The roller - band device includes a first pair of adjacent rotatable members 124 and 126 held under tension in an initial position as shown between guideway supporting walls 128 and 130 and end walls 132 and 134 by a first tension band 136 .
Member 126 may be provided with an orifice 138 passing through the center thereof and aligned with an opening 140 in band 136 .
The roller - band device also includes a second pair of adjacent rotatable members 142 and 144 held under tension as shown adjacent to member 16 by a second tension band 146 .
Tension bands 136 and 146 may be fastened under tension in an overlapping manner as shown by suitable fastening means at the extremities of each band .
Tension band 146 may be provided with suitable force biasing such as that shown in Figure 8 with cuto0ut 100 and tongue cutout 102 , leaving tongue 106 , in the same manner as tension band 96 in Figure 8 .
Members 142 and 144 operate in the same manner as members 80 and 82 in the switch shown in Figures 6 and 7 , responding to forces in the direction of the arrow .
The force level at which the members respond may be selected by means of adjustment screw 148 .
The force biasing in tension band 146 holds both sets of rotatable members in the initial position .
Tension band 136 may have uniform width dimension throughout its length similar to tension band 52a in Figure 4a .
The interior 149 of the guideway may be filled with a suitable damping fluid , liquid or gas .
Members 124 and 126 and tension band 136 are preferably closely dimensioned to that of the side walls so as to limit gas leakage around the end s thereof and the side walls shaped to provide guide rail type surfaces to prevent excessive side friction while members 142 and 144 and tension band 146 are loosely dimensioned to allow substantially undamped movement .
When the roller - band device is subjected to a predetermined or preselected acceleration to the left , members 142 and 144 and tension band 146 may roll to the end of the guideway adjacent to end wall 134 with tongue 106 engaged or locked in ledge or shelf 150 in wall 134 .
Simultaneously , members 124 and 126 and tension band 136 may begin to roll in the same direction since there is no force biasing holding the rotatable members and tension band in their initial position .
The rate at which members 124 and 126 roll along the guideway is dependent on the rate of flow of the damping fluid or gas through orifice 138 and opening 140 thus integrating the acceleration force with respect to time .
Suitable electrical contacts may be provided on the guideway and tension bands to indicate the G - level sensed by the embers 142 and 144 and tension band 146 and the velocity change measured by members 124 and 126 and tension band 136 .
The roller - band device may reset to its initial position by forcing or pushing tongue 106 off ledge 150 with screw 152 .
Figure 10 illustrates a roller - band accelerometer or G - switch which may sense one or more G - force l
TOKYO–All over Japan , retailers are scrambling to keep up with a new look known as " bon - kyu - bon . "
It means " big- small - big " and it signals a change in the way Japanese women look : they 're getting curvier .
Japanese stores that used to keep just two or three sizes of clothing on hand are rushing to stock larger sizes .
Juicy Couture , known for its figure - hugging terrycloth tracksuits , opened one of its biggest stores in Tokyo last year .
And Tokyo's high - end Isetan department store , which used to relegate its bigger sizes to one corner , now prominently features larger items from designers such as Ralph Lauren , Diane von Furstenberg and DKNY .
Wacoal Corp. , Japan 's largest lingerie company , was once known for its super - padded brassieres .
Now the company has a new best - seller : the " Love Bra , " a cleavage - boosting creation with less padding , aimed at curvier women in their 20s .
Today , the average Japanese woman 's hips , at 35 inches , are around an inch wider than those of women a generation older .
Women in their 20s wear a bra at least two sizes larger than that of their mothers , according to Wacoal .
Waist size , meanwhile , has gotten slightly smaller , accentuating many young women 's curves .
The average 20 - year - old is also nearly three inches taller than she was in 1950 , according to government statistics , and the average foot has grown by nearly a quarter of an inch .
The physical changes are largely the result of an increasingly Westernized diet , say nutritionists .
Meals that used to consist of mostly fish , vegetables and tofu now lean heavily toward an American - style menu of red meat , dairy and indulgences such as Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Cold Stone Creamery ice cream .
All this extra protein and calcium has led to longer , stronger and fuller bodies .
Shinichi Tashiro , an endocrinology professor at Showa Pharmaceutical University , says the intake of extra fat tends to go to either breasts or hips in adolescent girls .
Marketers say they first started noticing more women with hourglass figures a few years ago .
One of the first people to act on the change was apparel wholesaler Kazuya Kito .
In 2001 , Kito founded Egoist , a trendy purveyor of slinky clothing designed to highlight the busty look , figuring that the curvier bodies would make women want to wear less - modest outfits .
His fashion industry friends scoffed at the idea .
Back then , micro-mini skirts were in style but women , for the most part , kept their chests covered .
Yet Egoist , whose wares include see - through sweaters made to show off decorative bras or skinny tube tops , became a huge hit and a catalyst for other skimpy - clothing brands .
Nami Sakamoto , an advertising - agency employee , embodies the new look .
The 26 - year - old is tall – by Japanese standards – at 5 feet 5 inches .
She 's also voluptuous , with a 35 - inch bust and 35 - inch hips .
" I had a hard time finding button - down shirts that would close , " says Sakamoto , especially when she was in high school and there were fewer foreign retailers in Japan that actually sold bigger sizes .
" Sometimes the buttons would burst off . "
Now she buys clothes at Western retailers that carry larger sizes .
Other young women are buying special items to flaunt their new physique .
" It 's just more fun to show some skin , " says Ayami Arii , a 19 - year - old vocational school student , who recently sported a tiny denim mini skirt and an iridescent push - up bra that peeks out from below her low - cut blouse .
Her bra , a big seller at boutiques in Tokyo's Shibuya 109 department store , is called a " Showy Bra . "
Similar to a string bikini top , the $ 60 bras , made to be peeking out of a low - cut blouse , started appearing last year and come in a variety of colours , from red patent leather to leopard print and orange sequins .
The cleavage craze took off in 2003 , when a young pop star named Kumi Koda appeared in ads around Tokyo wearing a barely - there metallic bra and not much else .
In one image , she wore coconut shells over her chest .
Then , two years later , she performed at the televised Japan Record Awards wearing thin tape - like gold satin straps over her breasts that revealed nearly everything when she danced .
The 24 - year - old star has become the champion of a new " If you 've got it , flaunt it " attitude among young Japanese women .
NOVEMBER 27-- It 's not easy being Ann Coulter .
In response to being hassled at her Florida home , the conservative author has successfully petitioned Palm Beach officials to remove her address from county property records .
The 45 - year - old Coulter 's move was apparently spurred by several incidents , the most recent of which occurred earlier this year .
As first reported by the Palm Beach Post , Coulter contacted police in March to report that a vulgar greeting card was left in her mailbox and , on another occasion , she heard someone screaming " Ann Coulter is a big asshole " from a vacant lot near her house .
The pink and white card , which had " Go fuck yourself " printed on its face , included several denigrating handwritten statements , including , " The only things left after a nuclear war are you and cockroaches , " according to Palm Beach Police Department reports , copies of which you 'll find here .
No arrests have been made in connection with the Coulter incidents .

We ’ve all had trouble with our animals , but I do n’t think anyone can top this one :
Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable .
No matter how legitimate my excuse , I always get the feeling that my boss thinks I ’m lying .
On one recent occasion , I had a valid reason but lied anyway , because the truth was just too darned humiliating .
I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury , and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day .
By then , I reasoned , I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on the top of my head .
The accident occurred mainly because I had given in to my wife ’s wishes to adopt a cute little kitty .
Initially , the new acquisition was no problem .
Then one morning , I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife , Deb , call out to me from the kitchen .
“ Honey !
The garbage disposal is dead again .
Please come reset it . ”
“ You know where the button is , ” I protested through the shower pitter - patter and steam .
“ Reset it yourself ! ”
“ But I ’m scared ! ” she persisted .
“ What if it starts going and sucks me in ? ”
There was a meaningful pause and then , “ C’mon , it ’ll only take you a second . ”
So out I came , dripping wet and butt naked , hoping that my silent outraged nudity would make a statement about how I perceived her behavior as extremely cowardly .
Sighing loudly , I squatted down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button .
It is the last action I remember performing .
It struck without warning , and without any respect to my circumstances .
No , it was n’t the hexed disposal , drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth ..
It was our new kitty , who discovered the fascinating dangling objects she spied hanging between my legs
She had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I reached under the sink .
And , at the precise moment when I was most vulnerable , she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle - like claws .
I lost all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements , blindly rising at a violent rate of speed , with the full weight of a kitten hanging from my masculine region .
Wild animals are sometimes faced with a “ fight or flight ” syndrome .
Men , in this predicament , choose only the “ flight ” option .
I know this from experience .
I was fleeing straight up into the air when the sink and cabinet bluntly and forcefully impeded my ascent .
The impact knocked me out cold .
When I awoke , my wife and the paramedics stood over me .
Now there are not many things in this life worse than finding oneself lying on the kitchen floor butt naked in front of a group of “ been - there , done - that ” paramedics .
Even worse , having been fully briefed by my wife , the paramedics were all snorting loudly as they tried to conduct their work , all the while trying to suppress their hysterical laughter … and not succeeding .
Somehow I lived through it all .
A few days later I finally made it back in to the office , where colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me about my head injury .
I kept silent , claiming it was too painful to talk about , which it was .
“ What ’s the matter ? ”
They all asked , “ Cat got your tongue ? ”
If they only knew !
Creato - Terrorism July 10 , 2007 14:25 MST
It was only a matter of time .
The creationists , frustrated at continued legal losses and the complete lack of respect they receive from scientists , have finally past the threshold from trying to distort science in schools to attacking science in a more direct fashion .
Today ’s Denver Post contains a very short piece about an unnamed “ religious group ” leaving threatening packages at the CU Boulder ecology and evolutionary biology department , just up the road from where I work .
( I ’m a little disappointed that our campus did n’t receive this honor – but then again I could do without security crawling all over the place , making sure we have our ID badges displayed properly , etc . )
The messages included the name of a religious - themed group and addressed the debate between evolution and creationism , CU police Cmdr. Brad Wiesley said .
Wiesley would not identify the group named because police are still investigating .
“ There were no overt threats to anybody specifically by name , ” Wiesley said .
“ It basically said anybody who does n’t believe in our religious belief is wrong and should be taken care of . ”
The first threat was e-mailed to the labs - part of CU ’s ecology and evolutionary biology department housed in the Ramaley Biology building - on Friday .
Wiesley said Monday that morning staff members found envelopes with the threatening documents slipped under the lab doors .
Unfortunately , the article is short on details .
More about this as it develops .
Update :
In what should come as a surprise to no one , Rob Crowther of the Discovery Institute , on the basis of no evidence at all , implies that the biologists who received these threats lied to the police about them .
He also has a hard time with basic reading comprehension :
But where ’s the evidence that the perps are actually creationists , or religious at all ?
Read the second sentence of the article ( i.e. the first sentence I quoted above ) .
The policeman investigating this incident informed the Post that the group is “ religiously - themed ” and that they made references to creationism .
Then again , maybe Crowther thinks the police are lying too .
It gets worse :
As one colleague pointed out , that is hardly the way religious believers refer to their own belief system .
Rarely do Christian groups refer to their own “ religious beliefs ” — it is mainly secularists who refer to beliefs with the modifier “ religious . ”
Except the person who used the modifier “ religious ” was the policeman , not the perpetrators .
We do not know at this point what exactly the perpetrators said .
We do n’t even know for sure that they ’re Christian ( methinks Rob doth protest too much … )
A Link To The Past : The Ultimate Guide To Women , Dating , And Love
When people speak of the greatest gaming franchises ever made , the conversation is guaranteed to turn toward The Legend of Zelda and that usually happens sooner instead of later .
And why should n't it ?
The Zelda franchise is nothing short of spectacular , each individual game being an epic in its own right .
But when gamers are asked to pick which Zelda game is their favorite , A Link To The Past almost always wins out .
The SNES classic is a flawless classic , a game so spectacular that only one RPG from the 16 - bit era comes close to rivaling its sheer awesomeness : Final Fantasy VI .
What most people do n't realize is A Link To The Past is n't JUST a video game ; it 's also one of the greatest dating guides ever written .
Many of the lessons learned in the Super Nintendo masterpiece can also be applied externally and used to conquer women and win their unrequited love .
The number of similarities between girls and A Link To The Past are so striking that they can't be mere coincidence ...
Shigeru Miyamoto intentionally embedded these lessons in his game .
It is my belief that Miyamoto felt so guilty about creating a generation of antisocial video game nerds that he hid subliminal messages in Zelda to help his loyal fans score some pussy , thus ensuring the eventual creation of a new generation of antisocial game nerds , a generation who would be taught to treat his games with the same reverence that some people bestow upon the Bible .
I have found fifteen important lessons within the game , lessons which every guy should commit to memory .
So if you 're looking to get yourself some quality cooch , I suggest you read on .
Let 's begin ...
1. Any Girl Is Fair Game
There is an old saying that dictates that we can't choose who we fall in love with .
Personally , I believe that to be the case and as such , I believe you should never settle for a consolation prize .
You only live once , so go after the girl you want , even if she 's not readily available .
Just as Agahnim violates the sacred boundaries of the sanctuary to abduct Zelda , you must be equally ruthless in your quest for courtship .
So just because a girl is " married " or " comatose " or " dating your best friend " , that 's no reason you should n't pursue her .
You only live once , and nothing is as expensive as regret .
Not even that bomb you need to blow open the pyramid in the Dark World .
2. Learn To Play An Instrument
This one is so obvious that it probably should n't even be on here .
Girls love musicians , pure and simple .
Hell , it does n't even matter what instrument you play ; the drum makes 'em cum , but even the clarinet gets 'em wet .
The necessity of learning to play an instrument is further reinforced by The Legend of Zelda series , as virtually every Zelda game has included a musical device .
In Link To The Past , that instrument is a flute so magical that it looks like a mistranslated ocarina .
This magical flute allows Link to summon a magical duck to magically transport him around the Light World .
That 's a lot of fucking magic .
However , it 's still not as magical as getting a full body massage from a girl just because you can play a little bit of " 6th Avenue Heartache " on the guitar .
3. Always Carry A Mirror
Above everything else , girls tend to be vain and superficial .
The only thing that concerns them more than their own appearance is the appearance of potential courters .
You could be the world 's biggest asshole , but as long as you have frosted hair and a snazzy Abercrombie & Fitch shirt , there are hundreds of girls out there who will put up with all sorts of douchebaggery from you , up to and including repeated infidelity .
And so , to win a girl 's heart , you will need to care as much about your appearance as she does .
If even a single hair is out of place , it could jeopardize the entire mission .
To be safe , always carry a mirror with you and always be sure to check it at least once every 15 minutes .
This will let girls know that if they want a piece of your affection , they 're going to have to compete against your ego to get it .
Girls love that sort of challenge , it 's like a special testosterone - free version of Sudoku .
The mirror is equally important in Zelda .
Not only does it let you to escape from the Dark World , it also allows you to get to areas of the Light World that were previously unreachable .
4. Seriously Ill Relatives : Bad For Them , Sweet For You
When a beloved relative falls ill , it 's usually kinda sad .
It 's usually not THAT sad though , as it can be used to your advantage .
Having a sick or critically injured relative makes you a sympathetic character and girls love that shit .
" Your aunt 's in the hospital ?
Omigod , that 's soooo sad . "
And the worse off your relative is , the easier it will be to find comfort in the arms ( or bed ) of a compassionate female .
Dying family members are a bonus in Zelda as well .
When your fatass uncle is beaten within an inch of his life by the easiest fucking enemies in the game , he bestows both his sword and his quest upon you .
It 's kind of sad that Link 's uncle is so goddam worthless , but it makes the game a lot more fun ; if he could actually fight , the game would be comprised of 10 + hours of Link lying in bed .
5. Take Another Little Piece Of My Heart Now , Baby
Love is a tricky thing .
Sometimes when you like a girl , she does n't like you back ... at least not right away .
When that happens , you have two options .
Option # 1 is that you give up .
And if you 're a total pussy , the type who gives up easily and does n't like a challenge , then take the first option .
But if you 're a real man , the type that does n't think things through and bets his friends that he can transform a girl of their choosing into the next homecoming queen , then you 'll want to hear the other option .
Option # 2 is that you win her over little by little .
You must collect pieces of her heart , just as Link collects pieces of Heart to complete Heart Containers .
Strangely enough , you collect both in the exact same ways : by winning annoying carnival games and probing hidden areas .
The only difference is that a girl 's heart has significantly more than four pieces .
6. The Occasional Expensive Purchase Goes A Long Way
If you 're with a girl for a long enough period of time , she 's going to expect you to buy her stuff .
Sure , buying her dinner will work for a while , but sooner or later she 's going to want something that she can show off to her friends .
This usually becomes an issue when the girl realizes you 've been together for almost a year .
When this happens , you 're gonna have to buy her some jewelry or something , and it 's probably going to cost you like $ 150 .
If you 're wondering why the hell any guy would actually do that , I 'll let you in on a little secret : this is a quid pro quo situation .
If you get your girl some stupid shiny necklace , you get a free pass in the bedroom that night .
Hell , you could stick it in her ear if you wanted to .
In Zelda too , expensive purchases are sometimes necessary .
Particularly , you will probably want to buy Zora 's Flippers .
They may cost 500 Rupees , but they allow Link to swim as well as use the whirlpools of the Zora to warp around .
Sadly , it does n't stop Zoras from attacking you .
NOTE : Aural sex is not fun for either party and it can cause serious damage to ears and penises alike .
7. Befriending A Giant Faerie Is Usually A Good Idea
These days , homophobia is becoming less and less acceptable .
It 's still safe to hate on the gays in frat houses and whiskey bars , but an increasing number of people are disgusted by that sort of ignorance and intolerance and many of them are girls .
So while it 's still cool to tell your wingman that playing DDR will turn him queer , you should always be ready to prove that you do n't hate polesmokers in case some super hot , super sensitive chick gets all up in your business about it .
And what 's the best way to show a girl you 're not a homophobe ?
Easy : hang out with one guy who 's gay .
Like , really REALLY gay .
If you 're friends with a giant fairy , no girl can ever accuse you of being a hater .
In fact , she 'll probably be so impressed when she finds out you have a gay friend that she 'll blow you right there .
In Zelda , consorting with giant faeries is even more beneficial .
Some of them will restore your health , some of them will upgrade your items , but the coolest faerie of all will give you the ability to carry more bombs and arrows .
That 's right , getting the ability to carry more bombs is better than getting head .
You know why ?
Because if you 're carrying enough bombs , you can pretty much get all the head you want anyway .
8 . It 's Better With The Lights On
Having sex is a lot like exploring a Hyrule dungeon , it 's a hell of a lot better when you can see what you 're doing .
First off , it makes things easier to find your way to the correct passageways .
Secondly , if you do n't want to see what you 're doing , then you probably should n't be doing it .
RUN AWAY !
So whether your light source runs on incandescents , fluroescents , or MP , turn it the fuck on before you do something you regret .
9. Size Matters
The world is filled with holes and these holes need to be filled ; that 's the good news .
The bad news is that some holes are more demanding than others .
Some holes will only open up for a large tool .
Worse yet , these holes tend to be the most desirable as they lead to special treasures .
So if you do n't have a Big Key , prepare for a lot of disappointment in your life .
Do n't fret though ... there are some holes that prefer smaller keys .
10 . Dark Depths
To successfully complete A Link To The Past , you must explore every inch of Hyrule 's dank dungeons .
Alternatively , to have a successful relationship with a member of the fairer sex , you must be willing to explore every inch of her dank dungeon ... if you know what I mean .
Do you know what I mean ?
I bet you do .
( I was talking about the vagina . )
11 . If You 're Retarded , Get A Map
In this life , there are certain things that normal people have no problem accomplishing .
These things generally tend to be pretty basic stuff , stuff like successfully navigating your way through the dungeons in A Link To The Past without looking at the map .
The dungeons in Legend of Zelda games are rarely so complex that you should ever need a map to complete them and there are certainly none in the Super Nintendo masterpiece that require it .
Simply put , if you use the map in A Link To The Past , you are lazy , stupid , or both .
And if you have trouble working through 16 - bit mazes , you probably do n't have much luck finding your way around a vagina either .
If you 're so goddam pathetic that you can't find the clitoris , do n't worry ; there 's a map for that too .
12 . The Tip Should Shoot Stuff
Although Zelda appeals to gamers of both genders , it is primarily intended for men .
If you examine the game mechanics , you can clearly see that Link was designed so that men could easily relate to him .
Think about it .
Like most men , Link 's main concern is to brandish his Master Sword .
Like most men , he 'll stick it in just about anything .
And like most men , Link knows that keeping his health up will enhance the performance of his Master Sword .
When a man is in perfect health , he should be able to make stuff shoot out of his Master Sword without much effort .
If he can't , something is seriously wrong .
If you should ever find yourself in a position where your Master Sword wo n't shoot stuff when you want it to , do what Link does : consult a doctor .
Or your spam folder .
Or some weirdo in a robe .
13 . Dense Foliage Can Conceal Useful Holes
In your travels through life and Zelda , you will sometimes encounter a bush where you would n't normally expect to find one .
When this happens , your first instinct might be to ignore it , vomit , or run away ; these are urges that you must learn to overcome .
While such overgrowth is increasingly uncommon in today 's society and considered to be shameful by the Japanese , it is still worth exploring .
A bush can obscure the entrance to a secret cave that contains Rupees , faeries , or even a piece of Heart .
Also , there could be a vagina under there .
14 . Always Check For Crabs
Sometimes , you 're exploring an interesting place and then something unexpected happens : you find crabs .
In Zelda , crabs hide under rocks and bushes .
When their cover is blown , they will give you free Rupees for no apparent reason .
In the real world , crabs hide in pubic hair and dirty sheets , and they will make you itch way worse than you could ever fucking imagine .
Remembering which crabs are good and which ones are bad can be pretty tricky , so here 's a mnemonic device to help you remember :
Crabs under rocks , it 's that cool Zelda game .
Crabs on your cock , that 's a real fucking shame .
That 's easy enough , right ?
If push comes to shove and you can't remember the rhyme , do n't panic .
The truly important thing is that you check for crabs .
When in doubt , always scream and run away ; it 's much better to accidentally miss out on a handful of Rupees than to accidentally end up with an itchy crotch .
15 . Pearls Are A Man's Best Friend .
There 's an ancient Chinese proverb that goes something like this : " First you give her pearls , then you give her the pearl necklace . "
OK , so that 's not an ancient Chinese proverb ; I probably heard it in a porno .
But regardless of whether it was Confucius who said it or Peter North , it 's still a valuable teaching .
Now granted , there are plenty of chicks out there who will do whatever you want if you buy them a $ 30 dinner .
But if you 're looking for a guaranteed way to convince a girl to let you give her a fresh coat of white paint , pearls close the deal every damn time .
Pearls are important in Zelda too , as the Moon Pearl will protect Link from the changing effects of the Golden Power .
Now if only there was an item that would protect him from the Golden Shower .
Well , that 's pretty much it .
Guys , if you follow these simple guidelines , you are sure to find your luck with the opposite sex greatly increased .
It 's worked for Hal Sparks , it 's worked for me , and it can work for you to .
I 'd like to leave you with one very important caveat : the similarities between A Link To The Past and women are not absolute .
So remember , you can beat The Legend of Zelda , but you can't beat your girlfriend .
Well , unless you met her on a fetish forum .

YOUR HEART LEVEL INCREASED !
Epic Games ' motion to dismiss Silicon Knights ' lawsuit against the Unreal Engine maker has been denied .
Barring any other developments , this means that the case , in which Silicon Knights alleges that Epic " sabotaged " their game Too Human by not providing the promised support and features for Unreal Engine 3 technology , will proceed to trial .
The trial will likely go on for quite some time : " We 're a long way from a verdict , " Silicon Knights ' attorney told GameDaily .
What is your expert legal opinion on this case ?

THE phenomenon of Banksy , an English graffiti artist , seems to have got out of hand .
Banksy , who trades heavily on his anonymity , began drawing on walls alongside streets in north London and Bristol , his hometown .
But his stencils — often of rats making mordant political jokes — have come in from the cold streets to the prosperous warmth of London galleries and auction houses .
Record prices for Banksies have been repeatedly set and exceeded over the past nine months .
The rush began in February , when Sotheby 's sold seven of Banksy 's works in oil , enamel , acrylic and spray - paint .
Bonhams took up the baton , and set the pace in April , selling Banksy 's “ Space Girl and Bird ” for £ 288,000 .
This autumn , Bonhams has auctioned another 11 Banksies , and Bloomsbury no fewer than 21 .
AFP
Art or parlour trick ?
The April record was broken at Sotheby 's on October 12th , when “ The Rude Lord ” ( pictured ) — an 18th century portrait that Banksy altered to show the subject giving a middle - finger salute — fetched £ 322,900 .
At a less well publicised Sotheby 's sale three days later , six Banksies sold for a total of £ 447,000 .
Sotheby 's has put three more in their sale on December 12th , with a modest top estimate of £ 150,000 - £ 200,000 .
What is happening ?
Is this a significant shift in taste , with popular street art claiming a place in the mainstream , or is it a phase ?
It could turn out to be a bubble .
Look closely at " The Rude Lord " .
Banksy bought the original for £ 2,000 and sold it for more than 150 times that .
It exhibits most of his qualities : his anarchic sense of humour , his skill as a draftsman ( though he never had any training or went to art school ) and the quick and easy appeal of his work .
He has become a celebrity .
When he was photographed working on a piece of clever street art in late October , it made many of the London papers .
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt think he 's terrific .
So does Damien Hirst , who is an enthusiastic collector .
Banksy provides expensive provender for the contemporary art market , and if this is his strength , it is also his weakness : he is very easy to copy .
In April , Christie 's withdrew two Banksies from sale because of doubts about their authenticity , and stories about fraudulent Banksies pop up with a regularity that disturbs the auction houses .
Since Banksy does not appear in public himself , Sotheby 's arranges for his work to be authenticated by Steve Lazarides , his manager ( and fellow Bristolian ) .
This month 's Art Newspaper carries a damaging story about the appearance on eBay of 25 prints that appear to carry false authentification and may have been consigned by employees at one of Banksy 's galleries , Pictures on Walls .
( The gallery denies that the prints are fraudulent . )
Collectors who bought Banksies when they were young and he was entertaining have noticed this year 's huge price inflation and are taking their profits .
The temptation is irresistible .
Ralph Taylor , Sotheby 's man at the cutting edge — who thinks he might have met the artist but can't be sure — says that he takes calls regularly from people saying that they have a Banksy .
A few of them had picked up pieces for £ 300 which auctioneers estimate at £ 50,000 , and now find they are selling at between £ 70,000 and £ 100,000 .
" You can kill a market , " Mr Taylor warns , though Sotheby 's , who will have put 18 Banksies up for sale in 2007 , seems to believe this one is robust .

washington -- President Bush on Friday defended the CIA ’s harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects , saying its methods do not constitute torture and are necessary to protect America from attack .
But Bush ’s declaration that the United States “ does not torture people ” did little to dampen the fallout from fresh evidence that his administration has used secret legal memos to sanction tactics that stretch , if not circumvent , the law .
The president ’s comments came amid disclosures this week of classified opinions issued by the Justice Department in 2005 that endorsed the legality of an array of interrogation tactics , ranging from sleep deprivation to simulated drowning .
Bush ’s decision to comment again on what once was among the most highly classified U.S. intelligence programs underscores the political peril surrounding the issue for the White House , which has had to retreat from earlier , aggressive assertions of executive power .

It also reflects the extent to which the debate over tactics in the war on terrorism remains unresolved , six years after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The limits on CIA interrogators have been particularly fluid , shifting repeatedly under a succession of legal opinions , court rulings and executive orders .
In a brief appearance at the White House , Bush stressed the legality of the CIA program -- even while making the case for continued use of coercive methods .
“ We stick to U.S. law and our international obligations , ” Bush said .
But when the United States locates a terrorism suspect , he added : “ You bet we ’re going to detain them , and you bet we ’re going to question them -- because the American people expect us to find out information , actionable intelligence so we can help protect them .
That ’s our job . ”
The president ’s comments were met with outrage from key Democrats in Congress .

“ The administration ca n’t have it both ways .
I ’m tired of these games , ” said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va. ) , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
“ They ca n’t say that Congress has been fully briefed while refusing to turn over key documents used to justify the legality of the program . ”
The issue is expected to confront Michael B. Mukasey , Bush ’s nominee to be the next attorney general , at a Senate confirmation hearing later this month .
The two memos that surfaced publicly this week are among a collection of documents the White House has refused to turn over to congressional committees examining the CIA detention and interrogation program .
The newly uncovered memos , which were described for the first time Thursday by the New York Times , were drafted by the Justice Department shortly after Alberto R. Gonzales took over as attorney general in February 2005 .
They appear to show that the Bush administration continued to condone harsh interrogation techniques by the CIA even as Congress was moving to outlaw them .

One of the memos , written by the department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , authorized the CIA to use a combination of painful interrogation tactics , including head - slapping , extreme temperatures and simulated drowning , known as water - boarding .
A later opinion declared that none of the controversial methods violated a congressional ban on “ cruel , inhuman and degrading ” treatment of prisoners that lawmakers enacted in late 2005 .
The secret memos were issued at a time when the administration appeared to be signaling publicly that it was backing off from the most aggressive forms of coercive interrogation .
In December 2004 , the Justice Department published an analysis by the Office of Legal Counsel that declared torture to be “ abhorrent , ” and rejected an earlier opinion finding that methods short of causing “ organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death ” were legally permissible .

The memos since have been superseded by an executive order Bush issued in July , establishing stricter limits on CIA interrogation methods and requiring the agency to comply with the Geneva Convention on treatment of prisoners .
The order bans “ torture , cruel or inhuman treatment , mutilation or maiming ” as well as sexual humiliation or the denigration of religious objects or beliefs .
But it contains loopholes that appear to allow certain coercive methods to continue .
One provision lists the “ basic necessities of life ” that are to be provided any prisoner , including adequate food , water and shelter .
But the section makes no mention of sleep , and experts said the order appears to permit the use of stress positions as well as rough physical treatment .
Water - boarding is probably no longer allowed , said Tom Malinowski , the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch .

But even under the newest rules , Malinowski said , “ they could keep someone in an air - conditioned room , hands tied to the ceiling , music blaring and bright lights for four days . ”
A companion document spelling out in more detail the techniques that the CIA is allowed to employ remains classified .
The White House on Friday reiterated its long - standing refusal to discuss individual techniques , saying their disclosure would benefit U.S. foes .
Some lawmakers and military officials have expressed concern that the Bush administration has established a confusing system in which the CIA is free to go far beyond strict interrogation limits adopted by the military in September 2006 , in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .
Some also worry that in sanctioning harsh methods , the United States is inviting other countries to employ similar techniques on U.S. personnel .

At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last month , retired Army Lt. Gen. Charley Otstott said “ any techniques used by the CIA under this program are essentially those which our soldiers could expect to be used against them if they fall into enemy hands . ”
The debate has focused fresh scrutiny on the influential Office of Legal Counsel , which advises the president on the limits of executive power and has come under stiff criticism for approving broad claims by Bush in his response to Sept. 11 .
Historically , the Justice Department office has been a training ground for elite lawyers , including Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. But critics have expressed concern that in the Bush administration , it has become politicized .
Jack L. Goldsmith , a Harvard law professor who headed the office between October 2003 and June 2004 , published a book last month detailing battles within the administration over terrorism policies and steps he took to disavow and rewrite opinions on torture and other subjects that he considered legally indefensible .
He testified about his findings this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Advertisement
The acting head of the office , Steven G. Bradbury , who signed both of the newly disclosed opinions , has been singled out by Democrats as an administration rubber stamp .
The congressional majority has refused to confirm his nomination , which has been pending for two years .
Bradbury previously wrote a legal justification that the administration used to publicly defend the National Security Agency ’s use of warrantless electronic surveillance after Sept. 11 .
Given congressional opposition , there would be pressure on Mukasey , as attorney general , to replace Bradbury .

Defining ‘ torture ’
Advertisement
For five years , U.S. officials have struggled over the treatment of terrorism suspects and what interrogation techniques constitute torture .
Here are some of the documents that represent milestones in the unfolding debate :
Geneva Convention , Common Article 3 , 1949 : Bans any act of “ violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture ” and prohibits “ outrages upon personal dignity , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment . ”
U.N. Convention Against Torture , 1984 : Defines torture as “ any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted ” to obtain information or a confession .
Also bans intimidating or coercing treatment .
Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel , August 2002 ( “ Bybee memo ” ) :
Held that torture had to be pain that is “ difficult to endure ” and “ must be equivalent to intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death . ”
Advertisement
Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel , December 2004 : Withdraws the 2002 memo , saying : “ Torture is abhorrent , both to American law and values and to international norms . ”
Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel , 2005 : Formerly secret , the existence of two memos was divulged this week .
One authorizes the CIA to use a combination of painful tactics : head - slapping , extreme temperatures and simulated drowning , known as water - boarding .
The second declared that none of the controversial methods violated a congressional torture ban enacted later in 2005 .
Detainee Treatment Act / Military Commissions Act , 2005 and 2006 : The “ McCain amendment ” to two defense budget bills in 2005 prohibits “ cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ” of detainees held by the U.S.
The same language is approved the following year in a bill overhauling the system of trials for detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Army Field Manual , 2006 : A new version of the Army field manual explicitly recognizes the Geneva Convention and authorizes only 19 interrogation techniques while banning the most controversial tactics : hooding prisoners , mock executions , simulated drowning .
Advertisement
U.S. Supreme Court , June 2006 : Strikes down Bush administration ’s detention system because it violated U.S. law and the Geneva Convention .
Rules Geneva applies to detainees .
Executive Order , July 2007 : President Bush establishes limits on CIA interrogation methods and requires the agency to comply with the Geneva Convention , but allows the agency to resume a secret detention program .

Brian Williams , host of NBC's Nightly News , appeared on Saturday Night Live last night as guest host .
In a sketch poking fun at the most recent Democratic debate , the reputed newsman made a shocking admission : " Incidentally , this arrangement was all determined by the drawing of lots except for Senator Clinton , who we 're deliberately placing in the center since all of us in the media want her to be the nominee . "
The other candidates , everyone except Barack Obama , nod knowingly .
" Gentlemen , I 'm going to have to run ; I have a 15 - minute pre-debate interview with Senator Clinton , we 're going to ask her about her first 100 days in office , " Williams says in the sketch .
" I wish you all good luck tonight , though we , again , in the media have pretty much made up our minds to go with Senator Clinton .
We 'll see you in a few minutes . "

Prof Dawkins said atheists were not a threat to Christian traditions
He told the BBC's Have Your Say that he did not want to " purge " the UK of its Christian heritage .
The comments came after Tory MP Mark Pritchard accused " politically correct " people of undermining Christmas .
Professor Dawkins , author of the God Delusion , added that he liked " singing Carols along with everybody else " .
If there 's any threat these sorts of things , I think you will find it comes from rival religions and not from atheists
Prof Richard Dawkins
' Christianophobia ' warning
On Have Your Say , Mr Pritchard told Prof Dawkins there was an " increasing feeling " that " many of the main Christian festivals are being sidelined and marginalised , sometimes by stealth , sometimes openly " .
This , he argued , would allow groups such as the British National Party , to utilise Christian imagery for their own ends .
' Singing carols '
Prof Dawkins , who has frequently spoken out against creationism and religious fundamentalism , replied : " I 'm not one of those who wants to stop Christian traditions .
" This is historically a Christian country .
I'm a cultural Christian in the same way many of my friends call themselves cultural Jews or cultural Muslims .
" So , yes , I like singing carols along with everybody else .
I 'm not one of those who wants to purge our society of our Christian history .
" If there 's any threat these sorts of things , I think you will find it comes from rival religions and not from atheists . "
' Historical signifiance '
Last week , Mr Pritchard called a parliamentary debate on " Christianophobia " .
The MP for The Wrekin , Shropshire , complained that Christian heritage was being undermined by secular officials and public figures .
During that debate , community cohesion minister Parmjit Dhanda told MPs that Christianity had had a " significant impact " in securing people 's rights and freedoms .
He added : " I fully recognise the full historical and cultural significance [ of Christianity ] in our country .
" We should all be aware of that and celebrate that . "
And the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission , Trevor Phillips , said schools were wrong if they thought celebrating Christmas excluded children who were not Christian .
He said : " Christmas and the celebration of Christmas in this country , though it is a religious festival , is one in which people who are of no religion - or other religions - can share . "
Good ad :
I can also see the Giuliani camp making the argument that his facility with creative accounting , as demonstrated by his ability to gin up a slush fund with which to pay for his mistress ' chauffeur , makes him uniquely qualified to handle the financial shenanigans associated with the proverbial Big Shitpile .

Iraqi blood is ' on your hands , ' anti-war protester tells Condi

Rice appeared agitated but generally unfazed when an anti-war protester waved blood - red hands in her face , accusing the secretary of state of being a " war criminal . "
" Blood of millions of Iraqis is on your hands , " the protester told Rice , who was President Bush 's national security adviser when he decided to invade Iraq .
" War criminal ! ... War Criminal ! " the black - clad , " blood " - soaked protester screamed as authorities dragged her from a hearing room on Capitol Hill .
" Take her to the Hague . "
Rice was testifying to the House Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday , where she continued what some critics see as the Bush administration 's drumbeat to war with Iran .
" We are very concerned that the policies of Iran constitute perhaps the single greatest challenge to American security interests in the Middle East and around the world , " Rice said .
Although video of Wednesday 's hearing shows only one protester getting in Rice 's face , Capitol Police quickly removed several members of the anti-war group Code Pink who appeared to have caused no disturbance .
( Code Pink members have disrupted administration officials ' testimony in the past . )
" Stop , you 're hurting me , what are you doing , " one of the women yelled as she was forced from the Congressional hearing .

Utah payday lenders began refusing Monday to make loans to members of
the military rather than give them much lower rates mandated by a new
federal law .
That new law , which took effect Monday , caps the annual interest on
payday , car title or tax refund anticipation loans at 36 percent
annually for members of the military and their families … .
" At 36 percent annual percent rate , the total fees we could charge are
$ 1.38 per $ 100 for a two - week loan .
That is less than 10 cents a day , "
Walker said .
" Payroll advance lenders could not even meet employee payroll at that
rate , let alone cover other fixed expenses and make a profit , " he said .
I ’m surprised that it is constitutional for the government to require firms to lower prices for certain groups .
I ’m not surprised that the law has unintended consequences – but perhaps the consequences were not unintended .
" The protection the regulation offers is not a wall preventing a
service member from getting assistance , rather it is more like a
flashing sign pointing out danger and directing the borrower to a safer
way of satisfying immediate financial need , " said Leslye A. Arsht ,
deputy undersecretary of defense for military community and family
policy .
He said financial help for members of the military is available through
a member ’s chain of command , legal assistance office or military aid
society .
So the military does n’t pay you enough to pay your bills and then they reduce your borrowing options while suggesting that you can borrow more from them .
Hmmm … reminds me of a company town .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
At least one monastery remained sealed off by armed troops in the Tibetan capital days after celebrations marking the awarding of the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama , reported a human rights group .
In its report Tuesday , the International Campaign for Tibet , which opposes Chinese rule there , cited local sources and said that troops were surrounding Drepung monastery in Lhasa , with possibly hundreds of monks still inside .
The monastery was sealed off after " police stopped an attempt by monks to peacefully mark the honor to the Dalai Lama last week , " ICT reported .
" Another significant monastery in the city , Nechung , is also apparently closed , " the ICT added .
The group described " a tense atmosphere in Lhasa ( that ) has been described as similar to ' martial law , ' with increased numbers of troops on the streets . "
" Tibetan sources report a buildup of armed police in the city , checkpoints on roads out of Lhasa , and an order to Lhasa citizens not to carry out any religious or celebratory activities , " the ICT reported .
When asked about the report , a staff member at the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson 's office told CNN he was unaware .
There has been no reaction from the Chinese government in its state - run Xinhua news agency .
In a separate report , the Tibet Centre for Human Rights and Democracy , which also opposes Chinese rule in Tibet , said that Chinese authorities arrested eight Tibetans , including a Drepung monk , celebrating the Dalai Lama 's honor .
U.S. President George W. Bush bestowed the award -- his nation 's highest civilian honor -- on Tenzin Gyatso , the 14th and current Dalai Lama , on October 17 in the Capitol Rotunda .
After the award , China warned that the United States " gravely undermined " relations with China , and it demanded that Washington stop supporting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader and take steps to repair ties .
Since its 1951 invasion , the People 's Republic of China claims to be the rightful and legitimate government of Tibet .
However , ongoing sovereignty disputes have called into question the legitimacy of that claim .
The White House has said it believes the Dalai Lama is calling for more autonomy from communist China , including more freedom for Tibetans to practice their religion .
China , however , sees the Dalai Lama 's work as part of " separatist activities . "

Print This Email This Brooklyn reporter booted after asking about ' foreknowledge ' of 9/11
When GOP presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani stopped off for a little retail politicking at a Colorado coffee house last Saturday , he came prepared to hammer home his commitment to the war on terror , make a jab or two at Hillary Clinton , and field some tough questions about recently indicted pal Bernard Kerik -- but he apparently was n't ready for Sander Hicks .
Hicks , a Brooklyn - based journalist , publisher and all - around multimedia maverick , is also a self - described member of the " 9/11 Truth " movement , a group convinced that official explanations do not fully account for the Sept. 11 tragedies .
As Giuliani shook hands and signed autographs outside of Loveland , Colorado 's Loveland Coffee Company , Hicks was waiting with a question .
" Mr. Giuliani , six years ago you told Peter Jennings that 'we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse , ' " Hicks said , quoting a remark from the former New York City mayor made during an interview with ABC News .
" Where did you get your foreknowledge that the World Trade Center was going to collapse ? "
A laughing Giuliani quickly brushed past Hicks according to a video recording of the campaign stop , ignoring the question as he continued to work his way around an informal circle of supporters and press .
But Hicks was not ignored by the Loveland Police Department .
Two officers immediately took hold of his arms and hauled him into an adjacent parking lot .
" The police were aggressive , " Hicks said in an interview with RAW STORY .
" There 's no need for that .
I was there as a professional reporter . "
After being led away by officers in what he describes as a " submission hold , " Hicks identified himself to authorities and said he was just trying to ask Giuliani a question .
" I 'm a member of the media .
I 'm a publisher and editor - in - chief of the New York Megaphone , " he told police , citing a newspaper he runs which claims a readership of more than 60,000 .
" I 'm the only New York reporter here . "
After denying officers ' assertions that he had pushed people in the crowd , he told authorities that they were violating his right to speak .
" What you did was illegal , " Hicks said .
" What what you did was a violation of my fucking Bill of Rights . "
" I was emotional , " he told RAW STORY .
" My mom was just telling me , ' next time do n't cuss . ' "
Although Hicks was not arrested , officers said he was on private property and ordered him to leave .
" I should not have been grabbed , " the journalist said by phone .
" We need more reporters to ask these questions .
We need more citizens to ask the questions . "
Hicks is no new - comer to political controversy .
He was the subject of the 2002 documentary film Horns and Halos , which focused on his successful efforts to republish author James Hatfield 's unauthorized biography of President Bush , Fortunate Son .
The New York Times bestselling book , which included allegations that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 , was recalled by its original publisher after it was revealed that Hatfield was a paroled felon .
Hicks later returned the biography to bookstore shelves through his own boutique publishing house , Soft Skull Press .
' Why do n't you let go of my hand ' Hicks ' question for Giuliani had referred to an interview with ABC 's then - anchor Peter Jennings , conducted only hours after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York , in which the mayor remarked that he and other top city officials had been warned on that the trade center towers were going to come down .
" I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barclay Street , which was right there with the police commissioner , the fire commissioner , the head of emergency management , and we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse , " Giuliani said in the interview .
" And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building , so we were trapped in the building for 10 , 15 minutes , and finally found an exit and got out , walked north , and took a lot of people with us . "
Critics of 9/11 conspiracy theories say Giuliani was in fact warned -- but only at the last minute .
" Hicks appears to be trying to resuscitate the claim that Rudy knew the Towers were going to collapse in advance , " states an entry at the blog Screw Loose Change , a site which claims to debunk " myths " about Sept. 11 . " EMS Battalion Chief John Peruggia was warned by a NYC building engineer at 9:58 AM that the North Tower was in imminent danger of collapse .
Presumably either Peruggia or the building engineer proceeded to warn the Mayor .
Unfortunately Giuliani has compounded the problem by denying that he had any advance knowledge , perhaps because the kooks generally frame it that he had plenty of warning ... "
Hicks had made a a previous attempt to ask about the Jennings interview earlier in the campaign stop , soon after Giuliani arrived on the scene .
" Rudy , hi , I 'm Sander from the New York Megaphone , " he started , shaking the candidate 's hand .
" On 9/11 , when you said -- " But Giuliani cut him off , saying sharply , " Why do n't you let go of my hand ? "
The exchange was captured on tape by a local Colorado Fox affiliate .
But the candidate was confronted with more 9/11 Truth members once he made his way inside the coffee shop .
" Mayor Giuliani , why 'd you have thousands of tons of steel melted down and shipped off to Asia , " yelled one activist before being shouted down with chants of " Rudy , Rudy " from the crowd .
That individual was also asked to leave by police .
" Hey Rudy , the American people are waking up to the fact that you 're a criminal , " said another Truther .
" You 're a criminal , Rudy , you 're a fake conservative ... "
The protesters were affiliated with two 9/11 Truth organizations , We Are Change Colorado and TruthAlliance .
Giuliani : ' The conspiracy theorists are all over '
After leaving the coffee shop -- and moments before Hicks would be whisked away by police -- Giuliani made some brief comments about the disturbance .
" It 's part of America , " he told reporters .
" You learn when you are mayor of New York City that people have all kinds of different opinions , all kinds of different views ... the conspiracy theorists are all over , they are protesting all over the place ... it's very sad , it 's not true .
But you 're not going to convince them that it 's not true . "
Although Hicks says he is loosely allied with We Are Change Colorado -- and was in Colorado to speak at one of the group 's events -- he is careful to distance himself from tactics he refers to as " heckling . "
" I was not a heckler and I did not raise my voice , " he told RAW STORY .
" I did not scream my question . "
He even has some measured praise for Loveland police .
" The cops did a good job of defusing the situation in the sense that they were professional , they were level headed .
I appreciate the fact that I was not booked , that I was not cuffed , that I was not beaten , " said Hicks .
" But I should n't have to say this .
Of course I should n't have been beaten . "
He hastens to add that the police , in his opinion , " were making a political choice that was not their job to make . "
Even if his opinions about Giuliani and Sept. 11 are incorrect , Hicks said , he still had a right to air them .
" This is the main message : the First Amendment allows me to be wrong , " said Hicks .
" Let 's assume that my line of thinking is completely erroneous ... that is for the even playing field of free discourse to figure out .
We 're supposed to have free speech so that truth and error can both come out . "
Hicks has filed a complaint with the Loveland Police Department , a copy of which is available at his blog .
" No matter what you believe , Loveland Police should be protecting citizens ' First Amendment rights , which include our right to ask questions , " he writes .
" The First Amendment should be counted on to help get the USA back on track , through open dialogue . "

A.D. Corlan > Language Benchmarks
Programming language benchmarks
Translations of this page
This page contains the same program , implemented in the same way , in C , Ada , FORTRAN , Lisp , FORTH , Java , Perl , R and Ruby and run on a 300MHz Pentium under the " woody " Debian GNU / Linux , using exclusively tools that come with the Debian distribution , except for compiling Java I used the jikes compiler from IBM .
This is relevant for applications which involve intensive computations for multiple users , such as simulators with open web access ( like warfarissimo and autovaca ) .
For such applications , performance translates directly into cost : the number of machines you need to buy and maintain in order to serve a given number of users or to achieve a required response time is directly proportional to computation time .
The program we benchmarked computes the same 100 - term polynomial 500,000 times , using exactly the same algorithm .
In all programs the indices of the polynomial are kept in a local float vector .
In this , the program only tests the quality of code which accesses local vectors and performs simple arithmetics in loops , and is free from differences in the standard library , operating system calls and , indeed , the presence of any advanced language features .
There are two versions of the program : ( 1 ) all computations are done inside a single function body ; ( 2 ) each polynomial is computed through a call to a function ; the vector of the 100 coefficients are kept in a statically dimensioned array inside this function ; it is called 500000 times .
The execution speed of the first version was also explored through benchmarks on AMD 64x2 .
Results are below ( in seconds needed to perform the simple task outlined above ) .
Click on the link with a language name to see the details ( program and how to compile and run ) for each language :
naive ( no hand - optimization ) gcc-compiled C is some 30 % slower than fortran and ada , otherwise none is affected by a detectable overhead when allocating a local vector in a function ;
the gcj compiler does a good work , increasing the speed of code more than twice ; however , allocation of local variables ( the `pol ' array for example ) offsets all the gain obtained through native code compilation ;
the performance of the CMU - CL lisp compiler was stellar ; it was better than Java , even compiled natively , despite its highly dynamic nature ; of 10.69 seconds , some 6.5 are for garbage collection .
bytecompiled Perl code is comparable in speed with interpreted R code and is not much slower than Perl code compiled natively ; notice the fact that in R we use vectorial operators which also make the text very compact .
Discussion .
The relevance of these tests rests in the fact that in any language , performance is governed by how quickly operations , loop , access to array elements , function calls , etc , are performed .
Machine - oriented languages ( C , FORTRAN , Ada and to some extent Java ) perform on average 100 times faster than human - expression - oriented languages ( Perl , R , Python , Ruby ) .
Programming a 1 GHz Pentium [ fastest , 1000 $ , 2002 PC ] in Perl is like programming a 10 MHz something [ overclocked , 50 $ , 1982 Z80 - based ZX Spectrum ] in FORTRAN !
This is no big surprise as we are looking at the classical trade - off between the power of a language ( allowing the programmer to express something in a compact way ) and the performace of an implementation ( which classically was related to the language being close to the machine representation ) .
However , the huge exception is CommonLisp .
Lisp is the most powerful language that is , representing the classical extreme choice for expressive power instead of efficient implementation .
This choice seems to have paid off .
Given enough expression power it was possible to write a compiler that competes with any machine - oriented language .
Conclusions ( for me ) :
For new projects in which one is free to choose the language , one should choose Lisp .
An example is the offline generation of web views ( such as this ) of complex , heterogenous databases where there are two requirements : quick implementation of new ideas and a preference for updating the static web site in 10 minutes rather than 15 hours .
If efficiency is very critical and only if the application must be multithreaded , one should choose Ada .
Multithreaded , online simulation servers , like the ones mentioned above , are typical examples .
Other languages , with which one might be highly familiar due to historical reasons , could become efficient languages by being translated into CommonLisp and compiled with CMU - CL .

LILONGWE , Malawi —
When Yang Jie left home at 18 , he was doing what people from China ’s hardscrabble Fujian Province have done for generations : emigrating in search of a better living overseas .
What set him apart was his destination .
Instead of the traditional adopted homelands like the United States and Europe , where Fujian people have settled by the hundreds of thousands , he chose this small , landlocked country in southern Africa .
“ Before I left China , ” said Mr. Yang , now 25 , “ I thought Africa was all one big desert . ”
So he figured that ice cream would be in high demand , and with money pooled from relatives and friends , he created his own factory at the edge of Lilongwe , Malawi ’s capital .
The climate is in fact subtropical , but that has not stopped his ice cream company from becoming the country ’s biggest .
Stories like this have become legion across Africa in the past five years or so , as hundreds of thousands of Chinese have discovered the continent , setting off to do business in a part of the world that had been terra incognita .
The Xinhua News Agency recently estimated that at least 750,000 Chinese were working or living for extended periods on the continent , a reflection of deepening economic ties between China and Africa that reached $ 55 billion in trade in 2006 , compared with less than $ 10 million a generation earlier .
Ten years ago , Microsoft was the company everyone loved to hate .
The most vociferous Microsoft haters slammed the company for being a greedy industry bully that used its monopolistic , clunky , copycat operating system to force software on users and coerce partners into unfair licensing deals .
Do n't look now , but the role of the industry 's biggest bully is increasingly played by Apple , not Microsoft .
Here 's a look at how Apple has shoved Microsoft aside as the company with the worst reputation as a monopolist , copycat and a bully .
Apple the Monopolist
The core complaint about Microsoft in the 1990s was that its Windows market share gave it monopoly power , which it abused in multiple ways .
Attorneys General and others zeroed in on the " bundling " of the Internet Explorer Web browser , which they claimed was forced on users because Microsoft offered it as part of Windows .
People love iPods ( including me ; my family of four has purchased 12 iPods in the past few years ) .
But iPods come bundled with iTunes .
Want to buy music from Apple ?
Guess what ?
You must install iTunes .
Want an Apple cell phone from AT&T ?
Yep !
ITunes is required even if you want only to make phone calls .
Want to buy ringtones for your Apple phone ?
ITunes .
Apple not only " bundles " iTunes with multiple products , it forces you to use it .
At least with Internet Explorer , you could always just download a competitor and ignore IE .
Not fair , you might say .
Any hardware device that syncs data with a PC as part of its core functionality has software to facilitate that syncing .
True enough .
But operating systems have browsers as part of core functionality , too .
Does n't Mac OS X come with Safari ?
Does n't the iPhone ?
And " bundling " works .
Steve Jobs bragged this week that Apple has distributed 600 million copies of iTunes to date .
The overwhelming majority of those copies were iTunes for Windows .
And iTunes for Windows ' popularity is n't driven by software product quality .
ITunes is the slowest , clunkiest , most nonintuitive application on my system .
But I need it because I love my iPods .
At least with Windows , you could reformat your PC and install Linux or any number of other PC - compatible operating systems .
Can I reformat my iPod and install something else ?
Can I uninstall iTunes but keep using the iTunes store and my iPods ?
Apple strongly discourages all that , claiming that the iPod , the iPod software and iTunes are three components of the same product .
But that 's what Microsoft said about Windows and IE .
Sorry , Dad
Here 's a scenario for you .
A consumer walks into a local retail outlet to buy a Christmas present for dad .
The Apple iPod " section " of the store dwarfs the section where all the also - ran players are displayed .
IPod is clearly the trusted standard .
The consumer buys a shiny new " Fatty " iPod nano with video .
Dad opens the present and is excited .
He follows the directions , installs iTunes and immediately splurges on a few dozen songs at the iTunes store .
He loves it , and is an instant convert to portable digital music .
The only downside is that he works out every day at the gym , where cardio machines face TVs that broadcast sound over FM radio .
Six months later , when his iPod is stolen , he goes to buy another player -- this time , he hopes , with an FM radio in it .
Several competitors offer this feature , but not iPods .
He 's about to choose a new player with an FM radio when it hits him :
None of his files -- now totaling 300 songs and 50 movies -- will play on the new player .
He bought and paid for all this content , but it only works with iPods and iTunes .
Apple has an iPod customer for life .
Microsoft never had this kind of monopoly power .
Sorry , dad .
I should have bought you a tie .
Sticker Shock
Another clue that a company has monopoly power is when you find yourself suffering sticker shock .
How many times have you stood in line at the theater megaplex and marveled at the chutzpah required to charge $ 4.50 for a soft drink , when the same beverage is one - third the price at the quickie mart 50 feet outside the theater doors ?
But -- so sorry ! -- no outside food or beverages are allowed in the theater .
The theater has a monopoly on soft drink sales , and you 'll pay what they charge .
That same shock rippled through the iPhone enthusiast community yesterday when Jobs announced with a straight face that iPhone ringtones based on iTunes songs would cost the full price of the song , plus 99 cents extra .
What ?
The full song costs 99 cents !
How on Earth can Apple seriously charge the same amount again for the ability to hear just 30 seconds of the song -- the same length as the free iTunes " samples " ?
Apple fully understands the power of monopoly pricing .
The company has sold the 8GB iPhone for two prices in its short , three months of existence : $ 599 and , now , $ 399 .
When the iPhone was the only way to get the whole multitouch , big - screen , Wi-Fi iPod experience -- when the product had no alternatives -- the price was $ 599 .
One analyst estimated Apple 's cost to build an iPhone is $ 245.83 .
I do n't know if that 's true but , if so , more than half the user cost was profit .
That 's theater soda pricing .
But as soon as Apple introduced an alternative to the iPhone -- the iPod Touch -- Apple dropped the price by one - third .
Imagine if another company were allowed to compete in the OS X media player market .
These players would all drop to below $ 300 .
Do n't hold your breath , though ; it 'll never happen .
Apple has the power to exclude all others from software than runs on its media players .
Microsoft could only dream of such power .
Apple the Copycat
Ten years ago , Microsoft haters complained that Windows followed the Mac OS to market as a graphical user interface , copying the Mac 's features such as folders , trash cans , resizable windows and other elements .
That complaint was repeated with each new version of Windows -- Apple was the innovator in the operating system space , and got there first with a host of key features .
Microsoft just came along later , duplicated features that Apple pioneered , and reaped the benefit because of its monopoly power .
But who 's innovating now ?
The LG KE850 was winning awards for its full - screen , touch - screen , on - screen keyboard before Jobs even announced the iPhone .
The best thing about the iPhone and iPod Touch -- the warm - and - fuzzy multitouch UI with gestures -- was n't new , either .
Various labs have been demonstrating similar UIs for more than a decade , and even Microsoft demonstrated a fully realized 3G UI in May , well before Apple shipped the iPhone .
Microsoft will ship its tabletop UI , called Microsoft Surface , in November , and Apple will likely enter this space with a 3G UI months or years after Microsoft does .
And Wi-Fi in a media player ?
Ha !
Microsoft 's funky Zune had that almost a year before Apple did and SanDisk 's Sansa Connect with Wi-Fi was released last June .
Apple even stole the name for its iPod Touch product , according to HTC , which sells a touch - screen smart phone called the HTC Touch .
Do n't get me wrong .
I think Apple 's execution of these features is far better than its competitors ' .
And it would be horrible decision - making to not build the iPhone simply because others pioneered key features .
But that 's not what I 'm talking about .
I 'm talking about Apple doing what Microsoft did : dominating the market with features other companies had first .
If it was fair to slam Microsoft over Windows , it 's fair to slam Apple over the iPhone and iPod Touch .
Apple the Bully
Microsoft used to be the big bully , pushing everyone around and dictating terms to partners .
Microsoft has lost its edge in this regard -- most of Microsoft 's major resellers brazenly hawk Linux .
Even Intel -- the " tel " part of " Wintel " -- is powering Macs these days .
Microsoft is still profitable , but it has lost control -- and has lost its reputation as the bully nobody can say no to .
Meanwhile , Jobs has suddenly become the most feared man in Hollywood , bragging Thursday about Apple 's scary dominance in digital media sales .
Apple has sold more than 3 billion songs and 95 million TV shows via iTunes .
While music CD sales crash and burn , almost one - third of all music sales are now digital .
As Jobs euphemistically said yesterday , " iTunes is leading the way . "
Although full details have n't been revealed , NBC apparently wanted more " flexibility " to charge higher prices for its TV shows on iTunes .
Apple said no , and NBC was sent packing .
NBC now plans to sell shows on alternative locations , such as its own Web site and on Amazon.com .
Prediction : NBC will come crawling back to Apple and beg the company for inclusion , and on Apple 's terms .
Why ?
Because iTunes is increasingly becoming the only venue in which media companies can succeed selling music and TV show .
Jobs rules like Bill Gates never did .
If you want to succeed in the digital music or downloadable TV business , you 'll do things his way .
Why I Support Apple
After reading my preceding comments , you may be surprised at my next statement : I come not to bury Apple , but to support it .
You see , my point is n't that Apple 's growing bad reputation is deserved , but that Microsoft 's was n't .
All that evil monopoly hype , court cases and public posturing directed for so long at Microsoft drained energy and resources from the entire industry .
The market , however , corrects issues such as that .
In the case of Microsoft's " monopoly , " Linux , Firefox and now Apple prove that customers always had choices .
The same goes for Apple .
As pundits , bloggers , users , politicians , Hollywood big shots , regulators , lawyers and competitors increasingly bash Apple , accuse it of unfair play and call for legal and regulatory action , I will defend it , as I defended Microsoft .
It 's fun to slam big , powerful companies that are dominating their markets .
But in the final analysis , Apple has earned its growing power and influence , just like Microsoft did .
Is Apple a monopolist , copycat and bully ?
Yes , and deservedly so .
And if anyone thinks Apple 's success is a problem , well , bringing in the lawyers was n't the solution for Microsoft , and it wo n't be the solution for Apple .

This story , " Is Apple the New Microsoft ? " was originally published by Computerworld .
The measure was rushed through both the House and Senate as a stopgap measure , in part because of a classified ruling earlier this year by a special intelligence court , which held that the government needed to seek court - approved warrants to monitor those international calls going through American switches .
The new law expires in six months , but the White House has said it wants the provisions made permanent .
Mr. Leahy said his committee and the Senate in general need the paperwork to properly assess the administration ’s rationale for the eavesdropping .
It was no surprise that the White House did not meet the demands of the subpoena today , since it has balked at earlier deadlines and the White House counsel , Fred Fielding , told Mr. Leahy ’s committee today that the White House still needed more time .
Mr. Leahy did say that the office of Vice President Dick Cheney had at least acknowledged the existence of some documents that his committee is seeking .
Mr. Leahy said a letter acknowledging the documents was “ a good first step , ” one that should be followed by the administration ’s quickly turning them over .
But Mr. Leahy said the administration had maintained today , as it has before , that the office of the vice president is not part of the executive office of the president , and instead was “ some kind of fourth branch of government . ”
Japanese toymaker Bandai's Mugen Puchi-Puchi is a handheld electronic gizmo that makes the sound of popping bubblewrap when you press on the plastic bubbles .
From Mainichi Daily News :
… Once in every 100 squeezes of an air bubble , instead of emitting a " popping " sound , the noise will be replaced by the sound of a fart or a woman moaning in ecstasy .
To avoid any embarrassing situations , Sunday Mainichi notes that Mugen Puchi Puchi's are made to automatically turn off the sound on the train , so people can squeeze their air bubbles in peace knowing that they 're not going to produce any unseemly noises .
Jack Dromey , the deputy general secretary of the T&G section of Unite , said that self - regulation of the private equity industry was " worse than useless " .
Speaking in a TUC debate on private equity in Brighton this morning , Mr Dromey said that there was a pressing need for the government to act to defend workers when private equity companies entered the equation .
In a passionate address , the deputy union leader , whose wife is Labour 's deputy leader , Harriet Harman , said : " Private equity makes the Cosa Nostra look like a model of openness and transparency by comparison .
" They take our members ' jobs , they pile our companies with debt , they fleece all of us by not paying their fair share of tax and then expect us to be grateful .
" All the evidence we have seen is that jobs , pay , terms and conditions and pensions are put at risk when these companies come in , " he continued .
Earlier this year , the unions mounted a campaign to pressure the government to close down loopholes and improve the accountability and transparency of private equity firms .
Unions accuse these companies of borrowing large sums of money to buy up and asset - strip companies , then " slashing " jobs and hard - won conditions of employment for workers .
TUC delegates today backed moves to establish a database to track the activities of private equity funds both in the UK and overseas .
Unions also want consultation rights for staff where companies are taken over by private equity , and a review of the impact of pensions regarding the transparency of information provided by the industry .
Mr Dromey added : " We recognise that sometimes they will be the only show in town .
That is why the shroud of secrecy must be lifted , the tax regimes altered to make them fair , but above all our members must be offered protection . "
Earlier this morning , Richard Lambert , the director general of the Confederation of British Industry , faced tough questions from delegates over the tax arrangements of private equity firms following his keynote address to conference .
Mr Lambert said that private equity companies found themselves playing a " different role " in the economy after enjoying a period of huge growth .
But he acknowledged that the private equity industry should disclose more information than it had done in the past .
" There are other stakeholders who need to know what is going on , " he said .
I have a friend who has had affairs with a lot of married men , and she says the reason she even talked to them in the first place was because not one wore a wedding ring .
Later , after she ’d slept with them , they ’d tell her they were married , and when she asked why they did n’t wear rings , they all gave the same explanation : “ I just do n’t like jewelry . ”
When she told me this , she shook her head wryly and said , “ All those married women out there whose husbands are n’t wearing rings should be worried .
It ’s never an innocent choice . ”
But men who choose to go bandless insist they are doing it for a more innocuous reason than adulterous intentions : an unwillingness to be publicly defined by their marital state .
They want to be seen as people before they are seen as married , which presumes that one can not be both .
“ Once you ’re labeled a married man , ” says my friend Julian , 36 , a commercial director and Nakedfinger ( or NF ) who ’s been married twelve years , “ you ’re deprived of the attention of numerous people who might have been interested in you .
They fill in all these blanks before you can establish what you ’re about .
You become a stereotype .
If you act removed , then you ’re whipped , and if you ’re friendly , even innocently , then they think you ’re looking to cheat . ”
For the record , he says he has n’t , though I ’m not sure I believe him .
Unlike many NFs , he wears a sterling - silver ring on the third finger of his left hand .
When I first saw it I assumed it was a wedding band that had magically migrated for the evening .
“ I ’m not anti-jewelry , ” he says .
“ I just hate the look of a wedding ring .
It reminds me of a gay priest or a Banana Republic ad .
It ’s very bourgeois . ”
After half an hour of these varied rationalizations , he begins to sound like George Bush coming up with justifications for the war in Iraq .
Let ’s call a spade a spade .
Is n’t the main reason all these guys go ringless so that they can flirt with unwitting single women ?
David , a 32 - year - old trader and NF , says he often gets attention from women who assume he ’s single .
“ I like messing around with that a little bit , where you can flirt a little and not mention that you ’re married .
My wife does n’t care .
She ’s usually at the same party chatting it up with some guy without even realizing she ’s being hit on . ”
My husband , Jake , for his part , says he gets more attention now that he wears a band .
He does n’t think it ’s the ring so much as his attitude ; he ’s not looking , so he seems more confident .
One woman chatted him up at a weekly music show he goes to .
“ I saw you here last week with a woman , ” she said .
“ That was my wife , ” he said , raising his hand .
She did n’t bat an eye ; she just kept chatting , telling him where she lived and walking him all the way to the subway .
But lest single women get a bad name , most of the bachelorettes I know have no interest in sleeping with married men .
They find NFs infuriating — precisely because they sell a false bill .
I have a girlfriend who often gets in conversations with men at parties , only to have them tell her half an hour later that they ’re married .
She hates being misled when she could have spent her time talking to someone single .
A $ 800 platinum band might be uncomfortable at the gym , but if all the married guys out there dusted theirs off and slipped them on for holiday parties this season , thousands of single women would be spared unnecessary confusion .
There is , however , one class of married man that should be exempt from any sort of band - wearing , free to mislead and philander as they wish : guys who were strong - armed into buying expensive engagement rings for their wives .
In an era when women ’s earning potential is nearly the same as men’s , I find it disgusting that so many women still insist on being bought .
They want to have it both ways : earn equally but then trade sex for money .
I have less respect for them than I do for prostitutes , who have integrity .
I only hope these women ’s husbands cheat viciously , humiliate them , and leave them .
But sadly , in this day and age , divorce is the best thing they can hope for .
It used to be “ Marry for money , and you earn every cent , ” but these days it ’s more like “ Marry for money , and when you divorce , you ’ll be set for life . ”
Confessions of an ex Peak Oil Believer
By F William Engdahl , September 14 , 2007
The good news is that panic scenarios about the world running out of oil anytime soon are wrong .
The bad news is that the price of oil is going to continue to rise .
Peak
Oil is not our problem .
Politics is .
Big
Oil wants to sustain high oil prices .
Dick Cheney and friends are all too willing to assist .
On a personal note , Ive researched questions of petroleum , since the first oil shocks of the 1970s .
I was intrigued in 2003 with something called Peak Oil theory .
It seemed to explain the otherwise inexplicable decision by Washington to risk all in a military move on Iraq .
Peak Oil advocates , led by former BP geologist Colin Campbell , and Texas banker Matt Simmons , argued that the world faced a new crisis , an end to cheap oil , or Absolute Peak Oil , perhaps by 2012 , perhaps by 2007 .
Oil was supposedly on its last drops .
They pointed to our soaring gasoline and oil prices , to the declines in output of North Sea and Alaska and other fields as proof they were right .
According to Campbell , the fact that no new North Sea - size fields had been discovered since the North Sea in the late 1960s was proof .
He reportedly managed to convince the International Energy Agency and the Swedish government .
That , however , does not prove him correct .
Intellectual fossils ?
The Peak Oil school rests its theory on conventional Western geology textbooks , most by American or British geologists , which claim oil is a  fossil fuel ,  a biological residue or detritus of either fossilized dinosaur remains or perhaps algae , hence a product in finite supply .
Biological origin is central to Peak
Oil theory , used to explain why oil is only found in certain parts of the world where it was geologically trapped millions of years ago .
That would mean that , say , dead dinosaur remains became compressed and over tens of millions of years fossilized and trapped in underground reservoirs perhaps 4 -6,000 feet below the surface of the earth .
In rare cases , so goes the theory , huge amounts of biological matter should have been trapped in rock formations in the shallower ocean offshore as in the Gulf of Mexico or North Sea or Gulf of Guinea .
Geology should be only about figuring out where these pockets in the layers of the earth , called reservoirs , lie within certain sedimentary basins .
An entirely alternative theory of oil formation has existed since the early 1950s in Russia , almost unknown to the West .
It claims conventional American biological origins theory is an unscientific absurdity that is un-provable .
They point to the fact that western geologists have repeatedly predicted finite oil over the past century , only to then find more , lots more .
Not only has this alternative explanation of the origins of oil and gas existed in theory .
The emergence of Russia and prior of the USSR as the worlds largest oil producer and natural gas producer has been based on the application of the theory in practice .
This has geopolitical consequences of staggering magnitude .
Necessity : the mother of invention
In the 1950s the Soviet Union faced  Iron Curtain isolation from the West .
The Cold War was in high gear .
Russia had little oil to fuel its economy .
Finding sufficient oil indigenously was a national security priority of the highest order .
Scientists at the Institute of the Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences began a fundamental inquiry in the late 1940s : where does oil come from ?
In 1956 , Prof. Vladimir Porfiryev announced their conclusions :  Crude oil and natural petroleum gas have no intrinsic connection with biological matter originating near the surface of the earth .
They are primordial materials which have been erupted from great depths .
The Soviet geologists had turned Western orthodox geology on its head .
They called their theory of oil origin the a-biotic theory non - biological to distinguish from the Western biological theory of origins .
If they were right , oil supply on earth would be limited only by the amount of hydrocarbon constituents present deep in the earth at the time of the earths formation .
Availability of oil would depend only on technology to drill ultra - deep wells and explore into the earths inner regions .
They also realized old fields could be revived to continue producing , so called self - replentishing fields .
They argued that oil is formed deep in the earth , formed in conditions of very high temperature and very high pressure , like that required for diamonds to form .
 Oil is a primordial material of deep origin which is transported at high pressure via cold eruptive processes into the crust of the earth ,  Porfiryev stated .
His team dismissed the idea that oil is was biological residue of plant and animal fossil remains as a hoax designed to perpetuate the myth of limited supply .
Defying conventional geology
That radically different Russian and Ukrainian scientific approach to the discovery of oil allowed the USSR to develop huge gas and oil discoveries in regions previously judged unsuitable , according to Western geological exploration theories , for presence of oil .
The new petroleum theory was used in the early 1990s , well after the dissolution of the USSR , to drill for oil and gas in a region believed for more than forty - five years , to be geologically barren the Dnieper - Donets Basin in the region between Russia and Ukraine .
Following their a -biotic or non-fossil theory of the deep origins of petroleum , the Russian and Ukrainian petroleum geophysicists and chemists began with a detailed analysis of the tectonic history and geological structure of the crystalline basement of the Dnieper - Donets Basin .
After a tectonic and deep structural analysis of the area , they made geophysical and geochemical investigations .
A total of sixty one wells were drilled , of which thirty seven were commercially productive , an extremely impressive exploration success rate of almost sixty percent .
The size of the field discovered compared with the North Slope of Alaska .
By contrast , US wildcat drilling was considered successful with a ten percent success rate .
Nine of ten wells are typically dry holes . 
That Russian geophysics experience in finding oil and gas was tightly wrapped in the usual Soviet veil of state security during the Cold War era , and went largely unknown to Western geophysicists , who continued to teach fossil origins and , hence , the severe physical limits of petroleum .
Slowly it began to dawn on some strategists in and around the Pentagon well after the 2003 Iraq war , that the Russian geophysicists might be on to something of profound strategic importance .
If Russia had the scientific know - how and Western geology not , Russia possessed a strategic trump card of staggering geopolitical import .
It was not surprising that Washington would go about erecting a wall of steel a network of military bases and ballistic anti-missile shields around Russia , to cut her pipeline and port links to western Europe , China and the rest of Eurasia .
Halford Mackinders worst nightmare - - a cooperative convergence of mutual interests of the major states of Eurasia , born of necessity and need for oil to fuel economic growth - - was emerging .
Ironically , it was the blatant US grab for the vast oil riches of Iraq and , potentially , of Iran , that catalyzed closer cooperation between traditional Eurasian foes , China and Russia , and a growing realization in western Europe that their options too were narrowing .
The Peak King
Peak
Oil theory is based on a 1956 paper done by the late Marion King Hubbert , a Texas geologist working for Shell Oil .
He argued that oil wells produced in a bell curve manner , and once their peak was hit , inevitable decline followed .
He predicted the United States oil production would peak in 1970 .
A modest man , he named the production curve he invented , Hubberts Curve , and the peak as Hubberts Peak .
When US oil output began to decline in around 1970 Hubbert gained a certain fame .
The only problem was , it peaked not because of resource depletion in the US fields .
It peaked  because Shell , Mobil , Texaco and the other partners of Saudi Aramco were flooding the US market with dirt cheap Middle East imports , tariff free , at prices so low California and many Texas domestic producers could not compete and were forced to shut their wells in .
Vietnam success
While the American oil multinationals were busy controlling the easily accessible large fields of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Iran and other areas of cheap , abundant oil during the 1960s , the Russians were busy testing their alternative theory .
They began drilling in a supposedly barren region of Siberia .
There they developed eleven major oil fields and one Giant field based on their deep a-biotic geological estimates .
They drilled into crystalline basement rock and hit black gold of a scale comparable to the Alaska North Slope .
They then went to Vietnam in the 1980s and offered to finance drilling costs to show their new geological theory worked .
The Russian company Petrosov drilled in Vietnams White Tiger oilfield offshore into basalt rock some 17,000 feet down and extracted 6,000 barrels a day of oil to feed the energy - starved Vietnam economy .
In the USSR , a- biotic - trained Russian geologists perfected their knowledge and the USSR emerged as the worlds largest oil producer by the mid-1980s .
Few in the West understood why , or bothered to ask .
Dr. J. F. Kenney is one of the only few Western geophysicists who has taught and worked in Russia , studying under Vladilen Krayushkin , who developed the huge Dnieper - Donets Basin .
Kenney told me in a recent interview that alone to have produced the amount of oil to date that ( Saudi Arabias )
Ghawar field has produced would have required a cube of fossilized dinosaur detritus , assuming 100 % conversion efficiency , measuring 19 miles deep , wide and high . 
In short , an absurdity .
Western geologists do not bother to offer hard scientific proof of fossil origins .
They merely assert as a holy truth .
The Russians have produced volumes of scientific papers , most in Russian .
The dominant Western journals have no interest in publishing such a revolutionary view .
Careers , entire academic professions are at stake after all .
Closing the door
The 2003 arrest of Russian Mikhail Khodorkovsky , of Yukos Oil , took place just before he could sell a dominant stake in Yukos to ExxonMobil after a private meeting with Dick Cheney .
Had Exxon got the stake they would have control of the worlds largest resource of geologists and engineers trained in the a -biotic techniques of deep drilling .
Since 2003 Russian scientific sharing of their knowledge has markedly lessened .
Offers in the early 1990s to share their knowledge with US and other oil geophysicists were met with cold rejection according to American geophysicists involved .
Why then the high - risk war to control Iraq ?
For a century US and allied Western oil giants have controlled world oil via control of Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or Nigeria .
Today , as many giant fields are declining , the companies see the state - controlled oilfields of Iraq and Iran as the largest remaining base of cheap , easy oil .
With the huge demand for oil from China and now India , it becomes a geopolitical imperative for the United States to take direct , military control of those Middle East reserves as fast as possible .
Vice President Dick Cheney , came to the job from Halliburton Corp. , the worlds largest oil geophysical services company .
The only potential threat to that US control of oil just happens to lie inside Russia and with the now - state - controlled Russian energy giants .
Hmmmm .
According to Kenney the Russian geophysicists used the theories of the brilliant German scientist Alfred Wegener fully 30 years before the Western geologists discovered 
Wegener in the 1960s .
In 1915 Wegener published the seminal text , The Origin of Continents and Oceans , which suggested an original unified landmass or pangaea more than 200 million years ago which separated into present Continents by what he called Continental Drift .
Up to the 1960s supposed US scientists such as Dr Frank Press , White House science advisor referred to Wegener as lunatic .
Geologists at the end of the 1960s were forced to eat their words as Wegener offered the only interpretation that allowed them to discover the vast oil resources of the North Sea .
Perhaps in some decades Western geologists will rethink their mythology of fossil origins and realize what the Russians have known since the 1950s .
In the meantime Moscow holds a massive energy trump card .

Updated ( 1/18/2011 ) :
Because there ’s still a lot of confusion , I ’ve created Â a third post that attempts to resolve a lot of the questions from the comments on the last two posts .
The new post is here .
Updated ( 8/27/2009 ) : I ’ve created another post that attempts to make the distinctions a bit more clear .
The new post is here .
What is the difference between a URL and URI and why does it matter ?
This topic is confusing to some ( myself included ) and I thought I ’d share my understanding of the two concepts .
I ’m hoping this post will give you a better understanding about how the two differ and why it matters to some .
Note :
The goal of this post is to simplify the distinction between URI and URI .
If you feel that in the summarization process something was lost , or it ’s simply just correct , please post a comment and the information will be corrected .
I only ask for any comments / criticism to be constructive .
Update :
Thanks some constructive , and not - so constructive , feedback from some readers I have updated this post to correct many of my own misunderstandings .
Of which , there were many .
URI
A URI identifies a resource either by location , or a name , or both .
More often than not , most of us use URIs that defines a location to a resource .
The fact that a URI can identify a resources by both name and location has lead to a lot of the confusion in my opionion .
A URI has two specializations known as URL and URN .
URN
A URI identifies a resource by name in a given namespace but not define how the resource maybe obtained .
This type of URI is called a URN .
You may see URNs used in XML Schema documents to define a namespace , usually using a syntax such as :
< xsd : schema xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " xmlns:xsd = " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " targetNamespace=" urn:example "
Here the targetNamespace use a URN .
It defines an identifier to the namespace , but it does not define a location .
URL
A URL is a specialization of URI that defines the network location of a specific resource .
Unlike a URN , the URL defines how the resource can be obtained .
We use URLs every day in the form of http://damnhandy.com, etc .
But a URL does n’t have to be an HTTP URL , it can be ftp://damnhandy.com , smb://damnhandy.com , etc .
The Difference Between Them
So what is the difference between URI and URL ?
It ’s not as clear cut as I would like , but here ’s my stab at it :
A URI is an identifier for some resource , but a URL gives you specific information as to obtain that resource .
A URI is a URL and as one commenter pointed out , it is now considered incorrect to use URL when describing applications .
Generally , if the URL describes both the location and name of a resource , the term to use is URI .
Since this is generally the case most of us encounter everyday , URI is the correct term .

You 've got to feel scared and deeply demoralized when you receive emails which describe the searing realities confronting ordinary Americans .
The email I received a while back , which is the subject of this diary , did not come from a Kossack .
I know this much , because Kossacks always identify themselves .
Like so many before , and so many which will follow , it came from another desperate American citizen ready to give up .
Mine was a virtual shoulder for this person to lean on .
Then I read about Hank LeMieux and I thought this is the face of my nameless email .
I suppose the email came from someone we 'd call a lurker .
It came from an American citizen who happens to read Daily Kos .
A citizen some in our country would like to think does n't exist .
But this citizen does exist as do tens of millions just like him .
Here 's one .
Let 's put a face , a name and a body on our immense national tragedy .
His name is Hank LeMieux and he is an American citizen .
LeMieux is one of tens of millions of Americans with Medicare or Medicaid coverage .
Many find themselves either unable to find doctors who accept their coverage or struggling to foot the bill for expensive yet necessary prescription medications .
Sadly , the brutal anguish the email articulates , just like the plight of Hank LeMieux , is the primal scream of our nation .
What do you say to someone who sends you an email which ends , " it 's not death that scares me , it 's our country . "
What do you say to a sick person who is resigned to dying but cannot fathom being abandoned while sick by his country ?
What do you say to someone who tells you they 've led an honorable life .
They 've worked hard , they 've saved , but they did n't count on an illness that would bankrupt them ?
What do you say to someone who says , I want to die so my family will not be forced into the street ?
What do you say to someone who says , this is not the country I grew up in ?
But as we know , his story , and the questions he asks , are far from unique .
Even more grotesque , his story is status quo for countless hard - working American citizens .
His story is commonplace in the richest country on the planet .
Hank LeMieux , a senior citizen , one of our most vulnerable citizens is the face of our shame .
LeMieux , a cancer survivor , is experiencing what many have dubbed the " doughnut hole , " a result of a Medicare Part D provision leading to a break in prescription drug coverage .
LeMieux said Medicare temporarily discontinued drug coverage after doling out a total of $ 2,400 since January .
Unless LeMieux shells out approximately $ 3,000 toward his remaining 2007 prescription costs , he said , Medicare will not resume coverage until next year .
In the meantime , LeMieux — who should be taking seven medications — is taking just five .
The emails I receive almost always recount stories of unimaginable suffering .
Someday I am sure , we will describe the nation we lived in in 2007 to our grandchildren and they will recoil in disbelief .
We will explain that there was a time in the United States when this was routine treatment of our elderly .
" When you ’re a man who is 70 years old and worked hard all your life ... it ’s hard to make it when you have $ 860 worth of ( monthly ) prescriptions , " said LeMieux , adding that his physician , Dr. Jonathan Wheeler , recently supplied him with free samples of two medications that he would otherwise not have access to .
I have no doubt , nor should you , that I am not the only person to be in receipt of a steady flow of what I would call screams of pain .
Imagine for a moment , the desperate pleas received by the political class .
I often find myself wondering how these people sleep at night ?
Because , in all candor , many nights I lay awake and think about what I have read and say , there but for the grace of God go I .
What does it say about the people we elect to lead govern that they know , yet fail to respond to the manifest indignitites visited upon fellow Americans by our broken healthcare system ?
Leaders Politicians who find themselves unable to summon the courage to advocate on behalf of the American people .
Leaders Politicians who find themselves unwilling to fight for the radical changes necessary to end the human suffering which has burrowed deep into the heart and soul of the American people ?
They sit by while such intense pain occurs in the richest nation on the planet .
Napan Jerry Hazel , 75 , a recipient of both Medi-Cal and Medicare , is suffering from advanced tooth decay .
Several years ago , Hazel said , he saw a dentist who ordered multiple tooth extractions and dentures .
He said he has searched for an oral surgeon in Napa , but is unable to find one who takes Medi-Cal patients .
Still unable to receive care , he regularly takes pain medications for his condition .
Hazel said he occasionally seeks treatment for recurring gum infections caused by the lack of proper medical attention .
" Others must be going through what I ’m going through .
I just gave up all hope .
Everyone says , ‘ I ’m sorry , Mr. Hazel .
There ’s nothing I can do for you . ’"
Hazel , who must stick to eating only soft foods , said embarrassment of the condition of his teeth often prevents him from interacting with others .

Some of us accept our fate without questioning right and wrong .
Some accept all manner of horrors with stoic bravery .
Others , like the person who sent the email , ask only for a moment of reflection and ask a simple question .
What , dear Lord , has happened to the country of my birth ?
Mitt Romney is seen working on his speech in which he will promise to serve \ " only the common cause of the people of the United States .
\" ( Romney for President photo / Abby Brack ) Romney : ' Freedom requires religion '
In his much - anticipated speech on religious freedom and his own Mormon faith , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said Thursday that if elected president , he would " serve no one religion , no one
group , no one cause " :
Advertisement
" I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it , " Romney said .
" My faith is the faith of my fathers .
I will be true to them and to my beliefs . "
Still , Romney underlined the separation of church and state and echoed President John Kennedy 's famous 1960 speech in which Kennedy tried to make voters comfortable with his Catholicism .
" I do not define my candidacy by my religion .
A person should not be elected because of his faith , nor should he be rejected because of his faith , " Romney said at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station , Texas .
Here 's the full text of the speech , as released by the Romney campaign :
COLLEGE STATION , Texas – Speaking at The George Bush Presidential Library , Governor Romney addressed the American people about his views on religious liberty , our country grand tradition of religious tolerance and how faith would inform his Presidency .
Governor Romney 's " Faith in America " Address ( As prepared for delivery ) :
" Thank you , Mr. President , for your kind introduction .
" It is an honor to be here today .
This is an inspiring place because of you and the First Lady and because of the film exhibited across the way in the Presidential library .
For those who have not seen it , it shows the President as a young pilot , shot down during the Second World War , being rescued from his life - raft by the crew of an American submarine .
It is a moving reminder that when America has faced challenge and peril , Americans rise to the occasion , willing to risk their very lives to defend freedom and preserve our nation .
We are in your debt .
Thank you , Mr. President .
" Mr. President , your generation rose to the occasion , first to defeat Fascism and then to vanquish the Soviet Union .
You left us , your children , a free and strong America .
It is why we call yours the greatest generation .
It is now my generation 's turn .
How we respond to today 's challenges will define our generation .
And it will determine what kind of America we will leave our children , and theirs .
" America faces a new generation of challenges .
Radical violent Islam seeks to destroy us .
An emerging China endeavors to surpass our economic leadership .
And we are troubled at home by government overspending , overuse of foreign oil , and the breakdown of the family .
" Over the last year , we have embarked on a national debate on how best to preserve American leadership .
Today , I wish to address a topic which I believe is fundamental to America 's greatness : our religious liberty .
I will also offer perspectives on how my own faith would inform my Presidency , if I were elected .
" There are some who may feel that religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of the weighty threats that face us .
If so , they are at odds with the nation 's founders , for they , when our nation faced its greatest peril , sought the blessings of the Creator .
And further , they discovered the essential connection between the survival of a free land and the protection of religious freedom .
In John Adams ’ words : ' We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion .
...
Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people . '
" Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .
Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God.
Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone .
" Given our grand tradition of religious tolerance and liberty , some wonder whether there are any questions regarding an aspiring candidate 's religion that are appropriate .
I believe there are .
And I will answer them today .
" Almost 50 years ago another candidate from Massachusetts explained that he was an American running for president , not a Catholic running for president .
Like him , I am an American running for president .
I do not define my candidacy by my religion .
A person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith .
" Let me assure you that no authorities of my church , or of any other church for that matter , will ever exert influence on presidential decisions .
Their authority is theirs , within the province of church affairs , and it ends where the affairs of the nation begin .
" As governor , I tried to do the right as best I knew it , serving the law and answering to the Constitution .
I did not confuse the particular teachings of my church with the obligations of the office and of the Constitution — and of course , I would not do so as President .
I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law .
" As a young man , Lincoln described what he called America 's ' political religion ' — the commitment to defend the rule of law and the Constitution .
When I place my hand on the Bible and take the oath of office , that oath becomes my highest promise to God .
If I am fortunate to become your president , I will serve no one religion , no one group , no one cause , and no one interest .
A President must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States .
" There are some for whom these commitments are not enough .
They would prefer it if I would simply distance myself from my religion , say that it is more a tradition than my personal conviction , or disavow one or another of its precepts .
That I will not do .
I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it .
My faith is the faith of my fathers — I will be true to them and to my beliefs .
" Some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy .
If they are right , so be it .
But I think they underestimate the American people .
Americans do not respect believers of convenience .
Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs , even to gain the world .
" There is one fundamental question about which I often am asked .
What do I believe about Jesus Christ ?
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of mankind .
My church 's beliefs about Christ may not all be the same as those of other faiths .
Each religion has its own unique doctrines and history .
These are not bases for criticism but rather a test of our tolerance .
Religious tolerance would be a shallow principle indeed if it were reserved only for faiths with which we agree .
" There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church 's distinctive doctrines .
To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution .
No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith .
For if he becomes President he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths .
" I believe that every faith I have encountered draws its adherents closer to God .
And in every faith I have come to know , there are features I wish were in my own : I love the profound ceremony of the Catholic Mass , the approachability of God in the prayers of the Evangelicals , the tenderness of spirit among the Pentecostals , the confident independence of the Lutherans , the ancient traditions of the Jews , unchanged through the ages , and the commitment to frequent prayer of the Muslims .
As I travel across the country and see our towns and cities , I am always moved by the many houses of worship with their steeples , all pointing to heaven , reminding us of the source of life 's blessings .
" It is important to recognize that while differences in theology exist between the churches in America , we share a common creed of moral convictions .
And where the affairs of our nation are concerned , it 's usually a sound rule to focus on the latter — on the great moral principles that urge us all on a common course .
Whether it was the cause of abolition , or civil rights , or the right to life itself , no movement of conscience can succeed in America that cannot speak to the convictions of religious people .
" We separate church and state affairs in this country , and for good reason .
No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion .
But in recent years , the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning .
They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God.
Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life .
It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America — the religion of secularism .
They are wrong .
" The founders proscribed the establishment of a state religion , but they did not countenance the elimination of religion from the public square .
We are a nation ' under God ' and in God , we do indeed trust .
" We should acknowledge the Creator as did the Founders — in ceremony and word .
He should remain on our currency , in our pledge , in the teaching of our history , and during the holiday season , nativity scenes and menorahs should be welcome in our public places .
Our greatness would not long endure without judges who respect the foundation of faith upon which our constitution rests .
I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion , but I will not separate us from ' the God who gave us liberty . '
" Nor would I separate us from our religious heritage .
Perhaps the most important question to ask a person of faith who seeks a political office , is this : does he share these American values : the equality of human kind , the obligation to serve one another , and a steadfast commitment to liberty ?
" They are not unique to any one denomination .
They belong to the great moral inheritance we hold in common .
They are the firm ground on which Americans of different faiths meet and stand as a nation , united .
" We believe that every single human being is a child of God — we are all part of the human family .
The conviction of the inherent and inalienable worth of every life is still the most revolutionary political proposition ever advanced .
John Adams put it that we are ' thrown into the world all equal and alike . '
" The consequence of our common humanity is our responsibility to one another , to our fellow Americans foremost , but also to every child of God .
It is an obligation which is fulfilled by Americans every day , here and across the globe , without regard to creed or race or nationality .
" Americans acknowledge that liberty is a gift of God , not an indulgence of government .
No people in the history of the world have sacrificed as much for liberty .
The lives of hundreds of thousands of America 's sons and daughters were laid down during the last century to preserve freedom , for us and for freedom loving people throughout the world .
America took nothing from that Century 's terrible wars — no land from Germany or Japan or Korea ; no treasure ; no oath of fealty .
America 's resolve in the defense of liberty has been tested time and again .
It has not been found wanting , nor must it ever be .
America must never falter in holding high the banner of freedom .
" These American values , this great moral heritage , is shared and lived in my religion as it is in yours .
I was taught in my home to honor God and love my neighbor .
I saw my father march with Martin Luther King .
I saw my parents provide compassionate care to others , in personal ways to people nearby , and in just as consequential ways in leading national volunteer movements .
I am moved by the Lord 's words : ' For I was an hungered , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in : naked , and ye clothed me ...'
" My faith is grounded on these truths .
You can witness them in Ann and my marriage and in our family .
We are a long way from perfect and we have surely stumbled along the way , but our aspirations , our values , are the self - same as those from the other faiths that stand upon this common foundation .
And these convictions will indeed inform my presidency .
" Today 's generations of Americans have always known religious liberty .
Perhaps we forget the long and arduous path our nation 's forbearers took to achieve it .
They came here from England to seek freedom of religion .
But upon finding it for themselves , they at first denied it to others .
Because of their diverse beliefs , Ann Hutchinson was exiled from Massachusetts Bay , a banished Roger Williams founded Rhode Island , and two centuries later , Brigham Young set out for the West .
Americans were unable to accommodate their commitment to their own faith with an appreciation for the convictions of others to different faiths .
In this , they were very much like those of the European nations they had left .
" It was in Philadelphia that our founding fathers defined a revolutionary vision of liberty , grounded on self evident truths about the equality of all , and the inalienable rights with which each is endowed by his Creator .
" We cherish these sacred rights , and secure them in our constitutional order .
Foremost do we protect religious liberty , not as a matter of policy but as a matter of right .
There will be no established church , and we are guaranteed the free exercise of our religion .
" I 'm not sure that we fully appreciate the profound implications of our tradition of religious liberty .
I have visited many of the magnificent cathedrals in Europe .
They are so inspired ... so grand ... so empty .
Raised up over generations , long ago , so many of the cathedrals now stand as the postcard backdrop to societies just too busy or too ' enlightened ' to venture inside and kneel in prayer .
The establishment of state religions in Europe did no favor to Europe 's churches .
And though you will find many people of strong faith there , the churches themselves seem to be withering away .
" Infinitely worse is the other extreme , the creed of conversion by conquest : violent Jihad , murder as martyrdom ... killing Christians , Jews , and Muslims with equal indifference .
These radical Islamists do their preaching not by reason or example , but in the coercion of minds and the shedding of blood .
We face no greater danger today than theocratic tyranny , and the boundless suffering these states and groups could inflict if given the chance .
" The diversity of our cultural expression , and the vibrancy of our religious dialogue , has kept America in the forefront of civilized nations even as others regard religious freedom as something to be destroyed .
" In such a world , we can be deeply thankful that we live in a land where reason and religion are friends and allies in the cause of liberty , joined against the evils and dangers of the day .
And you can be certain of this :
Any believer in religious freedom , any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty , has a friend and ally in me .
And so it is for hundreds of millions of our countrymen : we do not insist on a single strain of religion — rather , we welcome our nation 's symphony of faith .
" Recall the early days of the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia , during the fall of 1774 .
With Boston occupied by British troops , there were rumors of imminent hostilities and fears of an impending war .
In this time of peril , someone suggested that they pray .
But there were objections .
' They were too divided in religious sentiments ' , what with Episcopalians and Quakers , Anabaptists and Congregationalists , Presbyterians and Catholics .
" Then Sam Adams rose , and said he would hear a prayer from anyone of piety and good character , as long as they were a patriot .
" And so together they prayed , and together they fought , and together , by the grace of God ... they founded this great nation .
" In that spirit , let us give thanks to the divine ' author of liberty . '
And together , let us pray that this land may always be blessed , ' with freedom 's holy light . '
" God bless the United States of America . "
Believe it or not , higher education is linked to a greater tendency to believe in ghosts and other paranormal phenomena , according to a new study .
Contrary to researchers ' expectations , a poll of 439 college students found seniors and grad students were more likely than freshmen to believe in haunted houses , psychics , telepathy , channeling and a host of other questionable ideas .
The results are detailed in the January - February issue of the Skeptical Inquirer magazine .
' Not Sure '
The survey was modeled after a nationwide Gallup Poll in 2001 that found younger Americans far more likely to believe in the paranormal than older respondents .
The new study was done by Bryan Farha at Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward Jr. of the University of Central Oklahoma .
In general college students checked the " Believe " box less than the general population surveyed by Gallup .
But the lack of " Do n't Believe " responses among college students was lower for six of the 13 categories : psychic or spiritual healing , haunted houses , demonic possession , ghosts , clairvoyance and witches .
That means a higher percentage of college students put themselves in the " Not Sure " column on these topics .
[ Table of results ]
Less skeptical
More significantly , the new survey reveals college is not necessarily a path to skepticism in these realms .
While 23 percent of college freshmen expressed a general belief in paranormal concepts — from astrology to communicating with the dead — 31 percent of seniors did so and the figure jumped to 34 percent among graduate students .
" As people attain higher college - education levels , the likelihood of believing in paranormal dimensions increases , " Farha and Steward write .
The media are likely responsible for some people 's beliefs in alien abductions and other paranormal concepts , the scientists write , based on their survey of existing studies .
And some people tend to selectively confirm whatever ideas might be in their heads .
Even smart people might believe in something offbeat because , in part , they 're good at defending whatever they believe .
Red lips and a rose nipple inflame the cool flesh of Egon Schiele 's model as she leans back and , blue eyes looking off to the side , lifts her ruffled skirt to show the artist what he wants to see .
You could not exclude Schiele from an exhibition entitled Seduced : Art and Sex from Antiquity to the Present .
Nor could you exclude his Viennese contemporary , Gustav Klimt , whose Reclining Masturbating Girl hangs nearby , nor Picasso , whose painting of himself at the age of about 20 being fellated is in the same room .
And yet there 's something about that title , " art and sex " , that does n't quite do justice to these artists .
It implies that art can sometimes be about things other than sex - and I 'm not sure if Schiele or Picasso ever believed it could .
I 'm not sure if I believe it myself .
This summer , while looking at ice age art in caves in France , I saw breasts and buttocks drawn by some ice age Picasso perhaps 25,000 years ago .
People have been making erotica , or pornography , or whatever you want to call it , far longer than the 2,500 years this exhibition surveys .
And you have to ask : has art ever been about anything else ?
As soon as the Greeks invented a lifelike way of depicting the human form , in the sixth century BC , they exploited their discovery to portray sex - as this show illustrates .
Who was the beautiful Sapphic red - figure painting of two slender women with triangular breasts and curvy buttocks meant to be enjoyed by ?
My one quibble with this show is how misleading it would be to think that sex is somehow a marginalised or hidden theme in art .
Just consider the National Gallery , where Bronzino 's perverse Venus and Cupid , Titian 's mordant Diana and Actaeon , Velázquez 's coolly sensual Rokeby Venus , Rembrandt 's wonderfully intimate bedroom portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels , and the late works of Degas could all have been included in this show .
The theme is potentially limitless , and to isolate " sex " in art might almost have something puritanical about it , a clinical scrupulousness .
But we live in a world that fears erotically charged images .
Pornography is loathed even as it is consumed .
In Britain , there has been a recent moral panic about one of the artists in this show , Nan Goldin , whose photograph of a naked young girl was removed from an exhibition at Gateshead 's Baltic Centre .
That is the modern version of anxieties that for centuries drove artists to veil passion in fine ideas .
This show includes a copy of Michelangelo 's drawing of The Rape of Ganymede , which he gave as a present to a young nobleman he adored , and which portrays Jupiter taking the form of an eagle to carry away a boy he lusted after .
Michelangelo was influenced by the Florentine Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino when he claimed that when he looked at male beauty it led him up into the pure spiritual realm , beyond lust .
By the 18th century , this doublethink produced the idea of the " nude " as a somehow lustless depiction of the human form .
This idea was still so current in the early 20th century that a philospher could claim : " If the nude is so treated that it raises in the spectator ideas or desires appropriate to the material subject , it is false art , and bad morals . "
To which the art historian Kenneth Clark replied : " No nude , however abstract , should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of erotic feeling , even though only the faintest shadow - and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals . "
Nowadays , we laugh at the very idea of a sexless nude , but we have got our own anxieties , our own difficulties of definition .
Does Goldin pander to paedophiles ?
Between the old worries and the modern ones , sex is still a dangerous subject .
The curators of this brilliant exhibition joyously shove it in your face .
I left with a slide show of erotica from all places and times playing in my head , the wet , raw , slithering photography of Nobuyoshi Araki fading into the proud flesh of Louis XV 's mistress , Mademoiselle O'Murphy , lying on her front on a chaise longue in a drawing by François Boucher , giving way to 19th - century photographs in which the models pose identically to what you would see in a modern men's magazine , to Rembrandt 's moving engraving of lovers with their clothes on on a chilly night .
Aubrey Beardsley 's drawing of a gigantic penis and an ancient Roman bronze phallus with bells hanging on it ; the detailed , ruffled , silken pink vulva of a white - faced courtesan arching her body over in a Japanese woodblock print and Klimt 's woman with her legs apart reaching under her turn - of - the - century skirts to touch herself .
In the rush of images , ideas are generated like the babies who , in Leonardo da Vinci 's Leda and the Swan - a copy is shown here of this lost masterpiece - hatch from eggs after Leda 's encounter with a god who has taken the form of a giant bird .
In Robert Mapplethorpe 's X Portfolio photographs , his most controversial works that created legal difficulties for American museums after the conservative Right attacked them at the end of the 1980s , men involved in the S&M scene subject themselves and one another to various constraints and tests :
Joe is encased in rubber , Jim has his head sealed in a leather mask , and Mapplethorpe himself poses with a whip inserted in his rectum .
Shocked ?
Disturbed ?
But walk over to the section that shows a lovely series of 18th - century Chinese scenes in which lovers embrace tenderly in a lotus garden .
The mood here is infinitely more delicate and gentle - except the woman wears dainty silken bags over her bound feet .
Sex is not an unchanging natural phenomenon .
What does that Roman bronze phallus with bells on it actually mean ?
And when a woman in a Renaissance picture collects phalluses in a basket , is this about " sex " or witchcraft ?
Mapplethorpe 's photographs are a crucial exhibit because they can be viewed as anthropological documents that record a very specific subculture , the same one , as it happens , that attracted the French philosopher Michel Foucault .
" You meet men there who are to you as you are to them , " Foucault said of his discovery of the American 1970s gay S&M scene .
" Nothing but a body with which combinations and productions of pleasure are possible . "
Foucault came to believe that if consenting men in 1970s California could invent a new sexuality from nowhere , sex must therefore be neither an unchanging historical constant nor a primordial drive fighting free of " repression " , but something cultures make and unmake .
This is the argument of his book The History of Sexuality .
In European culture since the rise of Christianity , there is no image of sex from which pain and guilt are wholly excluded - the Christian terror is visibly there in illustrations to 18th - century editions of De Sade .
Serious post - classical European art has never produced anything quite like the pure , comment - free eroticism of this show 's bright Indian illustrations of lovers demonstrating a series of spectacular positions , or Japan 's art of the floating world .
Seventeenth - century Japan saw the rise of a new secular culture in the great cities of Edo ( modern Tokyo ) , Osaka and Kyoto .
Religious
Noh theatre gave way to kabuki theatre with its everyday scenes , and the cities had pleasure districts whose community of the senses was named after the Buddhist term ukiyo , meaning " floating world " .
Woodblock prints , with their gorgeous colours , record , or rather invent and mythify , this floating world : lovers are suspended far from workaday worries in their own reality of silk and skin .
A man pleasures a woman after they have gorged on oysters ; the artist enjoys drawing a visual analogy between oyster and vulva .
I cannot think of a European equivalent , and it has to do with what art is in different cultures , as much as what sex is .
European art from the Renaissance into modern times was obsessed with the delineation of reality in space and time .
Japanese prints are instead decorative explorations of shape and colour : this makes for a much more tactile art .
Male and female genitalia are not " shown " to the spectactor like a provocative fact , as they are by Schiele , in Japanese art ; their visible presence is natural and is enjoyed by the artist , who draws comparisons with red frilly garments , or in the case of an erect penis , with a bird 's beak .
The same sensibility is at work in Araki 's shocking , beautiful images from his series Erotos .
In fact , these photographs are the only real contemporary erotica in the show .
It is proof of how fraught it is , this looking at sex , that in its closing stages the exhibition chickens out and retreats to a safe definition of high art : so we get Thomas Ruff 's blurred , artistic appropriations of internet porn , rather than internet porn .
It excludes a whole host of material that would challenge taste and definitions of the pornographic far more provocatively .
Why include early porn photographs and exclude fetish photographer Elmer Batters ?
In graphic art , why exclude sexually obsessed cartoonist Robert Crumb ?
I suppose they wanted to avoid too many questions about pornography and power - they wanted to create a safe " erotic " space .
Yet all the questions a critical viewer might ask are asked by Picasso in his series of etchings of the Renaissance master Raphael in bed with his lover , La Fornarina , " the baker 's daughter " .
It was said that Raphael so adored his mistress - and loved sex - that a patron had to install her in his house in order to get Raphael to finish his frescoes there .
I was at first disappointed to find Picasso - the most sexual artist there ever was - represented only by his youthful painting of a blowjob , although it connects him nicely with Andy Warhol 's nearby film ( Blowjob ) , which focuses on an ethereal silvery image of a man 's face .
Picasso etched Raphael and La Fornarina in 1968 , near the end of his life .
You would n't guess it from the way his line enjoys every detail .
Did I say western art has nothing to compare with Japanese sensuality ?
It does - it has Picasso .
And yet , and this is what makes Raphael and La Fornarina the greatest work of art in the show , Picasso knows exactly what he is doing : he knows he is too old to be Raphael any more .
In most of the prints , the Pope watches from behind draperies or - hilariously - while squatting on a potty .
This is the dilemma of anyone seeing the show : in your imagination are you La Fornarina , or her lover , or the Pope watching on his potty ?
It 's a risky business , admitting to how much you enjoy looking at sex .
I loved this show , but left feeling sad and ashamed ; then I had to come back the next day and look again .
It is the bravest and most intelligent exhibition of the year

The Dalai Lama says Tibet would reject a Chinese - picked successor
Usually , following the death of a Dalai Lama , senior Tibetan Buddhist officials , guided by dreams and signs , identify a young child to succeed him .
But the Dalai Lama said he feared China would try to influence this process .
He said he was considering whether his successor should be picked by him , or elected by high ranking Buddhist monks .
" If the Tibetan people want to keep the Dalai Lama system , one of the possibilities I have been considering with my aides is to select the next Dalai Lama while I 'm alive , " he told the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun during a visit to Japan .
Tibetans are concerned over what will happen when the 72 - year - old Dalai Lama dies , fearing that Beijing will try to take control of the succession .
" If China selected my successor after my death , the people of Tibet would not support him as there would be no Tibetan heart in him , " he said .
Chinese intervention
Beijing claims sovereignty over Tibet , which it has controlled since invading in 1950 .
However , many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 .
China has opposed his involvement in politics , viewing him as a separatist , and has intervened before .
When he picked a six - year - old boy to be the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism - the Panchen Lama - China detained the boy and selected a replacement who was loyal to Chinese rule .
Beijing has denounced the Dalai Lama 's many foreign trips , including recent visits to the US , Germany , and now Japan .
It says he should stay out of politics and restrict himself to a religious role .
Buddhists believe the current Dalai Lama is the reincarnation of his predecessors .
He was identified by a search party of High Lamas that scoured rural Tibet looking for a child born around the same time as the previous Dalai Lama died .
As a young child he successfully identified the prayer beads and relics that belonged to his predecessor .
The Dalai Lama has always said if he were reborn it would not be in a country ruled by China or anywhere that was not free .

An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world 's top RPG gamers after one criminal 's girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut , Google 's social network .
After sequestering him in Sao Paulo , they held a gun against the victim 's head for five hours to get his password , which they wanted to sell for $ 8,000 .
And yes , the story gets even better .

Surprisingly enough , after five hours the hostage was n't talking .
The group leader had a gun against his head all that time but the guy did n't say a word .
At that point , the crooks gave up and decided to let him go .
The brazilian police then caught the four suspects , aged 19 to 27 .
According to the police , the captive is the world leader in GunBound , a turn - based RPG - style multiplayer online game .
Developed in South Korea , in this artillery game you get more experience points , offensive and defensive capabilities depending on your skills during battle , as well as money to buy more weapons , armor and all kinds of gear for your multiple avatars .
You can only play with one of your avatars each time , but all of them belong to a single account .

The game looks to be quite popular , so the four gangsters decided they could make some quick cash if they kidnapped him to steal his user .
Their plan : use one of the criminal 's girlfriends , called Tamires , to get him into a date using Google 's online social network Orkut , which is also extremely popular in Brazil .
After contacting and seducing him , she told the GunBound wizard to meet her in a shopping mall .
But she never appeared .
Instead , Igor the boyfriend did .
Gun in hand , he abducted and held the player prisoner , planning to rely the password to his mates using a cellphone .
Against all odds , our hero ( or very stupid guy ) resisted .
Probably using some Stamina +357 spell .
Or a Big Cojones +577 mana potion .
Whatever he did to resist the torture for a stupid game password , boys and girls , there 's a moral to this story : if you live in Brazil , keep playing Tetris .

In 1994 , there were 20,000 visits for pediatric ( under age 19 ) bipolar disorder .
In 2003 , the number was ... 800,000 .
The diagnosis , therefore , was 25/100,000 in 1994 , and now it 's 1000 / 100,000 .
In other words , 1 % of the population .
To compare : for adults the rates were 905/100,000 in 1994 , to 1679 / 100,000 in 2003 .
In other words , 0.9 % up to 1.7 % .
I 've heard this justified as a step forward .
While " visits " is n't the same as incidence or prevalence in a population , it makes sense as a proxy .
The adult rate is about 1 - 2 % , consistently .
Bipolar was severely underdiagnosed in 1994 , and it 's better diagnosed today .
Since bipolar is a biological disorder with a strongly heritable component , it only makes sense that the child rate should be the same as the adult rate , assuming good diagnostic skills .
So the diagnosis rate has simply risen to match the adult rate .
The only problem is this : in 2003 , 2/3 of the children visiting were males .
But 2/3 of the adults were females .
So you have some options :
The ridiculousness of this increase in diagnosis is only exceeded by the potential harm such an increase is actually causing .
Forget about the safety or lack of safety of bipolar medications in kids , which is worrisome enough .
A problem few seem to want to talk about is the impact of a bipolar diagnosis on a person , for the rest of his life .
Let 's say , for the sake of argument , pediatric bipolar is overdiagnosed .
Then all those people who were misdiagnosed are , in fact , not bipolar ; however , they have no way of ever finding that out .
They have to carry this with them for the rest of their life .
When they 're 30 years old , and they 're asked on routine checkup if they 've ever had a psychiatric diagnosis , they have to say , " well , pediatric bipolar , but I think that 's not right . "
Sure it is n't .
When that 30 year old guy has kids , and those kids grow up , they 'll be asked , do you have a history of major psychiatric illness in your family ?
Hmm .
" Maybe bipolar ... but my Dad told me he thinks that was n't right . "
Oh , ok .
Did your Dad have a temper ?
" Well , he did yell a lot when he was mad . "
I see .
Did he go without sleep ?
" Oh my God , when we were kids -- lots of times . "
Then it 's settled .
If pediatric bipolar is being accurately diagnosed , then either psychiatrists are now more sensitive to its detection -- a unlikely possibility since the diagnosis has been around for a long , long time -- did we suddenly develop a better test for it ?
Or else something has changed in the world to cause it to be more frequent ( a toxin in bottled water ?
MySpace ? Iraq ? )
And yet to visit the US at present , as I have done , is to experience an overwhelming sensation of drastic impending change .
It 's not merely that President Bush , to whom Blair so disastrously tethered himself , is " in office but not in power " .
Most Americans can't wait for him to go , Congress is beyond his control , and the Senate majority leader , Senator Harry Reid , has told him that the war in Iraq is lost - for which statement of the obvious Reid was accused of " defeatism " by the vice - president , Dick Cheney .
Besides that the portents range from Paul Wolfowitz 's travails at the World Bank to the Senate interrogation of Alberto Gonzales , the attorney general , and the trial of Conrad Black .
This might sound like the " succession of small disasters , oh trifling in themselves " , in Alan Bennett 's Forty Years On ( " a Foreign Secretary 's sudden attack of dysentery at the funeral of George V , an American ambassador found strangled in his own gym - slip ... " )
And yet there really is an observable pattern .
Along with the collapse of Bush 's authority , all these episodes are connected to the great disaster in Iraq .
And all illustrate the hubristic , impenitent arrogance of the people who have been guiding America 's destiny - as well as ours , alas - for the past six years .
What one senses so acutely are the conditions building for a political perfect storm , which will engulf and destroy the whole neoconservative project .
In Washington I took part in a debate with Christopher Hitchens , my old sparring partner and drinking companion ( mots justes , all of them ) , who supports Bush with a defiance worthy of a better cause .
He surpassed himself by insisting that his friend Wolfowitz is a wronged man .
A World Bank committee reportedly disagrees , and has found that Wolfowitz did violate the bank 's rules in the matter of his lady friend 's salary .
But in any case everyone else in Washington says the same thing : Wolfowitz cannot survive .
His appointment was widely resented in the first place - the German , French , Dutch and Scandinavian governments have warned that they might withhold funds if he stays in office ; and severe damage is being done to the organisation he claims to have at heart by his refusal to accept reality .
Then again , detachment from reality is perhaps to be expected from one of the architects of the war , a man who thought that the Iraqis would rise up to greet the American army as liberators .
As the Nobel - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said , Wolfowitz and his cabal " do not seem to understand that being president of the World Bank is a privilege , not an entitlement " .
Gonzales was just a Texan hack lawyer who acted as Bush 's consigliere , but he made his contribution to the great enterprise when he ruled that torture could be justified in the " war on terror " .
His Senate hearing provided a little comic relief , what with his acute amnesia followed by the deathless admission that " I now understand there was a conversation with myself and the president " .
One day Blair may understand that there was a conversation between himself and the president about the invasion of Iraq , and that his commitment to the war took place much earlier than he has ever admitted .
While Lord Black has never worked for the Bush administration , he was aligned with the neocon elite through the National Interest , the journal he used to publish , and he brought some of its members , such as Richard Perle , on to the board of his companies .
Perle seems to have taken his fiduciary duties as lightly as he and his colleagues took the problems that would arise in Iraq as a result of the invasion .
What has struck me about Black 's trial was that we were hearing another version of the arrogance and denial we have heard from Wolfowitz and many others .
It will give me no particular pleasure if my former employer is banged up , but his downfall is another grave blow for the neocons .
All of which has vital implications for British politics .
Nicolas Sarkozy has been called " an American neoconservative with a French passport " , which he is not .
But Blair really is an American neoconservative with a British passport .
He revealingly and accurately said that " there is n't a world of difference " between himself and the neocons politically , and his party must now , as it shakes off the burden of these past years , ask itself what , in that case , he was doing as Labour leader .
The Tories have questions of their own .
Even the stupidest have grasped that the war and the American alliance are unpopular with the electorate , but they should now ask if sceptical , pragmatic Conservatism ever had anything in common with neoconservatism and its vast revolutionary scheme .
One who did understand is Matthew Parris , the former Tory MP .
Before the 2004 presidential election he said he wanted Bush re-elected : his presidency was halfway through an " experiment whose importance is almost literally earth - shattering " and should be played out to its inevitable failure .
But that failure must be demonstrated beyond contradiction .
" The theory that liberal values and a capitalist system can be spread across the world by force of arms ... should be tested to destruction ...
The president and his neoconservative court should be offered all the rope they need to hang themselves . "
His wish has come true ; neocons are dangling all around us .
In a flicker of self - knowledge , Wolfowitz told a recent World Bank meeting : " I understand that I 've lost a lot of trust , and I want to build that trust back up . "
But it 's too late , for him and all the other courtiers .
They never really enjoyed the trust of most Europeans , let alone Africans and Asians , and they have now lost the trust of the American people .
All the readings on the barometer and the wind gauge say the same thing .
The perfect storm is gathering .
Unfortunately the collapse of the neocon project comes at a very heavy cost , not only to the people of Iraq but to all of us .

I 'm an agnostic and I am constantly finding myself jealous of religious people .
I think that religion fulfills many psychological needs and I 'm definitely feeling the effect of not having those needs fulfilled .
I long for ceremony , ritual , rites of passage .
I want a temple to pray at even though I have no one to pray to .
I want to do that thing where the Christians all go down the aisle and take turns eating and drinking symbolic stuff .
I have no idea why , but those things just seem to lift my spirits so much and I feel down without them .
I was trying so hard not to fall asleep through the movie " Memoirs of a Geisha , " but I perked right up when they started talking about making everything into a ritual as a means of making the mundane enjoyable .
They also help tremendously for the sake of focus .
I 'm tossing around the idea of getting a Wiccan book and doing a spell for any goal I have .
I would n't actually believe in the magic , but doing a spell to improve my career would make such a difference in helping my focus on the goal and feel good about it .
I want something to cling to .
I want some equivalent to " God has a plan " and " The lord will provide . "
I have heard religious folk saying " The lord gives me strength . "
Where am I supposed to find that kind of strength ?
Where does it come from ?
Where am I supposed to get it ?
I would love so much to be able to have some idea to concentrate on to help me struggle through hard times .
I want a guide for how to live .
I would n't follow it blindly on faith .
I would certainly do some picking , choosing , and editing of such a guide .
But having to come up with it completely from scratch makes me feel so lost and confused .
I want some meaning handed to me .
I get frustrated with people who say secularists can't possibly have any meaning in their lives , because I believe that a person should have their own meaning instead of the meaning some higher power handed to them .
Still , they almost have a point .
Coming up with your own meaning is hard .
I want something external to help get me my meaning .
SO , after all that blather , I would like to ask my godless brethren how they fill these holes without religion .
Religion fulfills certain psychological needs .
How do non-believers manage without it ?

Scott Carson is distraught after his early howler at Wembley
England went 2 - 0 down when Scott Carson , in for Paul Robinson , fumbled Nico Kranjcar 's shot into the net and then Ivica Olic slipped in a second .
Frank Lampard pulled one back from the spot after Jermain Defoe was fouled , before David Beckham , winning a 99th cap , set up Peter Crouch to level it .
But Mladen Petric fired in from 25 yards to break England 's hearts .
The result will surely cost Steve McClaren his job as England manager and after such an abysmal display , he can have few complaints .
606 : DEBATE
He gambled his position and England 's participation on two huge selections and dropping Robinson and Beckham proved catastrophic .
Carson 's performance will live long in the memory for all the wrong reasons and it may take the 22 - year - old some time to recover .
When he stepped out on to the turf to warm - up and saw heavy rain making the pitch increasingly treacherous , he could have been forgiven for wishing Robinson - who was not even on the bench - had not been so unceremoniously dumped .
With eight minutes gone , he must have wanted part of the rain - sodden pitch to open up and swallow him whole .
A tearful David Beckham applauds the crowd at the end of the game
Kranjcar found space 30 yards out and let fly with a dipping right - foot shot that bounced just in front of the keeper and Carson could only parry the ball into the roof of the net .
The stadium fell silent - and six minutes later , England 's world was on the brink of collapse .
Eduardo drove at the heart of the England defence and played a cute pass into the area for Olic , the Hamburg striker coolly dribbling round a shell - shocked Carson and rolling into an empty net .
England embarrassingly appealed for offside , but Wayne Bridge and , ludicrously , Shaun Wright - Phillips - who should not have been that far back - were both clearly playing him on .
McClaren 's 4 - 3 - 3 formation at the start had turned into a 4 - 5 - 1 as Crouch was left painfully isolated in attack and his flick - ons were easily dealt with by the Croatians .
The visitors could have been more than 2 - 0 up by the interval - Carson patting the ball down after a shot from Luka Modric only for the ball to luckily skid away , forcing Kranjcar too wide to shoot .
Booed and jeered off the pitch , McClaren had to act and he brought on Defoe and Beckham , with Gareth Barry and Wright - Phillips making way .
It barely made any difference , before England were handed a lifeline in the shape of a penalty by the eagle - eyed assistant referee , who spotted Josip Simunic tugging back Defoe .
The quiet Lampard , with almost his first kick of the game , clinically dispatched the spot - kick to breathe new life into England 's campaign .
Petric 's winner at Wembley dumped England out of Euro 2008
England seemed keen to gift Croatia another goal as first Bridge cleared on to the top of his own crossbar and then Carson repaired some of the damage by brilliantly saving Olic 's point - blank header .
If the script had been written for Beckham to save his country once again , the former captain seemed keen to follow it .
The LA Galaxy midfielder sent over an inch - perfect cross from the right that Crouch expertly chested down and smashed into the bottom corner from seven yards .
Wembley erupted , but there was more drama to come on a remarkable night at the new stadium .
Croatia sent on Petric and with 13 minutes left , he arrowed a fizzing left - foot shot into the corner of Carson 's net from 25 yards .
It was what Croatia deserved for a display full of enterprise and heart - and what England deserved for one of their most inept displays in living memory .
The result , coupled with Russia 's slender 1 - 0 win over Andorra , means England will not be going to next summer 's tournament in Austria and Switzerland .

Followup to : An Alien God , The Wonder of Evolution , Evolutions Are Stupid
Yesterday , I wrote :
Humans can do things that evolutions probably can't do period over the expected lifetime of the universe .
As the eminent biologist Cynthia Kenyon once put it at a dinner I had the honor of attending , " One grad student can do things in an hour that evolution could not do in a billion years . "
According to biologists ' best current knowledge , evolutions have invented a fully rotating wheel on a grand total of three occasions .
But then , natural selection has not been running for a mere million years .
It 's been running for 3.85 billion years .
That 's enough to do something natural selection " could not do in a billion years " three times .
Surely the cumulative power of natural selection is beyond human intelligence ?
Not necessarily .
There 's a limit on how much complexity an evolution can support against the degenerative pressure of copying errors .
( Warning : A simulation I wrote to verify the following arguments did not return the expected results .
See addendum and comments . )
( Addendum 2 : This discussion has now been summarized in the Less Wrong Wiki .
I recommend reading that instead . )
The vast majority of mutations are either neutral or detrimental ; here we are focusing on detrimental mutations .
At equilibrium , the rate at which a detrimental mutation is introduced by copying errors , will equal the rate at which it is eliminated by selection .
A copying error introduces a single instantiation of the mutated gene .
A death eliminates a single instantiation of the mutated gene .
( We 'll ignore the possibility that it 's a homozygote , etc ; a failure to mate also works , etc . )
If the mutation is severely detrimental , it will be eliminated very quickly - the embryo might just fail to develop .
But if the mutation only leads to a 0.01 % probability of dying , it might spread to 10,000 people before one of them died .
On average , one detrimental mutation leads to one death ; the weaker the selection pressure against it , the more likely it is to spread .
Again , at equilibrium , copying errors will introduce mutations at the same rate that selection eliminates them .
One mutation , one death .
This means that you need the same amount of selection pressure to keep a gene intact , whether it 's a relatively important gene or a relatively unimportant one .
The more genes are around , the more selection pressure required .
Under too much selection pressure - too many children eliminated in each generation - a species will die out .
We can quantify selection pressure as follows : Suppose that 2 parents give birth to an average of 16 children .
On average all but 2 children must either die or fail to reproduce .
Otherwise the species population very quickly goes to zero or infinity .
From 16 possibilities , all but 2 are eliminated - we can call this 3 bits of selection pressure .
Not bits like bytes on a hard drive , but mathematician 's bits , information - theoretical bits ; one bit is the ability to eliminate half the possibilities .
This is the speed limit on evolution .
Among mammals , it 's safe to say that the selection pressure per generation is on the rough order of 1 bit .
Yes , many mammals give birth to more than 4 children , but neither does selection perfectly eliminate all but the most fit organisms .
The speed limit on evolution is an upper bound , not an average .
This 1 bit per generation has to be divided up among all the genetic variants being selected on , for the whole population .
It 's not 1 bit per organism per generation , it 's 1 bit per gene pool per generation .
Suppose there 's some amazingly beneficial mutation making the rounds , so that organisms with the mutation have 50 % more offspring .
And suppose there 's another less beneficial mutation , that only contributes 1 % to fitness .
Very often , an organism that lacks the 1 % mutation , but has the 50 % mutation , will outreproduce another who has the 1 % mutation but not the 50 % mutation .
There are limiting forces on variance ; going from 10 to 20 children is harder than going from 1 to 2 children .
There 's only so much selection to go around , and beneficial mutations compete to be promoted by it ( metaphorically speaking ) .
There 's an upper bound , a speed limit to evolution :
If Nature kills off a grand total of half the children , then the gene pool of the next generation can acquire a grand total of 1 bit of information .
I am informed that this speed limit holds even with semi-isolated breeding subpopulations , sexual reproduction , chromosomal linkages , and other complications .
Let 's repeat that .
It 's worth repeating .
A mammalian gene pool can acquire at most 1 bit of information per generation .
Among mammals , the rate of DNA copying errors is roughly 10 ^ - 8 per base per generation .
Copy a hundred million DNA bases , and on average , one will copy incorrectly .
One mutation , one death ; each non-junk base of DNA soaks up the same amount of selection pressure to counter the degenerative pressure of copying errors .
It 's a truism among biologists that most selection pressure goes toward maintaining existing genetic information , rather than promoting new mutations .
Natural selection probably hit its complexity bound no more than a hundred million generations after multicellular organisms got started .
Since then , over the last 600 million years , evolutions have substituted new complexity for lost complexity , rather than accumulating adaptations .
Anyone who doubts this should read George Williams 's classic " Adaptation and Natural Selection " , which treats the point at much greater length .
In material terms , a Homo sapiens genome contains roughly 3 billion bases .
We can see , however , that mammalian selection pressures are n't going to support 3 billion bases of useful information .
This was realized on purely mathematical grounds before " junk DNA " was discovered , before the Genome Project announced that humans probably had only 20 - 25,000 protein - coding genes .
Yes , there 's genetic information that does n't code for proteins - all sorts of regulatory regions and such .
But it is an excellent bet that nearly all the DNA which appears to be junk , really is junk .
Because , roughly speaking , an evolution is n't going to support more than 10^8 meaningful bases with 1 bit of selection pressure and a 10 ^ - 8 error rate .
Each base is 2 bits .
A byte is 8 bits .
So the meaningful DNA specifying a human must fit into at most 25 megabytes .
( Pause . )
Yes .
Really .
And the Human Genome Project gave the final confirmation .
25,000 genes plus regulatory regions will fit in 100,000,000 bases with lots of room to spare .
Amazing , is n't it ?
Addendum : genetics.py , a simple Python program that simulates mutation and selection in a sexually reproducing population , is failing to match the result described above .
Sexual recombination is random , each pair of parents have 4 children , and the top half of the population is selected each time .
Wei Dai rewrote the program in C++ and reports that the supportable amount of genetic information increases as the inverse square of the mutation rate ( ?!) which if generally true would make it possible for the entire human genome to be meaningful .
In the above post , George Williams 's arguments date back to 1966 , and the result that the human genome contains < 25,000 protein - coding regions comes from the Genome Project .
The argument that 2 parents having 16 children with 2 surviving implies a speed limit of 3 bits per generation was found here , and I understand that it dates back to Kimura 's work in the 1950s .
However , the attempt to calculate a specific bound of 25 megabytes was my own .
It 's possible that the simulation contains a bug , or that I used unrealistic assumptions .
If the entire human genome of 3 billion DNA bases could be meaningful , it 's not clear why it would contain < 25,000 genes .
Empirically , an average of O ( 1 ) bits of genetic information per generation seems to square well with observed evolutionary times ; we do n't actually see species gaining thousands of bits per generation .
There is also no reason to believe that a dog has greater morphological or biochemical complexity than a dinosaur .
In short , only the math I tried to calculate myself should be regarded as having failed , not the beliefs that are wider currency in evolutionary biology .
But until I understand what 's going on , I would suggest citing only George Williams 's arguments and the Genome Project result , not the specific mathematical calculation shown above .
Amazon から プログラミング言 語Erlang入門 が届きました 。
どんな構成だろうね、と会社で同僚数人とわいわいやっていたら、「フィボナッチ数列を計算するサーバー」という例があって、みんなのツボに入りました。Erlang の並列計算処理能力とネットワークプログラミングのしやすさを示すという上で良い例だと思うのですが、「フィボナッチ数列を計算する」というのと「ネットワークサーバーを書く」、という二つのテーマの不思議なギャップが面白いのでしょう。
そういえば関数型言語が得意な id : maoe は、はてなの採用面接の際に、はてなのボーナス計算を計算するシステムを作ってきたのですが、なぜかクライアント/サーバシステム、ネットワークサーバーを
Haskell で、クライアントを Scheme で書き、プロトコル が S 式という実装をみんなの前で披露して、周囲の笑いを誘っていました。
ちょっとしたプログラムの実行に大げさなインタフェース/実行環境を用意する、というネタは作るのも結構楽しいものです。そんなわけで、ついカッとなってフィボナッチ数を出力する
Linux のデバイスドライバを作りました。
% cat / proc / fib 10
と、proc 経由で項数が分かります。そして / dev / fib を read する と
% cat / dev/fib 55
と項数 10 のフィボナッチ数が得られます。項数を変更するのは ioctl ( 2 ) で行います。ここでは ioctl ( 2 ) を呼ぶプログラム fibdev_ioctl を実行して変更します 。
% ./fibdev_ioctl 20 % cat / proc/fib 20 % cat / dev/fib 6765
項数を大きくすると計算に時間がかかって
OS の反応が鈍くなってしまいす。カーネル空間ではそんなにがんばって計算してはいけません、という良い(悪い)例です。おバカですいません。でもいいんです。

By definition , people with Asperger ’s are outside the mainstream .
Even so , in recent months the syndrome has been cast into the limelight .
“ Look Me in the Eye , ” a memoir about living with Asperger ’s by John Elder Robison , who once created special effects for the rock band Kiss , has been a best - seller .
In August , the Pulitzer Prize - winning music critic Tim Page wrote a poignant article for The New Yorker about life with undiagnosed Asperger’s .
Mr. Robison says the popular appeal of these stories may be due , in part , to the tendency of people with Asperger ’s to be painfully direct — they lack the social filter that prevents other people from speaking their minds .
“ It ’s important because the world needs to know that there are tremendous differences in human behavior , ” said Mr. Robison , whose brother is the writer Augusten Burroughs .
“ People are all too willing to throw away someone because they do n’t respond the way they want .
I think books like mine tell the world that there is more to us than that . ”
But while Mr. Robison and Mr. Page tell the story of coping with Asperger ’s from the perspective of men in their 50s , Heather Kuzmich is just beginning her life as an adult with the disorder .
And it is often painful to watch her transition from socially awkward adolescent to socially awkward adult .

A gifted art student from Valparaiso , Ind. , she has a lean and angular look well suited to the fashion industry .
But her beauty does n’t mask the challenges of Asperger ’s .
The show requires her to live in a house with 12 other would - be models , and cattiness and backbiting ensue .
Early in the show , she appears socially isolated , the girls whisper about her within earshot , and viewers see her crying on the phone to her mother .
You want to make me pay public school teachers to teach " intelligent design , " which is nothing more than your antiquated mythology ?
Fuck you !
You want to tax my income , that I 've earned through hard work and dedication ?
Fuck you !
You want to tax my income to pay to invade another country , where they do n't want us , never wanted us , and it is n't doing a goddamn thing for my country ?
Fuck you !
You want to say that I can't take a bottle of water on the airplane , because you claim that you can make a Dasani into a bomb ?
Fuck you !
You want to use electronic voting machines that run MS Access , which I could hack into in about five minutes with my eyes closed ?
FUCK YOU !
...
Now , many of these people have never even dreamed of voting for a Democrat , and many of them are behind Ron Paul in a fiercely dedicated way .
I think to understand the " Ron Paul " phenomenon , you need to look no further than the Howard Dean campaign : there is someone running as a genuine outsider , with clear , anti-this - war positions and lots of support on the internet .
I think Ron Paul will follow a trajectory similar to Howard Dean : that is , he will show some early emerging success , get a little ( more ) national publicity , and then the Washington insiders will gang up against him and his campaign will be destroyed .
The " Fuck You " kids used to be loyal Republicans , but they feel somewhat betrayed by Bush .
They are ready to give the Republicans another chance , and they see that chance in Ron Paul .
When Ron Paul fails to get the nomination , they will be ready to leave the Republicans , for a brief window of time , because they will feel completely betrayed .
I mean , imagine if Romney gets the Republican nomination .
From the " Fuck You " kids point of view , Romney is the enemy .
First of all , he talks about God all the time , which make the fuck you kids think he 's a charlatan .
Secondly , he has specifically said in prominent speeches that he does not respect atheism , and most of the " fuck you " kids are atheist , or , at least , very skeptical agnostics .
He 's a warmonger , and the " fuck you " kids think ( largely ) that these recent wars are a big waste of their money .
Romney is pro-life , which the " fuck you " kids think is just an example of putting religion into politics .
Romney has no clear stance on the enormous attack on the civil liberties and the constitution , which , to the " fuck you " kids is probably the most pressing issue ( perhaps second most , after warmongering . )
Romney is not their man .
America 's Mayor might be able to persuade them to stay , I 'm sorry to say .
Mr. 9/11 is " tough , " and " no- nonsense , " and " does n't coodle criminals . "
And the " fuck you " kids , of course , do n't give a flying fuck about his extra-marital affairs .
So if Rudy !
gets the nomination , they may very well stay as republicans .
But if it 's Romney ( or , worse ! , Huckabee ) they will be ready to bolt .
So the question is : will we be ready to receive them ?
As I wrote in a comment elsewhere :
http://www.dailykos.com/...
an anonymous Paulite going by LOL left this comment on my website , thought y'all would be interested : " Just a quick note , re : Ron Paul supporters voting for Democrats >>>>
Since the Democratic Party has always been the pro-war , police - the - world , nation - building party for the last 75 years , up through and including these current Bush wars , why would the peace - loving anti-war Paul supporters even consider casting a vote for a Democrat if Paul somehow does n't make the nomination ? "
I wrote : " The democrats are better than the Republicans when it comes to civil liberties .
That is my entire point .
The Republicans , with the exception of Ron Paul , are certainly no better .
There is no choice on bellicosity .
There is choice on civil liberties , and the Democrats clearly dominate .
Why would you not vote for a Democrat over , for example , America ’s Mayor ( assuming RP does not get the nomination , and does not run as an independent . ) ?
There is no reason not to .
Democrats are either equal to or better than the Republicans .
No contest . "
http://thedu.us/...
...
I have n't heard a response .
I 'm curious about what will happen .
I think we have a chance here , to secure a very important slice of the American pie .
If we can convince the " fuck you " kids that we are open - minded , and , most importantly , pro-civil liberties , we may be able to get them in the general .
But they do n't care about nice words .
They do n't care to be pandered to .
And they can't give two shits about whether we 're one nation " under God . "
They think -- and , with some reason , I think -- that Hillary Clinton is also their enemy .
They know three things about her : first , that she 's Bill 's wife , and recall , up to now they have been loyal Republicans , so they have swallowed all that bullshit about Clinton , for better or for worse .
Nothing we can do about that , and that 's unjustified slandering of one of our best presidents anyway ( including , in terms of what they think is worthwhile . )
Second , she 's voted for the invasion of Iraq , and , more recently , essentially voted for the invasion of Iran .
Third , that she 's spent energy putting restrictions on violent video games .
In other words , she 's done nothing that they like .
Some of them like Kucinich , particularly given the possibility of a kucinich / Paul ticket .
I think that 's unrealistic , although some might disagree .
I can't tell where they stand on Obama and Edwards .
Some of them like Dodd 's message on the Constitution ( as do I . )
So , that 's my report from the field .
I 'll post some more as I figure out more things about them .

The blogs are abuzz with the AP article reporting that Army medical examiners questioned the close proximity of the three gunshot wounds to the forehead sustained by Pat Tillman .
These doctors were denied a request for an investigation .
Tillman 's death , as we know , was initially reported to be the result of enemy fire .
Family members persisted in a quest for the truth , with little help from the media who bought into the patriotic bullshit spun by the Pentagon .
This quest turned the official story 0n its head and Tillman 's death was subsequently declared to have been a case of accidental " friendly fire . "
Persistence again exposed even more damning evidence as uncovered in an AP report on July 26 , 2007 :
" Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman 's forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player 's death amounted to a crime , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press .
" The medical evidence did not match up with the , with the scenario as described , " a doctor who examined Tillman 's body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators .
The doctors - whose names were blacked out - said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M - 16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away . "
Discussions of cover-ups , motives , who was involved , how high up did it go have been the focus of many articles and comments .
But , what about those bullet holes - so close together , so accurate .
How do we make sense of that ?
What does it mean ?
Step in , Bill Perry , Paratrooper - Rifleman with the 101st Airborne Division during the TET Offensive in 1968 to explore the technical aspect of how these injuries may or may not have been executed .
Bill Perry :
I 'm NOT looking for an argument here , on what Wes Clark may , or may NOT have said on Keith Olberman 's MSNBC show .
What I DO want to mention is my highly personal experience of killing 4 men at extremely close range , with an M - 16 .
The Doctors examining Pat Tillman stated there was " an extremely close shot group " .... ( and they added " fired from less than 10 yards " away ) .
I 'm an expert marksman , and I killed 4 men who ran right up on my point position , AFTER an ambush began , them not realizing I was so far removed from the other 28 men in my platoon .
These men were about 3 to 4 yards away , and I had excellent cover ...
I had probably killed all 4 of them with just my first 6 shots from the expended 19 round magazine ... and I went through their pockets , afterwards , while they were still warm .
There was NOTHING CLOSE to a " Shot group " on any of these men .
Their wounds reflected their flailing & flying bodies as I blew them away .
A " Shot group " on Pat Tillman 's forehead indicates ONE shot killed him , and then he was " double checked " , then " triple checked " at POINT BLANK range , to make sure he was dead .
( 3 shots = " Shot Group " )
When the 1st shot hits something like a head or arm , it swings wildly BEFORE the 2nd or 3rd shot can hit it .
A " Shot group " indicates the head was up against something ( like the ground ) , and the shots were fired on " semi-auto " , NOT full automatic .
If there were a " fog of war " or an actual ambush , everybody would be on " auto " , and you would n't EVER find " shot groups . "
Our After Action Report of our particular firefight indicated 56 KIA , and , believe me , there was n't a " Shot Group " on any of them .

A model who killed three people while trying to commit suicide has been told she faces up to ten years in jail .
Stunning Jeanette Sliwinski deliberately rammed her car into another vehicle that had stopped at a red light .
The three occupants of the car were killed instantly in the horror smash - while Sliwinski only suffered a broken ankle in the accident , which happened two years ago .
Scroll down for more ...
The trial of the former 23 - year - old lingerie model has captivated America , with her model photos being posted on numerous blogs and websites .
She became known as the " suicide blonde " in reference to the INXS song of that title .
Sliwinski was depressed and delusional when she jumped into her car and raced through a Chicago suburb .
Prosecutors said she had jumped three red lights before slamming into a car containing musicians Michael Dahlquist,39 , John Glick,35 , and Douglas Meis , 29 .
The impact of the collision was so fierce their car was up ended and crashed down on the pavement killed all three instantly .
The men were in a Honda Civic waiting at traffic lights when Sliwinski's car struck them from behind .
Police said she was travelling at 70 mph and made no attempt to brake .
The model was on her way to see a psychiatrist after a bust - up with her mum .
As a model she had appeared in adverts for Lee Jeans and Fredericks of Hollywood , the famous lingerie store .
She also featured in a calendar for Chicago 's sexiest girls .
A judge found the model guilty on three counts of reckless homicide , but said she was mentally ill at the time .
Sliwinski will be held in a secure unit until she is deemed fit to transfer to prison .
Judge Garritt Howard told her she faces up to ten years when he sentences her next month .
The family of one of the victims told ABC News after the case that he was sorry she had not carried out her death wish .
" The one thing that would have brought this thing to closure would have been had she been successful in what she set out to do that day , " David Meis , brother of victim Douglas Meis .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A staged news conference during the California wildfires last month claimed the job of a second Federal Emergency Management Agency press official , as a review of the incident revealed " a calamity of bad decision - making . "
Aaron Walker , press secretary for FEMA , submitted his resignation to the administration 's chief David Paulison Wednesday afternoon , according to a FEMA official .
The official would not say whether Walker was asked to resign or did so voluntarily .
His resignation becomes effective in early December .
The official said Walker and John " Pat " Philbin , who was FEMA 's director of external affairs , bore the " greatest degree of responsibility for the planning and execution " of the news conference .
" They had the greatest ability to stop that train from going down the track , and they did n't , " said the official .
Philbin left his job two days after the news conference to become head of public affairs for the Director of National Intelligence , Mike McConnell .
That job offer , however , was rescinded as Philbin 's role in the press conference became clearer .
FEMA officials hurriedly called a press conference on October 23 , giving media outlets only a few minutes notice .
When no reporters were present for the conference , FEMA staffers asked questions of the agency 's No. 2 official , Harvey Johnson .
Reporters were allowed to call in for the conference , but they were kept in listen - only mode and not allowed to ask questions .
In a phone interview with CNN Wednesday , Philbin said , " It happened on my watch .
I should have known better .
I should have done more . "
Philbin blamed a series of bad decisions .
" It was n't done maliciously , " he said .
A just - completed review of events leading up to the press conference reached the same conclusion .
" There was no indication of malicious intent ... or any preconceived effort to deceive the media or the public , " Russ Knocke , the Department of Homeland Security official who conducted the review , told CNN .
Instead , Knock said , there was " a calamity of bad decision - making . "
The review uncovered an email sent by an unnamed staffer just minutes before the press conference telling employees of the FEMA press office to fill the empty seats in the auditorium and " spur discussion . "
In addition , as the press conference began , a member of FEMA 's senior staff encouraged and even instructed other FEMA staffers to ask questions .
Philbin said he is not that senior staff member .
No one tried to stop the session , said Knocke , even though some employees did have misgivings .
The review also discovered that the email advisory notifying the press of the news conference was delayed for about nine minutes while officials tried to confirm satellite coordinates for a live broadcast of the event .
Software glitches further delayed the email 's transmission , and some reporters only got the advisory at around the time the press conference was scheduled to begin , the review found .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff called the faux press conference " one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things I 've seen since I 've been in government . "
The incident prompted FEMA to issue new guidelines for dealing with the news media intended to prevent the incident from happening again .
The new Standard Operating Procedures , issued Friday , bar government employees from asking questions at " any Agency organized press event . "
They also call for notification of the media at least two hours -- " but at a minimum , no less than one hour " -- prior to the start of a news conference .
The new procedures also require two - way conference lines for media use when possible and say that " listen - only " lines will never be used .
Knocke said employees of the FEMA press office will also be receiving training from public relations and press organizations on various subjects , including ethics .

Cocaine seizures were up more than 45 % in 2005
The EU drugs agency ( EMCDDA ) says the increase in cocaine seizures and quantities also confirms its status as " Europe 's stimulant drug of choice " .
Prevalence of the drug is highest in Spain and the UK but the biggest increases are in Denmark and Italy .
About two million Europeans are said to have used cocaine in the past month .
The drugs agency bases its figures on information covering 2005 .
In that year , it says that seizures of cocaine reached record levels .
A total of 107 tons of the drug was recovered - up more than 45 % on the previous year .
Spain and Portugal are the main points of entry into Europe .
Impact on health
The EU drugs agency says the rise in demand for treatment is an indication of how cocaine use is affecting public health .
EU countries ' data on recorded drugs offences indexed to a base of 100 in the year 2000 , then weighted to reflect varying population sizes
It says that in 2005 , 22 % of all new requests for help were cocaine - related , almost three times the figure for 1999 .
Spain and the Netherlands had the majority of reports of treatment .
About 400 deaths relating to cocaine were reported in 2005 .
The agency says current systems make it difficult to detect the health consequences .
There has also been a steep rise in the offences linked to cocaine .
Across the EU , the agency reports an average 62 % increase with Germany the only exception .
The majority of crime is concerned with drug use or possession .
Cannabis is still the most commonly used illicit drug in Europe , but the agency says there are signs of its popularity waning among the young .
In Spain , 20 % of 15 - 34 year - olds are estimated to have used the drug in the past year , with similarly high rates in the Czech Republic ( 19.3 % ) , France ( 16.7 % ) , Italy ( 16.5 % ) and the UK ( 16.3 % ) .
Drug related crime has fallen by a fifth since 2003 , reducing harm to communities , while drug use is at its lowest level in 11 years

In the UK , France and the Czech Republic , that represents a fall of three to four percentage points .
The UK Home Office Minister , Vernon Coaker , welcomed the report .
He said that drug use as a whole was " at its lowest level in 11 years " and that drug - related crime had " fallen by a fifth since 2003 , reducing harm to communities " .
Nevertheless , the agency warns that some 7 % ( 23 million ) Europeans have taken cannabis in the past year and about three million people may be using it on a daily , or almost - daily , basis .
Add faked photos to the list of lies told by the Bush–Cheney Administration before its invasion of Iraq .
In a town hall meeting in Bloomsburg , Pa. , this week , Rep. Paul Kanjorski , a 12 - term congressman , said that shortly before Congress was scheduled to vote on authorizing military force against Iraq , top officials of the CIA showed select members of Congress three photographs it alleged were Iraqi Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) , better known as drones .
Kanjorski said he was told that the drones were capable of carrying nuclear , biological , or chemical agents , and could strike 1,000 miles inland of east coast or west coast cities .
Kanjorski said he and four or five other congressmen in the room were told there may be drones on freighters headed to the U.S. Both secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and President Bush wandered into and out of the briefing room , Kanjorski said .
Kanjorski said it was the second time he was called to the White House for a briefing .
He had opposed giving the President the powers to go to war , and said that he had n’t changed his mind after a first meeting .
Until he saw the pictures , Kanjorski said , “ I had n’t thought that Iraq was a threat . ”
That second meeting changed everything .
After he left that meeting , said Kanjorski , he was willing to give the President the authorization he wanted since the drones “ represented an imminent danger . ”
Kanjorski said he went to see Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , a retired Marine colonel .
Murtha , said Kanjorski , “ turned white ” when told about the drones ; Murtha , a former intelligence officer , believed that such information was classified .
Several years later , Kanjorski said he learned that the pictures were “ a god - damned lie , ” apparently taken by CIA photographers in the desert in the southwest of the U.S.
The drone story itself had already been disproved , although not many major media carried that story .
In October 2002 , President Bush said in Cincinnati that “ Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological ; weapons across broad areas . ”
He said that he was concerned “ that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States . ”
In that same speech , he claimed , “ Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles — far enough to strike Saudi Arabia , Israel , Turkey , and other nations — in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work . ”
Bush further claimed , “ Surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons . ”
Those claims were later proven false .
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla . ) said that at the time the President made his speech , intelligence analysts had already discounted that threat .
Nelson had told Florida Today in December 2003 that no analysts had “ found anything that resembles an UAV that has that capability . ”
Any drones that Iraq did have , John Pike , director of Global Security , a major military and intelligence “ think tank , ” told Florida Today , had limited range , and would not be able to target Tel Aviv , let alone the U.S .
Nelson , on the floor of the Senate in January 2004 , said that the information presented by the Administration was crucial in getting him and others to authorize a pre-emptive strike .
[ Assisting on this story were Bill Frost , and John and Sandie Walker .
In a four - day period after that meeting in northeast Pennsylvania , Rep. Kanjorski did not return phone calls to follow up on his statements .
The Department of Defense and the CIA did not comment .
Certain representatives who could confirm the meeting were unavailable .

Like the rest of your website , your About page is a robot .
You load it up with information , give it directives , and send it out to represent you in the world .
Although forums , blogs , and other two - way forms of online communication help bring humans back into the equation , you ’re pretty much stuck with the robot model for relatively static essentials like the About page — but you do get to decide what kind of robot you want to use .
Article Continues Below
Why the About page matters #section2
The About page exists to :
provide visitors with essential facts they need to interact with your company ,
give visitors context for the information they find elsewhere on the site ,
differentiate your organization from others like it , and
give visitors a reason ( several reasons , ideally ) for doing whatever it is you want them to do : contact a sales lead , join a campaign , send money , buy a widget .
Important stuff , and not too tricky , but while most organizations now recognize this page as an important opportunity to communicate , many still do n’t .
But why not ?
Because they ’re using the wrong kind of robot .
Meet our heroine , Ms. Patience .
She ’s selecting service companies to send an RFP to ; as part of her prep work , she needs to get a little information about the Knock - Doodle Corporation .
Little does she know that her quest will lead her through the gallery of useless machinery .
First up : a bucket of bolts we like to call Dumb - bot .
Dumb - bot meets information requests with a frozen metal smile and a blank - eyed stare .
Dumb - bots can be a little unnerving , and certainly do n’t serve anyone ’s marketing goals .
Let ’s take a look .
Ms. Patience : Excuse me , I ’m looking for a little information about your company .
Dumb - bot : [ Stares straight ahead ]
Ms. Patience : For starters , I need to know what you do .
Dumb - bot : The Knock - Doodle Corporation is a global services and solutions provider .
Ms. Patience : All right …
But what , exactly , do you do ?
Dumb - bot : [ Falls over ] Ms. Patience : [ Blinks ]
Dumb - bot in action#section4
Ask.com has a friendly enough About page .
The copy is a little vague , but it ’s useful — until you select the Company Overview link and get shunted to what looks like a different website ( new logo in the corner , new company name , same domain … ) with only the following to guide you :
IAC Search and Media delivers world - class information retrieval products through a diverse portfolio of Web sites , portals and downloadable applications .
IAC Search and Media ’s search and search - based portal brands include : [ list of companies ]
We know you ’re in there , Dumb - bot .
The blandness of the copy is even more jolting when you ’ve just come from Ask.com ’s warm , friendly bubble , but the real killer is that it provides nothing like the “ company overview ” we were promised .
You may also have run into the Dumb - bot 2000 , a more sophisticated model that holds up a sign reading “ over there ” before returning to its mechanical stupor .
This advanced version is visible on pages like Continental Airlines ’
About page , where the company apparently has room to link to resume - writing tips , but not to include even a brief description of who Continental is , what it does , and what makes it different from other companies .
Contrast it with Delta ’s About page , which provides a concise overview and a more judicious selection of links .
So what ’s the story ?
Does Dumb - bot ’s menacingly bland exterior hide a malicious intelligence dedicated to world domination ?
Is it the result of someone ( or a committee of someones ) failing to recognize the importance of serving user needs ?
Perhaps … but I believe I ’ve discovered the secret : these bots are actually Roombas that have been accidentally “ repurposed ” into a marketing role .
Given that , I think they ’re doing a reasonably good job .
Not so with our next mechanical menace .
If you ’ve ever had the educational experience of ordering service from a U.S. cable or telephone company , you ’ve probably run into one of these .
Sometime in the last five years , a bright - eyed business prodigy realized that long hold - times on customer service lines provided a captive audience — the perfect chance for cheesy recorded sales pitches that drone on and on while your neck cramps from holding the phone with your shoulder and an hour of your life drizzles into the slime - encrusted maw of the telecommunications beast .
Ew .
Less egregious , but still irritating , are the answering systems that require you to wait through a ten - second recording of the company ’s tagline before explaining how you can get the information you need .
An About page cluttered with subjective superlatives and self - congratulatory descriptions is just about as effective : your visitor asks for real information and you delay them with marketing fluff instead .
Let ’s test it on Ms. Patience .
Sales - o- matic : Good afternoon !
You ’ve reached the global headquarters of the Knock - Doodle Corporation , where world - class business solutions create real - time advantages !
We are committed to providing you with the best possible service by living our mission of the best possible service !
Ms. Patience : Ahh , hi .
Sales - o - matic :
Do you like to save money ?
If your answer is yes , I ’d like to tell you more about our — Ms. Patience : Actually , can just you tell me how many employees you have ?
Sales - o- matic : Knock - Doodle Corporation is the first solutions provider to truly embrace the global economy .
46,874 subject - matter experts strong , Knock - Doodle Corporation offers a deep pool of intellectual capital grounded in our worldwide — Ms. Patience : [ Drowns the sales bot in a pool of its own intellectual capital ]
Web users are not a captive audience .
Do n’t treat them like one .
The lawbot#section6
And now , the opposite of the sales bot .
This one shows up almost exclusively on the internet , possibly because anyone who tried it offline would get kidney - punched .
In response to requests for general information , the lawbot spits out the legal equivalent of machine language , overwhelming the reader with information that ’s irrelevant or unimportant to the vast majority of visitors .
I ’ve been picking on relying on Deloitte for examples since the days when their About page included portraits straight out of a funeral parlor .
Here ’s the way the first paragraph of their About page begins :
Deloitte refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu , a Swiss Verein , its member firms , and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates .
Not really a rip- roaring start , but it gets better , right ?
Well , they do offer a few chunks of useful information in the next sentence , but here ’s how that same paragraph ends :
Services are not provided by the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Verein , and , for regulatory and other reasons , certain member firms do not provide services in all four professional areas .
And the next two paragraphs :
As a Swiss Verein ( association ) , neither Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu nor any of its member firms has any liability for each other ’s acts or omissions .
Each of the member firms is a separate and independent legal entity operating under the names “ Deloitte , ” “ Deloitte & Touche , ” “ Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu , ” or other related names .
In the U.S. , Deloitte & Touche USA LLP is the member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu , and services are provided by the subsidiaries of Deloitte & Touche USA LLP ( Deloitte & Touche LLP , Deloitte Consulting LLP , Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP , Deloitte Tax LLP and their subsidiaries ) and not by Deloitte & Touche USA LLP .
That ’s the whole page .
As you can see , they can barely contain their own enthusiasm .
Let ’s just let Ms. Patience lie on the divan with a cool cloth over her eyes , shall we ?
The funny thing is , back in 1999 , Deloitte ’s About page copy was n’t so bad ( and had a better URL , too ) .
They used quotes from real people and talked about concrete achievements ; an updated version of that copy ( with better photography ) would be worlds better than their current trance - inducing legal litany .
An About page should provide context and necessary facts , but should also give the reader compelling reasons to do what you want them to do .
Legal text does n’t do that .
It can go on its own page — or at least get shoved down to a place where it can be safely ignored .
Taking stock #section7
Now that you ’ve been introduced to the most irritating of web - bots , have another look at your About page .
Does it achieve all the goals outlined above — without making any distressing noises or turning your visitors away screaming ?
If not , let us consider the qualities that will make your About page something useful to you and to the visitor :
Intelligence and consideration #section8
In each of these above examples , the real problem is a lack of attention to the user ’s needs and the way that the organization ’s communication goals can be met while serving those needs .
The first and most important way to improve your About page is to think very carefully about what your visitors — members , clients , potential employees , members of the press , investors , current employees , donors , or fans — need and want from your About page .
Personas are a useful tool for this sort of thing , but even a quick brainstorming session should produce results better than the ones we ’ve seen above .
Once you know what your visitors want , make it easy to find .
Want to keep your “ press room ” in its own section ?
Fine , but link to it from your About page anyway .
Do n’t hide things or force users to respect your internal organizational divisions .
Give them what they need .
Distinct personality # section9
Resist the temptation to be bland .
You need to convey important facts clearly and concisely , but make sure you also talk about the actual humans who make up both your organization and the group it serves .
Quotes are great and good photos are helpful .
A natural , friendly , confident writing voice does much to humanize your site , and the About page is an ideal place to demonstrate great writing skills , even if the rest of your site needs to be quite technical .
On the other hand , resist the urge to be irritating .
Imagine yourself using the text of your About page in a conversation with a sharp colleague from another company .
Would you really say it that way ?
Puffed - up language that would be out of place in an intelligent , one - on - one conversation probably does n’t belong on your About page — or really , anywhere else on your site .
( But let ’s dream small for now . )
A laser gun#section10
Instead of clogging your About page with subjective fluff , use verifiable accomplishments to make your case .
Do n’t say that your company is a leader — show it leading , via recognized awards , case studies , or useful statistics .
Instead of saying that your non-profit helps people , point to concrete accomplishments and recognition .
But what if you do n’t have evidence ?
If your organization is relatively new or if it operates in a sector in which concrete accomplishments are hard to define , you have a trickier job , but the theory still holds .
Real leaders do n’t need to wrap themselves in banners proclaiming their leadership ; clear , confident , user - focused communication goes a long way toward establishing credibility .
Incomplete , ill - considered communication does the opposite .
And the winner is …# section11
So now we have a smart , considerate , well - armed robot with a distinct personality .
Oh , and great language skills are crucial … think less Data , more Bishop .
Select the right robot and tune it up a little , and your About page will seem a lot more , well , human .
And then Ms. Patience can finally send you that RFP and take a well - deserved vacation .
ORANGE , California ( CNN ) --
With the number of uncontained fires down to nine in Southern California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger turned his attention Saturday to what he called " the ugly side of human behavior " during and after the disaster .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks Saturday at a news conference at the scene of the Santiago Canyon fire .

At least two of the fires were started intentionally and two more have suspicious origins , he said during a news conference , issuing a warning for the arsonists .
" We will hunt down the people that are responsible for that , " he said .
" If I were one of the people who started the fires , I would not sleep soundly right now , because we 're right behind you , " Schwarzenegger said , urging the culprits to turn themselves in .
Watch the governor 's tough message »
Authorities said Saturday they were following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F - 150 pickup that may be a lead in determining who set the sprawling Santiago Fire in Orange County .
Witnesses reported seeing the 1998 - 2004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday afternoon , about the time the Santiago Fire started .
Investigators said this week that the fire had two points of origin , and they found evidence at the scene , although they declined to describe it .
Possible leads have been coming in to a hotline .
The fire is 35 percent contained -- down from 50 percent on Wednesday .
It has burned 27,000 acres and destroyed 14 homes .
There is a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest .
Authorities also consider the Rosa Fire in San Diego County , which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained , an arson .
Five people in three counties have been arrested in arson probes , but none has been linked to any of the large fires .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
Anyone who tries to rip off vulnerable homeowners and anyone else victimized by the fire will get " no mercy " in finding and prosecuting them , several officials said .
State Insurance Commissioner Stephen Poizner said his office has 100 fraud investigators on the ground going door - to - door with local law enforcement , telling residents how to avoid scam artists .
Detectives will also conduct sting operations to catch anyone trying to exploit those who have suffered .
At least two arrests were made in the past few days for looting , Poizner said .
It turned out that both suspects were wanted for attempted murder , he said .
Meanwhile , downed power lines , leaking gas lines , broken water pipes and still - blazing fires have blocked the return of thousands of Southern Californians who fled their homes this week ahead of more than 20 wind - whipped wildfires .
Fourteen people died , seven from the fires and seven from causes linked to their evacuations .
With the number of uncontained fires down to nine , hundreds of thousands made the trip back home .
For most , the return was , if not joyful , at least filled with relief .

Meanwhile , Schwarzenegger announced more help for victims of the fire .
Cash grants of up to $ 10,000 will be available to help people with expenses caused by the disaster , such as housing , medical costs and transportation , he said .
That 's in addition to assistance provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
" California stands ready to provide fire victims all the assistance they need to get their lives back on track .
Even after the fires are extinguished , we will still be here to help fire victims in need , " Schwarzenegger said .
In Poway , northeast of San Diego , Mike Perry and his neighbors watched in disbelief this week as fire climbed over a hill near his home and crept closer to his front door .
He recalled the Cedar fire of 2003 , which destroyed about 280,000 acres .
" It was a helpless feeling then , " he said , gesturing toward a huge , high - powered industrial hose on his lawn that he bought at the time .
As he talked to CNN , he clutched a massive wrench that he had used to turn it on .
With firefighters stretched thin , he used the hose this week to douse flames from the Rice Canyon Fire .
His neighbors , some of whom had bought their own sophisticated hoses , pitched in .
Perry is sure that without them , his house would have been burned .

" It was surreal in that we were clearly thinking , we knew what we had to do , " he said .
" You had to save your home and your neighbors ' homes , and that 's what mattered . "
The Rice Canyon Fire , which burned dozens of homes to the ground in Fallbrook , was 80 percent contained Saturday at about 9,000 acres as calmer winds made firefighters ' jobs a little easier , fire officials said .

After a week in which nearly a million Southern Californians fled their homes in seven counties , fewer than 50,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders in hardest - hit San Diego County .
There , nine wildfires torched over 450 square miles , more than a tenth of the Connecticut - sized county 's total area .

San Diego city officials closed Qualcomm Stadium , home to the NFL's Chargers , to evacuees at midday Friday and cleared the team to play its scheduled Sunday afternoon game there against the Houston Texans .
Air in San Diego County remains unhealthy , especially in Oceanside and Chula Vista , said Bill Brick , senior meteorologist for the Air Pollution Control District .
Public health experts recommend lightly misting indoor and outdoor hard surfaces before gently sweeping ash .

The number of people hurt in the fires increased Friday to 85 , including at least 61 firefighters , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
Flames destroyed at least 1,641 homes , the department said .
The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $ 1 billion in San Diego County alone , an emergency official said .
Although forecasters predict no rain during the upcoming days , CNN's Jenny Harrison described a " much better picture " approaching -- including lighter winds and cloud coverage that will reduce temperatures and humidity .

As odd as it sounds , it ’s true .
The Mainstream News Media appears to be in a total news blackout in regard S 1959 .
At first , I believed it was merely the reluctance of the MSM to discuss this Bill , however , the answer may be much more sinister than that !
Below is a reply I found on Ron Paul ’s Campaign site which references this Bill , and I double and triple checked for ANY Mainstream News Coverage on this issue - and so far , it appears to almost be non-existent !
The Greatest Obstacle
On December 4th , 2007 hemingway 811 says :
is that the MSM has had a total blackout on the House ’s passage of HR 1955 on Oct. 23rd .
Do a search at any major newspaper & the major television stations , including cable .
I have found a few comments in Blogs at a couple of television sites , but that ’s about it .
For example , at the Washington Post you get :
“ No Results Found ”
LATIMES.COM ARTICLES
No matches found on search for : hr 1955
No matches found on search for : violent radicalization
404 members of the House voted for this “ thought crime ” Bill .
The ACLU is working with members of the Senate to amend the language .
They specifically refer to the regulation of thoughts .
I do n’t expect the ACLU to make much headway with the Senate .
We have been bombarded with so much fear - mongering 24/ 7 for so long , members of Congress are too afraid of being labeled unpatriotic if they do n’t vote for legislation like this .
RP did not cast a vote on HR 1955 .

It is time to flood Keith Olbermann , Lou Dobbs , Jack Cafferty , and anyone else speaking out of the real issues the rest of the MSM ignores , with e-mails urging them to speak out about this Legislation .
I already have .

Early humans may have strutted their stuff as upright walkers and runners , but a new study suggests they were real slowpokes .
If early humans lacked an Achilles tendon like gorillas , as the study 's " reverse - engineered " computer models suggest , our ancestors would have had difficulty running .
The lack of spring in their step would have kept their top speed to half that of a modern human while costing them twice the energy .
Still , the study implies that walking upright would have been more efficient than lumbering around like other primates .
" Our research supports the belief that the earliest humans used efficient bipedal walking rather than chimp - like ' Groucho ' walking , " said Bill Sellers , a computational primatologist at the University of Manchester in England who led the research .
Sellers presented his findings this week at the BA Festival of Science held at the University of York , UK .
Leg -up on survival
Although efficient sprinting may have been next to impossible for humanity 's ancestors , their walking would have been normal .
Sellers thinks the modern human's well - developed Achilles tendon , which transforms the legs into spring - loaded running tools , allowed us to switch from a herbivorous lifestyle to one focused on hunting .
" What we need to discover now is when in our evolution did we develop an Achilles tendon , as knowing this will help unravel the mystery of our origins , " Sellers said .
Sellers first looked at walking , and his models suggested that our human ancestors were able to walk as efficiently as modern humans around 3.5 million years ago .
His research also showed that their gait was a little slower than ours , but only because they were smaller and had shorter legs .
" How we evolved from our common ancestor with chimpanzees six million years ago is a fundamental question , " he said .
" Walking upright seems to be the very first thing that distinguishes our ancestors from other apes , so finding out about this should help us map the evolutionary pathway to modern humans . "
Dead woman walking
Sellers , who recently modeled the running speeds of five meat - eating dinosaurs , used the same software to model anatomical data from the hominid fossil skeleton called " Lucy " as well as hominid footprints preserved in ash at Laetoli in Tanzania .
" The skeletons and footprints from some of the earliest members of the human lineage — the early hominids — provide the best clues we have to how we progressed down the pathway to modern human walking and running , " Sellers said .
By " reverse - engineering " fossil skeletons , Sellers explained that information about muscles and tendons can be gathered and plugged into a realistic computer model .
" This model is a virtual robot where we can activate muscles and get it to move its legs in a physically realistic fashion , " he said .
" The tricky bit is getting it to actually walk or run without falling over . "
Sellers and his team also used the computer model to show how the Achilles tendon acts like a big spring that stores energy during running ; when the tendon was removed from the model , the top running speed was greatly reduced .
" We have only just started to look at [ humanoid ] running , " Sellers said .
" Our techniques should let us get to the bottom of this question because it will let us measure the running abilities of our fossil ancestors directly . "
The future of the Internet is up for grabs .
Last year , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) effectively eliminated net neutrality rules , which ensured that every content creator on the Internet - from big - time media concerns to backroom bloggers - had equal opportunity to make their voice heard .
Now , large and powerful corporations are lobbying Washington to turn the World Wide Web into what critics call a " toll road , " threatening the equitability that has come to define global democracy 's newest forum .
Yet the public knows little about what 's happening behind closed doors on Capitol Hill .
Some activists describe the ongoing debate this way : A small number of mega-media giants owns much of the content and controls the delivery of content on radio and television and in the press ; if we let them take control of the Internet as well , immune from government regulation , who will pay the price ?
Their opponents say that the best way to encourage Internet innovation and technological advances is to let the market - not the federal government - determine the shape of the system .
" The genius of the Internet was that it made the First Amendment a living document again for millions of Americans , " says Robert McChesney , a media scholar and activist and co-author of OUR MEDIA , NOT THEIRS .
" The decisions that we 're going be making ... are probably going to set our entire communication system , and , really , our entire society , on a course that it wo n't be able to change for generations . "
UPDATES
The mid-term elections appear to have moved net neutrality nearer the top of lawmakers ' priority lists .
Legislation opposed by net neutrality advocates died with the 109th Congress .
In January of 2007 , Senator Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of South Dakota , and Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , reintroduced pro-neutrality legislation to the new session .
There were also crucial developments in the matter of neutrality and media mergers in late 2006 .
AT&T 's 2006 bid to merge with Bell - South which ran into trouble with federal regulators .
Federal Communications Commission Commissioner Robert McDowell refused to participate in the agency 's vote on the proposed merger - which led to further debate among commissioners .
The upshot for net neutrality ?
AT&T filed a " letter of commitment " with the Federal Communications Commission in which it promises to observe Net Neutrality principles for at least 24 months as part of the settlement which let the merger go forward .
The letter states in part that AT&T :
commits that it will maintain a neutral network and neutral routing in its wireline broadband Internet access service .
This commitment shall be satisfied by AT&T / BellSouth 's agreement not to provide or to sell to Internet content , application , or service providers , including those affiliated with AT&T / BellSouth , any service that privileges , degrades or prioritizes any packet transmitted over AT&T / BellSouth 's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source , ownership or destination .

John Goetz und Conny Neumann Von
It ’s hard to think of elements being , of all things , ‘ cool ’ , but the basic building blocks of every thing that has come into common use in the world is comprised of the elements .
From the very air we breathe ( oxygen , nitrogen , and other trace gases ) to simple medications we take ( comprised of many things including calcium , magnesium , copper , potassium ) , all are found , or in a few cases , created , here on Earth .
Though many of the elements found in gaseous forms can be considered toxic , many in liquid and solid forms can be equally as deadly : argon , gallium , and chlorine to name just a few .
There are many that stand out because of their use , visible state , or exceptionally short life spans .
Here are but ten ( and , of course , a cool bonus ) .
10 . Mercury – Hg
Mercury also called quicksilver , is an element that has the symbol Hg ( Greek : hydrargyrum , meaning watery or liquid silver ) with an atomic number of 80 .
A heavy , silvery metal , mercury is one of the elements that are liquid at or near room temperature .
Mercury is used in thermometers , barometers and other scientific apparatus , though many concerns about the element ’s toxicity have led to said thermometers being largely phased out in favor of alcohol - filled or digital .
It remains in use in scientific study and research applications , and in dentistry .
Mercury is mostly obtained by reduction from cinnabar , a mineral .
Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world and it is harmless in an insoluble form , such as mercuric sulfide , but it is poisonous in soluble forms such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury .
Watch the video clip above for great footage of mercury vapor .
9. Magnesium – Mg
Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth ’s crust , though not found in nature in its elemental form .
It is a Group 2 element , called an alkaline earth metal .
Magnesium tarnishes slightly in air , and finely divided magnesium readily ignites upon heating in air and burns with a dazzling white flame .
Normally magnesium is coated with a layer of oxide that protects magnesium from air and water .
Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body .
It helps maintain regular muscle and nerve function , keeps heart rhythm steady , supports a healthy immune system , and keeps bones strong .
Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels , promotes normal blood pressure , and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and the synthesis of protein .
Rather than including an image , I thought you might enjoy this incredibly awesome little experiment video in which burning magnesium is combined with carbon dioxide .
8. Krypton – Kr
Krypton is present in the air at about 1 parts per million .
The atmosphere of Mars contains a little ( about 0.3 ppm ) of krypton .
It is characterized by its brilliant green and orange spectral lines .
Under normal conditions krypton is colorless , odorless , fairly expensive gas .
Solid krypton is a white crystalline substance with a face - centered cubic structure , which is common to all the “ rare gases ” .
In 1960 an international agreement changed the definition of the meter in terms of wavelengths of light emitted by the krypton - 86 isotope .
This agreement replaced the much - older standard ‘ meter ’ located in Paris which was a metal bar made of a platinum alloy ( the bar was originally estimated to be one ten millionth of a quadrant of the Earth ’s polar circumference ) .
Many window companies now use Krypton to fill sealed panes in order to reduce energy waste , and the gas can also be used to detect leaks in industrial sealed containers .
7. Curium – Cm
Named for famed physicist Marie Curie , curium is made by bombarding plutonium with helium ions .
So radioactive it glows in the dark .
Several kilograms of curium are produced each year .
As curium is only available in extremely limited quantities , it has few uses ; however , it was used on a Mars mission as an alpha particle source for the Alpha Proton X - Ray Spectrometer .
Curium is potential isotopes power source as it releases three watts of heat energy per gram gram .
Most normal individuals will never normally encounter curium as it does not occur in nature and is only produced in limited quantities .
Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created a visible sample of curium - 242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium - 241 with neutrons .
6. Strontium – Sr
Strontium is found chiefly as celestite and strontianite .
The metal can be prepared by electrolysis of the fused chloride mixed with potassium chloride , or is made by reducing strontium oxide with aluminum in a vacuum at a temperature at which strontium dissolves off .
Strontium is softer than calcium and decomposes in water more vigorously .
It does not absorb nitrogen below 380 oC .
It should be kept under kerosene to prevent oxidation .
Freshly cut strontium has a silvery appearance , but rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide .
The finely divided metal ignites spontaneously in air .
Volatile strontium salts impart a beautiful crimson color to flames , and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares .
Natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes .
The primary use for strontium compounds is in glass for color television cathode ray tubes to prevent X - ray emission .
If you want to see a future rocket scientist having a play with Strontium , here you go .
5. Lutetium – Lu
In 1907 Georges Urbain was credited with the discovery of the element and won the right to name them , although chemists later changed the spelling of lutecium to lutetium .
Today , lutetium is primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite sand ( ( Ce , La , Th , Nd , Y ) PO4 ) , a material rich in rare earth elements .
Lutetium is one of the most difficult elements to prepare and has no large scale practical uses , although some of its radioactive isotopes can be used as a catalyst in the cracking of petroleum products and a catalyst in some hydrogenation and polymerization processes .
Lutetium - 176 has been used to date the age of meteorites .
Lutetium Aluminum Garnet has been proposed for use as a lens material in high refractive lithography .
4. Chlorine – Cl
We all know never to mix chlorine with ammonia , right ?
Well , besides that potentially devastating fact , chlorine is widely used in making many everyday products .
It is used for producing safe drinking water the world over .
Even the smallest water supplies are now usually chlorinated .
It is also extensively used in the production of paper products , dyes , textiles , petroleum products , medicines , antiseptics , insecticides , food , solvents , paints , plastics , and many other consumer products .
Most of the chlorine produced is used in the manufacture of chlorinated compounds for sanitation , pulp bleaching , disinfectants , and textile processing .
Further use is in the manufacture of chlorates , chloroform , carbon tetrachloride , and in the extraction of bromine .
Organic chemistry demands much from chlorine , both as an oxidizing agent and in substitution , since it often brings many desired properties in an organic compound when substituted for hydrogen , as in one form of synthetic rubber .
3. Aluminum – Al
Remember the boom of aluminum siding back in the day ?
Well this stuff has thousand - and - one uses from soda cans to kitchen utensils , outside building decoration , and in thousands of industrial applications where a strong , light , easily constructed material is needed .
Although it ’s electrical conductivity is only about 60 % that of copper , it is used in electrical transmission lines because of its lightweight .
Pure aluminum is soft and lacks strength , but alloyed with small amounts of copper , magnesium , silicon , manganese or other elements impart a variety of useful properties .
These alloys are of vital importance in the construction of modern aircraft and rockets .
Aluminum , evaporated in a vacuum , forms a highly reflective coating for both visible light and radiant heat .
These coatings soon form a thin layer of the protective oxide and do not deteriorate as do silver coatings .
They are used to coat telescope mirrors and to make decorative paper , packages , and toys .
2. Zirconium – Zr
It is used extensively by the chemical industry where corrosive agents are employed .
Zirconium is used in vacuum tubes , as an alloying agent in steel , in surgical appliances , photoflash bulbs , explosive primers , rayon spinnerets , lamp filaments , etc .
It is used in poison ivy lotions in the form of the carbonate as it combines with urushiol .
With niobium , zirconium is super - conductive at low temperatures and is used to make super - conductive magnets , which offer hope of direct large - scale generation of electric power .
Zirconium oxide ( zircon ) has a high index of refraction and is used as a gem material .
The impure oxide , zirconia , is used for laboratory crucibles that can withstand heat shock , for linings of metallurgical furnaces , and by the glass and ceramic industries as a refractory material .
Its use as a refractory material accounts for a large share of all zirconium consumed .
1. Elements 112-118 Ununbium , Ununtrium , Ununquadium , Ununpentium , Ununhexium , Ununseptium , Ununoxium
Relatively new to the Periodic Table ( they were n’t even heard of when I was in High School ) , elements 112-118 .
They are completely man made by bombarding specific atoms of one element with specific atoms of another thereby separating each into an entirely new element only stable ( though not necessarily visible ) for a fraction of a fraction of a second .
Ununbium was first created on Feb. 9th , 1996 in a lab in Germany .
This element was created by fusing a zinc - 70 nucleus with a lead - 208 nucleus by accelerating zinc nuclei into a lead target in a heavy ion accelerator .
The two ununbium nuclei so produced had a mass number of 27 .
On Feb.
1 , 2004 the discovery of ununtrium and ununpentium were reported by a team composed of Russian scientists and an American scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Academy .
Most of the others were created or discovered much in the same fashion in different parts of the world since then .
As of yet , since none of these have been witnessed for more than a second , their inclusion remains suspect and under investigation .
Bonus : Helium
It would be unforgivable to do a list of amazing elements without including Helium .
First of all , it is the most popular element in parties – by inhaling the helium used to fill balloons , you can make your voice sound like Donald Duck .
This is particularly fun when drunk .
But , that is nothing compared to what helium does when it is dramatically cooled ( - 271 c ) – this is called the lambda point .
At this stage ( as a liquid ) it is known as Helium II .
Hellium II is a superfluid .
When it flows through even capillaries of 10? 7 to 10 ? 8 - m widths it has no measurable viscosity .
In addition , it will creep up a container ( as it seeks out a warmer area ) seemingly against the effects of gravity .
Just watch the clip above and be amazed !
And just when you thought it could n’t get better , here is a link to YouTube to listen to :
Bonus 2 : The Element Song
As this is a science related list I thought we could have a Bonus 2 rather than just a boring old Bonus 2 .
This is a song by Tom Lehrer called the Elements Song .
If that was n’t enough for you , here is a young future scientist singing it at school in a talent quest .
The discovery of Gliese 581 was one of the most exciting moments in extrasolar planetary researcher .
Astronomers found an Earth - massed planet orbiting within the habitable zone of a distant star .
This would mean that liquid water could be on its surface – and maybe life .
Now there ’s even more evidence that Gliese 581 is living up to the speculation .
Astronomers have published two independent studies this week , claiming that there are least 2 Earthlike planets orbiting the star within the habitability zone .
The first team , led by Franck Selsis , computed the properties of planetary atmospheres at various distances from the star .
As we ’ve seen with Venus , Earth and Mars in our own Solar System , your distance from the star matters a great deal .
Get too close , and the water is vaporized and blown out into space .
Get too far away and your carbon dioxide can’t trap in enough heat to keep the planet warm .
You want to be just right .
Selsis and his team calculated that the inner boundary of this habitable zone around Gliese 581 should be somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9 astronomical units ( an AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun ) .
And the outer zone should be between 1.7 and 2.4 AU .
At least one planet orbiting Gliese 581 falls within this range .
The second team used a different technique to calculate habitability .
They studied a narrower region where Earth - like photosynthesis is possible .
For the super - Earths thought to be orbiting Gliese 581 , they calculated the sources of atmospheric CO2 ( volcanos and ridges ) and then the potential sinks through weathering .
If a planet ’s too old , if might not be active any more , and would n’t release enough CO2 to keep the planet warm .
Once again , the age of the planets , and therefore the amount of carbon dioxide , is within this region of habitability .
Thanks to this new research , the planets orbiting Gliese 581 are primary targets for future planet hunting observatories , such as ESA ’s Darwin and NASA ’s Terrestrial Planet Finder .
These observatories should be able to directly measure the atmospheres of these planets , and determine if they harbour life .
A third paper on the topic has recently been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics .
In this , another team of researchers have studied the long term orbits of planets going around Gliese 581 .
Here you want stability , without highly eccentric orbits that might cause extreme warm and glacial eras .
Once again , the planets around Gliese 581 are surprisingly stable .
Things are looking really hopeful .
Now we just need someone to uncancel the Terrestrial Planet Finder .

It is obvious Hot Air is obsessed with the 9/11 truth movement .
Bloggers over at Hot Air — the neocon blog run by the concentration camp maven , Michelle Malkin — ca n’t stay away from Prison Planet and Alex Jones ’ websites .
It rankles AllahPundit somebody of the notoriety and stature of Jesse Ventura would consent to go on a nationally syndicated radio show and tell the truth — the buildings were brought down in obvious demolition fashion and titanium steel jet engines are not consumed by kerosene fire .
According to AllahPundit — who disgraces
Allah because that ’s what neocons do — Jesse has outed himself “ as a free - thinkin ’ fool on this subject , ” a subject lower ranking neocons , even the bloggers , never entertain , referring instead to the Popular Mechanics , Superman in Bizarro world version of history and physics .
Most of the time they will not even bother with this and simply defer to the mindless mantra that the “ twoofers ” are incurably , maybe even dangerously insane .
No wonder Bill O’Reilly wants them to shut up , Glenn Beck is convinced they are related to Timothy McVeigh , and Morning Joe wants them tased and disappeared Gitmo fashion .
It ’s too easy to say nothing of intellectually dishonest and lazy .
It is a feeding frenzy every time somebody with a household name questions the official 9/11 fairy tale , every time they say it is impossible for a building to collapse at free fall or large aircraft to slam into a concrete building without leaving behind an appreciable amount of wreckage .
It ’s a lost cause for the neocon bloggers .
Because millions of people think the official version is bunk .
And they are encouraged when a guy like Ventura gets on the radio , shortwave , and the internet and asks the same questions they do .
Even with the neocon voodoo trance corporate media doing its level best to stigmatize 9/11 researchers and activists — remember , Glenn Beck and Geraldo Rivera think these folks are deranged anarchists — it is not working .
Less people are reading the neocon bloggers or watching Malkin when she takes to the Faux News stage .
More are tuning in to “ Ron Paul ’s chat buddy ” and tuning out the corporate media .
It is curtains for the neocon bloggers and fans of the Faux News neocon Michelle Malkin .
Because they are on the losing side of not only history but physics and logic as well .
Only a matter of time before they are relegated to a footnote .

Scientists from Spectrolab , Inc. , a subsidiary of Boeing , have recently published their research on the fabrication of solar cells that surpass the 40 % efficiency milestone — the highest efficiency achieved for any photovoltaic device .
Their results appear in a recent edition of Applied Physics Letters .
Most conventional solar cells used in today ’s applications , such as for supplemental power for homes and buildings , are one - sun , single - junction silicon cells that use only the light intensity that the sun produces naturally , and have optimal efficiency for a relatively narrow range of photon energies .
The Spectrolab group experimented with concentrator multijunction solar cells that use high intensities of sunlight , the equivalent of 100s of suns , concentrated by lenses or mirrors .
Significantly , the multijunction cells can also use the broad range of wavelengths in sunlight much more efficiently than single - junction cells .
" These results are particularly encouraging since they were achieved using a new class of metamorphic semiconductor materials , allowing much greater freedom in multijunction cell design for optimal conversion of the solar spectrum , " Dr. Richard R. King , principal investigator of the high efficiency solar cell research and development effort , told PhysOrg.com .
" The excellent performance of these materials hints at still higher efficiency in future solar cells . "
In the design , multijunction cells divide the broad solar spectrum into three smaller sections by using three subcell band gaps .
Each of the subcells can capture a different wavelength range of light , enabling each subcell to efficiently convert that light into electricity .
With their conversion efficiency measured at 40.7 % , the metamorphic multijunction concentrator cells surpass the theoretical limit of 37 % of single - junction cells at 1000 suns , due to their multijunction structure .
While Spectrolab 's primary business is supplying PV cells and panels to the aerospace industry ( many of their solar cells are used on satellites currently in orbit ) , the company envisions that this breakthrough will also have applications in commercial terrestrial solar electricity generation .
The research that led to the discovery of the high efficiency concentrator solar cell was funded partly by the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory , and will play a significant role in the government ’s Solar America Initiative , which aims to make solar energy cost - competitive with conventional electricity generation by 2015 .
The company has said that these solar cells could help concentrator system manufacturers produce electricity at a cost that is competitive with electricity generated by conventional methods today .
The Spectrolab scientists also predict that with theoretical efficiencies of 58 % in cells with more than three junctions using improved materials and designs , concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45 % or even 50 % in the future .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 6 — H. Stewart Van Scoyoc , founder of one of the biggest lobbying firms in Washington , spent an anxious morning with his lawyer last week assessing the far - reaching ethics and lobbying rules Congress had passed the day before .
The first worry was what lobbyists are calling the new “ temptation rules . ”
Not only do they bar lawmakers and aides from accepting any gifts , meals or trips from lobbyists , they also impose penalties up to $ 200,000 and five years in prison on any lobbyist who provides such freebies .
And worse still for Mr. Van Scoyoc , under the new law he is required to certify each quarter that none of the 50 lobbyists in his firm bought so much as a burger or cigar for someone on a lawmaker ’s staff .
“ You are basically asking people to certify , with big penalties , that nobody has lied on their expense accounts , ” Mr. Van Scoyoc said , marveling at the complexity of policing such casual contact between lobbyists and Congressional aides .
“ These are people who are sharing apartments together , playing on the same softball teams , dating each other — young people with active social lives . ”
In the midst of a drought , Los Angeles officials announced Friday that 600 million gallons of water must be dumped from two reservoirs that supply a swath of the city because an unexpected chemical reaction rendered it undrinkable .
Silver Lake and Elysian reservoirs registered elevated levels of the suspected carcinogen bromate between June and October , the result of an unusual combination of intense sunlight , bromide naturally present in groundwater and chlorine used to kill bacteria .
The reservoirs delivered water to an estimated 600,000 consumers , but state public health officials say the dangers were minimal .
Bromate , they said , poses a small cancer risk only after being consumed daily over a lifetime .
Department of Water and Power officials said they removed the reservoirs from service within two days of learning about the problem in October and diverted wells that fed them .
The reservoirs will be drained and cleaned early next year so they can be replenished for the high - demand summer season .
The state Department of Public Health commended the DWP ’s action .
But two elected leaders criticized the city agency for not alerting the public until Friday , more than two months after the contamination was discovered and only after being urged to do so by the state health agency .
“ I praise the swift and quick reaction of the DWP , but I do n’t like how long it took the residents of Silver Lake to find out about it , ” said City Council President Eric Garcetti , who represents part of the area along with Councilman Tom LaBonge , who also criticized the delay .
“ The ratepayers deserve full information when public health is concerned . ”
One of those ratepayers , Silver Lake resident George Hoyt , said he was n’t happy to learn about the contamination from a reporter on Friday morning .
Hoyt , who makes a point of drinking tap water to save money , was dropping his 4 - year - old son at the Neighborhood Nursery School , its swing sets sitting almost at the edge of Ivanhoe Reservoir , which abuts its larger Silver Lake cousin but was unaffected by the bromate .
The DWP said there was no risk to the children there or to others who frequent the fenced - off reservoirs .
The perimeter of the Silver Lake site is a popular path for joggers .
“ It seems to me that the whole point of having tap water is that it is supposed to be reliable drinking water , ” Hoyt said .
DWP officials said they did not want to go public until they fully understood the cause of the problem , which affected water delivered to Elysian Park , areas south of Sunset Boulevard and east of Vermont Avenue , downtown and much of South Los Angeles .
State health officials said the DWP was not required to notify the public because the elevated bromate still fell below levels considered dangerous under state and federal clean water regulations .
To be in violation , bromate sampled each month must exceed 10 parts per billion on average over a year .
When DWP crews tested Silver Lake reservoir in October , the bromate level was 68 parts per billion ; Elysian was 106 .
The imminent water loss comes amid a prolonged dry spell that prompted Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to call for voluntary conservation .
But DWP officials downplayed the consequences , saying the two reservoirs account for less than 1 % of the city ’s annual water use .
And they say some of the water , while unsuitable for drinking , could be rechanneled for other uses .
Water from the Elysian Reservoir , for example , could be used to irrigate nearby hillsides , they said .
And officials were trying to determine whether they could channel Silver Lake Reservoir , which contains the bulk of the supply at issue , to irrigate parts of Griffith Park or to fill Hollywood Reservoir as emergency reserves for non-drinking purposes .
If not , it will simply be dumped into the Los Angeles River and carried to the ocean .
“ At a time of water shortages , we are loath to [ drain the reservoirs ] .
Every drop is precious , ” said DWP General Manager H. David Nahai .
“ But we want to make sure that . . . the public continues to retain a high level of confidence in the quality of the water . ”
Nahai said the agency became aware of the problem in October when an outside lab identified the existence of bromate ; the lab traced the problem back to June .
The DWP conducted its own tests and immediately removed the two reservoirs from service , Nahai said .
Officials said the bromate levels were a surprise because such a chemical reaction had never occurred in any of the city ’s six reservoirs .
DWP officials said they also immediately tested all of the city reservoirs and determined that water was safe to drink at the remaining four .
DWP crews will begin draining the Silver Lake and Elysian reservoirs in January or February .
New water could cost the DWP as much as $ 660,000 .
In the meantime , customers normally served by the reservoirs will receive water pumped through the Ivanhoe Reservoir .
“ The DWP is vigilant and will go to an over - abundance of caution in dealing with the water supply , ” Nahai said .
“ The water supply is safe . ”

The $ 150,000 mistake , your shipping schedule being off by a year , and The Really Bad Hire ( aka : we ’re being sued ) .
These are not screw - ups , these are fuck - ups .
When you discover them , the air leaves your lungs , the back of your head tingles , and there ’s an odd metallic taste in your mouth .
Your mind goes blank except for the crisp mental picture that is your fuck - up .
This initial discovery is shocking , but what I want to talk about is secondary discovery .
This is when your boss learns of the fuck - up , and you should n’t be worried whether there ’s an odd metallic taste in his mouth , you should worry about who he ’s about to turn into .
Management Transformations
Ideally , your boss is the levelheaded type and he ’ll manage your fuck - up cleanly and easily using his years of experience , but fuck - ups knock people off their game and out of their comfort zone .
Fuck - ups create stress and stress can mutate normally sane people into unrecognizable caricatures of themselves .
Let ’s talk about some of them .
The Interrogator
The Interrogator ’s approach is an endless stream of questions : “ When did the customer first call ? ” ; “ Who triaged the bug first ? ” ; “ What were the results ? ” ; “ How did we proceed from there ? ”
It goes on and on .
What ’s annoying about the Interrogator is that he actually only wants to ask one question — THE question — but he ’s putting you through the paces to build a sense of context .
This stream of questions will demonstrate the relevance of the one question .
The one question is the only question that matters , and when it shows up , it ’s time to start the meeting .
While you ’re being grilled , I want you to remember this :
The Interrogator is blowing off steam while asking the endless list of questions .
This process of question and answer is laborious , but with each piece of data you convey , you have an opportunity to paint a more detailed picture of your fuck - up and increase the chance he can help .
There are Interrogators who do n’t actually have one question that they ’re driving towards , and these managers need managing .
If you ’re 27 questions into your 1 - on - 1 with no clear direction , it ’s time to dig in your heels and ask , “ Hey , Boss , what are you really trying to figure out here ? ”
The Prioritizer and the Scheduler
These are two tightly coupled management reactions that share so much , I ’ve got to lump them together .
Meetings with both start with a complete inventory of the to - do list for your team .
They want to know everything that you ’re planning to do to resolve the fuck - up , and if this list does n’t exist or is n’t complete , you might as well reschedule the meeting , because there is no other way to satisfy either the Prioritizer or the Scheduler .
With that list in hand , the Prioritizer will now put you through the agonizing process of prioritizing every single task on the list .
If he ’s in a really bad mood , he ’s going to want to talk through your mental process of prioritization for each task .
And , if he ’s also the Scheduler , he ’s going to want dates .
For everything .
Unlike the Interrogator , there is no obvious point where you ’re going to understand , “ Oh , this is what he wants to know ” .
He wants to know everything .
Your fuck - up has him freaked out and his reaction to this is to gather as much data as possible .
Feels like micromanagement , right ?
It is .
More on this in a moment .
The Randomizer
The insane version of the Prioritizer / Scheduler is the Randomizer .
This is the manager who is going to swoop into the situation with good intentions , but he ’s mostly going to randomize the team with his endless good intentions .
The warning signs of the Randomizer are easy to recognize — his marching orders to address the fuck - up change every couple of hours .
You might not initially see this because the Randomizer is the boss .
His sense of passion and urgency is intoxicating because everyone wants to get to the other side of the fuck - up .
They want to succeed .
After the third drastic change to the plan of action , the team is going to start scratching their heads and thinking , How is running around bumping into shit actually helping us ?
You job as the minion of the Randomizer is to get back into the 1 - on - 1 , close the door , and see if you can summon the Prioritizer .
Your boss should be your strategic muse , not your tactical nightmare .
The Illuminator
The Illuminator is on the same mission as everyone we ’ve already talked about , but hes subtle about it .
You may not even know the Illuminator is in the room when you show up for your 1 - on - 1 . I love the Illuminator .
I love being the Illuminator .
See , you fucked up .
The Illuminator is n’t going to interrogate or prioritize you for an hour ; he is elegantly , calmly going to get you to realize the magnitude of the fuck up and also get you to suggest a reasonable course of action .
In fact , you ’ll be proud of yourself halfway through the meeting when you slap your forehead and say , “ Wow , this what happened and this is what we should do ! ”
The transcendent Illuminator experience is when you do n’t realize the Illuminator is gently mentally course correcting you and providing silent guidance .
The cherry on top is , even if you do see this management manipulation , you realize , “ Oh , he ’s trying to help . ”
The Enemy
On the opposite side of the spectrum of the Illuminator is The Enemy .
Like the Illuminator , the Enemy is n’t going to reveal his colors immediately , but unlike the Illuminator , he will not revel in silently providing guidance ; he loves going on the attack .
The Enemy is pissed .
The Enemy is angry about your fuck - up and The Enemy believes that dragging you through that anger is a useful learning experience .
Here ’s the terrifying reality regarding The Enemy : unlike all the other personalities I ’ve talked about , the Enemy is not on your side .
As long as your fuck - up did n’t involve breaking the law , your manager is part of your team , and even if he ’s furious with you , he should always be trying to lead and trying to help .
If The Enemy shows up , your fuck - up has now doubled in size .
You ’ve got a fuck - up and you ’ve got a manager who does n’t believe in you .
My hope is that The Enemy is a mood ; it ’s the peak fury of your manager ’s reaction to your fuck - up , and , fingers crossed , it should fade into a calmer personality .
Still , even when it does , you need to figure out why your manager does n’t trust you when he ’s freaking out ?
The M Word
Yes , everyone except the Illuminator is a micromanager , and while being micromanaged sucks see , you fucked up .
It ’d be great if your manager remained even keeled , but we humans are a squishy , moody bunch , and how we react when a fuck - up is thrown in our laps varies by the day .
Whether you ’re being interrogated , scheduled , or prioritized , you need to remember two things .
First , it ’s partially your job to figure out how to bring your calm , levelheaded boss back into the room .
As long as you ’re not dealing with The Enemy , each moody variant is looking for something and you need to deliver it .
Second , as you stare at this strange person who was your boss , you need to remember that people with more experience can teach you stuff , but you might need to wait for it .
While you wait , might I suggest a healthy dose of proactive fuck - up triage ?
Your boss should help , but success here will be taking active an role in understanding the full scope of your fuck - up , fixing it , and making sure it never happens again .

もうひとつ重要な点は、URLに直接的な個人情報や、セッションID等の個人情報にたどり着ける情報を含めるような実装は、Google Analyricsがある限りは絶対にやってはならない手法になったということです。

Researchers from the University of Delaware and the University of California at Riverside have thawed ice estimated to be at least a million years old from above Lake Vostok , an ancient lake that lies hidden more than two miles beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica .
The scientists will now examine the eons - old water for microorganisms , and then through novel genomic techniques , try to figure out how these tiny , living “ time capsules ” survived the ages in total darkness , in freezing cold and without food and energy from the sun .
The research is designed to provide insight into how organisms adapted to live in extreme environments .
“ It 's some of the coolest stuff I have ever worked on , ” said Craig Cary , professor of marine biosciences at UD .
“ We are going to gain access to the genetics of organisms isolated for possibly as long as 15 million years . ”
The collaborative research team includes Cary and doctoral student Julie Smith from UD 's College of Marine and Earth Studies ; project leader Brian Lanoil , assistant professor of environmental sciences at the University of California at Riverside , and doctoral student James Gosses ; and Philip Hugenholtz and postdoctoral fellows Victor Kunin and Brian Rabkin at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Joint Genome Institute .
Last week in Lanoil 's laboratory in California , segments of a tube - like ice core were thawed under meticulous , “ clean lab ” conditions to prevent accidental contamination , a process that required nearly a year of preparation .

“ It was very exciting to see the Vostok ice , knowing how old it is and how much it took to get that ice to the lab , ” Smith said .
“ The ice core itself was incredibly clear and glasslike , reflecting the light like a prism . ”
The segments of ice were cut from an 11,866 - foot ice core drilled in 1998 through a joint effort involving Russia , France and the United States .
The core was taken from approximately two miles below the surface of Antarctica and 656 feet ( 200 meters ) above the surface of Lake Vostok and has since been stored at - 35 degrees C at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver .
“ This ice was once water in the lake that refroze onto the bottom of the ice sheet , ” Cary explained .
“ We have no direct samples of the lake itself , only this indirect sampling of the refrozen ice above it because drilling into the lake without taking extensive precautions could lead to the lake 's contamination .
The borehole made to collect the ice is filled with a mixture of jet fuel , kerosene , and CFCs to keep it from closing , ” Cary noted .
“ Since the lake has not had direct contact with the surface world for at least 15 million years , this would be a contamination of one of the most pristine environments on Earth , ” he said .
Cary said the decontamination procedure was “ the most complicated and complete ever attempted , ” requiring the use of an isolation chamber for the actual melting , concentration of the meltwater through a special filtering system , use of bleaching solutions for the destruction of any contaminating bacteria or DNA from the outside of the core , and the wearing of sterile jump suits for all of the laboratory personnel , among other measures .
Although other scientific projects have identified the microorganisms living in the Vostok water , they have not revealed what these little one - celled organisms do or how they have become adapted to an environment that is eternally dark , cold and so isolated that food and energy sources are likely rare and hard to come by .

“ This research is important because it will give us insight into how microbes can survive in a very energy - limited system , ” Smith said .
She intends to pursue a career in academia after she completes her doctorate at UD's College of Marine and Earth Studies .
“ Most of our planet is permanently cold and dark , so it makes sense that we should study how life exists under these conditions .
In addition , enzymes produced by these microorganisms may be useful in industrial applications down the road , ” Smith noted .
The Vostok water contains only between 10 - 100 microbes per milliliter compared to approximately 1 million microbes per milliliter for most lakes , Cary said .
Novel “ whole genome amplification ” techniques will be applied , which provide insight into the genetic diversity of a community of organisms when only small numbers of organisms are available .
A veteran of research expeditions around the globe , Cary is an expert on “ extremophiles ” -- organisms that thrive in the harshest environments on the planet , ranging from the dry , frigid desert of Antarctica , to geyser - like hydrothermal vents spewing toxic chemicals from the ocean floor .
In the case of Lake Vostok , scientists speculate that it stays in a liquid state underneath miles of ice due to one of the Earth 's natural “ furnaces ” -- hydrothermal vents .
Superheated water erupts from these cracks in the seafloor which form where the plates that form the Earth 's crust pull apart .
“ We hope that by being so isolated for millions of years , these microorganisms from Vostok will be able to tell us about their life and conditions through the ages , ” Cary said .
This research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and is part of the International Polar Year .
This past August , the fatal shooting of six Italian men exiting a restaurant in Duisburg , Germany , informed the world of what Italian authorities already knew : Italy 's ' Ndrangheta crime syndicate had come of age as an international force .
The Cosa Nostra , Italy 's Sicilian mafia , used to be the country 's most notorious and feared organization .
But the capture this week of Salvatore Lo Piccolo showed how far they have fallen :
For the second time in less than two years , their top boss was arrested .
As the Cosa Nostra wilted under the focused efforts of Italy 's antimafia forces , however , the ' Ndrangheta quietly flourished .
But after the assassination of a politician in the ' Ndrangheta 's home province in 2005 , the government vowed to crack down on the syndicate .
An antimafia youth group – Ammazzateci Tutti – also rose up , vowing to hold the government to its promise .
" It was a mistake , because the state should investigate all criminal organizations , " says Giuseppe Lumia , vice president of Italy 's antimafia parliamentary commission .
" If we were to use a sports metaphor , the state is recuperating , is training with its best players , but has not yet formed a team that is able to win the championship . "
Europe 's biggest cocaine player
Based in Calabria , the southernmost province of Italy 's mainland , the ' Ndrangheta was once largely limited to shaking down small - town merchants and kidnapping for ransom .
Today , the ' Ndrangheta has formed close ties with Colombia 's Medellin drug cartel and become the biggest player in Europe 's cocaine market , says Alberto Cisterna , a magistrate with Italy 's National Antimafia Directorate in Rome .
Italian officials and experts estimate that 80 percent of Europe 's imports come through the Calabrian port of Gioia Touro , which local police say is controlled by the syndicate .
Prosecutors estimate that the ' Ndrangheta 's operation generates ¤ 36 billion ( $ 52 billion ) a year in revenues .
According to a 2005 report by the Italian social research institute Eurispes , drug trafficking accounted for ¤ 22.3 billion , with extortion , arms trafficking , and loan sharking also bringing substantial revenues .
The syndicate has used its proceeds to invest in northern Italy and the rest of Europe , says Nicola Gratteri , Calabria 's senior magistrate , who has battled the ' Ndrangheta for nearly 20 years – doing everything from ordering wiretaps to prosecuting court cases .
The Italian and German press , including Panorama and Stern magazines , have reported money - laundering schemes by the ' Ndrangheta across Europe .
According to a report presented by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's office in August , the syndicate has " a sizable presence " in Germany , France , Belgium , the Netherlands , the Balkans , Eastern Europe , and South America .
Virtually impervious family ties
With members recruited on the basis of family ties , the ' Ndrangheta is virtually impervious to police infiltration .
" Every locali , or cell , is composed of people who belong to family , and this is why there are no justice collaborators , " says Mr. Gratteri , adding that only 42 turncoats have come from the ' Ndrangheta , compared with 700 to 1,000 from the Cosa Nostra and 2,000 from the Camorra .
Yet the ' Ndrangheta 's clans can be quarrelsome – with fatal results .
The killings in Duisburg last summer are rooted in such an internecine dispute , says Mr. Gratteri , who is overseeing the investigation into the origins of the attack .
One of the men shot in Duisburg , Marco Marmo , was wanted by authorities for involvement in the December 2006 murder of an the ' Ndrangheta leader 's wife in the Calabrian village of San Luca .
Gratteri refused to discuss the details of the investigation under way , but the Italian press has speculated that Marmo was the reason an ' Ndrangheta clan executed the Duisburg attack .
Mr. Lumia of Italy 's antimafia parliamentary commission says this conflict " has become a clash for financial and territorial control of San Luca ... [ which ] becomes control on an international level . "
In order to bring down the ' Ndrangheta , Gratteri contends , new legislation is needed .
" We have no laws that are proportional to the force of the ' Ndrangheta , " he says , explaining that well - behaved convicts can leave prison after five years .
" I would like ... [ them ] not to be released before 30 years . "
Youths ' challenge to Italy : rise up
For magistrates battling the ' Ndrangheta , a welcome ally has been Ammazzateci Tutti – formed two years ago by fed - up young people .
" The ' Ndrangheta is an octopus which tries to control everything and to kill all of the fish , " says Bruno Marino , a student whose father was killed by the group .
Since its founding , Ammazzateci Tutti has held regular demonstrations designed to pressure the Italian state into taking action against the ' Ndrangheta .
Last February , a protest in Reggio di Calabria drew thousands into the streets .
In recent weeks , the group has staged regular protests against the government 's pending transfer of Luigi De Magistris , an antimafia magistrate investigating links between politicians and the ' Ndrangheta .
" The ' Ndrangheta ... is infiltrating the political system , " says Aldo Pecora , a law student and spokesman for Ammazzateci Tutti , whose taunting title means , " Now Kill Us All . "
" Ammazzateci Tutti is a message that expresses both hope and challenge to the ' Ndrangheta , saying ' See if you have enough lead to kill us all , ' " explains Mr. Pecora .
" It 's also a challenge to normal people to rebel against the the ' Ndrangheta . "
Pecora says the group continues to form chapters across both Calabria and throughout Italy , their message spreading via the Internet , which he credits with helping them to become a national organization .
Still , he concedes that they do n't yet pose a serious threat to the ' Ndrangheta , but are rather " bothering " those who want to control Calabria .
He hopes to one day become an antimafia magistrate , and says he 's put Ammazzateci Tutti " before everything , before my family and my studies , because I am not wasting time .
I am doing something for my children , if I ever have any .
There is nothing to lose and only the future to gain . "
Trent Lott Resigning
James Joyner · · 18 comments
Trent Lott is resigning mid-term , reportedly in order to get out ahead of more restrictive ethics laws .
MSNBC :
NBC News has learned that Sen. Trent Lott , R - Miss. , the minority whip is in the midst of informing close allies that he plans to resign his senate seat before the end of the year .
It ’s possible a formal announcement of his plans could take place as early as today .
Lott ’s office initially denied that he he would step down , but subsequent requests for information about his plans went unanswered .
While the exactly reason Lott is stepping down before he finishes his term is unknown , the general speculation is that a quick departure immunizes
Lott against tougher restrictions in a new lobbying law that takes effect at the end of the year .
That law would require Senators to wait two - years before entering the lucrative world of lobbying Congress .
Martin Kady II and Josh Kraushaar for The Politico :
The announcement took Capitol Hill by surprise because Lott , the former majority leader , seemed to be relishing his job as minority whip , the second - ranking GOP leadership job .
He had regained a post in leadership after he resigned following racially insensitive remarks at a birthday party for the late Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R - S.C. ) .
Lott ’s departure opens up a position within Republican leadership , and there could be a fight to replace him .
Lamar Alexander , who ran for the position last year , would be a natural candidate , but there are plenty of GOP up - and - comers who could compete for the slot , including Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , and Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , who are part of the current leadership team and could be looking for a promotion to the no .
2 spot in the hierarchy .
Lott would become the sixth Republican senator to announce plans to step down this election cycle .
His term expires in 2012 ; and a resignation would prompt a special election to fill the remainder of his term . [… ]
A Republican adviser close to Lott said : “ He ’s ready to move on .
It ’s that simple .
He only stayed to help through the Hurricane Katrina recovery , and Mississippi is doing well . ”
Lott lost a beloved house in the hurricane .
AP ’s Jack Elliot :
No reason for Lott ’s resignation was given , but according to a congressional official , there is nothing amiss with Lott ’s health .
The senator has “ other opportunities ” he plans to pursue , the official said , without elaborating .
Lott was re-elected to a fourth Senate term in 2006 .
One hopes that Lott ’s health is indeed fine .
Resigning in order to pursue a career as a lobbyist , though , would further tarnish his public image .
Elections are expensive , wrenching events and create an obligation to serve out the term .
It ’s considered kosher to leave early to pursue higher elective office , since it ostensibly allows the candidate to better serve his constituents , but doing so for private financial gain is rather unseemly .
Via Memeorandum , which is quickly collecting other blogger reactions .
Female Sexual Abusers : A Theory of Loss
Hollida Wakefield , Martha Rogers , and Ralph Underwager1
ABSTRACT : Awareness about female sexual abuse perpetrators has increased in recent years .
However , some of the recent literature is likely to have included cases of false accusations which gives a misleading picture of the frequency of female sexual abuse and the characteristics of such women .
There is a great range in the estimated frequency from different studies and the definition of sexual abuse , sample selected , and methodology must be considered .
Taken as a whole , the literature indicates that although most sexual abusers are males , child sexual abuse by females does occur and is probably less rare than was once believed .
There are widely different circumstances in which women sexually abuse children and these circumstances may often differ from those causing men to do so .
Many studies depict female abusers as socially isolated , loners , alienated , coming from abusive backgrounds , and having emotional problems , although most are not psychotic .
A theory of loss as one circumstance underlying female sexual abuse is described and four case studies are discussed in detail .
Recently , however , there has been much more discussion of women as possible perpetrators of child sexual abuse .
Some researchers suggest it is not as rare as previously assumed .
However , there is still considerable disagreement and confusion about just how frequently women sexually abuse children , what type of women , and under what circumstances .
In reviewing information on women as perpetrators , Finkelhor and Russell ( 1984 ) note that some studies indicating that women sexually abuse children more frequently than has been believed contain definitional problems which inflate the statistics .
For example , the National Incidence Study figures suggest that almost half of the sexual experiences of children included a female perpetrator .
However , according to the study definitions , a caretaker could be a perpetrator if she " permitted acts of sexual contact to occur . "
If a mother neglected a child while a father sexually abused the child , the mother would be listed as a sexual abuse perpetrator .
Also , a mother could be listed as an active perpetrator if she failed to adequately supervise the child 's voluntary sexual activities .
When the data were reanalyzed to exclude these types of cases , the figures indicated 14 % of perpetrators against boys and 6 % of perpetrators against girls were females acting alone .
Self - report studies are another source of information .
Finkelhor and Russell ( 1984 ) report that such studies indicate sexual contact between children and older women is a distinct minority of child - adult sexual contacts .
They conclude that " The data collated from a variety of studies seem to support clearly the presumption that most sexual offenses against children are perpetrated by males " ( p.177 ) .
They believe the best estimates put female perpetrators of sexual abuse at about 20 % for male children and 5 % for female children .
They note , despite ample opportunities for sexual abuse , remarkably few mothers seem to take advantage of them and conclude that the literature " leads fairly persuasively to the conclusion that the traditional view about child molestation as a primarily male deviation is essentially correct .
Women do not use children for their own direct sexual gratification very frequently " ( p.181 ) .
Since writing this , Finkelhor , along with others , has reported greater frequencies of females as sexual abusers .
However , some of the more recent literature purporting to show higher frequencies of female sexual abusers are based on suspicious data .
For example , Finkelhor , Williams , and Burns ( 1988 ) , in a national study of 270 day care cases , report that 40 % of the perpetrators were women .
These women tended to be intelligent , educated , highly regarded in their communities , and not likely to have a history of known deviant behavior .
Many of these apparently normal women were alleged to have engaged in extremely deviant , low frequency behavior , including oral - genital penetration , urolagia and coprophagia , and ritualistic , mass abuse .
However , although the authors required the abuse to be " substantiated , " their definition of substantiation was if any one of the agencies believed that abuse was real , despite whoever else may have thought it was false ( Coleman , 1989 ) .
This comes down to the decision of one person to substantiate an allegation , " ... we included the case if the investigator had labeled the case ' substantiated ' ... " ( Finkelhor et al. , 1988 , p.14 ) .
Therefore , their sample includes an unknown number of cases which ended in dismissals or acquittals , or the cases had not yet been tried , of which the McMartin case is only the most publicized example .
They say " our way of defining substantiation is only a way of approximating the truth ...
Whenever we refer to cases , the reader should not automatically assume that we , or anybody else , knows with absolute certainty that these are cases of abuse rather than mistaken allegations " ( p.14 -16 ) .
No conclusions whatsoever can be drawn about the characteristics of perpetrators from studies with such a flawed and questionable criterion measure .
The Finkelhor et al. ( 1988 ) book is the most obvious example of the problem of cases of false accusations knowingly included in the sample .
In defending their choice they claim there is no reason to believe investigators err on one side or the other ( p.16 ) .
Given the extensive theoretical discussion and empirical research on the cognitive activity of the clinician , the research on the reliability of diagnosis , the wide and broad research on decision theory , the more than forty years of research on clinical versus statistical decisions with not a single study supporting confidence in clinical observations and judgment , and the failure of research to demonstrate any efficacy to clinical experience , this is a surprising claim ( Dawes , Faust , & Meehl , 1989 ; Faust , 1989 ; Dawes , 1988 ; Dawes , 1989 ; Meehl , 1959 ; Meehl , 1989 ; Meehl , 1990 ) .
It can only be the result of ignorance or a deliberate choice to obscure and obfuscate the issues .
In other instances researchers may have inadvertently included falsely accused persons in their sample .
However , the possibility of women wrongfully convicted or falsely accused must always be considered when reviewing the recent literature on female perpetrators .
Allen ( 1990 ) claims that women may be perpetrators more often than is realized and believes that there are several barriers preventing the recognition of female child sexual abuse .
The first barrier suggested is an overestimation of the strength of the incest taboo , in which the taboo was thought to be so strong that sexual abuse by women was an extremely rare aberration .
When it occurred , it was seen as evidence that the woman was seriously impaired .
A possible second barrier to recognition has been an overextension of feminist explanations of child sexual abuse .
Here , child sexual abuse is considered to be a direct result of culturally - based socialization which leads to male dominance and subsequent exploitation of women and children .
The third proposed barrier is the overgeneralization of the empirical observation that female - perpetrated child sexual abuse is rare .
That is , the frequency of reports in the literature may not accurately reflect the frequency of its actual occurrence .
Allen notes that even if there are far fewer female than male perpetrators , there may still be a significant number of females who abuse children .
Allen concludes by recommending the strategy suggested by Bolton and Bolton ( 1987 ) :
Awareness of female sexual abuse perpetration is increasing ....
It seems wise to withhold judgment about such cases until more is known ( p. 146 ) .
Banning ( 1989 ) also believes that the incidence of child sexual abuse by women is underestimated .
She notes that the feminists view child sexual abuse as a crime committed against girls by men and until recently mother - child incest was considered to be virtually nonexistent .
She claims that female sexual abuse is not recognized because of the disbelief that this can occur .
In addition , women are permitted a freer range of sexual contact with their children through caregiving activities and sexually abusive behavior may be more difficult to recognize .
Although more recent studies have shown a higher incidence of female perpetrators , there has been little research on them and their psychopathology may be different from that of male perpetrators .
Banning believes , however , that the incidence of female sexual offenders will probably remain much lower than that of males .
Faller ( 1989 ) reports on a clinical sample of 87 boy victims and 226 girl victims of validated sexual abuse .
The female victims were more likely than male victims to be sexually abused by a man .
Neither boys nor girls were very likely to be victimized by a woman alone , but this happened with boys ten times more often than with girls .
Of the 87 boys , 55 ( 63.1 % ) were victimized by a man alone , 7 ( 8 % ) were victimized by a woman alone , and 25 ( 28.7 % ) were victimized by both females and males together .
Faller reports that the largest category of offenders was professionals , including day care workers .
In this study , the validation criteria was primarily the child 's statements and a clinical interview , although other evidence such as perpetrator confession , witnesses , and medical findings were also relied upon when present .
Therefore , this sample may include an unknown number of false accusations .
The fact that Faller reports the largest category of offenders was professionals , including day care workers , suggests this study may have similar difficulties to the Finkelhor , Williams and Burns ( 1988 ) day care study discussed earlier .
Risin and Koss ( 1987 ) surveyed 2972 male college students and found that 216 ( 7.3 % ) met one of their three criteria for sexual abuse ( age discrepancy between child and perpetrator , use of coercion , or perpetrator who was a care giver or authority figure ) .
Their definition was very broad , and included some consensual activities with adolescent females .
The abusive behaviors ranged from exhibition to penetration .
Risen and Koss report that there were almost as many female perpetrators ( 42.7 % ) as male ( 53.3 % ) , with a small proportion involving both a male and a female together ( 4.2 % ) .
Almost half of the females perpetrators were adolescent babysitters .
Almost half of the boys involved with female perpetrators reported that they participated in the incidents voluntarily and did not feel victimized .
The authors note that this suggests qualitatively different experiences were tapped in this study compared to other surveys .
The need to consider how sexual abuse is defined , particularly in studies of male victims , is emphasized by Fromuth and Burkhart ( 1987 ) .
They surveyed 582 men from two colleges and found that , depending upon the definition of childhood sexual abuse , prevalence rates varied from 4 % to 24 % being defined as " abused . "
The majority of the perpetrators of sexual abuse were females .
They also found that , compared to women in college survey studies , men are less likely to perceive childhood sexual experiences as abusive .
This is consistent with the Risen and Koss ( 1987 ) survey .
It may be that women perceive such experiences as sexual violation , while men perceive them as sexual initiation .
Male socialization encourages men to define sexual experiences as desirable as long as there is no homosexual involvement .
The differences in rates obtained among different studies is likely to be due to the different definitional and methodological framing of the research questions .
Fromuth and Burkhart emphasize the importance of considering how abuse was defined and the sample selected when studying male sexual abuse victims .
The necessity of considering differences in the type of sample and research method is demonstrated by contrasting these results to those reported by Reinhart ( 1987 ) , who found that only 4 % of 189 boy victims were alleged to be abused by females , and Farber , Showers , Johnson , Joseph , and Oshins ( 1984 ) , who reported that only 2 % of 162 children ( half boys and half girls ) were sexually abused by a female acting alone ( 6 % were abused by both a male and a female ) .
Both Reinhart and Farber et al. used clinical as opposed to college samples , and their studies were of current cases in a hospital as opposed to a retrospective survey .
Neither are clear as to how the abuse was substantiated .
A still smaller percentage of female perpetrators was found by Rowan , Rowan , and Langelier ( 1990 ) , who report that only 9 ( 1.5 % ) of 600 sex offenders referred for evaluations were females .
This study , however , was on sex offenders rather than on victims .
The previous studies focused on victims .
The necessity of specifying the sample and methodology before drawing conclusions is also shown by contrasting the Fromuth and Burkhart and the Risen and Koss retrospective surveys of college males to a report by Johnson and Shrier ( 1987 ) on eleven cases of molestation in a community - based sample of adolescent male outpatients .
Eight of these boys experienced the molestation as intensely traumatic .
The female molesters were usually acquaintances of the victims  most often a neighbor , baby sitter , or other trusted older adolescent or young adult .
All but one of the female molesters used persuasion rather than physical force or threats and three - quarters of the female molesters attempted to get their victims to ejaculate , and nearly half succeeded .
Johnson and Shrier therefore conclude that childhood sexual victimization of boys by women as well as men is a high - risk and traumatic experience .
In contrast , the two college surveys indicate that many men did not feel victimized by the experience .
Bolton , Morris , and MacEachron ( 1989 ) conclude that male perpetrators " far exceed " female perpetrators of child sexual abuse .
They observe , however , that the interest in studying female offenders has increased markedly in the past few years .
They note that no matter how the differing rates found in the various studies are explained , the fact remains that females are sometimes perpetrators .
In summary , the different studies report widely varied frequencies of sexual abuse by women .
The definition of sexual abuse used , the type of sample selected , and the methodology employed affects the results obtained .
Although child sexual abuse by females may not be as rare as was once believed , it does occur .
However , some of the recent studies may be inadvertently including cases of false allegations , which adds to the confusion .
Characteristics of Female Sexual Abuse Perpetrators
What are the circumstances under which women sexually abuse children ?
What are the characteristics of such women ?
Are the etiological factors similar to those in male perpetrated sexual abuse ?
There are beginning to be studies which address these questions .
Many of these are based on small samples and case studies .
Although any generalizations from such reports must be made cautiously , this information provides a necessary starting point in understanding female sexual abuse perpetrators .
Mathews , Matthews , and Speltz ( 1987 ) and Patton ( 1987 ) , report on a study of 16 female sexual offenders who were in the Genesis II treatment project in Minnesota .
All but one of the women studied were themselves victims of childhood sexual abuse and many were also victims of physical abuse .
There were strong and consistent patterns of childhood social isolation , alienation , and lack of development of interpersonal skills and competence among perpetrators .
Three categories of female sex offenders were described : Teacher / Lover , Predisposed ( intergenerational ) , and Male - Coerced .
The Teacher / Lover is generally involved with prepubescent and adolescent males with whom she relates as a peer .
Her motive is , ostensibly , to teach her young victims about sexuality .
The Predisposed offender is usually a victim of severe sexual abuse that was initiated at a very young age and persisted over a long period of time .
She initiated the sexual abuse herself and the victims are her own children .
Her motives are nonthreatening emotional intimacy .
The Male - Coerced offender acts initially in conjunction with a male who has previously abused children .
She exhibits a pattern of extreme dependency and nonassertive behavior , and she may eventually initiate sexual abuse herself .
Her victims are children both within and outside of the family .
Faller ( 1987 ) reports on a clinical sample of 40 women who were judged by staff to have sexually abused at least 63 children .
These women represented 14 % of the total of 289 perpetrators of sexual abuse .
Many of the women had significant difficulties in psychological and social functioning .
About half had mental problems , both retardation and psychotic illness .
More than half had chemical dependency problems , and close to three - fourths had maltreated their victims in other ways in addition to the sexual abuse .
The women fell into five case types ( four were sexually abusive in more than one context ) .
1. Polyincestuous abuse .
Twenty - nine ( 72.5 % ) of the women fit into this category .
In such cases , there are at least two perpetrators and generally two or more victims .
Usually , a male rather than the female offender instigated the abuse .
The woman went along with the male and played a secondary role .
2. Single - parent abuse .
Six ( 15 % ) of the women who sexually abused were single parents .
These mothers did not have ongoing relationships with men and the oldest child seemed to serve as a surrogate partner for the mother , often having adult role responsibilities .
3. Psychotic abusers .
Only three ( 7.5 % ) of the women were classified as psychotic at the time of the sexual abuse .
Therefore , this study does not support the clinical assumption that most female perpetrators are highly disturbed and often psychotic at the time of the sexual abuse .
4. Adolescent perpetrators .
Three ( 7.5 % ) were adolescent girls who had difficulty with peer relationships and lacked alternative sexual outlets .
5. Noncustodial abusers .
There was only one woman who was the noncustodial mother of her victims and sexually abused them during visitation .
Faller believes that in such cases the noncustodial parent is apt to be devastated at the loss of her spouse and the children become the source of emotional gratification .
Faller concludes that the circumstances that lead women to sexually abuse children can be differentiated from those causing men to do so .
McCarty ( 1986 ) describes the characteristics of 26 mother - child incest offenders .
These women were identified by the Dallas Incest Treatment Program over a three - year period and constituted 4 % of the offender population .
The cases had been validated by a protective service investigation .
Nine of the mothers were co-offenders with a male partner , while 12 were independent offenders ( a male offender was also involved in half of these ) .
All but two of the women described their childhood as difficult and abusive .
When the mother was a co-offender , her dependency on her spouse was the major contributing factor .
Half of these women were of borderline intelligence .
The independent offenders in particular were characterized as experiencing themselves psychologically as loners and lacking any sense of attachment or belonging .
They were likely to have married as teenagers .
Half were characterized as seriously emotionally disturbed and almost half had a serious chemical abuse problem .
However , all were at least of average intelligence .
In three of the cases of mother - son incest , the father was out of the home and the mothers seemed to treat the boys as age mates .
However , the women who abused daughters seemed to treat the daughters as extensions of themselves .
Vander Mey ( 1988 ) reviews the research on sexually abused boys and reports that there is so little information on sexual abuse of males that findings must be considered tenuous .
She tentatively posits that male incest victims are abused more often by males than by females and that both mother and father incest perpetrators tend to have emotional , social , and psychological problems compounded by poor impulse control , low self - esteem , and alcohol abuse .
Finkelhor ( Finkelhor , 1984 ; Araji & Finkelhor , 1986 ) suggests that there are four components that contribute , in different degrees and forms , to the making of a child molester .
These four components present complementary processes which help explain the diversity of the behavior of sexual abusers .
These four factors are sexual arousal , emotional congruence , blockage , and disinhibition :
Sexual arousal :
In order for an adult to be aroused by a child , there has to have been cultural or familial conditioning to sexual activity with children or early fantasy reinforced by masturbation .
Emotional congruence :
For emotional congruence , there is comfort in relating to a child and satisfaction of emotional need through the abuse .
This is apt to be due to arrested development through limited intelligence , immaturity , or low self - esteem .
Blockage :
Age appropriate sexual opportunities may be blocked by bad experiences with age appropriate adults , sexual dysfunction , limited social skills , or marital disturbance .
Disinhibition .
The abuser may lose control through impulse control deficits , psychosis , alcohol , drugs , stress , or nonexistent family rules .
Finkelhor believes that examination of these factors can help explain why sexual abusers are predominately male .
Rowan , Rowan , and Langelier ( 1990 ) examined 600 sex offender evaluations in New Hampshire and Vermont and found that in only nine ( 1.5 % ) was the perpetrator a woman .
These nine cases are discussed in terms of Finkelhor 's ( 1984 ) four - factor model .
In five of the cases , the abuse occurred in conjunction with a dominant male partner ; in four the woman acted independently .
The case histories of several of the women showed a history of childhood abuse and all had serious psychological problems or limited intelligence .
The four women who acted independently abused boys .
Of the five who acted in conjunction with a male , three had female victims , one a male victim , and one victimized both a son and a daughter .
The authors conclude that none of these cases were true paraphilics according to the DSM - llI - R but that the female molesters did fit the model proposed by Finkelhor .
James and Nasjleti ( 1983 ) , in reporting on their clinical experience with sexually abusive families , report that a minority of their cases involved female perpetrators .
Although the psychological profiles of these mothers is sketchy , in general they have infantile and extreme dependency needs , a marriage relationship that is absent or emotionally empty , possessive and overprotective attitudes toward child victims , and alcohol used as a crutch .
These women expect their children to meet their emotional needs and because of the mothers ' traditional rule as a caretaker , they are able to hide the sexually explosive nature of these contacts .
Chasnoff , Burns , Schnoll , Burns , Chisum , and Kyle - Sproe ( 1986 ) report on three cases of sexual abuse by a mother of her infant .
The mothers all were separated from their sexual partners , had demonstrated some confusion regarding sexual identity , and had sought assistance with chemical dependency during pregnancy .
Two of the three were diagnosed as borderline personality disorder and two had been raped .
All three women were isolated in their living arrangements and the authors believe that the sexual abuse was motivated by loneliness .
The social alienation and isolation of the mothers were significant facts in the molestation of their infants .
Goodwin and DiVasto ( 1989 ) review six reported cases of mother - daughter incest and two cases of grandmother - granddaughter incest .
These cases deviate from the usual descriptions of incest and the authors note that physical closeness between mothers and daughters is less subject to taboo than are father and daughter contacts .
The greater toleration of physical intimacy between mothers and daughters makes it more difficult for the child , the parent , and eventually the therapist to recognize when these contacts become incestuous .
Although Goodwin and DiVasto acknowledge that since the reports of mother - daughter incest are few and brief , any conclusions must be tentative , they find that the mothers seem to be similar to those mothers who initiate mother - son incest .
They describe the mothers as aggressive women who have abandoned their maternal role for an exploitive relationship with their children .
Their need for nurturance precipitates a sexual relationship with the child .
In all five cases of mother - daughter incest , the mothers were involved in deteriorating marriages .
Goodwin and DiVasto believe that mother - daughter incest is more common than the rare case reports suggest .
Kempe and Kempe ( 1984 ) suggest that with the high divorce rate , an increasing number of boys are living alone with their mothers and become a source of comfort and closeness which may sometimes substitute for the companionship previously experienced in marriage .
Although this in itself is normal , it can lead to problem behaviors , such as taking the boy to bed for comfort .
Kempe and Kempe note that society is more ready to believe that there is a sexual aspect to fathers who sleep with daughters compared to mothers who sleep with sons .
They describe two case studies in which sleeping arrangements also included overt sexual behavior and state that in their experience , the psychological effects to the boy can be devastating .
Krug ( 1989 ) reports on eight case histories of men who were sexually abused by their mothers as children in which seven of the mothers slept with their sons regularly until the boys were teenagers .
The mothers , who were either divorced or had troubled marriages , appeared to be trying to satisfy emotional and relational needs through their sons .
Some were clearly socially insecure and isolated .
In four of the cases , the mothers initiated actual sexual contact , in the others there was no overt sexual behavior .
None of these mothers were described as psychotic .
Although these case studies are interesting , we question Krug 's classifying all of them as sexual abuse .
The behaviors of the mothers sleeping with their sons into adolescence may be inappropriate and infantilizes the boys , but to label all such cases as sexual abuse is to use a very inclusive definition of sexual abuse .
Krug reports that all these men had psychological and adjustment problems .
However , since this was a clinical sample we would expect the men to report emotional and adjustment problems in that this is why they sought therapy .
In an early article describing different types of incest , Lukianowicz ( 1972 ) discusses five cases of female perpetrators  three mother - son and two aunt - nephew .
In one case of mother - son incest , the mother was a widow , and in a second , the mother 's married life was very unhappy .
Both of these women became very dependent on their eldest sons , in whom they saw the idealized young lovers of their own youth .
The third mother was a chronic schizophrenic of low intelligence .
One of the aunts was hypomanic and seduced her nephew during a manic phase ; the other was generally promiscuous .
Lukianowicz reports that in in many of the cases studied , social isolation was a very important etiological factor .
O'Connor ( 1987 ) reports on a group of 62 convicted and imprisoned female sex offenders in Great Britain .
In 39 ( 63 % ) of the sex offenses with individual victims ; the victims were children and in 9 cases the offender was the mother or stepmother .
In most ( 25 ) of the cases the women were convicted of aiding and abetting a male offender .
Almost half of the women convicted of child sexual abuse had a previous history of psychiatric disorder .
Sexual gratification was never noted as a motivation for the women involved in sex offenses with a victim .
Conclusions from Literature
Several conclusions can be drawn from the review of the literature on female perpetrators .
1. Awareness about women perpetrators of sexual abuse use has greatly increased in recent years .
However , sexual contact between children and women is a minority of child - adult sexual contacts and the traditional view of child sexual abuse as a primarily male problem is correct .
2 . However , child sexual abuse by females does occur and is probably not as rare as the earlier literature indicates .
3 . There is a great range in the estimated frequency of sexual abuse by women from different studies and the definition of sexual abuse used , sample selected , and methodology employed must be considered .
4 . Some of the recent literature which discusses female perpetrators is likely to have included cases of false accusations which gives a misleading picture of both the frequency with which females abuse children and the characteristics of such women .
5 . Female child sexual abusers are less likely than men to fit the psychiatric definition of " pedophile . "
6 . There are widely different circumstances in which females may engage in behavior that is defined as " child sexual abuse " and the circumstances that lead women to sexually abuse children can often be differentiated from those causing men to do so .
One example of this is sexual abuse which occurs in conjunction with a dominate male and in which the woman plays a secondary role .
Another is found by the retrospective surveys of college men in which many of the boys reported that they had engaged in the incidents voluntarily and did not feel victimized .
7 . Many studies depict women who sexually abuse children as being loners , socially isolated , alienated , likely to have had abusive childhoods , and apt to have emotional problems .
However , most are not psychotic .
A Theory of Loss
Based upon our experience of evaluating and treating women who have sexually abused children we suggest an additional theoretical construct that may account for some of the instances of actual sexual abuse by women .
This suggested conceptualization is based upon a case study approach .
The methodology of single case study material can be used in the beginning stages of a research effort .
Case studies can provide a basis for the development of theory and hypotheses which can then be subjected to a controlled experimental approach ( Fantuzzo & Twentyman , 1986 ; Plotkin , Azar , Twentyman , & Perri , 1981 ) .
The following case studies are specific instances in which we propose that a significant loss experienced by the women created a vulnerability and a readiness to become involved in sexual abuse of a child .
One type of perpetrator we have observed is a woman who has a history of losses in her background along with a lack of healthy , secure childhood relationships .
The woman is not psychotic but is apt to be insecure and emotionally isolated .
The sexually abusive behavior is triggered by a particular loss and the relationship between the female perpetrator and the victim is emotional as well as sexual and appears to be engaged in primarily to satisfy the woman 's emotional needs .
While there is no empirical research data yet available to support this hypothesis , there are a number of studies that demonstrate a relationship between mothers ' experience of stress and a heightened risk or potential for child abuse .
Holden , Kosisky , Willis , and Foltz ( 1990 ) report significantly higher scores on the Child Abuse Potential instrument and higher levels of stress on the Parent Stress Index for mothers who were in a treatment program for maltreating children .
Nicholas and Bieber ( 1990 ) found that male and female college students who gave retrospective accounts of sexual abuse reported higher sexual abuse by fathers than by mothers but no other significant effects .
However , mothers were reported acting more overprotective than fathers .
Santrock , Warshak , and Elliott ( 1982 ) suggest the possibility that in divorces a child of the opposite sex may become a substitute for the now absent spouse .
This could lead to a smothering , overly nurturant relationship that may elide into emotional or sexual abuse .
These authors also suggest from their observations of child - stepmother interactions that a remarriage of a biological father and the advent of a stepmother is more difficult and conflicted for boys than for girls .
These studies are representative of the many efforts to locate regularities in the interactions between parents and children and the occurrence of abuse .
This body of research literature suggests that stress is an important factor in the experience of mothers who are maltreating children and that stressful life experience may precipitate abusive relationships .
Loss is a stressor event ( Dohrenwend & Shrout , 1985 ) .
Under the impact of a significant emotional loss , a woman may be more needy , less controlled , and more responsive to a relationship which can be misperceived as affectionate and positive .
Given environmental stimuli , opportunity , and availability of a child , a woman may progress in a gradual step by step movement into a full blown sexual exploitation of a child .

Case # 4 - Ellen
Discussions and Conclusions :
Sexual psychopathology , whether seen in men or women , may be seen in the context of object relations theories .
( See Scharff [ 1982 , 1990 ] for a comprehensive treatment of these issues . )
The development of the ability to relate to others begins with the mother / child relationship and internalizing that experience .
The problems in development where that attachment is disrupted in young children are well known ( Bowlby , 1969 , 1973 , 1980 ; Mahler , Pine , & Bergman , 1975 ) .
Positive experiences with the mother are internalized and aspects of the mother which are experienced as rejecting or painful are hypothesized to become unconscious and to be projected into external relational objects ( Fairbairn , 1952 , 1954 ; Segal , 1973 ; Klein , 1975a & b ) .
Scharff ( 1990 , p.442 ) believes that most sexual difficulties can be understood as attempts to communicate with others while imposing an aspect of the patient 's internal object relations into these relationships .
At certain stages in development , the child 's emerging identity and sexuality will become the focus .
At these particular points , aspects of loss can be expressed through the development of sexual symptoms or sexualization .
There is not , however , any exact link between a specific trauma or insult and the subsequent sexual problem .
Even while taking into account the child 's temperamental predispositions , developmental factors , and the life matrix of relationships , as well as the specific meaning of events to the child , such specific predictions cannot be made .
In this model , sexual paraphilias reflect the development of fixations of early experiences which would ordinarily be more transient in nature .
Sexual arousal is often fused in these symptom patterns , which allow for the expression of anxiety and aggression .
Family reinforcement patterns , incorporating the use of projective identification , may then overtly or subtly reinforce such aberrant solutions to relationships outside the family .
Each person 's particular set of responses or paraphilic syndrome is a product of complex relational factors centering around how object loss is handled .
The specific paraphilia typically expresses and symbolizes the history of the person 's object relations and her fantasies , which , if understood , will help make sense of the symptom .
It is probable that in the case of women perpetrators the development of sexual symptomatology may be more obviously related to specific losses and less a reflection of a full - blown repetitive paraphilic pattern as is more often the case in males .
Certainly , however , the impact of losses can be traced in males as well .
Some males who apparently previously functioned normally sexually and who are not diagnosable as pedophilic may at times act out sexually in response to a specific loss , as seen in the work of Van Couvering ( 1988 ) .
In the four cases we have described , there was an admission on the part of each woman that the offense had occurred , and there was a wealth of supporting data to corroborate their admissions .
There was no indication of prior sexual misconduct involving a minor , with the exception of Ellen .
In each case , there was a turbulent early childhood with losses or rejections of various kinds .
Sylvia had a rejecting alcoholic father and experienced rejection by her siblings .
Nancy 's parents were divorced when she was three , and there were multiple caretakers up to age seven .
She had the perception that her stepmother wanted to get rid of her .
Janet lost her dad at age eleven , and then functionally lost her mother who had to go to work to support them .
Ellen felt displaced by foster siblings and later her natural sibling for her parents ' attention , and her parents were experienced as willing to give to others more freely than to her .
In some there were significant losses during adolescence which damaged their ability to relate to peers , as in the case of Sylvia whose boy friend was drowned .
Janet experienced a teen - age pregnancy and gave up her baby boy for adoption .
Such disturbed histories may also be found in male offenders , but in females the impact of losses in family contexts may be expressed in a more open way .
Women are typically more prone to define themselves and to build their identities around relationships and it is more culturally acceptable for them to express their dependencies overtly .
Women are also more prone to feel that their failures in relationships are the mark of their personal inadequacies and that they are therefore less adequate as women .
All of these women were likely to be unusually vulnerable to losses as adults , and were highly sensitive to changes in their environment .
The relational patterns for all four had been dissatisfying , and , prior to their offenses , there had been a move to a different locale by the woman and / or by her spouse , followed by feelings of disruption .
Sylvia lost her adoptive son , Josh , and was without him at the holidays .
Nancy 's husband , Steve , left for military duty , and her baby died at six weeks of age .
While Steve returned briefly , she was then left to manage her grief on her own .
Janet moved to another state , and her 12 - year - old son remained with his father .
It was after a summer visit when the boy returned home that she experienced her loss very strongly .
Ellen had moved away to go to college and had not successfully made that transition , in that she did not establish satisfactory peer relationships .
She went through two losses of boy friends , the latter one about three weeks prior to the offense .
In three of the four cases , a young adolescent male was available at the time the woman was feeling the greatest need and vulnerability , and it was to him that she turned .
For Sylvia and Janet , the victim may have represented a substitute for a lost or unavailable son .
In Nancy 's case , her husband was away in the military and she was struggling with the death of her infant .
In cases where such losses have occurred and there are available young males who play some sort of substitute role , such women may be at greater risk for sexual acting out .
Each woman described her victim as an aggressor in some manner , where increasingly she felt unable to stop the incidents .
In this regard , these women are not significantly different than many male perpetrators who also may unconsciously relate to their victims as peers and who may report that the child was the instigator .
Such descriptions are significant clues as to the level of object relations attained by the perpetrator which are being expressed through the sexual acting out behaviors .
Ellen 's view of her victim was directly tied to her unresolved conflicts and losses as a child , where she felt directly competitive with foster children in the home and later with her sister .
There was clearly an element of jealousy of the victim 's relationship with her parents , and Ellen projected sexual trauma into her inferences about what the child was being exposed to by sleeping in the same room as her parents .
The five - year - old victim was the recipient of her rage and loss , most likely triggered by being in an unwanted caretaking role and seeing her old boy friend on campus that day .
In the other cases , there was not so much obvious expression of anger as there was of loss and substitution of the victim to replace those losses .
As is seen in literature , women in child care roles are sometimes vulnerable to sexual acting out patterns .
It would be important for clinicians working with such women to explore their past attitudes and experiences in caretaking roles and assess their risk to any current children from a standpoint of any form of physical , sexual , or emotional abuse or neglect .
Sexual abuse in women is often unexpected and may go unrecognized but it can occur .

Is America A Christian Nation ?
The U.S. Constitution is a secular document .
It begins , " We the people , " and contains no mention of " God " or " Christianity . "
Its only references to religion are exclusionary , such as , " no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust " ( Art. VI ) , and " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " ( First Amendment ) .
The presidential oath of office , the only oath detailed in the Constitution , does not contain the phrase " so help me God " or any requirement to swear on a bible ( Art. II , Sec. 1 , Clause 8 ) .
If we are a Christian nation , why does n't our Constitution say so ?
In 1797 America made a treaty with Tripoli , declaring that " the government of the United States is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion . "
This reassurance to Islam was written under Washington 's presidency , and approved by the Senate under John Adams .
The First Amendment To The U.S. Constitution :
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . "
What about the Declaration of Independence ?
We are not governed by the Declaration .
Its purpose was to " dissolve the political bands , " not to set up a religious nation .
Its authority was based on the idea that " governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , " which is contrary to the biblical concept of rule by divine authority .
It deals with laws , taxation , representation , war , immigration , and so on , never discussing religion at all .
The references to " Nature 's God , " " Creator , " and " Divine Providence " in the Declaration do not endorse Christianity .
Thomas Jefferson , its author , was a Deist , opposed to orthodox Christianity and the supernatural .
What about the Pilgrims and Puritans ?
The first colony of English - speaking Europeans was Jamestown , settled in 1609 for trade , not religious freedom .
Fewer than half of the 102 Mayflower passengers in 1620 were " Pilgrims " seeking religious freedom .
The secular United States of America was formed more than a century and a half later .
If tradition requires us to return to the views of a few early settlers , why not adopt the polytheistic and natural beliefs of the Native Americans , the true founders of the continent at least 12,000 years earlier ?
Most of the religious colonial governments excluded and persecuted those of the " wrong " faith .
The framers of our Constitution in 1787 wanted no part of religious intolerance and bloodshed , wisely establishing the first government in history to separate church and state .
Do the words " separation of church and state " appear in the Constitution ?
The phrase , " a wall of separation between church and state , " was coined by President Thomas Jefferson in a carefully crafted letter to the Danbury Baptists in 1802 , when they had asked him to explain the First Amendment .
The Supreme Court , and lower courts , have used Jefferson 's phrase repeatedly in major decisions upholding neutrality in matters of religion .
The exact words " separation of church and state " do not appear in the Constitution ; neither do " separation of powers , " " interstate commerce , " " right to privacy , " and other phrases describing well - established constitutional principles .
What does " separation of church and state " mean ?
Thomas Jefferson , explaining the phrase to the Danbury Baptists , said , " the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions . "
Personal religious views are just that : personal .
Our government has no right to promulgate religion or to interfere with private beliefs .
The Supreme Court has forged a three - part " Lemon test " ( Lemon v. Kurtzman , 1971 ) to determine if a law is permissible under the First - Amendment religion clauses .
A law must have a secular purpose .
It must have a primary effect which neither advances nor inhibits religion .
It must avoid excessive entanglement of church and state .
The separation of church and state is a wonderful American principle supported not only by minorities , such as Jews , Moslems , and unbelievers , but applauded by most Protestant churches that recognize that it has allowed religion to flourish in this nation .
It keeps the majority from pressuring the minority .
What about majority rule ?
America is one nation under a Constitution .
Although the Constitution sets up a representative democracy , it specifically was amended with the Bill of Rights in 1791 to uphold individual and minority rights .
On constitutional matters we do not have majority rule .
For example , when the majority in certain localities voted to segregate blacks , this was declared illegal .
The majority has no right to tyrannize the minority on matters such as race , gender , or religion .
Not only is it unAmerican for the government to promote religion , it is rude .
Whenever a public official uses the office to advance religion , someone is offended .
The wisest policy is one of neutrality .
Is n't removing religion from public places hostile to religion ?
No one is deprived of worship in America .
Tax - exempt churches and temples abound .
The state has no say about private religious beliefs and practices , unless they endanger health or life .
Our government represents all of the people , supported by dollars from a plurality of religious and non-religious taxpayers .
Some countries , such as the U.S.S.R. , expressed hostility to religion .
Others , such as Iran ( " one nation under God " ) , have welded church and state .
America wisely has taken the middle course -- neither for nor against religion .
Neutrality offends no one , and protects everyone .
The First Amendment deals with " Congress . "
Ca n't states make their own religious policies ?
Under the " due process " clause of the 14th Amendment ( ratified in 1868 ) , the entire Bill of Rights applies to the states .
No governor , mayor , sheriff , public school employee , or other public official may violate the human rights embodied in the Constitution .
The government at all levels must respect the separation of church and state .
Most state constitutions , in fact , contain language that is even stricter than the First Amendment , prohibiting the state from setting up a ministry , using tax dollars to promote religion , or interfering with freedom of conscience .
The words , " under God , " did not appear in the Pledge of Allegiance until 1954 , when Congress , under McCarthyism , inserted them .
Likewise , " In God We Trust " was absent from paper currency before 1956 .
It appeared on some coins earlier , as did other sundry phrases , such as " Mind Your Business . "
The original U.S. motto , chosen by John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , and Thomas Jefferson , is E Pluribus Unum ( " Of Many , One " ) , celebrating plurality , not theocracy .
Is n't American law based on the Ten Commandments ?
Not at all !
The first four Commandments are religious edicts having nothing to do with law or ethical behavior .
Only three ( homicide , theft , and perjury ) are relevant to current American law , and have existed in cultures long before Moses .
If Americans honored the commandment against " coveting , " free enterprise would collapse !
The Supreme Court has ruled that posting the Ten Commandments in public schools is unconstitutional .
Our secular laws , based on the human principle of " justice for all , " provide protection against crimes , and our civil government enforces them through a secular criminal justice system .
Why be concerned about the separation of church and state ?
Ignoring history , law , and fairness , many fanatics are working vigorously to turn America into a Christian nation .
Fundamentalist Protestants and right - wing Catholics would impose their narrow morality on the rest of us , resisting women 's rights , freedom for religious minorities and unbelievers , gay and lesbian rights , and civil rights for all .
History shows us that only harm comes of uniting church and state .
America has never been a Christian nation .
We are a free nation .
Anne Gaylor , president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , points out : " There can be no religious freedom without the freedom to dissent . "

December 4 , 2007 — “ One World , One Dream " is China ’s slogan for its 2008 summer Olympics in Beijing .
But there is one nightmare that China should n’t be allowed to sweep under the rug .
That nightmare is Darfur , where more than 400,000 people have been killed and more than two - and - a - half million driven from flaming villages by the Chinese - backed government of Sudan .
China is pouring billions of dollars into Sudan .
Beijing purchases an overwhelming part of Sudan ’s oil exports and state - owned China National Petroleum Corporation , an official partner of the upcoming Olympic Games , owns the largest shares in each of Sudan ’s two major oil consortia .
China has been indirectly funding the Sudanese government ’s war effort in Darfur by massively investing in Sudan ’s oil industry .
Sudan ’s government receives large royalties for the declared 500,000 barrels that are pumped each day , and observers believe as much as 70 percent of this cash goes to the military .
The rebel Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) attacked the Chinese - run Defra oil field in Kordofan region in October 2007 , days before peace talks were scheduled to begin with the government in Sirte , Libya , warning the Chinese to Leave Sudan .
Other reports indicate that the government of Sudan ( GOS ) uses as much as 80 % of proceeds from those sales to fund its brutal Sudan Armed Forces ( SAF ) and its allied barbaric proxy militias .
It also purchases their machinery of mass destruction such as bombers , assault helicopters , armoured vehicles and all sorts of arms , most of which are Chinese manufactured .
Airstrips are constructed and operated by the Chinese have been used to launch bombing campaigns on villages .
China has used its Veto Power in the U.N. Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the International Community to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the slaughter .
Recently , the two main Darfur Rebel groups , JEM and the Sudan Liberation Movement / Army ( SLM/ A ) have demanded China to withdraw its troops , which include ( 135 ) engineers from Darfur with immediate effect .
They said that China is not one of the states , which have worked to alleviate the suffering of the internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) and the refugees in Darfur .
Furthermore , the rebels accused China of impartiality toward the crisis in Darfur , and worst , Beijing has been accused of working hard to disrupt and impede the international resolutions in the UN Security Council .
The Movements added in their opposition to the presence of the Chinese troops that Beijing government has been funding the Government of Sudan ( GOS ) in its war against the people of Darfur .
They also pointed out that China represents the major source of arms and military hardware that the National Congress Party ( NCP ) government uses to fuel its genocidal war against the people of Sudan in Darfur .
Furthermore , they indicated that the early arrival , before the deadline , of the Chinese military personnel is part of its complicity with the evil agenda of the ruling National Congress Party ( NCP ) in Khartoum and the protection of their bilateral interests rather than coming for the sake of protecting the defenceless civilians in Darfur .
The spokesperson for JEM told « Middle East News Paper » that their movement would not target the Chinese troops who have been deployed in Darfur as long as they are under the flag of the United Nations in accordance with the UN Resolution 1769 .
Nevertheless , JEM said that the Chinese forces are unwelcome in Darfur and are asked to leave the Region .
The Movement drew attention to the demonstrations in the Camps for the refugees and the internally displaced persons against the presence of the Chinese troops as a strong evidence of mistrust in their objectives of coming to Darfur .
The demonstrators delivered letters to the African Union and to the United Nations expressing their position .
They told the regional and the international bodies that they could n’t trust " Khartoum providers of weapons " .
Sudan Tribune reported that the IDPs of Darfur has been the first to express their rejection of the Chinese troops last Saturday , a day before the arrival of the 135 Chinese engineers to Nyala .
JEM added that China is not only collaborated with the Khartoum regime in its killing spree , but it has done essentially nothing in Darfur other than standing like a spectator as the horrors of Darfur took place before its eyes .
“ The people of Darfur , do not trust China ” , JEM said .
Although China is the only country that can influence or compel General Omer al - Bashir ’s NCP government of Sudan to stop the continuing mass murders and crimes against humanity , it chose not only to stand by but to support a government whose senior members may end up in front of the international criminal court ( ICC ) for war crimes .
The Chinese have so far been unabashed of their collaboration with the Khartoum regime in the ongoing holocaust in Darfur .
China , who is hosting the “ Genocide Olympics ” in August 2008 , seems to continue supporting Khartoum ’s larger genocidal strategy in the region of Darfur and exportation .
Beijing is not morally moved by the five - years - on tragedy of the most vulnerable people of Sudan in Darfur .
China ’s complicity in the ultimate international crime of genocide is evidently seen in its position at the UN Security Council when it abstained in the critical Vote on Resolution 1706 and insisted that the consent of Khartoum must be sought prior to the deployment of the UN force in Darfur .
In doing so , China officially colluded with Khartoum ’s claim of national sovereignty despite the responsibility of the International Community to protect the people of Darfur against massacre , war crimes and genocide . , China , Sudan ’s ally and , Sudan ’s ally and veto - holding permanent member of the security council , Since 1997 when the US imposed oil sanctions on Sudan , countries like China became the main beneficiaries of Sudan ’s emerging oil industry .
American sanctions have kept many companies from Europe and the United States out of Sudan , but firms from China , Malaysia , India , Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are racing in .
Moreover , barter trade between Sudan and China that includes arms for oil and anticipated oil revenue has been documented in various reports , including a detailed compendium from Human Rights Watch .
Reports from the ground indicate that as much as 75 percent of weaponry captured from Khartoum ’s forces is of Chinese manufacture .
Not coincidentally , China is now a net importer of oil , with consumption growing at about 10 percent a year .
Sudan continues to be China ’s premiere offshore oil source .
Therefore , corporate indifference to human suffering and destruction keeps on in Darfur through the unholy alliance between the Communist China and the NIF in Khartoum .
The displaced persons and the refugees chanting slogans such as “ Oh China take your weapons and return to your country ; we do not want your presence in Darfur ! ; China ’s oil rights in Sudan mean mass murder in Darfur to go on .
Is it ” Oil for Blood or the “ Genocide Olympics ? ” !

The US must boost its computer security , congressional advisers say
China is pursuing new technology " aggressively " , it says , legitimately through research and business deals and illegally through industrial espionage .
China has also " embraced destructive warfare techniques " , the report says , enabling it to carry out cyber attacks on other countries ' infrastructure .
A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing denied any spying activities by China .
" China and the US have a fundamental common interest in promoting sound and rapid development , " said Liu Jianchao , quoted by the Associated Press news agency .
Weapons advances
The allegations were made by the US - China Economic and Security Review Commission in its annual report .
China denied reports that it had hacked into Pentagon computers
The advisory panel , appointed by Congress , recommended that US security measures and intelligence be stepped up to try to prevent the theft of military technology , in particular .
" Chinese espionage activities in the United States are so extensive that they comprise the single greatest risk to the security of American technologies , " the report said .
It urged Congress to study " military , intelligence and homeland security programmes that protect critical American computer networks and sensitive information , specifically those charged with protecting networks from damage caused by cyber attacks " .
The report also identified other grounds for concern , such as the fact that the Chinese are manufacturing " sophisticated weapon platforms " speedily and efficiently .
The unexpected pace of China 's military development has fuelled analysts ' suspicions that it is being helped by stolen information , the commission said .
' Unfair trade '
In addition , the Chinese media - firmly under state control - are being used to create " deep feelings of nationalism " , it said .
In an international crisis , the panel warned , that could turn misunderstanding into conflict .
The report also criticised Chinese economic policy , saying that small and medium - sized American businesses " face the full brunt of China 's unfair trade practices , currency manipulation and illegal subsidies for Chinese exports " .
The BBC's Vincent Dowd in Washington says that this is a hard - hitting report which will be consumed eagerly and with concern in the US capital .
In September , the Chinese government denied reports that its military had hacked into the computer network of the US defence department in Washington .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Republicans have seized on a liberal advocacy group 's print ad attacking Gen. David Petraeus and have called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to denounce it .
Gen . David Petraeus listens to opening statements Monday before testifying at a congressional hearing .
In the ad , running in Monday 's edition of The New York Times , bold letters under a picture of Petraeus spell out " General Petraeus or General Betray us ? "
MoveOn.org Political Action , which paid for the ad , accuses Petraeus of " cooking the books for the White House " on progress being made in Iraq and calls him " a military man constantly at war with the facts . "
Petraeus on Monday began giving an assessment to Congress about the progress of the war in Iraq .
A letter addressed to Reid circulated Monday among senators asking that Reid make it clear he does not share MoveOn.org 's views .
The letter reads : " The ad is distasteful and frankly , below the level of respect that America 's commanding general in Iraq has earned .
No matter whether any senator supports or opposes the war in Iraq , we should all voice recognition and appreciation of Gen. Petraeus ' long and distinguished record of service to our country . "
A senior Democratic leadership aide called the ad an " unnecessary distraction " and said Democrats are prepared to focus on " Petraeus executing a mismanaged mission . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said , " Democratic leaders must make a choice today : Either embrace the character assassination tactics Moveon.org has leveled against the four - star general leading our troops in the fight against al Qaeda , or denounce it as disgraceful . "
" Gen . Petraeus and the other commanders in the U.S. Armed Services have dedicated their lives to defending the very freedom that enables MoveOn.org the right to free speech .
I support that right , but I find the way they have chosen to exercise it today to be disrespectful and downright reprehensible , " Boehner said in a statement .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman , I - Connecticut , also called on the Democratic leadership to " denounce MoveOn.org 's attack on Gen. Petraeus . "
Lieberman has been supportive of President Bush 's efforts in Iraq .
Congressional Democrats showed an eagerness to distance themselves from the ad .
Asked early Monday if this was the right message for his party to send , a member of the Democratic leadership , speaking on background , curtly answered , " No . "
Sen .
John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , called the ad " over the top . "
" I do n't like any kind of characterizations in our politics that call into question any active duty , distinguished general who I think under any circumstances serves with the best interests of our country , " said Kerry , the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate and a decorated veteran .
" I think there are a lot of legitimate questions that need to be asked , a lot of probing that ought to take place ; there 's a lot of legitimate accountability that needs to be achieved .
It ought to be done without casting any aspersions on anyone 's character or motives , " he added .
White House spokesman Tony Snow called the ad , running the same day the general testified before Congress about Iraq , a " boorish , childish , unworthy attack . "
MoveOn.org said Monday it stood by the ad completely .
" Every major independent study and many major news organizations cast serious doubt on Petraeus ' claims , " said Eli Pariser , executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action Committee .
" It should come as no surprise that Gen. Petraeus ' claims have come under critical scrutiny :
The facts all point in one direction -- the surge is n't working -- and Gen. Petraeus and the White House are pointing in another , " the statement said .
" No wonder recent polls show that the American people agree with the ad also : A majority expect that the general will deliver ' a biased report that reflects what the Bush administration wants the public to believe , ' " the statement said , quoting from a USA Today / Gallup poll reported in Monday 's USA Today .

Conyers files contempt report ; says White House has one last chance Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday November 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This White House says ' futile ' contempt filing ' wo n't go anywhere '
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) filed a report today holding that two White House officials are in contempt of Congress for their continued refusal to honor subpoenas in connection with the controversial firing of US attorneys last year -- but he 's offering one last chance to make a deal .
In a Monday letter to White House Counsel Fred Fielding , Conyers wrote that he would be officially filing submitting the contempt report , a move which would allow the full House to later vote on the measure , but would stop the contempt process there if the White House would agree to a final compromise offer .
 I have written to you on eight previous occasions attempting to reach agreement on this matter ,  Conyers says in the letter .
 As we submit the Committees contempt report to the full House , I am writing one more time to seek to resolve this issue on a cooperative basis . 
The 862 - page contempt resolution was filed with the House clerk Monday afternoon .
But White House Press Secretary Dana Perino told reporters that an effort to bring a contempt citation to a vote was " futile . "
" I 'm just amazed that the Democrats actually think they 've accomplished so much on behalf of the American people that they can now waste time again on another diversion , " she said .
" I do n't know if they 'll actually have a vote on the House floor or not .
If they do , I guess we 'll just take it from there .
But it 's been very clear that this is a futile attempt on their part , because they know that it wo n't go anywhere . "
In July , Conyers had written Fielding to inform him that White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers could be held in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas seeking documents and testimony as part of a House Judiciary probe into the firing of nine US attorneys .
President Bush had earlier blocked those requests , citing executive privilege .
In order to prevent further action on the contempt measure , Conyers is requesting that the White House provide communications documents pertaining to the firings , including internal White House materials , and asking that White House staffers be allowed to conduct private interviews -- albeit not under oath -- with the House Judiciary Committee .
 I hope you will consider this offer in earnest and based upon the good faith with which it is delivered ,  Conyers writes , going on to give Fielding a Nov. 9 deadline .
Republicans in the House have already sprung into action , according to Politico 's John Bresnahan .
" GOP leaders have begun to prepare their own counter - attack if a criminal contempt resolution vote takes place on the floor , and they plan to target conservative and moderate Democrats , " he writes .
" Republicans see several moves that signal a vote is likely to happen soon , but Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) has not made a final decision one way or the other at this time . "
According to the Washington Post , Democrats have been working to secure the votes necessary to make sure that a contempt vote , if brought to the House floor , would be successful .
" House Democratic leaders have spent the past 10 days trying round up enough votes to secure a majority on the House floor for a contempt citation , aware that some Democrats from moderate to conservative districts may be wary of such a high - profile vote against President Bush , " says the paper .
If Fielding rejects Conyers ' offer , reports the Post , a contempt vote could come as early as next week .

(... and why you should care . )
The thousand monkeys inside Ann Coulter 's head have simultaneously stopped typing , so that must mean that Ann has completed a new " book " to inflict upon the world .
It 's only been a year since her last book , but hey -- this stuff ai n't Shakespeare .
The new book , in turn , means she will now make the rounds of television programs that seemingly would want little to do with her , and in order to plug said book she will make a stream of absurd , ridiculous , conscience - punching , logic - mugging , baby - eating things intended to attract attention .
And since she is already known throughout the land as a hatemongering nutcase , every statement has to top the last .
The absurd part about all of this is not that a serial scenery - chewer like Coulter would say shocking things .
The absurd part is that , in spite of all the things Coulter says all the time , she still gets invited by major news outlets to make those comments .
Every .
Damn .
Time .
So in this iteration of the story , CNBC 's Donny Deutcsh invites her on his show , and then is shocked -- shocked ! -- when she uses the opportunity to say the offensive and bigoted things .
Media Matters :
COULTER : Well , OK , take the Republican National Convention .
People were happy .
They 're Christian .
They 're tolerant .
They defend America , they -- DEUTSCH : Christian -- so we should be Christian ?
It would be better if we were all Christian ?
COULTER : Yes .
DEUTSCH : We should all be Christian ?
COULTER : Yes .
Would you like to come to church with me , Donny ?
DEUTSCH : So I should not be a Jew , I should be a Christian , and this would be a better place ?
COULTER : Well , you could be a practicing Jew , but you 're not .
DEUTSCH : I actually am .
That 's not true .
I really am .
But -- so we would be better if we were - if people -- if there were no Jews , no Buddhists -- COULTER : Whenever I 'm harangued by -- DEUTSCH : -- in this country ?
You can't believe that . [...]
DEUTSCH : That is n't what I said , but you said I should not -- we should just throw Judaism away and we should all be Christians , then , or -- COULTER : Yeah .
DEUTSCH : Really ?
COULTER : Well , it 's a lot easier .
It 's kind of a fast track .
DEUTSCH : Really ?
COULTER : Yeah .
You have to obey .
DEUTSCH : You can't possibly believe that .
COULTER : Yes .
DEUTSCH : You can't possibly -- you 're too educated , you can't -- you 're like my friend in -- COULTER :
Do you know what Christianity is ?
We believe your religion , but you have to obey .
You can't possibly ?
You 're too educated ?
Please , give me a break : it 's not even in the realm of plausible anymore .
Asserting that Jews should not be Jews , and that Muslims should not be Muslims , and that as a " perfected Jew " she 's in charge of who has to " obey " -- that hardly could make it to Coulter 's personal top ten list of intentionally bigoted statements .
Just among the most recent of Ann Coulter 's hateful spews , she called a Democratic presidential candidate a faggot .
She declared the widows of 9/11 were " enjoying " their husband 's deaths .
She declared that women should n't have the right to vote -- because they were doing it wrong .
She asserted Islam to be nothing more than a " cult " .
And so on , and so on .
So if you can look at that record of bile and bigotry , and still invite her on your show , here 's the rule : you own what she says .
You do n't have to invite her on .
Just because she 's plugging another book , a thin rewrite of the last four or five similar books about liberals - something - something - traitor - something - something , does n't mean you 're obligated to prop her up in a chair and help her promote it .
You choose to put her on the air .
You choose to give an audience to her crap .
If you invite David Duke or a Stormfront spokesman on your network to talk about the inferiority of blacks or Jews or Latinos , you have made the choice to give those hatemongers a mountaintop from which to promote their bigotry .
If you invite hacks on the air to reiterate , for the umpteenth consecutive time , a discredited conspiracy about " Aztlan " , you own that story .
And if you invite Ann Coulter on the air to croak out statements of pure , unapologetic venom about other religions , other races , or other ideologies , it is your network that made the decision that a person known for making those statements was worthy of your audience .
Do n't give us this crap about pretending to be offended by her bigotry .
If you were truly offended by her bigotry , you would n't have returned her damn phone calls , much less hitched a microphone to her and placed her in front of a camera .
In giving her an audience knowing full well what sorts of things she would say , you own her bigotry .
Mr. Boren declined to say which candidate would be strongest , but suggested “ some kind of combination of those three : Bloomberg - Hagel , Bloomberg - Nunn . ”
He said Mr. Bloomberg would “ not have to spend a lot of time raising money and he would not have to make deals with special interest groups to raise money . ”
“ Normally I do n’t think an independent candidacy would have a chance ” said Mr. Boren , who is the University of Oklahoma ’s president .
“ I do n’t think these are normal times . ”
Mr. Bloomberg , who has tried to seize a national platform on gun control , the environment and other issues , has been regularly briefed in recent months on foreign policy by , among others , Henry A. Kissinger , his friend and the former secretary of state , and Nancy Soderberg , an ambassador to the United Nations in the Clinton administration .
Advisers have said Mr. Bloomberg , a billionaire many times over , might invest as much as $ 1 billion of his own fortune ( he spent about $ 160 million on his two mayoral races ) on a presidential campaign .
But they warned that while they were confident of getting on the ballot in every state , the process was complicated and fraught with legal challenges , and that Mr. Bloomberg would begin with an organizational disadvantage , competing against rivals who have been campaigning full time for years .
Still , the mayor said this month at a news conference , “ Last I looked  and I ’m not a candidate  but last time I checked reading about the Constitution , the Electoral College has nothing to do with parties , has absolutely nothing to do with parties .
It ’s most states are winners take all .
The popular vote assigns electoral votes to the candidate , and I do n’t think it says in there that you have to be a member of one party or another . ”
The key players  virtually the only players  in Mr. Bloomberg ’s embryonic campaign are three of his deputy mayors , Kevin Sheekey , Edward Skyler and Patricia E. Harris .
Another aide , Patrick Brennan , who was the political director of Mr. Bloomberg ’s 2005 re-election campaign , resigned as commissioner of the city ’s Community Assistance Unit earlier this year to spend more time exploring the mayor ’s possible national campaign .
Nixon 1968 , Clinton 2008
Not so long ago , electability was a one - way ticket to presidential primary election oblivion .
The road was littered with " most electable " candidates .
Their names were Scranton and Romney , Muskie and Humphrey , Bayh and Connally ; to mention but a few .
Today , electability is perhaps the most salient issue for presidential primary voters .
It 's the issue that catapulted Sen. John Kerry to the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination .
It 's the issue that keeps afloat the 2008 Giuliani for President Campaign .
In an age of highly polarized , hyper - alert politics , who can win in November matters a great deal .
Every time Sen. Hillary Clinton goes a bit wobbly , her chief strategist , Mark Penn , issues a memo which says , basically , not only is she electable , she 's inevitable .
And here are 8,000 pieces of poll data that prove the point .
Mr. Penn did just that last week , in the run-up to the Nevada debate , after Sen.
Clinton had fish - tailed through an icy patch .
There are n't ten people in the United States who know more about what primary election voters consider salient than Mark Penn .
So it 's illustrative indeed that his counter - argument to the slightest sign of trouble is : she 's inevitable , stop whining and shut up .
The question is : is inevitability a sustainable strategy for Sen. Clinton ?
Assume for the moment that over the course of the next six or seven weeks , Barack Obama separates himself from John Edwards in Iowa and becomes the only " viable " alternative to Sen.
Clinton for Iowa caucus goers .
If that happens , Sen . Obama will win Iowa by a reasonable , perhaps comfortable margin , depending on turnout ( Clinton needs an historically high turnout to win Iowa , which is why she has suddenly flooded the state with organizers and operatives ) .
Sen .
Obama will then head into New Hampshire riding a wave of favorable publicity ( he 's a winner , she 's in trouble ) and with a newly fortified campaign treasury ( money hedges in politics , just as it does on Wall Street ) .
Sen .
Clinton 's campaign will have to turn harshly negative , to slow down Sen .
Obama 's momentum and heighten voter concerns about his experience .
Let 's further say it does n't work and Sen. Obama wins New Hampshire .
How does Senator Clinton then argue that she 's the most elect - able , that she is in fact inevitable , when she 's just lost two in a row and there are only three weeks left ?
This is the flaw in the Clinton campaign 's strategy .
If she is perceived to have lost two in a row by too much , the rationale for her campaign 's continuance collapses .
All good strategies have an antecedent .
The antecedent strategy for the Clinton campaign of 2008 is the Nixon strategy of 1968 .
Then , the problem was : how do you make the country 's most disliked politician electable ?
Frank Shakespeare and Fred McWhorter started by trying to make Nixon warmer , friendlier , your next door neighbor .
A young turk named Roger Ailes came in , took a look and said ( and I am paraphrasing here ) : " forget it .
No one will ever warm to the guy .
He 's un-likeable .
We 've got to change the narrative .
This is about a man in the arena ; this is about grit and determination and hard work and brains and perseverance . "
Ailes went on to create televised " Man in the Arena " town hall meetings , at which Nixon answered voter questions , by himself , being himself .
Voters did n't need to like Nixon to elect him .
He only needed to earn their respect .
Like Nixon , Senator Clinton is widely disliked .
Like Nixon , she cannot be made warm , even by a modern - day Roger Ailes .
Like Nixon , she is a politician whose resentments are always close to the surface .
And like Nixon , she is a politician about whom her peers have real doubts .
But also like Nixon , she is intelligent and diligent and determined and tough and she has been through hell and back .
She is experienced in a way that only her husband and President George W. Bush are experienced .
She knows what it 's like to get her head kicked in every day , day after day after day , for months and years on end .
She endures .
That was the whole point of the 1968 Nixon campaign narrative .
He was n't perfect by any means , but he was formidable and he endured .
It 's a narrative that fits Senator Clinton 's campaign like a glove .
For reasons either right or wrong , Americans will elect their first female president only when they are convinced that she is the tougher of the two ( or three ) choices .
She wo n't be inevitable until we believe she is as formidable as Tricky Dick .

Here is a review of Paul Krugman 's new book , The Conscience of a Liberal from David Kennedy .
The review appears in the New York Times .
When you start , as David Kennedy does , with the premise that " maybe Krugman is not really an economist " because he believes that sometimes government intervention is necessary to correct market failures , you have to wonder if it 's worth reading on .
It 's not " anti-economist " as Kennedy suggests to believe markets sometimes need to be corrected .
The suggestion that it is " anti-economist " displays the reviewer 's ignorance about basic economics .
Also , if you are going to have an historian rather than an economist or political scientist review Paul Krugman 's work , it ought to be one who at least gets history right .
Paul Krugman reviews his review :
Continuing the tradition , by Paul Krugman :
Well , I ’ve gotten a dismissive review in the NYT .
It ’s sort of a tradition .
After all , The Great Unraveling received an equally dismissive review from Peter Beinart , in which he portrayed my conclusion that the Bush administration deliberately misled us into war as a crazy conspiracy theory , and contained this immortal pronouncement :
But most Americans do not consider the Bush administration corrupt , and Paul Krugman cannot convincingly prove it is .
I think David Kennedy ’s review will hold up about as well as Peter Beinart ’s .
I presented facts on voting behavior , which point to the centrality of race — he ignores them .
I presented polling evidence about the timing and role of the perception that Democrats are weak on national security ; he just waves it away .
Oh , and when Kennedy says , to illustrate my alleged factual problems , that Kansas , whatever its other crimes and misdemeanors , is not customarily regarded as the birthplace of Prohibition you have to ask who ’s got the factual problems .
I do n’t know what “ customarily regarded ” means , but Carrie Nation wielded her ax in Kansas - and Kansas was the first state to ban alcohol in its constitution .
And here 's the review itself :
Malefactors of Megawealth , by David Kennedy , NY Times : Paul Krugman is a justly renowned professor of economics ...
His abundant accolades include the John Bates Clark Medal , ... perhaps even more prestigious than receipt of the Nobel in economic science .
His twice - weekly column in The New York Times routinely and authoritatively demystifies complex economic arcana .
And yet maybe Krugman is not really an economist — at least not according to the definition offered more than a century ago by Francis Amasa Walker , the first president of the American Economic Association , who wrote that laissez - faire “ was not made the test of economic orthodoxy , merely .
It was used to decide whether a man were an economist at all . ”
Most modern economists continue to celebrate Walker ’s orthodoxy , and behind it , the classical doctrines of Adam Smith , whose fabled “ invisible hand ” regularly works wonders of production , distribution , innovation and efficiency , provided it is kept free of the meddlesome “ nanny state . ”
Against the constant threat of encroachment from that benighted quarter the free - market faithful are ever vigilant .
Krugman will have none of this — well , very little of it ( he won the Clark Medal for work demonstrating the limitations , but not the total illogic , of free trade ) .
Where the orthodox see nothing but market miracles , he sees many a market failure .
And where they detect the invisible hand , he finds manipulation by the richest Americans to rig the game in their favor .
In our time , Krugman argues , the malefactors of megawealth have triumphed .
He recites the now - familiar data that the wealthiest 0.01 percent of Americans are seven times richer than they were three decades ago , while the inflation - adjusted income of most American households has barely nudged upward .
...
But Krugman the anti-economist does not believe that growing economic inequality incubated modern political conservatism .
In his view , the “ arrow of causation ” points the other way : political change , cunningly engineered by “ radicals of the right , ” has spawned egregious economic disparity , as well as a toxic level of partisanship .
Ever the iconoclast , Krugman says “ this strongly suggests that institutions , norms and the political environment matter a lot more for the distribution of income — and that the impersonal market forces matter less — than Economics 101 might lead you to believe . ”
In short , it ’s the politics , stupid .
The bulk of this book consists of a historical explanation for how this sorry state of affairs came to be .
It ’s a story that is as factually shaky as it is narratively simplified .
( Kansas , whatever its other crimes and misdemeanors , is not customarily regarded as the birthplace of Prohibition ; the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 , not 1964 . )
History according to Krugman goes something like this : the nation suffered through a “ Long Gilded Age ” of let - ’er - rip , dog - eat - dog capitalism until the New Deal created a new social order characterized by income - leveling taxes , job security , strong labor unions , a prosperous middle class , bipartisan solidarity and general social bliss .
Krugman invokes that post - World War II “ paradise lost ” in his first paragraph , and his yearning to restore that Edenic moment informs all the pages that follow .
But as the story unfolds , serpents slither into the garden , in the form of pesky “ movement conservatives . ”
Those upstarts set out in the 1960s to exploit racial tensions , national security anxieties and volatile value - laden matters like abortion , school prayer and gay rights “ to change the subject away from bread and butter issues . ”
By century ’s end they had managed to fasten upon their hapless fellow citizens “ a second Gilded Age ” in which inequality is on the rise and even the modest American version of the welfare state that the New Deal put in place is in danger of being dismantled .
For this dismal state of affairs the Democratic Party is held to be blameless .
Never mind the Democrats ’ embrace of inherently divisive identity politics , or Democratic condescension toward the ungrammatical yokels who consider their spiritual and moral commitments no less important than the minimum wage or the Endangered Species Act , nor even the Democrats ’ vulnerable post - Vietnam record on national security .
As Krugman sees it , the modern Republican Party has been taken over by radicals .
“ There has n’t been any corresponding radicalization of the Democratic Party , so the right - wing takeover of the G.O.P. is the underlying cause of today ’s bitter partisanship . ”
No two to tango for him .
The ascendancy of modern conservatism is “ an almost embarrassingly simple story , ” he says , and race is the key .
“ Much of the whole phenomenon can be summed up in just five words : Southern whites started voting Republican .
... End of story . ”
A fuller and more nuanced story might at least gesture toward the role that environmental and natural - resource issues have played in making red-state country out of the interior West , not to mention the unsettling effects of the “ value issues ” on voters well beyond Dixie .
And as for national security — well , as Krugman sees things , it was not Democratic bungling in the Iranian hostage crisis or humiliation in Somalia or feeble responses to the first bombing attack on the World Trade Center or the assault on the U.S.S.
Cole , but the runaway popularity of the Rambo films ( I ’m not making this up ) that hoodwinked the public into believing that the party of Carter and Clinton ( not to mention McGovern and Kucinich ) might not be the most steadfast guardian of the Republic ’s safety .
For all that he inveighs against the evils of partisanship , Krugman astonishingly concludes by repudiating the chimera of “ bipartisan compromise ” and declaring that “ to be a progressive , then , means being a partisan — at least for now . ”
Indeed , at times he seems more intent on settling his neocon adversaries ’ hash than on advancing solutions to vexed policy issues .
“ Yes , Virginia , there is a vast right - wing conspiracy , ” he writes , a sentence that both stylistically and substantively says much about the shortcomings of this book .
That assorted wing nuts have pretty much managed to hijack the Republican Party in recent years is scarcely in doubt .
That the market is at least occasionally fallible is also not at issue .
Nor is it deniable that the New Deal rendered the lives of millions of Americans more secure , and that they have become markedly less so in recent decades .
A tidal wave of risk - shifting — from defined - benefit to defined - contribution retirement plans , and from employer - financed to individually - paid health care insurance , to cite but two examples — has set millions of American families anxiously adrift on a sea of uncertainty .
Krugman ’s chapter on the imperative need for health care reform is the best in this book , a rueful reminder of the kind of skilled and accessible economic analysis of which he is capable , and how little of it is on display here .
Like the rants of Rush Limbaugh or the films of Michael Moore , Krugman ’s shrill polemic may hearten the faithful , but it will do little to persuade the unconvinced or to advance the national discussion of the important issues it addresses .
It may even deepen the very partisan divide he denounces .
Where is the distinguished economist when we need him ?
More to the point , where 's a decent reviewer when we need him ?
As Krugman notes in his response , David Kennedy is wrong about the history of prohibition , and the other " error " is a pretty trivial slip of writing 1964 instead of 1965 .
If those are the best examples of Krugman 's errors Kennedy ( as an historian himself ) can come up with , then you have to conclude that Krugman is on pretty solid ground with the historical story he tells .
The review also ignores a lot of evidence from political scientist Larry Bartels on values voting that supports Krugman 's position on the influence of racial politics .
The values voting conclusions are n't things Krugman simply asserts - as you might conclude from the review - Krugman reviews solid evidence before coming to this conclusion .
So when Kennedy launches into other reasons why voters may have supported Republicans , it does nothing to undermine Krugman 's thesis that a large amount of the change arises from racial politics .
The Bartels evidence is still there , nothing is presented in the review to counter it , and it paints a clear picture .
The author also takes issue with the statement that “ Yes , Virginia , there is a vast right - wing conspiracy , ” but once again he does not tell us about nor bother to try to rebut the careful , detailed discussion of right - wing institutions and their common funding sources that comes before this statement .
Krugman 's statement is a summary of this evidence , and to focus on the summary statement rather than than the evidence that supports it is not much of a rebuttal .
It 's too bad that Kennedy chose to argue that , in essence , " Democrats have problems too " -- as though that somehow excuses Republicans for issues like racial politics -- rather than dealing with the evidence Krugman presents concerning the political and economic changes that produced the New Gilded Age .
Update : Brad DeLong adds :
Update ( 12-12-2010 ) : For additional features not present in gitosis , check out gitolite .
Update ( 08-10-2008 ) :
For topics not covered here , I encourage everyone to read the gitosis README , bundled with the distribution .
There is also an example .
conf configuration file that illustrates more features than I have covered here .
I have been asked more and more these days , “ How do I host a Git repository ? ”
Usually it is assumed that some access control beyond simply read - only is involved ( some users have commit rights ) .
With access control comes issues of security , and that ’s a whole other bag of cats .
This post is about presenting an answer to this question , without the fuss .
The rest of this article will be a tutorial showing you how to host and manage Git repositories with access control , easily and safely .
I use an up and coming tool called gitosis that my friend Tv wrote to help make hosting git repos easier and safer .
It manages multiple repositories under one user account , using SSH keys to identify users .
However , users do * not* need shell accounts on the server , instead they will talk to one shared account that does not allow arbitrary commands .
Git itself is used to setup gitosis and manage the Git repos , which pleases the recursion - seeking orthogonal CS - side of my brain .
Assumptions : I take my examples from a Ubuntu Linux server .
While I have n’t tested other systems , I imagine different Linux distributions , FreeBSD , OS X , etc … would be similar .
Gitosis is written in Python , so you should have a copy of Python installed as well .
Enough talk , let ’s get down and dirty .
Install gitosis
gitosis is a tool for hosting git repositories ( I ’m repeating myself for those who skim :)
The first thing to do is grab a copy of gitosis and install it on your server :
1 2 cd ~/src git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git
Notice that gitosis is extremely light - weight .
The clone takes a mere couple seconds .
Less is more , and I like that a lot .
Next , install it like so :
1 2 cd gitosis python setup.py install
Do n’t use –prefix unless you like self - inflicted pain .
It is possible to install gitosis in a non-standard location , but it ’s not nice .
Read the Caveats section at the bottom and then come back here .
If you get this error :
1 - bash : python : command not found
or
1 2 3 4 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " setup.py " , line 2 , in ? from setuptools import setup , find_packages ImportError :
No module named setuptools
You have to install Python setuptools .
On Debian / Ubuntu systems , it ’s just :
1 sudo apt - get install python - setuptools
For other systems , someone tell me or leave a comment , so I can update this section and improve this tutorial .
The next thing to do is to create a user that will own the repositories you want to manage .
This user is usually called git , but any name will work , and you can have more than one per system if you really want to .
The user does not need a password , but does need a valid shell ( otherwise , SSH will refuse to work ) .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 sudo adduser \ -- system \ -- shell / bin/sh \ -- gecos ' git version control ' \ -- group \ -- disabled - password \ -- home / home / git \ git
You may change the home path to suit your taste .
A successful user creation will look similar to :
1 2 3 4 Adding system user `git '...
Adding new group `git ' ( 211 ) .
Adding new user `git ' ( 211 ) with group `git ' .
Creating home directory ` / home / git ' .
You will need a public SSH key to continue .
If you do n’t have one , you may generate one on your local computer :
1 ssh-keygen -t rsa
The public key will be in $ HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
Copy this file to your server ( the one running gitosis ) .
Next we will run a command that will sprinkle some magic into the home directory of the git user and put your public SSH key into the list of authorized keys .
1 sudo - H -u git gitosis - init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub
id_rsa.pub above is your public SSH key that you copied to the server .
I recommend you put it in / tmp so the git user wo n’t have permission problems when trying to read it .
Success looks like :
1 2 Initialized empty Git repository in ./ Initialized empty
Git repository in ./
( Yes , two times )
For good measure , let ’s make sure the post - update hook is set executable .
I ’ve seen it where sometimes it does n’t get set ( problem with older setuptools ) :
1 sudo chmod 755 / home / git/ repositories / gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update
Here some cool magic happens .
Run this on your local machine :
1 2 git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git cd gitosis-admin
You will now have a gitosis.conf file and keydir / directory :
1 2 3 4 ~/dev/gitosis-admin ( master ) $ ls -l total 8 - rw -r--r-- 1 garry garry 104 Nov 13 05:43 gitosis.conf drwxr-xr-x 3 garry garry 102 Nov 13 05:43 keydir /
This repository that you just cloned contains all the files ( right now , only 2 ) needed to create repositories for your projects , add new users , and defined access rights .
Edit the settings as you wish , commit , and push .
Once pushed , gitosis will immediately make your changes take effect on the server .
So we ’re using Git to host the configuration file and keys that in turn define how our Git hosting behaves .
That ’s just plain cool .
From this point on , you do n’t need to be on your server .
All configuration takes place locally and you push the changes to your server when you ’re ready for them to take effect .
Creating new repositories
This is where the fun starts .
Let ’s create a new repository to hold our project codenamed FreeMonkey .
Open up gitosis.conf and notice the default configuration :
1 2 3 4 5 [ gitosis ] [ group gitosis - admin ] writable = gitosis - admin members = jdoe
Your “ members ” line will hold your key filename ( without the .pub extension ) that is in keydir / .
In my example , it is “ jdoe ” , but for you it ’ll probably be a combination of your username and hostname .
To create a new repo , we just authorize writing to it and push .
To do so , add this to gitosis .
conf :
1 2 3 [ group myteam ] members = jdoe writable = free_monkey
This defines a new group called “ myteam ” , which is an arbitrary string .
“ jdoe ” is a member of myteam and will have write access to the “ free_monkey ” repo .
Save this addition to gitosis.conf , commit and push it :
1 2 git commit - a -m " Allow jdoe write access to free_monkey " git push
Now the user “ jdoe ” has access to write to the repo named “ free_monkey ” , but we still have n’t created a repo yet .
What we will do is create a new repo locally , and then push it :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 mkdir free_monkey cd free_monkey git init git remote add origin git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git # do some work , git add and commit files git push origin master : refs / heads / master
With the final push , you ’re off to the races .
The repository “ free_monkey ” has been created on the server ( in / home / git / repositories ) and you ’re ready to start using it like any ol ’ git repo .
Adding users
The next natural thing to do is to grant some lucky few commit access to the FreeMonkey project .
This is a simple two step process .
First , gather their public SSH keys , which I ’ll call “ alice.pub ” and “ bob.pub ” , and drop them into keydir / of your local gitosis - admin repository .
Second , edit gitosis.conf and add them to the “ members ” list .
1 2 3 4 cd gitosis- admin cp ~/alice.pub keydir / cp ~/bob.pub keydir / git add keydir / alice.pub keydir/bob.pub
Note that the key filename must have a “ .pub ” extension .
gitosis.conf changes :
1 2 3 4 [ group myteam ] - members = jdoe + members = jdoe alice bob writable = free_monkey
Commit and push :
1 2 git commit - a -m " Granted Alice and Bob commit rights to FreeMonkey " git push
That ’s it .
Alice and Bob can now clone the free_monkey repository like so :
1 git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git
Alice and Bob will also have commit rights .
Public access
If you are running a public project , you will have your users with commit rights , and then you ’ll have everyone else .
How do we give everyone else read - only access without fiddling w/ SSH keys ?
We just use git-daemon .
This is independent of gitosis and it comes with git itself .
1 sudo -u git git- daemon -- base - path=/ home/git/ repositories / -- export-all
This will make all the repositories you manage with gitosis read - only for the public .
Someone can then clone FreeMonkey like so :
1 git clone git://YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME/free_monkey.git
To export only some repositories and not others , you need to touch git - daemon - export - ok inside the root directory ( e.g. /home/git/repositories/free_monkey.git ) of each repo that you want public .
Then remove “ –export - all ” from the git - daemon command above .
More tricks
gitosis.conf can be set to do some other neat tricks .
Open example .conf in the gitosis source directory ( where you originally cloned gitosis way at the top ) to see a summary of all options .
You can specify some repos to be read - only ( opposite of writable ) , but yet not public .
A group members list can include another group .
And a few other tricks that I ’ll leave it to the reader to discover .
Caveats
If /home / git/.gitosis.conf on your server never seems to get updated to match your local copy ( they should match ) , even though you are making changes and pushing , it could be that your post - update hook is n’t executable .
Older versions of setuptools can cause this .
Be sure to fix that :
1 sudo chmod 755 / home / git/ repositories / gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update
If your Python goodies are in a non-standard location , you must additionally edit post- update and put an “ export PYTHONPATH = … ” line at the top .
Failure to do so will give you a Python stack trace the first time you try to push changes within gitosis - admin .
If you want to install gitosis in a non-standard location , I do n’t recommend it .
It ’s an edge case that the author has n’t run up against until I bugged him to help me get it working .
For the brave , you need to edit whatever file on your system controls the default PATH for a non-login , non-interactive shell .
On Ubuntu this is /etc / environment .
Add the path to gitosis - serve to the PATH line .
Also insert a line for PYTHONPATH and set it to your non-standard Python site - packages directory .
As an example , this is my /etc / environment :
1 2 PATH=" /home/garry/sys/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games "
PYTHONPATH=/home/garry/sys/lib/python2.4/site-packages
Be sure to logout and log back in after you make these changes .
Do n’t use the gitosis - init line I have above for the standard install , instead use this slightly modified one :
1 sudo - H -u git env PATH=$ PATH gitosis- init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub
Be sure to also set PYTHONPATH in your post - update hook as described above .
The * should * do it .
I am purposefully terse with this non-standard setup as I think not many people will use it .
HIt me up in # git on FreeNode if you need more info ( my nick is up_the_irons ) .
Non-standard SSH port
If you run SSH on a non-standard port on your server , do n’t use the syntax “ git@myserver.com :1234:/foo/bar ” , it wo n’t work .
Putting the port in the URL does n’t seem to make gitosis , or git , ( not sure which ) happy .
Instead , put this in your ~/.ssh / config file : 1 2 Host myserver.com Port 1234
Conclusion
Well , I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that it makes your Git hosting life easier .
This is public revision 10 .
Please let me know if you find mistakes , omissions , an easier way than what I described , etc …

誰が 「ソートするときに比較関数に『ランダムに1か-1を返す関数』を与えたらシャッフルできる」って言い出したのかしらないけど、真に受ける方も真に受ける方だと思う。
たとえばソート関数が下のような「リストの先頭の値をピボットにしてそれより大きいものと小さいものに振り分けるクイックソート」だったとする。比較関数の所はランダムにしてある。
>>> def quicksort ( xs ) : from random import random if len ( xs ) < 2 : return xs pivot = xs [ 0 ] left = [ ] right = [ ] for x in xs [ 1 :] : if random ( ) < 0.5 : left.append(x ) else : right.append(x ) return quicksort ( left ) + [ pivot ] + quicksort ( right )
で、その 「 ランダムソート 」 で[ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] をシャッフルしてみる。
>>> range ( 7 ) [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] >>> quicksort ( range ( 7 ) ) [ 4 , 1 , 3 , 6 , 0 , 2 , 5 ]
一見混ざっているように見える。
でそれを7000回やってシャッフルした結果の0番目に来る数を集めたリストを作ってみる。きちんとシャッフルされているなら当然「どの数字もだいたい1000回出現する」という結果になるはずだよね。
>>> sample = [ quicksort ( range ( 7 ) ) [ 0 ] for _ in range ( 7000 ) ]
じゃぁ表示してみよう。
>>> for i in range ( 7 ) : print i , sample.count( i ) 0 108 1 848 2 1102 3 1180 4 1227 5 1233 6 1302
見ての通り、0が出る確率がものすごく少ない。最初にピボットに選ばれる数は「残りの6個がすべてそのピボットよりも大きい」という場合しか先頭に来ないので、0.5を6回掛け合わせた確率でしか先頭に現れない。最初に選ぶピボットをどこに決めようがその数が先頭に来る確率はとても少なくなる。クイックソートが使われている限り、この方法で均等なシャッフルはできない。
プログラミングの勉強ってのはどこかの誰かが「こうすればできる」って言ったことをたくさん鵜呑みにして蓄えることじゃない。自分で納得するまでかみ砕かなくては、いくらたくさん飲み込んでも栄養にはならない。本当を言えば「嘘を嘘と見抜く能力」をつけて欲しいところだけども、まだその力がないのならせめて鵜呑みにする前にきちんと試してみたほうがいいのではないだろうか。

追記 ：Pythonの組み込みのsortedを使った場合を試してみたらやっぱり数字によって出現確率に差が出た。
>>> sample = [ sorted ( range ( 7 ) , cmp=lambda x , y: choice ( [ - 1,1 ] ) ) [ 0 ] for _ in range ( 70000 ) ] >>> for i in range ( 7 ) : print i , sample.count( i ) 0 17581 1 6827 2 8807 3 11613 4 7611 5 8089 6 9472

The astronomical valuation for Facebook is evidence that Microsoft executives believed they could not afford to lose out on the deal .
Google appears to be building a dominant position in the race to serve advertisements online .
Fearing it might lose control over the next generation of computer users , Microsoft has been trying to match and in some cases block Google ’s plans , even if that effort is costly .
“ We are now stepping outside what is typically a business decision , ” said Rob Enderle , the founder of the strategy concern Enderle Group .
“ This was almost personal .
I would n’t want to be the executive that ’s on the losing side at either firm . ”
A Google spokesman said the company had no comment .
Facebook is planning to comment on the deal later today .
Representatives of Facebook say the investment will allow it to add employees , expand overseas and aggressively develop its own advertising system that will tailor ads to the personal preferences users make public on their Facebook pages .
Facebook is expected to introduce such an ad network at an event in New York next month .
The Microsoft investment throws the value of the holdings of Facebook investors into the stratosphere .
Mark Zuckerberg , the 23 - year - old Facebook founder who dropped out of Harvard to build the company , owns a 20 percent share which is now valued at $ 3 billion .
Accel Partners , the venture capital firm that invested $ 12.7 million in May 2005 and owns 11 percent of Facebook , now holds stock worth $ 1.65 billion .

CSS is magical stuff .
In the right hands , it can transform the plainest of ( well - structured ) documents into a visual feast .
But it ’s not all fur coat and nae knickers ( as my granny used to say ) .
Here are some simple ways you can use CSS to improve the usability and accessibility of your site .
Even better , no sexy visuals will be harmed by the use of these techniques .
Promise .
Nae knickers
This is less of an accessibility tip , and more of a reminder to check that you ’ve got your body background colour specified .
If you ’re sitting there wondering why I ’m mentioning this , because it ’s a really basic thing , then you might be as surprised as I was to discover that from a sample of over 200 sites checked last year , 35 % of UK local authority websites were missing their body background colour .
Forgetting to specify your body background colour can lead to embarrassing gaps in coverage , which are not only unsightly , but can prevent your users reading the text on your site if they use a different operating system colour scheme .
All it needs is the following line to be added to your CSS file :
body {background - color : # fff;}
If you pair it with
color : # 000 ;
… you ’ll be assured of maintaining contrast for any areas you inadvertently forget to specify , no matter what colour scheme your user needs or prefers .
Even better , if you ’ve got standard reset CSS you use , make sure that default colours for background and text are specified in it , so you ’ll never be caught with your pants down .
At the very least , you ’ll have a white background and black text that ’ll prompt you to change them to your chosen colours .
Elbow room
Paying attention to your typography is important , but it ’s not just about making it look nice .
Careful use of the line - height property can make your text more readable , which helps everyone , but is particularly helpful for those with dyslexia , who use screen magnification or simply find it uncomfortable to read lots of text online .
When lines of text are too close together , it can cause the eye to skip down lines when reading , making it difficult to keep track of what you ’re reading across .
So , a bit of room is good .
That said , when lines of text are too far apart , it can be just as bad , because the eye has to jump to find the next line .
That not only breaks up the reading rhythm , but can make it much more difficult for those using Screen Magnification ( especially at high levels of magnification ) to find the beginning of the next line which follows on from the end of the line they ’ve just read .
Using a line height of between 1.2 and 1.6 times normal can improve readability , and using unit -less line heights help take care of any pesky browser calculation problems .
For example :
p { font - family : " Lucida Grande " , Lucida , Verdana , Helvetica , sans - serif ; font - size : 1em ; line - height : 1.3 ; }
or if you want to use the shorthand version :
p { font : 1em/1.3 " Lucida Grande " , Lucida , Verdana , Helvetica , sans - serif ; }
View some examples of different line - heights , based on default text size of 100% / 1em .

Transformers : Initial case in disguise
Nobody wants to shout at their users , but there are some occasions when you might legitimately want to use uppercase on your site .
Avoid screen - reader pronunciation weirdness ( where , for example , CONTACT US would be read out as Contact U S , which is not the same thing – unless you really are offering your users the chance to contact the United States ) caused by using uppercase by using title case for your text and using the often neglected text - transform property to fake uppercase .
For example :
.uppercase { text - transform : uppercase }
Do n’t overdo it though , as uppercase text is harder to read than normal text , not to mention the whole SHOUTING thing .
Linky love
When it comes to accessibility , keyboard only users ( which includes those who use voice recognition software ) who can see just fine are often forgotten about in favour of screen reader users .
This Christmas , share the accessibility love and light up those links so all of your users can easily find their way around your site .
The link outline
AKA : the focus ring , or that dotted box that goes around links to show users where they are on the site .
The techniques below are intended to supplement this , not take the place of it .
You may think it ’s ugly and want to get rid of it , especially since you ’re going to the effort of tarting up your links .
Do n’t .
Just do n’t .
The non-underlined underline
If you listen to Jacob Nielsen , every link on your site should be underlined so users know it ’s a link .
You might disagree with him on this ( I know I do ) , but if you are choosing to go with underlined links , in whatever state , then remove the default underline and replacing it with a border that ’s a couple of pixels away from the text .
The underline is still there , but it ’s no longer cutting off the bottom of letters with descenders ( e.g. , g and y ) which makes it easier to read .
This is illustrated in Examples 1 and 2 .
You can modify the three lines of code below to suit your own colour and border style preferences , and add it to whichever link state you like .
text - decoration : none ; border - bottom : 1px #000 solid ; padding - bottom : 2 px ;
Standing out from the crowd
Whatever way you choose to do it , you should be making sure your links stand out from the crowd of normal text which surrounds them when in their default state , and especially in their hover or focus states .
A good way of doing this is to reverse the colours when on hover or focus .
Well - focused
Everyone knows that you can use the : hover pseudo class to change the look of a link when you mouse over it , but , somewhat ironically , people who can see and use a mouse are the group who least need this extra visual clue , since the cursor handily ( sorry ) changes from an arrow to a hand .
So spare a thought for the non-pointing device users that visit your site and take the time to duplicate that hover look by using the : focus pseudo class .
Of course , the internets being what they are , it ’s not quite that simple , and predictably , Internet Explorer is the culprit once more with it ’s frustrating lack of support for : focus .
Instead it applies the : active pseudo class whenever an anchor has focus .
What this means in practice is that if you want to make your links change on focus as well as on hover , you need to specify focus , hover and active .
Even better , since the look and feel necessarily has to be the same for the last three states , you can combine them into one rule .
So if you wanted to do a simple reverse of colours for a link , and put it together with the non-underline underlines from before , the code might look like this :
a : link { background : # fff ; color : #000 ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : none ; border - bottom : 1px #000 solid ; padding - bottom : 2 px ; } a:visited { background : # fff ; color : # 800080 ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : none ; border - bottom : 1px #000 solid ; padding - bottom : 2 px ; } a : focus , a : hover , a: active { background : #000 ; color : # fff ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : none ; border - bottom : 1px #000 solid ; padding - bottom : 2 px ; }
Example 3 shows what this looks like in practice .
Location , Location , Location
To take this example to it ’s natural conclusion , you can add an id of current ( or something similar ) in appropriate places in your navigation , specify a full set of link styles for current , and have a navigation which , at a glance , lets users know which page or section they ’re currently in .
Example navigation using location indicators .
and the source code
Conclusion
All the examples here are intended to illustrate the concepts , and should not be taken as the absolute best way to format links or style navigation bars – that ’s up to you and whatever visual design you ’re using at the time .
They ’re also not the only things you should be doing to make your site accessible .
Above all , remember that accessibility is for life , not just for Christmas .

BBC News , Mogadishu
Rising from the ruins of the Mogadishu skyline are signs of one of Somalia 's few success stories in the anarchy of recent years .
Mobile phone masts are among the few new structures in Mogadishu A host of mobile phone masts testifies to the telecommunications revolution which has taken place despite the absence of any functioning national government since 1991 .
Three phone companies are engaged in fierce competition for both mobile and landline customers , while new internet cafes are being set up across the city and the entire country .
It takes just three days for a landline to be installed - compared with waiting - lists of many years in neighbouring Kenya , where there is a stable , democratic government .
And once installed , local calls are free for a monthly fee of just $ 10 .
International calls cost 50 US cents a minute , while surfing the web is charged at 50 US cents an hour - " the cheapest rate in Africa " according to the manager of one internet cafe .
But how do you establish a phone company in a country where there is no government ?
No monopoly
In some respects , it is actually easier .
There is no need to get a licence and there is no state - run monopoly which prevents new competitors being established .
Voices of Somali internet users

And of course there is no - one to demand any taxes , which is one reason why prices are so low .
" The government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled , we were free to set up our own business , " says Abdullahi Mohammed Hussein , products and services manager of Telcom Somalia , which was set up in 1994 when Mogadishu was still a war - zone .
" We saw a huge gap in the market , as all previous services had been destroyed .
There was a massive demand . "
The main airport and port were destroyed in the fighting but businessmen have built small airstrips and use natural harbours , so the phone companies are still able to import their equipment .
Despite the absence of law and order and a functional court system , bills are paid and contracts are enforced by relying on Somalia 's traditional clan system , Mr Abdullahi says .
Mobile target
But in a country divided into hundreds of fiefdoms run by rival warlords , security is a major concern .
While Telcom Somalia has some 25,000 mobile customers - and a similar number have land lines - you very rarely see anyone walking along the streets of Mogadishu chatting on their phone , in case this attracts the attention of a hungry gunman .
We are very interested in paying taxes
Abdullahi Mohammed Hussein
Telcom Somalia
Life in Somalia : Have Your Say
The phone companies themselves say they are not targeted by the militiamen , even if thieves occasionally steal some of their wires .
Mahdi Mohammed Elmi has been managing the Wireless African Broadband Telecoms internet cafe in the heart of Mogadishu , surrounded by the bustling and chaotic Bakara market , for almost two years .
" I have never had a problem with security , " he says and points out that they have just a single security guard at the front door .
Mr Abdullahi says the warlords realise that if they cause trouble for the phone companies , the phones will stop working again , which nobody wants .
" We need good relations with all the faction leaders .
We do n't interfere with them and they do n't interfere with us .
They want political power and we leave them alone , " he says .
Selling goats on the net
While the three phone companies - Telcom , Nationlink and Hormuud - are engaged in bitter competition for phone customers , they have co-operated to set up the Global Internet Company to provide the internet infrastructure .
Somali traders say if business is better without a government

Manager Abdulkadir Hassan
Ahmed says that within 1.5 km of central Mogadishu , customers - mostly internet cafes - can enjoy service at 150 Mb / second through a Long Reach Ethernet .
Elsewhere , they can have a wireless connection at 11 Mb / s.
He says his company is able to work anywhere in Somalia , whichever faction is in charge locally .
" Even small , remote villages are connected to the internet , as long as they have a phone line , " he says .
The internet sector in Somalia has two main advantages over many of its Africa neighbours .
There is a huge diaspora around the world - between one and three million people , compared with an estimated seven million people in Somalia - who remain in contact with their friends and relatives back home .
Somalis send e-mails in their own language E- mail is the cheapest way of staying in touch and many Somalis can read and write their own language , instead of relying on English or French , which restricts internet users to a smaller number of well educated people .
Just two days after it was opened , the Orbit internet cafe in south Mogadishu 's km5 was already pretty busy , with people checking their e-mail accounts , a livestock exporter sending out his invoices and two nurses doing medical research .
Video calling And Somalia 's telecoms revolution is far from over .
" We are planning to introduce 3G technology , including live video calling and mobile internet , next year , " says Mr Abdullahi .
But despite their success , the telecoms companies say that like the population at large , they are desperate to have a government .
Mogadishu's phone engineers are going to be kept busy " We are very interested in paying taxes , " says Mr Abdullahi - not a sentiment which often passes the lips of a high - flying businessman .
And Mr Abdulkadir at the Global Internet Company fully agrees .
" We badly need a government , " he says .
" Everything starts with security - the situation across the country .
" All the infrastructure of the country has collapsed - education , health and roads .
We need to send our staff abroad for any training . "
Another problem for companies engaged in the global telecoms business is paying their foreign partners .
At present , they use Somalia 's traditional " Hawala " money transfer companies to get money to Dubai , the Middle East 's trading and financial hub .
With a government would come a central bank , which would make such transactions far easier .
Taxes would mean higher prices but Mr Abdullahi says that Somalia 's previous governments have kept taxes low and hopes this will continue under the regime due to start work in the coming months .
Somalia 's telecoms companies are looking forward to an even brighter future with the support of a functioning government - as long as it does not impose punitive tax rates or state control in a sector which obviously needs very little help to thrive .

And all four leading Republican candidates for the 2008 nomination have turned down an invitation to a debate on minority issues scheduled to air on PBS this week .
Yet if the marchers at Jena reminded us that America still has n’t fully purged itself of the poisonous legacy of slavery , it would be wrong to suggest that the nation has made no progress .
Racism , though not gone , is greatly diminished : both opinion polls and daily experience suggest that we are truly becoming a more tolerant , open society .
And the cynicism of the “ Southern strategy ” introduced by Richard Nixon , which delivered decades of political victories to Republicans , is now starting to look like a trap for the G.O.P .
One of the truly remarkable things about the contest for the Republican nomination is the way the contenders have snubbed not just blacks — who , given the G.O.P. ’s modern history , probably wo n’t vote for a Republican in significant numbers no matter what — but Hispanics .
In July , all the major contenders refused invitations to address the National Council of La Raza , which Mr. Bush addressed in 2000 .
Univision , the Spanish - language TV network , had to cancel a debate scheduled for Sept. 16 because only John McCain was willing to come .
If this sounds like a good way to ensure defeat in future elections , that ’s because it is : Hispanics are a rapidly growing force in the electorate .
But to get the Republican nomination , a candidate must appeal to the base — and the base consists , in large part , of Southern whites who carry over to immigrants the same racial attitudes that brought them into the Republican fold to begin with .
As a result , you have the spectacle of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney , pragmatists on immigration issues when they actually had to govern in diverse states , trying to reinvent themselves as defenders of Fortress America .
And both Hispanics and Asians , another growing force in the electorate , are getting the message .
Last year they voted overwhelmingly Democratic , by 69 percent and 62 percent respectively .
In other words , it looks as if the Republican Party is about to start paying a price for its history of exploiting racial antagonism .
If that happens , it will be deeply ironic .
But it will also be poetic justice .

Where is Django ’s blog application ?
In terms of people looking for sample code or example applications to use / learn from , “ where can I find a good Django - powered blogging application ” is probably at the top of the frequently - asked questions list both on django - users and in the IRC ; part of this is simply that , right now , there is no “ definitive ” Django blogging application ; there are a bunch of them available if you go looking , but you ’re not likely to get anyone to recommend one of them as “ the ” Django blogging app ( unless the person doing the recommending happens to be the author of one of them ) .
In a larger sense , though , I think there ’s a big gap between what people want / expect / look for from a Django - based blog and what feels “ natural ” to do in Django , and that gap is probably the reason why there is n’t — and may never be — a definitive Django blogging application .
As it turns out , this also leads neatly into some important ideas in designing Django applications and some speculation on an important shift in methodology , so let ’s take a deeper look .
How I built this site
When I sat down to rewrite my Django - powered blogging application , I had a specific feature list in mind and started out implementing things on it one by one , but along the way an interesting thing happened : instead of ending up with a single all - in - one application to handle everything I wanted , I kept spinning off separate applications to handle specific bits of functionality .
Most of the apps I ’ve released over the past six months — things like comment_utils , the contact - form app , etc. — started out as features which were going to be integrated into my blog app , but became applications in their own right .
The reason for that is pretty simple : Django encourages a development model based around tightly - focused “ pluggable ” applications .
I needed a contact form , for example , but that ’s something I ’m going to need for lots of different projects , so I spent a couple of nights making it a bit more generic and reusable , then released it as its own application .
Ditto my template utilities and comment - moderation code .
When I wrote the app that powers djangosnippets early in the year , I did the same thing : user registration was something I knew I ’d need all over the place , so tying it tightly to the snippets app , when I could just as easily break it out into a reusable application , would n’t have made much sense .
So when I did finally finish my blogging application , it was pretty lightweight ; the code is online ( though unsupported and undocumented right now , aside from docstrings embedded in the code itself ) , but you ’ll find that it ’s really just three models and some wrappers around generic views .
Everything else was supplied by other applications ; django.contrib.admin provides the admin interface , django.contrib.auth does what little authentication I need , django.contrib.comments provides the comments system , and a combination of other contrib apps and my own and other folks ’ third - party applications round out the full functionality of this site .
In general , that ’s what I personally want from a Django blogging solution : something that can be plugged into any site I happen to be working on , and which is happy to “ do one thing and do it well ” , trusting that other applications will take care of functionality outside the direct scope of writing a blog .
But that ’s not the only way to do “ blogging ”
Meanwhile , most popular blogging software — Wordpress , Movable Type , Textpattern , etc. — is oriented around almost the opposite philosophy : the blog application is a monolithic all - in - one system which provides everything : blogging , user auth , templating , admin interface , plugin API , the whole nine yards .
There ’s nothing wrong with that , of course , and the popularity of software like Wordpress is a testament to how effective this methodology can be , which is probably why so many discussions of Django - based blogging software end up involving the phrase “ Wordpress clone ” at some point .
Having a single piece of software to install is an extremely powerful technique for improving adoption .
But it ’s not something that really seems like it ’d fit well with Django : you could write a monolithic Wordpress clone using Django if you wanted to , but you ’d be reinventing an awful lot of wheels and tightly coupling them all to each other , which seems like it goes against general best practices for developing Django applications .
Or , perhaps , focuses on a different use case than Django typically does : Django came out of an environment where the ability to put a site together by combining a default set of reusable “ stock ” applications and a few customized site - specific apps was essential , and that sense of being focused less on monolithic “ all - in - one ” applications and more on sort of “ reusable building blocks ” remains in Django ( and is generally a good thing , if you ’re a web developer looking to build things on a deadline ) .
Which brings us to the gap
I think this points to the primary reason why there ’s not a “ definitive ” Django blogging application : writing one app which would handle all the things expected from a traditional blogging package like Wordpress simply does n’t feel natural in Django .
Again , that ’s not to say it could n’t be done , just that there ’d be an inevitable temptation to start spinning functionality off to separate applications .
I ’ve been there , I ’ve done that and I know that sooner or later you just get fed up feeling like you ’re going against the grain .
And from the perspective of a developer using Django , a Wordpress - style self - contained “ all - in - one ” solution probably wo n’t be as attractive as something which can be plugged into an existing site and take advantage of other standard and / or popular Django applications .
An app that requires its own administrative interface and user auth system separate from django.contrib.admin and django.contrib.auth , for example , would always be a second - class citizen in the larger ecosystem of Django applications .
How to resolve this ?
At work , we develop , use and sell an online publishing system , geared towards news organizations .
It ’s called Ellington , and it ’s the system from which Django was “ extracted ” , in much the same way that Basecamp is the system from which Rails was extracted .
Ellington is not a single application , though ; it ’s actually a collection of Django applications , each of which focuses on a narrow aspect of doing online news , but all of which complement ( and in some cases depend upon ) each other .
That ’s been a great model for us , because it opens up the ability to build sites by mixing and matching a subset of the standard Ellington apps , or to sell “ editions ” of Ellington focused at different types of sites .
Ultimately , I think the only way to resolve the tension between the desire for “ all - in - one ” packages and pluggable “ building - block ” apps is going to be this sort of approach : rather than a single definitive “ Django blog ” application , for example , I think it ’s much more likely we ’ll see a collection of applications which , taken together , provide all the key functionality ( while allowing a certain amount of mixing and matching in order to customize the finished product ) .
I do n’t have any idea what the packaging for such a thing would look like , since I ’m almost certain that all of the apps wo n’t be developed by the same person or group of people , but it ’s something I ’ve been thinking about a lot lately , and I ’d love to hear ideas :)

“ The true economic impact of climate change is fraught with ‘ hidden ’ costs . ”
CLIMATE CHANGE-US : Delay Now , Pay Dearly Later
By Stephen Leahy
Oct 16 ( IPS ) – The United States is facing hundreds of billions of dollars in weather - related damages in coming years if it does not act urgently on climate change , the first - ever comprehensive economic assessment of the problem has found .
The costs of inaction on climate change on U.S. infrastructure , and its agricultural , manufacturing and public service sectors , will far outweigh the costs involved in making the needed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , according to the report , “ The U.S. Economic Impacts of Climate Change and the Costs of Inaction “ , released Tuesday .
“ We ’re making billions of dollars of infrastructure investments every year and often without taking impacts of climate change into account , ” said report co-author Matthias Ruth , director of the University of Maryland ’s Centre for Integrative Environmental Research .
“ Climate change will affect every American economically in significant , dramatic ways , and the longer it takes to respond , the greater the damage and the higher the costs , ” Ruth told IPS .
“ The true economic impact of climate change is fraught with ‘ hidden ’ costs , ” the report concludes .
It adds that these costs will vary regionally and will put a strain on public sector budgets .
For example , the combined impacts of storms on the U.S. since 1980 have surpassed 560 billion dollars .
Hurricane Katrina alone accounted for nearly 200 billion dollars in economic losses .
More frequent and intense storms — a virtual certainty , many climate scientists warn — will raise the price - tag even higher .
Storm damage is just one factor in what is fast becoming a cascade of costs amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars , the report documents .
In the U.S. west and northwest , the cost of fire suppression and property damages will run in the billions due to changes in precipitation patterns and snow pack .
The Great Plains will experience increased frequency and severity of flooding and drought , resulting in additional billions of dollars in damages to crops and property .
The already sinking water levels will go lower in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system , driving up shipping costs and producing major impacts on the midwest manufacturing sector .
Sea level rise and storm surges will eat away valuable property along the Atlantic coast — a single storm surge event can cost 2.0 billion to 6.5 billion dollars .
Drought will take firmer hold of the south and southwest , with costly impacts on agriculture , industry and households .
For the Central Valley in California alone , the economy - wide loss during the driest years is predicted to be around 6.0 billion dollars

Today in my series of photos from my travels : this baby bath on sale at the John Lewis store in London 's Oxford Street .
It 's basically a bucket ( the instructions refer to it as " womb - shaped " ) that you wash your baby in .
Seems reasonable , but once you use the enclosed stand , it begins to look a little bit too much like " baby in a blender " for my taste .

The lawsuit names Houston city and its police department
The officers are suing Houston and its police department , claiming status and pay have been reduced .
The department imposed the ban in 2005 , saying gas masks could not be sealed over facial hair in bioterror attacks .
The officers say the ban is unfair on those with a particular skin condition that reacts to shaving and primarily affects black men .
The condition is called pseudofolliculitis barbae and sufferers who shave can be subjected to rashes , ingrowing hairs and severe irritation .
Two of the plaintiffs , Sgts Shelby Stewart and Kenneth Perkins , said they wore goatees because of the condition .
They said it affected more than 100 policemen in the department .
Police review
Sgt Stewart , who has been on the force for 26 years , told the Houston Chronicle newspaper : " When they took us out of uniform and told us we could n't work second jobs in uniform , that meant that we had to take a financial hit that most officers would not take . "
The lawsuit argues the ban disproportionately affects black officers .
Sgt Stewart said : " We made decisions that we had to make based on civil rights . "
Houston police denied the reassignments were demotions and said it had changed its policy over the issue .
Police lawyer Craig Ferrell said officers who were unable to shave would be now allowed to wear a special mask over their beard .

American casualties in Iraq have declined dramatically over the last 90 days to levels not seen since 2006 , and the White House has attributed the decline to the surge of 35-40,000 U.S. combat troops .
But a closer look suggests a different explanation .
More than two years of sectarian violence have replaced one country called Iraq with three emerging states : one Kurdish , one Sunni , and one Shiite .
This created what a million additional U.S. troops could not : a strategic opportunity to capitalize on the Sunni - Shiite split .
So after Shiite leader Muqtada al - Sadr decided to restrain his Mahdi army from attacking U.S. forces , General David Petraeus and his commanders began cutting deals with Sunni Arab insurgents , agreeing to allow these Sunnis to run their own affairs and arm their own security forces in return for cooperation with U.S. forces against Al Qaeda fighters .
As part of the bargain , the Sunni leaders obtained both independence from the hated Shiite - dominated government , which pays far more attention to Tehran ’s interests than to Washington ’s , and money — lots of money .
Striking such a “ sheikhs for sale ” deal ( whether they be Sunni or Shiite ) is nothing new in the Arab world .
The men who ran the British Empire routinely paid subsidies in gold to unruly tribal leaders from the Khyber Pass to the headwaters of the Nile .
( Of course , British subsidies were a pittance compared with the billions Britain extracted from its colonies in Africa and Asia . )
While the arrangement reached by U.S. military commanders and dubbed the “ Great Awakening ” has allowed the administration and its allies to declare the surge a success , it carries long - term consequences that are worrisome , if not perilous .
The reduction in U.S. casualties is good news .
But transforming thousands of anti-American Sunni insurgents into U.S. - funded Sunni militias is not without cost .
In fact , the much - touted progress in Iraq could lead to a situation in which American foreign - policy interests are profoundly harmed and the Middle East is plunged into even a larger crisis than currently exists .
First , a warning .
We do n’t know much about developments within Iraq .
Military officers who have recently served in Iraq tell me they do n’t truly understand Iraq ’s complexity or the duplicitous nature of the Iraqis they work with .
In my conservations with them , they raise troubling questions that do n’t lend themselves to sound - bite answers on talk radio or the evening news .
Is the Great Awakening inside the Sunni Arab community the road to Iraq ’s stability , or is it just a pause for Sunni rearmament and reorganization ?
Is it a means to secure American military bases inside an emerging Sunni client state generously supplied with cash from Saudi Arabia , a kind of cordon sanitaire along the fault line that separates the Sunni Arab world from Shiite Iran and its beachhead in southern Iraq ?
Does this development mean America wins when our former Sunni Arab enemies regain power in central Iraq ?
Or — here ’s the most disturbing question — will the presumed successes of today be catalysts for yet bloodier civil war inside Iraq or , worse , larger regional war ?
With eyes firmly fixed on Jan. 20 , 2009 — the departure date for this administration — the White House and its generals are n’t publicly addressing such policy implications .
They ’re not interested in explaining why the world ’s most powerful military establishment has resorted to buying off its enemies , effectively supplanting counterinsurgency with cash - based cooptation .
Officers who ’ve served in Iraq warn that the Great Awakening could be transitory .
“ The Sunni insurgents are following a ‘ fight , bargain , subvert , fight ’ approach to get what they want , ” said one colonel .
So Americans need to explore whether U.S. forces are courting long - term strategic success , or if the expedient cash surge is leading U.S. forces into a new phase of conflict that could engulf the region and create a perfect storm .
In four years of occupation and civil war , hundreds of thousands of Arabs , including many Sunnis , have been killed , wounded , or incarcerated .
About two million more Arabs , most of them Sunni , have fled the country .
How many more Sunni and Shiite Arabs have died over the last two years as a result of the civil war is unknown , but the numbers are likely greater than anyone in the Pentagon or State Department is prepared to admit .
That the Sunni Arab population is tired of fighting is beyond dispute , but winning Sunni Arab hearts and minds in the aftermath of the last four years ’ violence seems a remote possibility .
So , in the absence of the common interest in disposing of Al Qaeda ’s unwanted foreign fighters and war fatigue , what besides cash motivates the Great Awakening ?
Officers familiar with Iraq ’s Sunni Arab leaders insist these leaders genuinely believe that if left alone by U.S. occupation forces and receiving modest financial support from Saudi Arabia they can eventually crush the Shiite militias and regain their dominant position inside Iraq .
If true , the “ awakening ” may simply be an opportunity for Iraq ’s Sunni Arabs to consolidate and prepare without American interference for an inevitable , future showdown with the Shiites whether U.S. forces withdraw or not .
A former U.S. Army battalion commander with extensive service in Iraq reports , “ It is my sense the Sunni Arab leaders are using the pause in the fight with U.S. forces to take a breather , harden and regroup themselves much like a conventional army would rest and refit after a major battle .
Besides , who do the generals in Baghdad think are targeting and killing Iraqi Security Forces ?
It ’s the Sunni insurgents .
They ’re just not shooting at us right now . ”
One of the unspoken assumptions that underpins the “ awakening ” is that U.S. occupation forces can place untold thousands of Sunni insurgents on the U.S. government ’s payroll , allowing them to rearm and recuperate inside Sunni - pure enclaves while U.S. forces open a new front in the war against the Shiite militias .
Thus far , Tehran has advised its Shiite friends in Iraq to restrain their fighters in the hope the U.S. occupation will end and allow the Shiites to consolidate their victory .
The question now is whether the Shiite militias will continue to lie low or risk the kind of campaign against U.S. forces that the Sunnis waged for nearly four years .
No one knows the answer .
But it is doubtful Muqtada al - Sadr will do nothing as U.S. forces halt operations against the Shiites ’ old enemies and allow these enemies to rebuild .
He may well step up attacks on Americans , assisted by the Shiite - dominated Iraqi Security Forces .
And if that happens , retaliatory attacks by U.S. forces on the Mahdi Army could mobilize the Shiite population behind Muqtada al - Sadr in the fight against their old Sunni Baathist oppressors who are now openly allied with the Americans .
In such a battle — a revived civil war — what the majority Shiite Iraqi army will do is another unknown .
What happens in Iraq will not stay in Iraq .
That is , other states have an interest in the Sunni - Shiite fight .
In many Arab countries , particularly the United States ’ oil - providing protectorates in the Persian Gulf , the ruling elite fear Iran and oppose the emergence of a Shiite - dominated Iraq , something the U.S. military occupation effectively created when it sided with the Shiites against the Sunnis in 2003 .
These ruling elites worry that they too could be replaced one by one with “ faithful ” Sharia - based Islamists .
The Bush State Department seems determined to exploit such fears , promising that giant American bases like the 30,000 - man Balad Air Base will offer the Sunni elites security in the form of an anti-Iranian Maginot line that stretches from the Indian Ocean to the Turkish border .
This may be the Bush administration ’s strategic ploy to win the support ( or acquiescence ) of neighboring Sunni Arab countries for continuing the U.S. military occupation of Iraq long after Bush leaves office .
However , what the corrupt ruling elites of the Arab world agree to and what their restive populations will accept are very different things — meaning that a status quo predicated on U.S. troops remaining stationed in Iraq lacks stability .
Tehran is certainly watching developments in Iraq with interest .
The Iranian leaders have turned out to be very competent chess players in foreign affairs , carefully calculating each move .
As demonstrated by the recent National Intelligence Estimate ’s reassessment of Iranian nuclear aims , the Bush administration and its generals are , at best , poker players .
Every raise and bluff by the Bush administration and its generals in Baghdad has been effectively countered with some very thoughtful , strategic moves by Tehran — moves aimed at cultivating close relationships with Turkey , Russia , China , and even Europe .
This brings us to the big concern :
The unresolved ( if not heightened ) instability within Iraq could lead to unforeseen consequences of a strategic nature — say , a war between Turkey and the Kurds .
Inside Turkey , the United States is viewed as a false friend , and as having betrayed the interests of its steadfast Turkish ally .
Not only has Washington failed to end Kurdish support in Iraq for the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) , which advocates independence for Kurds inside Turkey , but the United States also occupied Iraq over Ankara ’s strong objections .
These points of friction coincide with an Islamic revival and a growing desire within Turkey for an assertion of national power .
Like the Orthodox Church and Russian nationalism , Islam is inextricably intertwined with Turkish identity , culture , and history .
According to the Pew Research Center , only 9 percent of Turks still hold a favorable view of the United States , a figure that places Turkey last of 46 countries surveyed .
Turks now see America as a threat to Turkish national security .
The anti-American attitude has been reinforced in the past few years within popular culture .
In the Turkish blockbuster Valley of the Wolves Iraq , a small Turkish force heroically battles an evil U.S. military commander and his troops .
In Metal Storm , a recent best - selling work of fiction , an all - out war between Ankara and Washington in 2007 is described , a war Turkey wins with the aid of Russian and European support .
Iran suspects it is a matter of when , not if , the Turks intervene in northern Iraq .
Turkey , which boasts the largest army in NATO , is the 500 - pound gorilla of the Muslim world and Iran knows it .
And anti-Kurdish sentiment is leading to an alliance between Iran , Turkey , and Syria , each of which fear growing Kurdish independence .
It ’s hard to imagine a worse outcome for the United States than the sudden intervention of 100,000 Turkish troops in northern Iraq .
Turkish intervention would rob the United States of the support of Kurdish troops that are now policing northern Iraq against Al Qaeda and containing the Sunni insurgency .
And the Iranians , who are the real power behind the Shiite - dominated Baghdad government , would support a Turkish military intervention .
( Russia and China might support the anti-Kurdish alliance , too . )
All this could well embolden the Sunni Arab insurgents to renew their war against the U.S. military .
In the midst of this , the Saudis , Egyptians , and Gulf oil protectorates might even turn to the Turks , the natural leaders of the Sunni Muslim world , as a preferable alternative to their ties with the West and Israel .
And add to this mix the instability within nuclear - armed Pakistan .
This could all lead to a dreaded situation in which the United States finds itself stuck in the middle of a regional war , with the potential for chaos in Iraq on the rise and Iran ’s influence in Iraq growing .
Which brings us back to the Great Awakening .
As 2008 approaches , all we can say with certainty is that unrelenting Arab hatred of the U.S. military presence in Iraq and the nature of the Sunni - Shiite struggle will make it unlikely that the cash - for - cooperation strategy will buy Iraq genuine stability , let alone the legitimate political order that is needed .
( In the Saidiyah neighborhood of Baghdad , U.S. military officers have groups of “ concerned citizens ” — mainly Sunni — on the payroll .
And the office of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has tried to undermine this effort , fearing the United States is organizing a rival Sunni force . )
Wherever American forces operate , they make a difference to their surroundings , but even officers with years of service in Iraq doubt that whatever the U.S. military builds for Iraq will survive the withdrawal of U.S. military power .
History supports their conclusion .
The last thousand years of history demonstrate that the imposition of foreign , particularly Western Christian , political systems or control on Muslim Arabs through military occupation has no chance of enduring permanently .
The storm may not hit soon .
Until January 20 , 2009 , there is a high probability that the Arabs will take all the cash the generals are willing to give them , make minimal trouble , and bide their time .
The Turks also prefer to wait for U.S. forces to leave or draw down before they intervene to eliminate the Kurdish threat .
And Iran is nothing if not patient .
That said , if the next administration fails to disengage its forces from Iraq and renews the determination to hold on to the country , if it does not renounce the myth that America ’s mission in the world is to impose American concepts of political order on foreign peoples burdened with undeveloped economies and dysfunctional societies , all bets are off .
Sunni and Shiite patience may well wear out , neighboring powers may cooperate to intervene , and this worst - case scenario ( or one just as frightening ) may eventually come to pass , compelling the United States to fight a major regional war far from its shores , one that is irrelevant to its strategic interests .
Meanwhile , thanks to superficial analysis and weak reporting from the media , the right questions about the “ awakening ” are going unasked and , therefore , unanswered .
If the Marine Corps leadership were able to achieve a cease - fire with the Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province , a place where U.S. forces sustained a disproportionate number of their casualties on a monthly basis over the last three years , was it really necessary to commit additional U.S. combat troops ?
Why was it not possible to extend the Anbar model to the rest of Sunni - held Iraq ?
Or did the generals in Baghdad begin cutting deals with the Sunni insurgents only when the mounting casualties from the surge in the spring and early summer of 2007 compelled them to do so ?
But the main problem is the belief held by U.S. policymakers and generals that the critical issue in Iraq is tactics , not the overall mission : occupying and trying to control a Muslim Arab country .
Given the conventional wisdom that the U.S. counterinsurgency efforts are working , the imperial hubris at the top of the Bush administration , and the complacency in Congress , the conditions are ideal for a spin - off war that could cause us one day to wonder how we Americans could have ever been so stupid as to occupy Iraq .
Remember John McCain ?
Oh , sure you do now , but will you remember him 20 years from now ?
If history is any guide , McCain 's 2000 campaign will end up on the curio shelf next to John Anderson 's presidential run in 1980 or Paul Simon 's campaign in 1988 .
And yet , as Al Gore and George W. Bush vie for the presidency this month , it 's easy to imagine a very different election — one that might better reflect the true wishes of the people .
As late as February of this year , McCain 's " Straight Talk Express " was on a roll .
He won the New Hampshire primary , hit a bump in South Carolina , then won a highly publicized Michigan primary , in spite of the Michigan governor 's promise to deliver the state to George W. Bush .
The news media loved McCain , and so did the voters .
In a February 7 CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll , more Americans thought favorably of him than of any other candidate .
When the poll was repeated on February 28 , his lead had widened : 66 percent had a favorable opinion of him compared with 59 percent for Al Gore , 57 percent for George W. Bush , and 54 percent for Bill Bradley .
Yet nine days later , McCain was out of the race .
What happened ?
The short answer is Super Tuesday .
McCain was wiped out in the delegate - rich states of California and New York , while winning only a few small states in New England .
The loss in California , a winner - take - all primary , hurt most .
An exit poll by the Sacramento Bee suggested that McCain had been too critical of right - wing religious leaders .
The poll also showed that voters believed Bush was more likely to beat Gore in November than McCain was .
Yet the same voters , in the same exit poll , said they would vote for Gore over Bush ( 51 to 43 percent ) , and they would vote for McCain over Gore ( 48 to 43 percent ) .
While campaign strategists and political pundits comb through the wreckage to see where McCain went wrong , ordinary voters would do well to raise a different set of questions .
All the signs suggest that the most popular candidate — a candidate who could have drawn voters from both parties — is not on the ballot this November .
If a candidate like McCain can't win , is something wrong with our election system ?
The answer , say voting theorists Donald Saari of the University of California at Irvine and Steven Brams of New York University , is a resounding yes .
America 's presidential election system is fundamentally flawed , they argue , because both the primaries and the election are based on the plurality vote .
McCain is just the most recent candidate done in by the paradoxes of election mathematics .
In a democratic election between two candidates , the winner is the person with the majority of the votes .
But when three or more candidates run , things are seldom so simple .
The winner often amasses only a plurality , not a majority , of the votes .
( Bill Clinton , for example , won the presidency with 43 percent of the vote ; Jesse Ventura won the Minnesota governorship with 37 percent . )
The plurality winner could be everybody else 's least favorite candidate and could even lose to each of the other candidates in a head - to - head battle .
As Saari puts it : " The plurality vote is the only procedure that will elect someone who 's despised by almost two thirds of the voters . "
Voting theorists have recognized the weakness of the plurality system for centuries .
" The apparent will of the plurality may in fact be the complete opposite of their true will , " wrote the Marquis de Condorcet , a close friend of Thomas Jefferson and author of a proposed French constitution , in 1793 .
That is why runoff elections are often used in races that are expected to draw a lot of candidates .
What students do n't learn in high - school civics class , and certainly wo n't hear from the two major parties , is that there are many voting systems besides the plurality vote and the runoff election .
Some systems are even older than that of the United States .
In recent years , there has been a steady increase of research on voting theory ( also called " consensus theory " or " social choice theory " ) .
For the first time ever , Saari says , " We have the tools to systematically analyze all the procedures . "
So what is the best procedure ?
That 's the catch .
Saari favors a method called the Borda count ; Brams advocates a method called approval voting .
Many would argue that there can be no definitive answer until other systems are tested .
Alas , consensus is as elusive as ever — even on the theory of consensus .
Approval voting , the simplest of the alternative methods , dates back to at least the 13th century , when Venetians used it to help elect their magistrates .
It was subsequently reinvented many times , although it did n't acquire a name until 1976 .
In an approval vote , a person casts one vote for every candidate he or she considers qualified for the office .
It 's like an opinion poll , only the results are added up to determine a winner .
Brams argues that all presidential elections should be decided this way .
" With approval voting , you can eat your cake and have it , too , " he says .
Voters who like a dark horse do n't have to feel as if they are wasting their votes : " You can vote for all the out - of - the - running candidates you want to , and a safe choice as well . "
Even if the safe candidate wins , the support for other candidates will be noted .
At the same time , Brams believes , the quality of debate would also improve : " Campaign strategies would change .
You would have to be more expansive in your appeal . "
Third - party candidates , like Ralph Nader or Ross Perot , would get more votes and get their ideas out to a wider audience .
Can approval voting truly change the outcome of an election ?
Absolutely , as the CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll demonstrated .
If this year 's election had been decided by an approval vote in February , McCain would have won .
True , by the November election his rivals would have had more time to dig up dirt against him , but the polls showed that three weeks of intense campaigning by Bush did n't make a dent in McCain 's approval ratings .
Besides , Brams argues , negative campaigning would n't be as widespread if we used approval voting , because it would be more likely to backfire against its users .
The advantages of an approval vote — and the perils of plurality voting — are most apparent in contests like the Louisiana governor 's race of 1991 .
The primary that year was dominated by three candidates : Edwin Edwards , the often - indicted former governor ; David Duke , a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan ; and incumbent governor Buddy Roemer .
Edwards won the primary with 34 percent of the vote compared with 32 percent for Duke and 27 percent for Roemer .
But it was Duke 's surprisingly strong showing , despite his overtly racist stance , that won national headlines .
Time and Newsweek ran long articles about the politics of hate in America .
Bumper stickers , anticipating an Edwards - Duke runoff election , urged Louisianans to " Vote for the crook : It 's important . "
In the end , Edwards walloped Duke by a 61 to 39 percent margin .
But the result was hardly a triumph for the runoff system .
Say what you will about Louisiana voters , it 's unlikely that anyone other than Edwards 's core supporters really wanted to put a " crook " in the governor 's office .
And the election returns from November show beyond a doubt that very few people approved of Duke , outside of the 32 percent who originally voted for him .
Roemer , on the other hand , had no strikes against him except that he had recently switched parties .
In an approval vote , he might well have finished first , sparing Louisianans the choice between racketeering and racism .
By the same token , approval voting might have spared Minnesotans from electing a professional wrestler to the governor 's seat two years ago , or New Hampshirites from handing Pat Buchanan a triumph in the 1996 presidential primary .
Some theorists object that approval voting violates the " one person , one vote " principle .
But that is partly a misconception .
The Supreme Court decision that enshrined that principle — Baker v. Carr , in 1962 — was meant to ensure that each voting district in a state had the same population .
Approval voting would n't change that .
More important , Brams argues , approval voting gives each voter equal " sovereignty " over the way his or her vote is counted .
" Voters are more equal if they have an equal opportunity to express themselves , " he argues .
" If I prefer one candidate above everyone else , I can better express myself with a bullet vote for him .
Another voter who hates one candidate can express his preferences by voting for the other four . "
Approval voting has some strong advocates in the voting science community , but it 's hardly the clear front runner ( see " Mathematicians in the Voting Booth , " page 82 ) .
Its chief competitor is the Borda count , the method championed by Donald Saari .
The Borda count was named after a French physicist — and later a hero in the American Revolution — named Jean - Charles de Borda , who proposed it in 1770 .
But it was used in the Roman senate as long ago as A.D. 105 .
Although it sounds obscure , sports fans should recognize it as the method used to rank college football and basketball teams .
In a Borda count election , each voter ranks all of the candidates from top to bottom .
If there are , say , five candidates , then a voter 's top - ranked candidate gets 5 points , his second - ranked candidate gets 4 , and so on .
Finally , the points from all the voters are added up to determine the winner .
Though more complicated than approval or plurality votes , Borda counts sidestep certain pitfalls .
Suppose , for instance , that three voters are trying to decide whom to vote for in a primary .
Alice ranks McCain first , Bush second , and Gore third .
Betty ranks Bush first , Gore second , and McCain third .
Cheryl ranks
Gore first , McCain second , and Bush third .
The situation is completely symmetrical ; each candidate has one first - place , one second - place , and one third - place ranking .
" I have yet to find anyone who says this should be anything else but a tie , " Saari says , and in a Borda count , it is .
Consider a two - stage election , however , consisting first of a Republican primary followed by a runoff between Gore and the Republican winner .
In stage one , Cheryl and Alice would vote for McCain , and so he would win the primary , 2 to 1 .
In stage two , Betty and Cheryl would vote for Gore over McCain , and so Gore would win the runoff , 2 to 1 .
In this format , the result is n't a tie : Gore wins .
In fact , in this year 's Michigan primary , Bush 's supporters complained that some Democrats , like Cheryl , crossed party lines to help McCain beat Bush .
But it was n't their fault — the system encouraged it .
Now consider a four - person election in which two voters have exactly the opposite preferences : Andrew 's preferences are , in descending order , Gore , Bradley , McCain , and Bush .
Bob prefers Bush first , McCain second , Bradley third , and Gore fourth .
Once again , most people would call this a four - way tie , and a Borda count would agree with them .
But in a plurality vote , Gore and Bush would tie for first and Bradley and McCain would be out of luck .
" The reason voting procedures give us paradoxes and unwanted outcomes is that they do not respect the symmetries of data that give us ties , " Saari says .
Is there any system that would consistently declare the vote of Alice , Betty , and Cheryl a tie , and would do the same for Andrew and Bob ?
" Only one procedure does that , " Saari says .
" The Borda count . "
To prove his point , he published two 50 - page papers on the Borda count in the January issue of the journal Economic Theory .
How would McCain , Bush , and Gore have fared in a general election under the Borda count ?
The Sacramento
Bee poll , plus the official tallies for California 's open primary , offers a clue .
According to the Bee 's results , McCain would have beaten Gore 48 to 43 , and Gore would have beaten Bush 51 to 43 .
But could McCain have beaten Bush among all voters , not just Republicans ?
Here 's one way to figure it out .
In the California primary , 60 percent of Republicans voted for Bush and 35 percent voted for McCain .
We can assume that those percentages would have stayed the same had they been slated to run against each other in November .
On the Democratic side , nearly 800,000 voters broke party ranks in March 's primary to vote for Republicans .
Of these , 64 percent voted for McCain and 31 percent voted for Bush .
Again , the simplest thing to do is assume that the entire Democratic party would have split the same way if they were forced to choose between those two candidates in November .
So in our hypothetical Bush - McCain race , Bush would win by 60 to 35 among the Republican voters , and McCain would win by 64 to 31 among the Democratic voters .
Overall , McCain would beat Bush , 50 percent to 45 percent .
( To arrive at those figures I first added together each candidate 's percentage of the Democratic and Republican vote — 60 and 31 for Bush , 64 and 35 for McCain — and divided them in two .
That gave 45.5 for Bush and 49.5 for McCain .
I then converted those totals to percentages and rounded them off . )
To see how all three candidates would do under the Borda count , we add up the results of the head - to - head matchups : Hence , in California at least , McCain would have been the Borda count winner .
" Two cheers for the borda count , " Brams laconically replies .
He does n't dislike Saari's system — it often produces a better consensus candidate than the plurality method , assuming voters rank the candidates sincerely .
But it can produce head - scratching results if voters try to beat the system .
For example , if all Democrats rank Gore first and Bush last , and all Republicans rank Bush first and Gore last , voters might wake up the next morning with a surprise winner — Ralph Nader , say , or Pat Buchanan — thanks to all the second - place votes .
The system would clearly take some getting used to .
( The problem of insincere voting was pointed out to Borda himself .
His response was characteristic of a more optimistic age : " My system is only for honest men . " )
Both Brams and Saari point out that their disagreement has never become personal .
Yet their theories clearly live in different worlds .
Brams 's approach is classical , axiomatic , and deductive .
Saari's is geometric and visual ( " The Geometry of Voting , " page 82 ) .
Brams 's theory assumes that voters will often not be able to side with one candidate over another ; Saari 's starts from the viewpoint that they can rank them all .
Brams argues that voters should have " sovereignty " — that one voter 's 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 may be different from another voter 's 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 .
Saari laments the " indeterminacy " of the approval vote , the fact that the outcome is not fixed only by the voters ' preferences but also depends on their voting strategies .
The one trait that both systems share is a need for hard choices :
They both ask voters to choose whom they would pick if their favorite were eliminated .
That is the information missing in our current system , Saari and Brams say , yet it 's vital to reaching a consensus .
In the early 1980s , convinced of the current system 's shortcomings , Brams launched a one - man voting reform movement .
He wrote numerous articles about the approval voting system and took his campaign to the studios of Good Morning , America and to the legislatures of New Hampshire and New York , yet the crusade failed to find many converts in government .
According to Brams 's former student Arnold Urken , a political scientist at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey , the failure was not surprising .
Before people will reform something as momentous as a political election , Urken says , they need to learn about voting methods in less formal situations .
Groups of friends , Urken suggests , could begin by using alternative voting methods to decide which restaurant or movie to go to .
If the voters are well - informed and clear about their rankings , the Borda count may be best .
If they are not so sure , approval voting may work better .
Either way , they will probably reach a consensus faster than through a plurality vote .
The Internet is another natural place to test voting methods .
Urken runs an e-business called Choice Logic Corporation out of his home in New Jersey , consulting for companies on the interpretation of customer surveys , which are a kind of vote .
The companies have a big stake in getting their information right , so Urken advises them to use several different tallying methods .
" I see voting as a tool for looking at data , " he says .
The best testing ground for alternative voting methods may be among scientists themselves .
Six scientific societies now use approval voting for their elections , most notably the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers , whose 350,000 members outnumber the eligible voters in Wyoming .
" I think it 's no accident that mathematics and engineering societies adopted it , because they can understand the logic behind it , " Brams says .
He also notes that none of them have gone back to other methods .
Other scientists have made good use of Saari 's method .
In 1973 , for instance , the scientists who designed the Voyager missions to Jupiter and Saturn used a Borda count to help choose among several trajectories .
Jim Parker , who works on computer vision at the University of Calgary in Alberta , uses voting methods for character recognition .
One computer program might interpret a scrawled figure as a 3 , while three others think it is an 8 and one thinks it is a 6 .
If they vote on it , they almost always get it right .
With a straight majority vote , they make one mistake every 166 characters .
When they use a Borda count , the error rate drops to one every 1,000 .
Americans love to vote .
We vote for all - star teams , music awards , soft drinks , and hamburgers .
Millions of us watch two television shows that involve a vote : Survivor and Who Wants to be a Millionaire ?
The only time we do n't like to vote , it seems , is Election Day .
Some would trace this strange reluctance to the corruption and inequality in campaign financing .
But the more likely reason is that people do n't believe they 're getting a fair choice .
Sometimes the most popular candidate , like John McCain this year or Buddy Roemer in Louisiana in 1991 , can't even make it onto the ballot .
At other times , ballots list numerous candidates , but people hesitate to vote for their favorites because they 're only allowed one vote and they do n't want to " waste " it .
Perhaps the best way out of our electoral malaise is n't to reform campaign finances , as politicians so often say , but to reform the voting system itself — even if it means doing so one vote at a time .
PRAGUE – A report by U.S. intelligence services minimizing the Iranian threat has meant another embarrassment for Czech politicians supportive of U.S. plans to set up a radar base in Central - Eastern Europe .
The radar system  which Washington claims will protect the West from missile attacks by " rogue states " such as Iran and North Korea  would consist of a radar in the Czech Republic and an anti-missile base in Poland .
Contradicting the official U.S. line on Iran , the U.S. report said the Iranian clandestine nuclear arms program had been halted in 2003 following international supervision and pressure .
The report by the National Intelligence Estimate , which came out Dec. 3 , says Iran still poses a threat , as it could develop nuclear weapons by 2010 - 2015 .
Nevertheless , most analysts have interpreted the report as possibly indicating that the U.S. had exaggerated the threat for domestic reasons , and say it could herald a change in Washington ’s policy toward Iran .
But Czech government officials reacted publicly by insisting that the Iranian and other threats remains real , though their words also expressed a sense of frustration over the way the U.S. is treating one of its most faithful allies .
The Czech ministry of foreign affairs reacted in an official statement warning that the program could be resumed at any point .
" The U.S. intelligence services ’ report will have no impact on the Czech government ’s position on further negotiations , " reads the statement .
Tomas Klvana , the Czech government ’s spokesmen for the radar issue , warned that Iran was still working on ballistic missiles and enriching uranium with unclear purposes .
" Iran continues with the preparation of ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000 km that can also hit some European areas , " Klvana said during a visit to Washington .
But the last months have been full of disappointments for pro-U.S. Czech politicians who feel the world ’s biggest superpower is not taking Prague seriously .
" The threat of Iran was used as the main argument by them , " Jan Drahokoupil , analyst at the Czech Economy and Society Trust , told IPS .
" It seems the U.S. did not bother to inform them about publishing the report . "
Czech First Deputy Foreign Minister Tomas Pojar admitted that " our reservations about the way in which the USA speaks about individual affairs are very , very frequent . "
" We have said we want to be informed in time about the broader security circumstances , not only on the affairs that are connected with the missile threats .
We welcome it if we are informed in time about news of this sort , " Pojar added .
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg , who expects talks between Prague and Washington to culminate in an agreement by early 2008 , also said he planned to voice Czech dissatisfaction to his U.S. counterpart Condoleezza Rice during a Dec. 7 meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) foreign ministers in Brussels .
The minister was allegedly unable to voice his discontent to Rice .
Czech politicians had presented Iran as exemplifying the nuclear danger posed by " rogue states , " but after the publishing of the U.S. reports Czech officials are defending the thesis that other unstable states could imperil the Western world .
" We have not presented Iran as the only threat , we have rather spoken about it as an example , " Veronika Kuchynova - Smigolova , director of the security policy section at the Czech foreign ministry told the press .
Asked by a journalist why Iran had always been mentioned as the first threat , the official replied : " Because the Americans have mentioned it as the first . "
Czech officials earlier reacted with surprise to a U.S. proposal that Russian officials could be allowed into Czech territory to monitor the radar .
Czech politicians criticized the U.S. for not warning Prague in advance on the proposal , leaving Prague unprepared when reacting to questions by a shocked media and public opinion .
Since then both Czech and U.S. officials have stated that a Russian presence in the radar , which Czechs have not excluded as long as it is not of a military nature , would be conditional on Prague ’s consent .
But a recent U.S. Congress decision to cut $ 139 million from the budget for the base left many wondering whether the Czechs are rushing to welcome a base that not even the U.S. itself is sure it wants .
Warning the U.S. against delaying the project , Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Vondra sent a straight message to the U.S. : " You must take your allies seriously , " he said .
Justifying his position during a conference hosted by the U.S. - based conservative think - tank Heritage Foundation , Vondra said that " for us in the Czech Republic , which lies between Germany and Russia , the presence of the radar and several American soldiers is a good thing . "
But Drahokoupil thinks the government ’s and much of the media ’s insistent talk on a Russian threat is not genuine , and Czech government officials are not truly concerned about any Russian or Iranian threat .
" There is no geopolitics here ; they are just trying to manufacture support for the U.S. base , " he told IPS .
" What ’s important is to take the U.S. side , whatever that means . "
The opposition has welcomed the report with an ironic smile .
Social Democrat Opposition leader Jiri Paroubek called the report " another argument to reject the radar " and advised the government to " temporarily interrupt talks with the U.S. "
Social Democrat Jan Hamacek , chairman of the chamber of deputies ’ committee on foreign affairs , claimed that the report had trivialized arguments thus far used by the Czech government .
" The road of bilateral talks at any price and at the highest speed leads to a blind alley , " he warned .
The plans for the radar are rejected by a wide majority of the public , and poll results released Dec. 12 show that the number of opponents has risen from 65 percent in June to 68 percent in November .
The number of supporters has decreased by three percentage points during the same period , standing now at 25 percent of the population .

Energy can supply all the energy we 'll ever need , say scientists and environmentalists familiar with the technology
Admit it :
For many of us , our work computer is a home away from home .
It seems only fair , since our home computer is typically an office away from the office .
So in between typing up reports and poring over spreadsheets , we use our office PCs to keep up with our lives .
We do birthday shopping , check out funny clips on YouTube and catch up with friends by email or instant message .
And often it 's just easier to accomplish certain tasks using consumer technology than using the sometimes clunky office technology our company gives us -- compare Gmail with a corporate email account .
There 's only one problem with what we 're doing :
Our employers sometimes do n't like it .
Partly , they want us to work while we 're at work .
And partly , they 're afraid that what we 're doing compromises the company 's computer network -- putting the company at risk in a host of ways .
So they 've asked their information - technology departments to block us from bringing our home to work .

Sitting down for extended periods poses a health risk as " insidious " as smoking or over - exposure to the sun , a scientist claims .
Millions of workers who sit at desks for hours on end before going home to sit in front of the TV are increasing their chances of heart disease , Type 2 diabetes and obesity , says Professor Marc Hamilton of the University of Missouri .
Writing in the November issue of the medical journal Diabetes , he said : " The dire concern for the future may rest with growing numbers unaware of the potential insidious dangers of sitting too much .
Scroll down for more ...
" These studies demonstrate a significant impact of inactivity on a par with smoking .
" I view exposure to sitting ... like an oncologist views exposure to unnecessary sunlight . "
A second study at the International Diabetes Institute in Melbourne concluded that even two hours of exercise a day would not compensate for " spending 22 hours sitting on your rear end " .
Professor David Dunstan told Australian Doctor magazine : " People who break up their sitting time - walking to a colleague rather than emailing him , for instance - have a lower risk of diabetes . "
It looks like the battle 's officially over between iPhoneSIMfree and the numerous unique groups of open source hackers trying to software SIM unlock the iPhone .
As we 've been following in our previous post on the topic , earlier this afternoon iUnlock , the first free , open source iPhone SIM unlock app , was released to the underground just 74 days after the iPhone 's release .
Developed by the iPhone Dev Team , it 's not ( yet ) for the faint of heart and it takes a little longer to do its magic than iPhoneSIM free 's method , but it works .
To pull this off you 'll need iUnlock + nor + the .fls file , which is available in ZIPs all over .
We 've got the app here , but this package does n't include all of the files necessary .
Good list of links here , or try here here , and here For the how - to , just hit up one of those guides down below .
Naturally , we offer zero guarantees that any of this will work .
( Read : do n't whine to us if your iPhone gets bricked . )
Big ups to the iphone .
unlock crew , Draken , and , of course , the iPhone Dev Team .
Let us know in comments if this technique works for you .
We 've confirmed the hack !
Yes , it 's fully restore - resistant , too , which is great news .
We 'll get you all the juicy proof in a few , but we have indeed managed to software unlock an iPhone with iUnlock .
Also , HaRRo says the app should be out " very soon " to make this easier on the noobs .
Depending on activation method , YouTube might not be working after the unlock -- ours is n't .
This is , of course , expected behavior .
There 's a Windows script here that should hopefully fix you up ( again , we do n't make any guarantees ) , but Mac users will have to look elsewhere .
Also , alongside the Mac GUI iUnlock app in the works , the iPhone Dev Team is prepping a Windows version , a simple bash script and an iPhone app -- and eventually an all - in - one app that can do everything from the Jailbreak to the unlock .
We 've posted our terminal output from using the hack after the break .
Go ahead .
Nerd out .
Also , the graphical version is n't out quiet yet , but we 've got the first image of it above .
Check it out .
Ok , the graphical unlock app still is n't yet out , but we 've tested an early build , and it definitely works !

While there 's no doubt that videogames dominate the geekish gaming scene , there 's still room for low - tech pleasures that involve sitting around a table with your friends , face to face , and trying to crush them like earthworms on the sidewalk next to an elementary school .
Many of the best board games fall into a category often labeled " designer games " or " Eurogames . "
It 's a pity they have trouble finding a place at most U.S. toy stores next to Hanna Montana Girl Talk and dozens of themed Monopoly sets , but your friendly local game store , or one of many online shops , will be happy to take up the slack .
The following are n't all Eurogames , but they 're mostly a bit off the beaten path for board games .
Any of them would make an excellent gift for the gamer in your life .
Left : Hey !
That 's My Fish !
Mayfair Games , two to four players , ages 8 and up , $ 25
Buy it for :
The geek with young geeklings
You play : Hungry penguins with an inexplicable fear of water
The object : Gorge yourself on suicidal fish more efficiently than anyone else .
Recommended for ages 8 and up , Hey !
That 's My Fish ! can appeal both to kids and their geekish parents .
The young ones will enjoy the cute penguin tokens and the straightforward rules , while older geeks will enjoy the complex spatial logistics underneath the surface .
The game can easily be handicapped by giving one side more penguins , in case the parents are better at it than the children ( or vice versa ) .

North Star Games , three to 21 players , ages 10 and up , $ 28
Buy it for :
The trivia dominator
You play : A know - it - all with a head for numbers and a penchant for gambling
The object : Cash , baby .
Do you know a trivia whiz who tries to badger everyone into playing Trivial Pursuit even though the outcome is a foregone conclusion ?
Wits & Wagers is a simple and fun party game that adds a clever twist to the play :
If you 're not certain of your answer , you can bet on someone else 's .
The players can profit from the trivia master 's expertise , or bet on the resident jock when the sports questions come around .

RoboRally
Avalon
Hill , two to eight players , ages 12 and up , $ 60
Buy it for :
The programmer
You play :
An adorable , somewhat - addled sentient robot
The object :
Win the race without being blasted into slag by laser beams .
A number of arenas are provided with the game , each giving your robot a course to run with a selection of conveyor belts , laser beams , bottomless pits and similar hazards .
During each turn , players randomly draw a number of Program cards , with instructions like " Move 2 " or " U - Turn , " and try to arrange them so their robots will actually get somewhere .
The goofy science - fiction theme , the programmatic thinking and the fact that it's by the same guy who invented Magic :
The Gathering make this one of the most overtly geeky board games out there .

Buy it for :
The recovering collector
You play :
The commanding officer of a mix of English , French , goblins and dwarves .
The object : Depends on the scenario .
Usually , kill the other guys .
Do you know someone who has thousands of dollars worth of collectible game cards and / or miniatures gathering dust in a closet somewhere ?
Someone who quit the scene after realizing how much it costs to keep up with a typical collectible game ?
BattleLore might be a good way to scratch that collecting itch while still having money for food and rent .
The basic game gives you all the dice , tokens and little miniature war guys you need to fight all sorts of battles , while a sane number of periodical expansions add figures like ostrich - riding goblins and bagpipe - playing dwarves .

Fiji
Rio Grande Games , two to five players , ages 10 and up , $ 30
Buy it for :
The mastermind
You play : A souvenir hunter with little respect for the dead
The object : Amass a large , unsettling collection of shrunken heads .
Fiji involves a little bit of logic , and a lot of mind games .
The object is to earn shrunken heads by displaying your colored beads , trying to show , for instance , the most red beads or the fewest blue beads .
Your opponents are trying for the same thing , though , and ties cancel each other out .
So if you think everyone else is going to show four red beads , maybe you should show three .
But if they 're thinking the same thing , four beads will win after all .
It takes a round or two to get into the groove , but once you catch on , it 's fun to try to read your friends ' minds .

The Settlers of Catan
Mayfair Games , three to four players , ages 12 and up , $ 40
Buy it for :
The newbie
You play :
An island settler
The object : Exploit the natural resources of your island paradise more efficiently than your opponents .
The Settlers of Catan is the canonical gateway to the lovely and challenging world of designer board games .
The rules are fairly simple , but a lot more deep than " roll the dice and move your mice . "
Each turn , all players have a chance to receive resources like wood and wheat , and can trade with the active player .
These resources can be turned into roads , settlements and the like , which in turn can give you more resources , until someone gets enough victory points to win .
A roving robber and a set of development cards add spice , while the lovely and evocative design gives Settlers of Catan a charming atmosphere .
A wonderful gift for anyone who likes games , but thinks that board games begin and end with Sorry .

Coloretto
Rio Grande Games , three to five players , ages 8 and up , $ 12
Buy it for : A stocking stuffer
You play : Someone who likes color , but not too much
The object : Get lots of some colors , and none of others .
While some elaborate games can get quite pricey , there 's no reason you need to go into holiday debt to give someone a good time .
Coloretto goes for about 12 bucks , but it 's a fun , quick and easy game for a handful of players .
The game is a lot like life , requiring you to decide between settling for a little bit of something you want , or going for the gusto and risking getting a lot of bad stuff along with the good .
Plus it has lizards on the cards – that 's always fun .

Go
Various makers , two players , ages 8 and up , various prices
Buy it for :
The classicist
You play : A person putting stones on a board
The object : Capture the other guy 's stones .
In a world where computers can beat grand masters at chess , and checkers has been solved mathematically , it 's good to know that there 's an ancient game where even the best computers are only pretty good .
Go boards can cost anywhere from a few dollars for a cardboard model to hundreds of dollars for carved bamboo boards , slate stones and rosewood bowls .
But all sets come with a vast and enthusiastic worldwide community of players dedicated to the game .

Puerto Rico
Rio Grande Games , three to five players , ages 12 and up , $ 40
Buy it for :
Anyone who loves games
You play : A Central American capitalist
The object : Create the most impressive company town .
It 's hard to define what exactly it is that distinguishes European - style board games from American pastimes , but Puerto Rico has most of the distinguishing characteristics that set Eurogames apart .
Everyone does something almost every turn , instead of most players waiting for their chance to make a move , and most of your choices affect other players directly .
Puerto Rico is also based on a particular time and place , instead of a movie or fad , and the game 's design is both lovely and functional .
On top of all this , Puerto Rico is great fun , well - deserving of the top spot in the ratings over at Board Game Geek .

Cafferty 's viewers warn of ' the slippery slope to a police state ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 20 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Boston police are trying to get guns off the streets by asking parents in high - crime areas to let detectives come into their homes without a warrant and search their children 's bedrooms .
There has been considerable controversy over the program .
For example , former Boston police lieutenant Thomas Nolan , who now teaches criminology at Boston University , complained that " I just have a queasy feeling anytime the police try to do an end run around the Constitution .
...
The police have restrictions on their authority and ability to conduct searches .
The Constitution was written with a very specific intent , and that was to keep the law out of private homes unless there is a written document signed by a judge and based on probable cause .
Here , you do n't have that . "
Jack Cafferty discussed the controversy on his CNN show Monday , highlighting the objections by civil liberties advocates that parents " may be too intimidated to say no to the police or may not understand the consequences if they say yes . "
Cafferty also noted that Boston police say a similar program in St. Louis was highly successful , finding guns in half the homes that were searched , and have promised that they would never abuse the program to gain access to the homes of people under suspicion or make arrests for small amounts of marijuana .
However , the St. Louis program was effective only during a brief period in 1994 - 95 , when youth violence was at a peak and community support high .
It later switched over to a focus on traditional warrants and arrests and was ultimately discontinued .
Cafferty then asked his viewers to respond to the question , " Should Boston police be able to enter private homes without a warrant to search for guns ? "
He read excerpts from the responses during a follow - up segment .
Although one viewer suggested that " concerned parents would welcome this , " the general reaction appeared to be strongly negative , to the point where Cafferty suggested it might be because the question had not contained the phrase " with permission . "
He apologized repeatedly for that omission , both before and after reading from viewers ' comments .
One viewer wrote in warning about " the slippery slope to a police state . "
Another insisted " absolutely no entry without a warrant ... no fishing expeditions . "
Yet another wanted to know , " Since when did Boston secede from the U.S. and the constitutional safeguards against illegal searches ? "
And one raised the specter of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , asking , " Did someone make Gonzo the Boston Police Commissioner ?
Why would anybody in their right mind invite the police into their home to conduct an illegal search for illegal guns ? "
The following video is from CNN's Cafferty File with Jack Cafferty , broadcast on November 19 , 2007

IT is no -longer a hackers paradise populated only by people with a background in Computer Science , it is a discipline for the masses and as such the IT technologies and standards that we adopt should recognise that stopping the majority doing something stupid is the goal .
stopping someone from accidentally doing something wrong
Sick of the false dichotomy of arguing strong , static typing vs. powerful , expressive languages ?
The Little MLer introduces ML ( and its object - oriented variant Ocaml ) through a series of entertaining and straightforward exercises working with lists , structures , and even deriving arithmetic from types .
ML and Ocaml provide pattern matching , higher - order functions , and a strong , static type system so expressive that it actually changes the way you think about programming with types .
Yet it does so with type inference , so you get the brevity of languages like Ruby and Python .
An interesting read .
The characterization of “ dynamic languages == hackers doing programming as art ” does not match my experience talking to people who use dynamic languages in commercial projects , so I ’ll respond to that one point .
This quote should n’t be taken as the entire premise of his post : please read the whole thing and decide for yourself what he is and is n’t saying .
And my response here is n’t really an argument with Mr. Jones , it ’s more of a riff inspired by it .
I ’m going to talk about different ways to achieve a similar goal .
Perhaps that is disagreement .
Or perhaps it is violent agreement .
One of the many things people do with languages like Python and Ruby is try to solve the exact problem he mentions , .
Obviously , not with static typing .
So how else can this be done ?
Let ’s start with Python .
What , do you suppose , is with the enforced indentation .
Do you think it might have something to do with standardizing code style to make it readable ?
Which in turn lowers the bar for someone to come in and understand code and therefore fix it more easily and without accidentally breaking everything ?
Although this has nothing to do with Python ’s “ dynamic ” nature , it has everything to do with the language ’s design goals .
And I am very sorry that type inference is not a common feature in “ popular ” statically typed languages .
One of the reasons people like dynamic languages is making the boilerplate go away .
And agreed , the baby goes out with the bathwater .
But it ’s more than just saving yourself typing , especially for someone like myself who spends more time thinking about what I ’m going to write than typing it .
Even if it takes me twice as long to type my code , I do n’t become half as productive , not by a long shot .
The point is also readability , and readability directly drives application support .
Code that is easier to read in the aggregate is easier to maintain .
And dynamic languages can be used to make code very easy to read .
Put in this light , the “ dynamic ” nature of certain languages is not the goal , but rather a means to an end , or even an unhappy side - effect of the goal , which is making code more expressive and therefore readable .
For example Regular Expressions could be considered an artful way to play “ golf , ” to reduce code from pages of loops to perform searches down to a few characters with some cryptic special features — [ ^a - z ] * and so forth — but they could also be seen as a way to reduce errors by abstracting something that is error - prone and difficult for “ the majority ” to get right the first time , much less maintain when someone else has re-invented the text search wheel in their own idiosyncratic way .
Likewise , Ruby on Rails — which is a framework and includes several DSLs — could be DHH futzing about writing poetry in Ruby .
Or it could be a way of stopping the majority from doing stupid things like getting relational databases wrong .
reducing relations to conventional table and columns names plus readable “ declarations ” like “ has_many : ideas ” also serves to make it easier for the non-expert to write and maintain code .
This is not to say that bondage and discipline does n’t have its place .
Or that you ca n’t achieve all of the same goals with Java and stop someone from accidentally calling .to_s on an object which actually responds to .toString .
But I am definitely saying that writing code for others to maintain is both a laudable goal and one of the things that the current crop of dynamic languages can do well .
In the end , my suggestion to everyone is simply this : Programming is Art — to a programmer who is also an artist .
And Programming is Engineering — to a programmer who is also an engineer .
And finally , Programming is “ A Means to Organize and Mold the Work of The Majority ” — to a programmer who seeks to organize and mold the work of the majority .
In the hands of a programmer seeking these goals , each language has its own advantages and disadvantages , no doubt .
And I will not argue with suggestions that a language with veryLongCamelCaseConventions using WidgetTemplateFactoryMethodFactoryFacadeFactoryVisitors is the preferred choice for certain projects in certain environments .
But I am pointing out that if you begin with the same ends in mind , such as writing code to be maintained by others , you can use radically different tools in radically different ways , yet wind up reaching the same objective .p.s.
A good read from Steve Jones :
What is it with vendors ’ view on time ?
Snowflaking is a spinoff of the Snowball approach to debt reduction popularized by Dave Ramsey .
With the Debt Snowball method , you figure out what amount you can pay to debt every month , and then you keep paying that amount , even as your debts shrink and your minimums get smaller .
To implement it , in a nutshell , make a list of all your debts , order them from either smallest to largest or highest interest to lowest interest ( that is a debate in itself ) , and you focus all extra money above the minimum payments on a single debt ( either the smallest total or the highest interest , I use interest order ) .
As you eliminate debts , you apply the payment you were making to that debt to the next debt in line until the snowballing effect of decreasing minimums and increasing amounts applied to particular debts eliminates all the debts on your list .
Well , what are snowballs made of ?
Snowflakes !
I have a set amount I pay to debt without fail every month that is above my minimum payment due ( about $ 800 ) .
On top of that , I also try to collect up little bits of money wherever I can and I apply those as well to my top priority debt as immediately as possible .
I take surveys online , I sell possessions on craigslist and ebay , I have yard sales , and any money I get from these endeavors goes directly to my debt .
I also keep a very strict accounting of all the money that comes in every month and what I spend and everything left over at the end of the month not earmarked for future expenses also goes directly to debt .
These are my snowflakes .
I have averaged over $ 200 extra going to pay down my credit card debt every month due to these snowflaking efforts .
Many small snowflakes make a snowball , and no amount is too small for me to snowflake .
I used to pay my credit card directly every time I collected a snowflake through their online interface , but now that I have moved my credit card debt to another card with a 0 % interest offer , I collect the snowflakes and pay them once per week ( I am limited to the number of payments I can make to this card a month ) .
If you are able to and your debt is not at 0 % interest , I highly recommend the “ pay snowflakes immediately ” method .
The faster your balance is reduced , the less interest you will accrue .
So , that is my snowflaking method .
Small efforts matter , and many little things can add up to a huge snowstorm .
I use it because of anything I ’ve tried , this has kept me the most focused and deliberate about debt reduction and eliminated debt the fastest .
I cannot take credit for the idea or the implementation , many many other personal finance gurus and bloggers alike have used this method before me , and I first read about it on an iVillage Debt Support message board .
I am just a subscriber to it .
Maybe someday I should read some Dave Ramsey and learn from the granddaddy of the snowball himself .

SACRAMENTO --
Up to 33,000 prisoners in California may be entitled to release earlier than scheduled because the state has miscalculated their sentences , corrections officials said Wednesday .
For nearly two years , the overburdened state prison agency has failed to recalculate the sentences of those inmates despite a series of court rulings , including one by the California Supreme Court .
The judges said the state applied the wrong formula when crediting certain inmates for good behavior behind bars .
Some inmates released in recent months almost certainly stayed longer in prison than they should have , said corrections officials , employees and advocates for prisoners .
Some currently in prison most likely should be free , they said .
But many whose sentences are too long are not scheduled to be released for months or years .
The inmates in question -- 19 % of the state prison population -- are serving consecutive sentences for violent and nonviolent offenses .
The sentencing errors range from a few days to several years .

Corrections officials say they have been unable to calculate the sentences properly because of staffing shortages and outdated computer systems that force analysts to do the complex work by hand .
Keeping prisoners institutionalized for too long wastes millions of dollars a year .
A preliminary analysis of the problem in August by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation concluded that the longer sentences boost the state ’s already swollen prison population by 600 inmates a day , at a cost of nearly $ 26 million annually .
The state has about 173,000 prisoners and has undertaken the addition of 53,000 more beds because of overcrowding -- a situation that has helped erode the state ’s shaky finances .
“ This is another function of the overcrowding crisis , ” said Don Specter , director of the Prison Law Office , a Bay Area group that represents inmates in court .
“ They have to handle the number of prisoners who are in the system .
They ca n’t meet their medical or mental health needs .
Now it appears that there is some reason to believe that they ca n’t even calculate their release dates correctly . ”

Specter said prisoners who are kept too long would have grounds to sue the corrections department .
Scott Kernan , the state ’s chief deputy secretary for adult prison operations , said the department hopes to hire 85 more analysts to begin working on the problem .
“ We believe it ’s a problem , ” Kernan said .
“ We ’re taking it very seriously in a time of limited resources .
. . .
We have an obligation to go recalculate their sentences , and we ’re going to get the resources and we ’re going to do it . ”
Corrections officials said they plan to ask Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration next week for the additional personnel .

The corrections department had been taking 15 % off sentences for good behavior -- the standard for violent offenses -- even when part of the term was for a nonviolent crime .
But in three decisions in 2005 and 2006 , state appeals courts and the state Supreme Court agreed with prisoners that they should have received a 50 % credit -- the standard for nonviolent crimes -- on the nonviolent portion of their sentences .
In the most recent case , decided Jan. 12 , 2006 , the 5th District state Court of Appeal sided with prisoner Breonne Tate , who argued that his release date should have been about 10 months earlier than the state calculated .
The judges agreed , and he was paroled Aug. 27 , 2006 .
Tate had been convicted in Los Angeles County in 2001 of attempted robbery using a firearm , receiving a 4 1/2 - year sentence for a violent felony .
In 2003 , he received two more years after pleading guilty to possession of a weapon in prison , considered a nonviolent crime .
But after the 5th District decision , corrections officials decided they would not immediately recalculate the sentences of all those eligible , according to prison case records analysts and the labor leaders who represent them in the Service Employees International Union Local 1000 .

Instead , administrators instructed that only those prisoners who complained or obtained a court order would receive revised sentences , union officials said .
Kernan said he was not aware that such an instruction had been issued but added , “ That would be a reasonable course of action , ” given the department ’s lack of resources .
The union filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court in Sacramento against the corrections department , Secretary James Tilton and Schwarzenegger .
It accuses them of violating state and federal law by failing to fix the errors .
The union called for the hiring of hundreds more case - records analysts .
“ The department chronically runs understaffed , ” Marc Bautista , a vice president of the union , said Wednesday .
“ It ’s just a lack of leadership . ”

In August , Tilton ordered a sampling of the 33,000 prisoners to determine the severity of the problem .
The study indicated that although some release dates might be off by only a few days , correcting the sentences would reduce the inmate population by 600 a day .
Kernan said the agency initially requested 67 more analyst positions in the summer of 2006 so the new sentence calculations could be made .
But they were denied by Schwarzenegger ’s budget officials .
H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the Department of Finance , said the corrections agency was told to fill its existing vacancies first and given extra salary allotments .
Meanwhile , analysts say they are working hundreds of hours overtime .
The state ’s 25 - year - old computers cannot analyze the complex sentencing formulas created by a crazy - quilt of laws passed by the Legislature and by voters through the initiative process , and modified by the courts .
Toni Garcia , a case records analyst at Central California Women ’s Facility in Chowchilla , complained that the governor and the Legislature pass new laws spending billions on reforming the system when prison workers have to share desks and computers , and requests for staff are met with “ red tape . ”

“ They ’re going to build all these facilities to help reform , ” Garcia said .
“ It ’s all great .
But we need to fix the system the way it is now . ”

BATON ROUGE , La. ( AP ) -- LSU let its second chance slip away .
Twice the Tigers were No. 1 and in control of their national championship hopes .
Twice the team with a flair for the dramatic could n't pull out a triple - overtime victory against a Heisman Trophy contender .
Darren McFadden rushed for 206 yards and three touchdowns , and even threw for another score to lift Arkansas to a 50 - 48 victory Friday , likely eliminating another team from the national title chase .
" Certainly , he had a Heisman performance today , " LSU coach Les Miles lamented .
" Right now , there 's a goal of our football team taken off the board and it 's sad .
... Tonight , we 'll be sick . "
LSU may very well play a bowl game in New Orleans , but the one they were hoping to play -- the BCS championship game on Jan. 7 -- now looks out of reach .
That had to devastate most of the 92,606 fans who filled Tiger Stadium with earsplitting roars throughout this classic , then quietly filed out while the Razorbacks stormed the field in triumph after snapping the nation 's longest home - winning streak at 19 games .
The Tigers ( 10 - 2 , 6 - 2 Southeastern Conference ) had already clinched the SEC West Division and will move on to the conference title game in Atlanta on Dec. 1 , but will do so feeling a little hollow .
Winning the SEC title will put LSU in the Sugar Bowl .
No team with two losses has ever played in the national title game .
A few more upsets could put LSU back in the debate , but it could 've been so easy for the Tigers .
All they had to do was win two .
" It 's a sick feeling , losing another tough game that we played our hearts out , " tight end Richard Dickson said .
" We can think about it for a while but we have to come out next week and win an SEC title . "
McFadden 's rushing touchdowns went for 16 yards in the second quarter , 73 yards in the third period and 9 yards in the second OT .
His TD pass was a flawlessly executed 24 - yarder over the middle to Peyton Hillis after McFadden froze the defense with a play - action fake .
Heisman voters will have to think twice about leaving McFadden off of the top of their ballot .
" However you want to put it , " McFadden said , " numbers speak for themselves . "
Hillis scored four TDs , the last in the third overtime .
Felix Jones ran for the critical 2 - point conversion to make it 50 - 42 for the Razorbacks ( 8 - 4 , 4 - 4 ) .
LSU responded when Matt Flynn found Brandon LaFell for a 9 - yard TD , but Matterral Richardson intercepted the 2 - point conversion attempt , and Arkansas ' bench emptied onto the field in triumph , having ended the nation 's longest home winning streak at 19 games .
" Hey , we were the best team in the country today , " boasted Houston Nutt , who is rumored to be on his way out as the Razorbacks ' coach .
" To come down here in Baton Rouge and win is huge . "
McFadden , last year 's Heisman Trophy runner - up , has 1,725 yards rushing this season , breaking the school 's single - season record he set last year .
No doubt there are West Virginia and Ohio State fans who'd vote McFadden for Heisman if they could .
By knocking off LSU , which was in first place in the BCS standings , Arkansas boosted the national championship hopes of the Mountaineers and Buckeyes .
McFadden often took direct snaps in the " Wild Hog " formation , in which he was a triple threat to run , hand off or throw .
While he looked quite comfortable in the quarterback role , he was most dangerous running the ball , as usual .
All of his rushing TDs came on direct snaps .
" We had been watching film of LSU and saw they had weaknesses against running quarterbacks , " McFadden explained .
" So it was something we planned on doing all week . "
Miles said he thought he had a good plan for the " Wild Hog , " with two defenders shadowing McFadden .
LSU linebacker Ali Highsmith did his best , making 15 tackles .
" There 's a point where I thought we were going to defend that thing pretty well , " Miles said .
" There were two pretty good LSU tacklers ready to tackle that guy and he did n't go down .
It definitely affected us . "
Maybe McFadden was running a little angrier than usual after hearing Miles purposely mispronounce Arkansas as ar - KANSAS this week .
" They were n't saying it right so we wanted to let them know how to say it , " McFadden said .
Hillis ran for 89 yards and Jones had 85 as Arkansas finished with a 385 yards on the ground against one of the best run defenses in the country .
Now that the Tigers have fallen as No. 1 a second time , the winner of Saturday night 's game between No. 2 Kansas and No. 3 Missouri will likely take over the top spot in the rankings and the BCS standings .
No. 4 West Virginia , which was third in the BCS standings , has a chance to sneak up to at least No. 2 in each with a win over Connecticut .
As for Ohio State , the Buckeyes are done and waiting it out .
They were fifth in the last BCS standings .
Whichever team reaches No. 1 , it'll be the fourth top - ranked team in this season of instability .
The last season with four No. 1s was 1997 .
Flynn finished with 209 yards passing and three touchdowns , two of them to Demetrius Byrd , who also was the intended receiver on the failed 2 - point try that ended the game .
Flynn ran for a 12 - yard score in the first overtime , when LSU could have emerged victorious with a stop on fourth - and - 10 .
But Casey Dick found Hillis open for a 12 - yard gain to keep the Razorbacks alive , then later found Hillis again for a 9 - yard tying TD .
Jacob Hester rushed for 126 yards and two TDs for LSU , which had to rally from a one - touchdown deficit three times in the second half , and convert two fourth - down plays on its last drive in regulation , just to force overtime .
LSU had made a habit of pulling off dramatic second - half comebacks in victories over Florida , Auburn and at Alabama .
Their only other loss also came in triple OT at Kentucky , with quarterback Andre Woodson putting on a Heisman - worthy performance .
This time , Arkansas and the embattled Nutt walked away holding the " Golden Boot , " a trophy shaped like the states of Arkansas and Louisiana .
" This league 's the toughest league in America and that 's why it 's hard for a lot of people to understand that every Saturday , anybody can beat anybody in this league , " Nutt said .
Or on Fridays .
Nutt , who will have his team in a bowl game , may not be back with the Hogs next season after growing unrest in Fayetteville , Ark .
Arkansas officials have yet to confirm that , however , and firing Nutt may be a less popular move now .
Miles ' job is not in jeopardy , but there 's been talk he could be moving after this season , too .
Miles , who played at Michigan and was an assistant coach there , is widely considered a top candidate to replace Lloyd Carr as the Wolverines ' head man .
Before Miles decides that , LSU still has a couple games to play -- just probably not the one the Tigers were hoping to play .
Sex for the first time can be painful , is often scary , and rarely happens without some difficulty .
Everything you are describing is normal and will improve with time , but for now you have a couple of options .
First , evaluate how scared you are and decide if it 's just expected anxiety over something you 're excited and ready to do , or if it 's scared because it 's happening too fast and you are n't ready for it .
If you decide that you are n't ready , then do n't do it .
Do n't let anyone pressure or rush you into this until it 's right for you .
You alone are in control over this decision .
If however you 've decided that you are going to do this ( perfectly okay decision as well ) , then here are a few tips .
First , make sure you are properly lubricated .
If you are really scared then you probably are n't aroused very much which means lubrication might be an issue .
Saliva works , but an artificial lubricant like baby oil is better .
I prefer water - based lubricants rather than oil based because they are far easier to wash off .
I recommend the non-irritating , easy to clean , non-sticky Wet Light and sugar - free Wet Light flavored lubricants .
Do NOT use Vaseline or any other petroleum jelly as it will eat through the condom .
Read the back of any lube or oil you buy before you use it .
( And yes , you must use a condom or you risk sexually transmitted diseases and / or pregnancy ) .
After you are properly lubricated ( naturally or with lube ) , the next thing to do is let yourself be in control for a while .
Your partner does n't know when something is beginning to hurt or when he should slow down .
Even if you tell him , it wo n't be until after it has already hurt you .
Try laying him down on his back and getting on top of him .
Tell him to stay still no matter how much he wants to thrust .
Take all the time you need .
Remind him that there will be plenty of evenings for him to go wild with you , but for now you need to call the shots .
Demolition began on Wednesday night at one housing project that had been scheduled to be destroyed before the storm and will begin on two other projects this weekend .
Federal officials say the barracks - style complexes were substandard before Hurricane Katrina and were badly damaged by the storm .
New subsidized housing , and vouchers for existing and new apartments , will ensure that no one who lived in the demolished projects will be left homeless , they said .
“ The goal was to rebuild it , build it better , and move people into new homes , ” said Jereon M. Brown , a spokesman for the housing department .
Mr. Brown said of the protesters : “ Ask how many of them have lived in public housing , have been to public housing other than to protest . ”
But the protesters , including some former residents of the projects , say the sturdy apartment buildings could be rehabilitated , especially at a time when little low - cost housing is available in New Orleans .
Hurricane Katrina destroyed more than 50,000 rental units here , and damaged thousands more apartments , affecting two - thirds of the city ’s rental stock .
Rents have soared for the apartments that remain habitable .
Adding to the pressure on the rental market , almost 3,000 families living in government trailer parks in Louisiana must find a new place to live in the next few months , as the Federal Emergency Management Agency closes the sites it manages .
By the end of the year , it will stop paying for 3,700 trailers in private trailer camps .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The 2008 Democratic presidential race has tightened , with Barack Obama gaining on front - runner Hillary Clinton six weeks before the first contest , according to a national Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
Among Republicans , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani expanded his national lead over second - place rival Fred Thompson , the former senator and Hollywood actor , as voters begin to focus on the race for the White House .
“ This race is just beginning , let alone all over , ” pollster John Zogby said .
Clinton led Obama 38 percent to 27 percent in the new poll , a 10 - point fall from her 46 percent to 25 percent lead last month .
The drop followed a month of attacks on the New York senator from her rivals and a heavily criticized performance in a late - October debate .
Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina remained in third place , climbing four points to 13 percent .
All other Democratic contenders scored in low single digits , including New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson at 4 percent .
About 14 percent of Democratic voters nationwide are still uncertain of their choice as the first contest approaches in Iowa , which kicks off the state - by - state battle to pick candidates for the November 4 , 2008 , presidential election .
The poll was similar to several other national and state surveys showing Obama , a first - term Illinois senator , gaining on Clinton , the senator from New York who has led most polls all year .
“ Clinton had a bad couple of weeks and as a front - runner she ’s a target for everyone , she ’s treated almost as the incumbent , ” Zogby said .
The Reuters / Zogby poll was taken November 14 - 17 , sandwiching the November 15 Democratic debate in Las Vegas , Nevada , where Clinton gave a stronger performance and fired back at her rivals .
In the Republican race , Giuliani widened his lead over Thompson to 14 points , 29 percent to 15 percent , compared to last month ’s 28 percent to 20 percent lead .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee jumped over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney into third place .
Huckabee had 11 percent , with Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain at 9 percent .
A growing number of Republicans , 21 percent , said they have not made up their mind , leaving room for more changes in the field .
The shifting numbers , after months of a relatively static race , could indicate voters around the country are beginning to pay attention to the 2008 race , Zogby said .
“ There is a real fluidity to both races , ” he said .

Clinton led Obama by at least 20 points among voters age 35 and older .
Obama ’s strength was with younger voters , leading Clinton by more than 30 points among voters between the ages of 18 and 34 .
Obama , who would be the first black president , led by 14 points among black voters .
Clinton , who would be the first woman president , led by 18 points among women .
They were virtually tied among men .
Giuliani , who has taken heat from social conservatives for his support for abortion rights , led the Republican contenders among voters who described themselves as conservative with 28 percent .
Thompson was second among conservatives with 13 percent .
Among those voters who described themselves as “ very conservative , ” however , Thompson and Huckabee led Giuliani .
Thompson drew support from 28 percent of those voters , with Huckabee at 22 percent and Giuliani at 19 percent .
The telephone poll surveyed 545 likely Democratic primary voters and 503 likely Republican primary voters , with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points for Democrats and 4.5 percentage points for Republicans .

MIRROR NEURONS and imitation learning as the driving force behind " the great leap forward " in human evolution
By V.S. Ramachandran
The discovery of mirror neurons in the frontal lobes of monkeys , and their potential relevance to human brain evolution  which I speculate on in this essay  is the single most important " unreported " ( or at least , unpublicized ) story of the decade .
I predict that mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology : they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments .
There are many puzzling questions about the evolution of the human mind and brain :
1 ) The hominid brain reached almost its present size  and perhaps even its present intellectual capacity about 250,000 years ago .
Yet many of the attributes we regard as uniquely human appeared only much later .
Why ?
What was the brain doing during the long " incubation " period ?
Why did it have all this latent potential for tool use , fire , art music and perhaps even language - that blossomed only considerably later ?
How did these latent abilities emerge , given that natural selection can only select expressed abilities , not latent ones ?
I shall call this " Wallace 's problem " , after the Victorian naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace who first proposed it .
2 ) Crude " Oldawan " tools  made by just a few blows to a core stone to create an irregular edge  emerged 2.4 million ago and were probably made by Homo Habilis whose brain size was half way ( 700 cc ) between modern humans ( 1300 ) and chimps ( 400 ) .
After another million years of evolutionary stasis aesthetically pleasing " symmetrical " tools began to appear associated with a standardization of production technique and artifact form .
These required switching from a hard hammer to a soft ( wooden ? ) hammer while the tool was being made , in order to ensure a smooth rather than jagged , irregular edge .
And lastly , the invention of stereotyped " assembly line " tools ( sophisticated symmetrical bifacial tools ) that were hafted to a handle , took place only 200,000 years ago .
Why was the evolution of the human mind " punctuated " by these relatively sudden upheavals of technological change ?
3 ) Why the sudden explosion ( often called the " great leap " ) in technological sophistication , widespread cave art , clothes , stereotyped dwellings , etc. around 40 thousand years ago , even though the brain had achieved its present " modern " size almost a million years earlier ?
4 ) Did language appear completely out of the blue as suggested by Chomsky ?
Or did it evolve from a more primitive gestural language that was already in place ?
5 ) Humans are often called the " Machiavellian Primate " referring to our ability to " read minds " in order to predict other peoples ' behavior and outsmart them .
Why are apes and humans so good at reading other individuals ' intentions ?
Do higher primates have a specialized brain center or module for generating a " theory of other minds " as proposed by Nick Humphrey and Simon Baron - Cohen ?
If so , where is this circuit and how and when did it evolve ?

CouchDB Roundup ( UPDATED )
Buzz around CouchDB continues to grow .
It 's kinda freaking me out .
Today I talked to guy a from Fortune magazine who wanted to know more about it , but I think I just end up confusing him .
Jan wrote a terrific tutorial for creating a simple Todo application with CouchDB .
Ajatus ( http://www.ajatus.info/) is pure browser implementation of distributed document management system for CouchDB .
I soooo want to spend more time playing with this .
About performance , because a lot of people are asking about it , I 'll just say I do n't know .
I 've not done any performance work on CouchDB .
No one has that I 'm aware of .
It 's been fast enough for most testing purposes , so we have n't profiled or optimized anything .
The biggest performance problem I 'll bet is that CouchDB only caches only database headers in memory , so it actually goes all the way to the OS layers for all data on each query .
Not just for document object reads , but also each btree node read in every index lookup , etc .
On most systems the OS will maintain a memory cache of the database file , so disk IO itself does n't become a bottleneck .
Instead CouchDB appears to be CPU bound , because of all those unnecessary calls and copying data across layers , encoding and decoding , etc .
The easy answer is high level object cache for the most common lookups , which I think will increase performance dramatically .
But right now will also complicate things , as the design evolves it 's best the code stay lean and nimble .
So no caching for now .
Coming Soon
The next release I hope to have implemented the incremental reduce functionality .
I 've got the design worked out ( I think ) and it should work quite well and is functionally identical to Google 's MapReduce , with incremental semantics .
CouchDB already has an incremental map facility ( the views ) , where the max cost of incrementally updating the views is logarithmic .
Now I 've figured out a fairly simple way of incrementally computing the reductions with logarithmic cost too , by extending the same view btree structures and storing intermediate reductions in the modified tree structures .
Plus I get the built - in concurrency and crash - only semantics of the existing view model .
Incremental reductions will open up a whole bunch of new reporting capabilities for CouchDB .
We also hope to have a new HTTP server layer .
We are trying to move away from the Erlang inets httpd code base and use Mochiweb .
It 's appears to be a better match for CouchDB 's purposes .
Want to Help ?
- Security Model .
CouchDB still needs a built - in security model .
I have one in mind but I 'm open to suggestions .
- Large File Driver .
Total database file size is limited to a total file size of 2/4 gig ( depending on the OS I think ) because Erlang does n't support large files in the std library .
Large file support will require a special port driver to be created for Erlang .
This driver might be a good start .
- Benchmark and Stress Testing .
Curious about CouchDB performance , scalability and reliability ?
We need someone to create some test scripts and benchmarks to hammer CouchDB .
Got questions or suggestions ?
The mailing list is the best place to start .

Different types of rice , many imported from the U.S. , are seen in Mexico City 's largest market , in this March 15 , 2007 file photo .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Trace amounts of genetically modified varieties of rice that were found commingled in the U.S. rice supply in 2006 caused more than $ 1.2 billion in damages and additional costs , the environmental group Greenpeace International said on Monday .
U.S. rice exports fell sharply after Bayer CropScience , a division of Bayer , reported in 2006 that trace amounts of its biotech LibertyLink rice variety LLRICE601 were found in a widely grown variety of U.S. rice called Cheniere .
Later , a second variety called Clearfield 131 was found to be contaminated with LLRICE604 .
“ Until we ’ve seen the report , we really ca n’t comment , ” said Bayer spokesman Greg Coffey .
The discovery of GMO - tainted rice triggered the largest financial and marketing disaster in the history of the U.S. rice industry , according to Greenpeace .
At least 30 countries were affected by the contamination and many closed their markets to U.S. rice , including major importers such as the European Union and the Philippines .
The overall cost to the industry , estimated at $ 1.2 billion , included losses of up to $ 253 million from food - product recalls in Europe , U.S. export losses of $ 254 million in the 2006 / 07 crop year and future export losses of $ 445 million , Greenpeace said .
“ It ’s impossible to know what the cost is , ” said David Coia of trade group USA Rice Federation .
“ It ’s certainly the most significant event in the history of the U.S. rice industry .
The current rice crop is in pretty good shape .
We ’ve been able to eliminate most of the genetically engineered material . ”
Hundreds of U.S. farmers and European businesses have filed lawsuits against Bayer in attempts to recoup their losses , said the environmental group .
Greenpeace is urging India not to go ahead with field trials of GMO varieties because it could risk suffering a similar contamination and loss of exports .
A lengthy U.S. investigation failed to pinpoint how the biotech rice entered the U.S. supply .
However , all three varieties of rice were grown at a research station in Louisiana from 1999 to 2001 .
Story Highlights • Only 52 of 435
House members provided information on earmark requests
• 68 declined to provide requests ; 315 did n't return calls or provide requests
• Democrats promised scrutiny of earmarks when they regained Congress
• Earmarks -- derided as " pork " -- often fund lawmakers ' pet projects
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Despite the new Democratic congressional leadership 's promise of " openness and transparency " in the budget process , a CNN survey of the House found it nearly impossible to get information on lawmakers ' pet projects .
Initially , staffers for only 34 of the 435 members of the House contacted by CNN between June 13 and 15 were willing to supply a list of their earmark requests for fiscal year 2008 , which begins on October 1 .
Some of those 34 staffers simply pointed callers to Web sites where those earmark requests were posted .
Since CNN aired the results of the survey , bloggers demanded that members of Congress release their requests .
The Chicago Tribune ran an editorial asking why members of the Illinois delegation were being so secretive .
On Thursday , Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , a member of the Illinois delegation , posted his more than 100 earmark requests on his Web site , the first presidential candidate to do so .
And 11 more House members released their earmark requests .
Six members of the House said they had no earmark requests .
Of the remainder , 68 declined to provide CNN with a list , and 315 either did n't respond to requests or said they would get back to us , and did n't .
( Find out how your representative responded )
" As long as we are not required to release them , we 're not going to , " said Dan Turner , an aide to Rep. Jim McCrery , R- Louisiana .
In 2006 , Congress approved a record $ 29 billion in earmarks .
Those spending requests -- often derided as " pork " -- fund everything from road construction and research grants to ski lifts and minor league baseball diamonds .
Legislators view these projects as important proof they are serving their constituents back home .
The 2006 total was 6.2 percent -- more than 2005's $ 27.3 billion .
When Democrats regained control of Congress last fall , they promised to create the most honest , open Congress in history .
" We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks , " Speaker - elect Nancy Pelosi said in December 2006 , " and we will give the American people the leadership they deserve . "
Democrats said Republicans had corrupted the earmark process while they controlled Congress .
Earlier this year , the House implemented rules changes that require greater disclosure of earmark requests , and the Senate passed a bill that would require lawmakers to post a list of their earmark requests on the Internet .
The bill , however , has not passed the House .
Last week , the issue came to a head as the House got bogged down deliberating the budget for the Department of Homeland Security Department .
Republicans accused the Democratic leadership of attempting to bypass debate on questionable earmarks when House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey , D - Wisconsin , said he would not attach them to legislation until those bills had passed the Senate and House and had been sent to conference committees to work out differences .
Obey said there was n't time to scrutinize the 32,000 earmark requests and keep the legislation moving .
He blamed having to " clean up after " the Republican - controlled Congress for why the requests would n't be examined in time .
( Watch Obey tell the GOP that Dems had to clean up " your mess " before addressing earmarks )
But House Republicans pointed out that position was counter to Democratic campaign promises and Obey was forced to back down and allow Republicans weeks to examine the earmark requests .
Critics said that does n't play well with reform - minded taxpayers .
" Their behavior is n't better than the last Congress and in some ways worse because they know they have those requests , " said Ryan Alexander , president of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
" We know they have more than 30,000 letters asking for specific earmarks and they 're not letting us see them . "
Tom Schatz , of Citizens Against Government Waste , said the compromise is a step in the right direction but short of promised reforms -- all requests wo n't be made public , only the ones for which spending requests are approved .
Originally there was going to be no disclosure , now we have some disclosure , " Schatz said .
" And yet again the judgment will be made by the Appropriations Committee staff . "
But others like Public Citizen say the compromise is far from what was promised .
" It violates the whole spirit of the reform , said Craig Holman , legislative representative for the nonpartisan group 's Congress Watch .
" We really did expect that earmark requests would be an open book so that all of America could sit there and take a look at who 's requesting what earmarks , " Holman said .
CNN staffers Amanda Sealy and Todd Schwarzschild and interns Rachel Zelkowitz , William Hudson , Rachel Reynolds , Chamise Jones , Haley Van Dyck and Brittany Edney contributed to this report .
" Red November , black November / Bleak November , black and red . /
Hallowed month of labor 's martyrs , / Labor 's heroes , labor 's dead . "
So wrote radical poet and American political prisoner Ralph Chaplin in 1933 .
The month of November is indeed a hallowed month for leftists in this country and around the world .
In November 1915 , a Utah firing squad executed Joe Hill , the labor activist and songwriter whose tunes would later inspire such politically oriented musicians as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan .
Jailed on a murder charge under dubious circumstances , Joe Hill had supporters around the world , including President Wilson , who said the radical troubadour had not received a fair trial because of his membership in the militant Industrial Workers of the World labor union , also known as the Wobblies .
A year later , in November 1916 , police gunfire killed five Wobblies who were arriving by boat for a labor rally in Everett , Wash .
Two police officers also were killed , probably by " friendly fire " from their own ranks .
The Everett Massacre was another chapter of labor history written in blood .
Washington 's long saga of labor unrest reached a high point of horror in the small logging town of Centralia in November 1919 .
During an Armistice Day parade celebrating the end of World War I , members of the newly - formed American Legion attacked an IWW meeting hall .
Union men fought back and there was gunfire from both sides in the conflict .
Wesley Everest , a lumberjack , IWW member and World War I veteran , vowed , " I fought for democracy in Europe and I 'll fight for it here " as he fired his pistol at the mob .
That night , the captured Everest was taken from jail and lynched in his Army uniform .
His body was displayed to gawking townspeople for three days and pieces of the lynching rope became coveted souvenirs of an event still remembered in labor history as the Centralia Conspiracy .
No event in the history of American labor strife has had the impact of the trial and executions of the anarchists and union organizers hanged in Chicago on Nov. 11 , 1887 , for their roles in what historian Paul Avrich has called " The Haymarket Tragedy " in his definitive book about the incident .
Union men and women were on the march in post - Civil War Chicago , and the city had become a mecca for radicals .
Both the Democratic and Republican mainstream political parties offered little hope for disgruntled and downtrodden workers both immigrant and American - born , so doctrines like anarchy , socialism , communism , feminism and labor activism sprouted in the political soil of late - 19th - century America .
In 1886 , a bomb powered by the newly invented dynamite was thrown into the ranks of cops who were attacking a labor rally in Chicago 's Haymarket district .
One officer was killed outright and several others were wounded .
To this day , no one knows precisely how many labor activists were killed or injured in the incident and no one knows who threw the dreadful bomb .
Historians do know that martial law was declared in Chicago as the whole country came under the hysteria of this nation 's first " Red Scare , " as men who had no part in the bombing were hanged for their anarchist opinions .
" Make the raids first and look up the law afterwards , " sneered Chicago prosecutor Julius Grinnel .
After a sensational trial that had what Avrich called " the dimensions of a historical tragedy , " four of the anarchists were hanged by Windy City authorities on Nov. 11 , 1887 - 120 years ago this week .
The Haymarket affair had many political elements that we still struggle with today : government surveillance , police misconduct , immigration , workers ' rights .
It was one of the most important events in American history , but it is history that often is ignored by schools and colleges .
As Ralph Chaplin wrote in " Wobbly , " his autobiography : " Working people , like everyone else , have a way of forgetting the struggles and sacrifices that made possible the improved conditions they enjoy today . "

“ If human embryonic stem cell research does not make you at least a little bit uncomfortable , you have not thought about it enough , ” he said .
“ I thought long and hard about whether I would do it . ”
He decided in the end to go ahead , reasoning that the work was important and that he was using embryos from fertility clinics that would have been destroyed otherwise .
The couples whose sperm and eggs were used to create the embryos had said they no longer wanted them .
Nonetheless , Dr. Thomson said , announcing that he had obtained human embryonic stem cells was “ scary , ” adding , “ It was not known how it would be received . ”
But he never anticipated the extent and rancor of the stem cell debate .
For nearly a decade now , the issue has bitterly divided patients and politicians , religious groups and researchers .
Now with the new technique , which involves adding just four genes to ordinary adult skin cells , it will not be long , he says , before the stem cell wars are a distant memory .
“ A decade from now , this will be just a funny historical footnote , ” Dr. Thomson said in the interview .
As for the science behind it , the thrill of discovery , he said , “ Surprisingly , there is no ‘ Wow ’ moment , ” either from 1998 or now .
Both times , the discovery came after he had spent months rigorously testing the cells to be sure they really were stem cells , worrying all the while that they could die or be lost to contamination .
When he knew he had succeeded , the suspense was gone .

Best Buy during the holidays is a special kind of hell .
Swarms of soccer moms trailing toddlers , looking for the new game of the year .
Overweight dads butt - glued into recliners in front of NASA - style walls of aggressive televisions , commenting on the silent football games arrayed before them .
Hordes of middle aged couples making dreadfully misguided computer purchases .
But the best part of the Best Buy holiday extravaganza are the demo kids .
And it was one of these kids who showed me something I will never see again .
Guitar Hero 3 . " Through the Fire and the Flames . " Expert .
This is a good year for Demo kids .
At our local ( meaning a half - hour drive ) Best Buy there are several honey - pots distributed .
Each is well placed in order to siphon off parental traffic towards easy - to - purchase , high - margin merchandise .
Along one aisle , a big screen TV is set in a small 12 by 12 carpet square , with a 5.1 sound system ( the rear speakers on mic stands ) and a handful of low - to - the - ground " gaming chairs . "
In the cabinet under the TV sits an Xbox 360 .
In the chairs sit - perpetually - three teenage boys , their eyes intent on game - du - jour .
This Sunday , it was Halo 3 splitscreen .
Nobody was deluding themselves that this was any kind of demo - these kids were settling a score , and they were there for the duration .
At the main entrance , a much larger setup is dedicated to Rock Band .
Tellingly , the guitars are both Guitar Hero 2 era wired Explorers , the workhorse standard in the guitar game universe .
The drum kit features duct tape in several places .
As I walk by , 4 teenage boys are playing " Maps " by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , a choice not only unlikely due to the song 's laconic and decidedly non-hardcore tone , but also due to the fact that one of the boys is actually singing , amplified , and doing it quite well .
That Rock Band has brought baggy - trousered boys out of their basements to actually sing in public is a testament to the game 's power .
That my four year old son
Jake is also singing every word with perfect diction and not - half - bad tone is a testament to how many hours I 've played it , not any expression of talent on his part .
And then there 's the Guitar Hero setup .
Let 's face it , if there was a battle going on between Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 , GH3 not only lost , it packed up its marbles and went home .
An entertaining extension of the franchise to be sure , it is been relegated to a mid-aisle station in the PC gaming ghetto , not even worthy of console - land real estate .
The Xbox 360 is perched atop the shelves connected to a paltry 20 - something standard - definition screen .
One heavily abused wired Gibson guitar hangs by its strap , calling out to me even though I know I have the game at home , can't play anything particularly impressive , and have no time to waste as we press through the herd .
As I stare wistfully down the PC game aisle , the posse approaches .
Four teenage boys ( it always seems to be boys ) , not so much walking , but dancing , like poised ballerinas .
Their torsos are almost entirely motionless as their legs slide along the floor .
Their pants are ridiculous : large enough for two and beltless , each clearly a plumber 's apprentice .
They wear unmatching zip hoodies .
The tallest of the boys is perhaps 6 feet .
His skin is pasty white and pimpled , with what might pass for baby - soft stubble .
His hair is a mass of center - parted brown grease .
I feel a deep sympathy for him .
As one and with purpose , they stop in front of the GH3 shrine .
Choreographed in their movements , the smallest of the clan hands the well - used Gibson Les Paul reverently to the leader .
" OK Kyle , here you go . "
Kyle takes the guitar from him .
Jake is getting antsy .
" Ratatouille !
Daddy we have n't even seen Ratatouille ! "
I lose my focus on Kyle as I negotiate the non-purchase of Pixar 's ratmovie .
Uncurling from the bent over toddler - discussion Yoga pose , I see Kyle move through the selection screens , and my heart jumps to my throat .
" Through the Fire and the Flames " on Expert .
The inclusion of Fire and the Flames in Guitar Hero 3 always struck me as something of a cruel joke .
Upon beating the game , Fire and the Flames plays as the credits roll .
It plays in a kind of practice mode , so that you have the opportunity to flail on the ridiculous note chart .
The song itself is classic hair - guitar , and while watching the original guitarist play it is a jaw dropping " holy - Jesus - on - a - popsicle - stick " experience , as music goes it 's not the kind of thing I put on my iPod for casual listening .
It exists purely as an expression of guitar hubris .
As the stage swirls on the screen , a calm comes over Kyle .
His face slackens a bit .
He closes his eyes .
His lieutenants absorb his tension , shuffling their feet , biting their nails .
The highway of the fret board starts rolling , and as the first note falls , Kyle 's eyes open .
The entire intro of Fire is hammer -ons .
There 's no preamble .
There 's no warm up .
It starts hard and it stays hard .
Both of Kyle 's hands are poised over the fret buttons as he taps out the notes .
He is not looking at the screen .
He is looking at his fingers .
His long neck and arms make the guitar controller look even more diminutive than it is .
He is curled over it , completely motionless but for his fingers .
I look at the screen as he passes " 200 note streak . "
The second half of the intro starts at about 30 seconds in and moves from hammer - ons to a rapidfire staccato .
I 've seen this on YouTube ego - clips , so I 'm expecting the sharp jackhammer of the strum bar as he approaches what must be 20 notes per second .
But instead of loud and frantic flailing , his face slackens , his lips parting slightly , and he is nearly silent .
Instead of slamming the strumbar with mechanical arrogance , he holds it between two fingers as if plucking petals off a rose , each stroke a delicate whisper .
300 note streak .
400 note streak .
500 note streak .
At about one minute in there is a pause , perhaps five seconds where the band 's singer mumbles some 1980 's era lyrics into a microphone .
I 've never particularly cared what he had to say .
Kyle is absolutely motionless .
There 's no shaking out of hands , no turning to make knowing glances at his audience or worry about his hair .
He blinks .
The song enters another manic section .
Occasionally he shifts his right hand up from the strum bar to tap out a hammer - on section .
His face continues to soften .
He has lost at least an inch of height as his spine and knees succumb to gravity .
A minute and a half into the song , I see him falter , missing a note for the first time and resetting his multiplier to zero .
It 's not clear that Kyle has noticed .
The shortest of his kinsmen , the one who had so reverently handed him the guitar , sends a glance my way , then down towards my knees to the eyes of my 4 year old .
I bend over and pick him up .
" Can we go ? " Jake asks .
A reasonable question for which there is no reasonable answer .
" Just a minute , I need to see this . "
I point at the screen .
3 , 4 , 5 minutes into the song .
Kyle slips deeper into what is clearly a state of Samadhi ;
He no longer perceives a space between himself and the game .
There is no him .
There is no song .
There is no guitar .
At 6 minutes in , a small crowd has formed , perhaps 15 of us .
His sravaka - his disciples - look nervously at us , absorbing the distractions , protecting him a bubble of calm .
There is complete silence .
Even my son is staring slackjawed , like he does in church during communion , not understanding the content of the ritual but understanding the tone and sacredness of the space .
At just over 6 minutes , the song becomes even more ludicrous .
While actually playing it will ever remain for me an uncrossable gap , I am enough a student of the form to recognize the crux .
He is Lance Armstrong approaching the bottom of Alpe D'Huez : Will he attack ?
Kyle has yet to use the Star Power crutch he has carried throughout his meditation .
He continues to ignore it .
His posse is immobile now : brows furrowed in tension , fingers white and digging into palms .
I realize I have n't blinked in too long and force myself .
My palms are sweating , my left hand cramped in sympathy .
As the song comes to it 's unrelenting conclusion , I can only stare at Kyle 's face .
His eyelids have dropped , half covering his irises .
He hits the last orange note .
He lets the guitar fall from his hands onto the floor .
It 's not an act of disdain or bravado , his hands simply open and then there is no guitar .
I look at the screen .
" You Rock ! "
Jake echoes with the screen .
500,000 points .
Kyle is n't looking .
The small crowd claps for a second , then starts to disperse .
I try to catch his eyes , to make some feeble 40 - year - old - dad gesture : maybe a nod , or a humble utterance of " nice . "
But , his sutra complete , his eyes have gone to his shoes .
His companions pat him on the back , not with a juvenile high - five , but with an almost loving touch , they way you 'd touch an aging parent on the back when asking if they 're pneumonia was getting better .
They turn away from us and walk back down the aisle in the direction they had come .
Jake squirms .
I put him down and take his hand .
It 's warm and soft and surprisingly strong as he squeezes mine .
As we walk out of the store , I have the odd sense of being aware of my breathing .
For a moment at least , it becomes a conscious act .
Few among the 34.5 million could have been disappointed .
But what could those viewers have thought of the usually well - spoken Gumbel , who said early in the game , “ The Patriots with their high - powered offense come back on the field for the first time this evening ” ?
They heard someone who should n’t be in this seat , not beside Cris Collinsworth , who has proved through his work on the NFL Network , NBC and HBO that he is the best N.F.L. analyst around .
But Gumbel , one of the most talented studio personalities of the last 25 years , is struggling to learn what he should be doing after the network ’s two seasons .
He does n’t see the field well , which leads him to be imprecise ( or wrong ) about yardage gained on a play or the yard line .
More often than not , he will not even try to provide the yardage .

His imprecision leads him to fall back on ambiguities like “ the ball is inside the 10 ” or “ way short of the first - down marker , ” phrases that more experienced announcers only occasionally use .
Gumbel uses them as crutches .
He repeatedly locates a play as going to “ this side ” or the “ far side , ” when “ right ” or “ left ” will suffice .
He too frequently uses “ stone ” as a verb to denote a runner gaining little or no yardage .
How about “ stacked up ” or “ stopped ” ?

There are good reasons on both sides for Gore to remain coy .
On the one hand , if he has already decided against a run , it makes sense to keep the suspicion alive and force your issues to stay at the forefront .
On the other hand , he knows he can wait until September / October , bypass most of the petty bickering between now and then , and still retain the capacity to raise tons of money overnight and steal the show .
Gore already looks to be slimming down .
Maybe Diane Sawyer can read into that for us .
In case you missed it , check out Gore 's appearance on " The Daily Show " and his hour long chat with Charlie Rose .

A striking young woman with a talent for painting , Sharise Gatchell was - like many teenagers - painfully self - conscious .
At 14 , she moved with her family from South Africa to England where at first she found it hard to make friends .
By the age of 16 she was acutely embarrassed that her periods had n't started and felt she was sweating excessively .
Just the sort of thing to make adolescence even more painful than usual .
Her mother , Stephanie , took her to see a consultant physician at the local hospital .
Stephanie Gatchell recalls :
" During that consultation she became a bit emotional because she was explaining to him about the problems she had and how it affected her social life .
Then she started crying and I was amazed .
He asked her , ' Sharise , do you sometimes feel like ending it all ? ' , and I could n't believe it when she said ' Yes I do . '
And then he started talking about paroxetine and suggesting that she try it . "
" Off - label " Prescriptions
Paroxetine - better known as Paxil in the U.S. - is an antidepressant .
It is licensed only for adults , but doctors are allowed to prescribe any medicine if they think it will help their patient , a practice called " off- label " prescribing .
Sharise was not the only teenager getting paroxetine off - label .
Around 7,000 children a year were on the drug in the UK ; and many more in the U.S .
Within days of starting on paroxetine , Stephanie noticed a dramatic change in her daughter : she became more confident .
But with the confidence came aggression and worse :
" One day in the kitchen her sleeve pulled up slightly and I noticed that there were cut marks on her left arm .
I could n't believe my eyes .
She was obviously self - harming while she was on the drug , something she 's never ever done before . "
Stephanie persuaded her daughter to stop taking paroxetine .
But in 2003 Sharise went back on it without telling her mother .
When her parents returned from a weekend break , Stephanie immediately realized something was terribly wrong :
" I went upstairs before my husband came in , and the moment I got to the landing at the top and I turned round and looked , she was hanging from the loft hatch .
I tried to revive her , but before I even started I realized I was too late . "
Next to her daughter 's suicide note lay a packet of paroxetine .
Stephanie instinctively blamed the drug and now blames herself for letting her daughter take it .
But she could n't have known what the drug 's manufacturer had known for years .
GlaxoSmithKline Experiments on Children
UK - based GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , the second largest drug company in the world , which recorded 2006 sales of over $ 45 billion , had begun a series of clinical trials in the mid-1990s to test whether paroxetine would work in depressed children .
Paroxetine had already been hailed as a wonder drug in adults as a treatment for everything from depression and stress to anxiety and even shyness .
By the new millennium 100 million paroxetine prescriptions had been written worldwide , bringing in $ 2 billion a year for GSK and placing the antidepressant a close second to Prozac in popularity .
With the adult market sewn up , the company sought new ways to make money from the drug , or " life cycle management , " as the approach is known in the pharmaceutical industry .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wanted to boost the number of medicines tested for children and had introduced an incentive that would give companies a six - month extension on their patent just for carrying out pediatric trials .
For paroxetine alone that would be worth $ 1 billion .
And if GSK could be the first company to prove its antidepressant was safe and effective for children , the rewards would be even higher , as paroxetine could become the market leader .
Hundreds of children were recruited from around the world to take part in three clinical trials .
One group was given the drug , the other a placebo .
They were randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) where neither the children nor their doctors knew whether they were taking the active drug or the placebo until the end of the study .
This is widely accepted as the best way of working out whether a drug causes a particular effect : the gold standard in terms of evidence .
But the outcome of these the trials was not what GSK had been hoping for .
Paroxetine proved no better than placebo .
In the biggest trial , Study 329 , which was conducted across several sites in the U.S. , 11 of the 93 children who took paroxetine developed serious side - effects ; seven had to be hospitalized .
Significantly more had self - harmed or attempted suicide on the drug than on placebo .
The BBC ( British Broadcasting Corporation ) obtained confidential case reports from Study 329 which detail what happened to them :
" [ 13 days after starting paroxetine ] the patient became very angry .
He punched pictures , broke glass and sustained lacerations that required six sutures ... he expressed hopelessness and possible suicide thoughts . "
" The patient began exhibiting symptoms of disinhibition , grandiosity and expansive mood around week four [ after eight weeks ] the patient became agitated and said she would kill herself . "
" [ 11 days after starting paroxetine ] the patient was hospitalized for psychosis with auditory hallucinations and superficial cuts . "
Yet this was a drug that was supposed to make children happier and reduce the risk of suicide .
The company knew it had a problem .
In an internal memo to senior executives in 1998 the product director for paroxetine admitted :
" The results of the studies were disappointing .
The possibility of obtaining a safety statement from this data was considered but rejected .
Consultation of the marketing teams confirmed that this would be unacceptable commercially . "
In other words , publishing the data in full would undermine the drug 's safety profile and put profits at risk .
It took five years for this information to reach the public domain and only then as a result of the BBC investigation .
In the intervening years doctors continued to prescribe a drug to tens of thousands of vulnerable children , ignorant of the fact that it had not been shown to work and was harmful to some .
Lawsuits Reveal Questionable Paper Trail
This has been described by British psychiatrist Dr. David Healy as " the biggest medical scandal since thalidomide . "
Dr. Healy , rather than the regulatory authorities charged with monitoring the safety of medicines , was instrumental in uncovering the evidence at the heart of the scandal .
It was a series of U.S. legal actions that led Dr. Healy , as an expert witness , and the legal team with whom he was working , deep into GSK 's secret archives , where they found a series of damning internal documents .
What this paper trail reveals is how the company , with no hope of obtaining a children 's license , devised a back - door method of marketing paroxetine for childhood depression .
In came the spin-doctors to bury the inconvenient facts and spread the good news to doctors around the world that paroxetine was safe and effective for children .
Drug companies discovered long ago that doctors are much more likely to be persuaded by their peers than by the hard sell of sales reps .
So GSK built a business relationship with several leading academics to write articles and speak at conferences , effectively selling paroxetine for the company .
They are known in the trade as " Key Opinion Leaders . "
Internal company documents reveal that Professor Martin Keller , Chair of Psychiatry at Brown University in the U.S. , was one of the company 's leading Key Opinion Leaders .
He was named as the author of Study 329 .
But the documents cast doubt on whether he actually analyzed the data himself and wrote the final paper .
In a memo , Professor Keller thanks a ghost writer for the initial preparation of the study manuscript - a ghost writer who works for a medical public relations company hired by GSK :
" You did a superb job with this .
Thank you very much .
It is excellent .
Enclosed are some rather minor changes from me . "
It is clear from the internal correspondence that the ghost writer was making some important decisions about how to present the data for publication .
At one point a senior GSK executive comments that : " It seems incongruous that we state that paroxetine is safe yet report so many Serious Adverse Events . "
GSK suggests to the public relations person that she make clear paroxetine may have caused all 11 of the serious side - effects .
But the final article says : " Of the 11 patients , only headache ( 1 patient ) was considered to be related to the treatment . "
The paper never states clearly how many children became suicidal , nor does it explore whether the drug was to blame .
Instead , it concludes that paroxetine is " generally well - tolerated and effective " .
The next step in GSK 's marketing plan was to get the study published .
Doctors rely on medical journals to give them advice they can trust .
The first journal GSK approached spotted flaws in the study and rejected it .
So the company sent it to the premier children 's mental health magazine , the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry .
Its peer reviewers also spotted the flaws , as is clear from their confidential comments :
" Overall .
Results do not clearly indicate efficacy , authors need to clearly note this . "
" The relatively high rate of serious adverse effects was not addressed in the discussion . "
" Given the high placebo response rate , are [ these drugs ] an acceptable first - line therapy for depressed teenagers ? "
Nevertheless , the journal published the study .
Who knows how many child and adolescent psychiatrists around the world were influenced by the article 's misleading conclusion ?
At the same time , another of GSK's PR people was saying in an internal memo :
" Originally we had planned to do extensive media relations surrounding this study until we actually viewed the results .
Essentially the study did not really show paroxetine was effective in treating adolescent depression , which is not something we want to publicize . "
Objective Medical Opinion ?
When I first started looking at Study 329 for the BBC in 2002 , I was confused about its findings .
The published article 's conclusions seemed at odds with the details of the study .
I went to Philadelphia to interview one of the authors and came across another of GSK's Key Opinion Leaders - Dr. Neil Ryan , an eminent child psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh .
He was speaking at an American Psychiatric Association symposium sponsored by GSK but I had no reason at that time to think he was anything other than independent .
Dr. Ryan told the audience that paroxetine was effective for children with depression .
He did n't mention anything about the apparent high rate of psychiatric side - effects of paroxetine in Study 329 .
But the more I studied the data , the more convinced I became that paroxetine was causing serious problems for some kids who took it .
When I returned to Britain , I pursued him by telephone but he refused to talk to me about it .
Fast forward four years , when the internal GSK documents revealed what had actually been going on behind the scenes .
Dr. Ryan had been asking the company that sponsored his research how he should deal with my awkward questions , emailing all my correspondence to them .
In one email he said :
" I 'll call you again later today and you can advise on how might be best to handle this . "
GSK denies that it promoted paroxetine for off - label use through Key Opinion Leaders or any other route , laying the responsibility firmly at the door of individual clinicians .
A statement issued by the company reads : " Any decision to prescribe a medicine outside its authorized indications , in the EU or the U.S. , is made by a doctor on the basis of his / her clinical judgement and the interests of their patient . "
But where do doctors get the information from that gives them the confidence to prescribe off - label ?
From medical journals and conferences .
It was the documents that in the end exposed the Key Opinion Leaders and the drug company .
Without the U.S. legal action we would have been none the wiser .
The drug is now effectively banned in the UK for use in under - 18s and in the U.S. it carries a " black box " warning about the risk of suicidal behaviour .
This drug was GSK 's golden egg for many years and a lucrative business was built around its promotion .
So it is perhaps not surprising the company dismissed my investigation as media scaremongering .
What is surprising , though , is how many doctors on both sides of the Atlantic who claim to practice evidence - based medicine still refuse to acknowledge the damage the drugs can do - even though the evidence comes from GSK's own RCTs and the company 's internal correspondence clearly shows how they tried to cover it up .
Sales Affected by Warning Labels
Dr. Mike Shooter , former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a child psychiatrist who used to prescribe paroxetine , says :
" I personally felt cheated and heaven only knows what the children , adolescents and their parents and their doctors on the other end of that felt .
Very much the same .
This has huge implications , right through medicine . "
Professor Keller and Dr. Ryan seem unabashed by their role in the scandal .
A few months ago Professor Keller co-authored another paper , on the impact of media reporting on prescribing .
Rather than exploring how those conducting the trials overlooked the damage to children caused by the drug , he and his co-authors expressed concern that prescriptions of antidepressants to children have declined sharply in the U.S. since the addition of the black box warning - as if the increased risk of suicidal behaviour on the drugs was n't something that should affect prescribing .
The FDA is now considering whether to remove the black box warning on paroxetine and other similar antidepressants because it is scaring doctors .
In the UK , the regulatory authorities are investigating whether GSK acted fraudulently in its conduct over Study 329 .
Theoretically , criminal charges could be brought , but the medicine 's regulator is fully - funded by the drugs industry , so do n't hold your breath .
Meanwhile , Stephanie Gatchell and her husband have moved away from the home that holds so many awful memories , to start a new life in Ireland .
They can't forgive GlaxoSmithKline for concealing what it knew about paroxetine :
" I can't understand how they could possibly be so devious , and all just because of profit .
I think the decision - makers in that company should be brought to justice .
They have a lot to explain . "

Let 's be clear .
Alberto Gonzales is resigning as attorney general not because he 's become an embarrassment to the Bush administration -- which has repeatedly shown itself to be beyond embarrassment -- but because he is no longer useful .
Exposed as a serial liar and an administration hack , he can no longer be relied upon by the Bush administration to carry forward its criminal agenda of subverting the Constitution , the electoral process and the Bill of Rights , because his every step is being watched by the public and the Congress .
But this is no victory unless the Congress follows up by pursuing those who put Gonzales up to his crimes .
The whole reason felons and hacks like Gonzales resign from office is to bury their misdeeds by leaving town .
If Congress then obliges by moving on to other things , the resignation will have succeeded .
Next , it looks like we will have Michael Chertoff as AG .
Now on one level that might seem to be an improvement .
Gonzales was a both a house servant to Bush through his years as governor and president , doing whatever was necessary to tidy up after Bush 's messes , like hiding evidence of his drunk driving record and his dereliction of duty during the Vietnam War , and a kind of mob attorney , developing legal loopholes to protect the president from prosecution ( or impeachment ) for various crimes as president , like violating the Geneva Conventions or unleashing the nation 's spy apparatus against Americans .
Chertoff , who is not a part of the Texas Mafia , may not be so ready to cross the line into rank sycophancy and to play the role of co-conspirator , particularly given that it 's only for another 16 months .
Then again , Chertoff , in his short stint at what is still referred to as the " Justice " Department , headed up the anti-terrorism unit under Gonzales ' predecessor , John Ashcroft , and willingly played along with the sham prosecution of John Walker Lindh , the kid who was captured in Afghanistan and inflated by Ashcroft and Chertoff into " the American Taliban . "
It was Chertoff who successfully deep - sixed evidence of Lindh 's weeks of torture at the hands of American forces , by threatening Lindh with a treason prosecution , while holding out the offer of a deal - - " just " 15 years in the can if he agreed to sign a fraudulent statement saying he had " never been mistreated " in US captivity , and to accept a gag order barring him from talking about what had happened to him for the entire length of his sentence -- an unprecedented gag order .
That prosecution and silencing of Lindh , which prevented the public from exploring the deliberate campaign of torture that had been developed in Afghanistan , later to " migrate " to Guantanamo and thence to Abu Ghraib and Iraq , was in its way as damaging to the nation as was Chertoff 's other signal disaster -- his inept and callous mishandling of the catastrophe of the Katrina flooding of New Orleans .
If Chertoff - - a demonstrable failure both as an administrator and as a defender of justice -- is the best this administration can come up with as a replacement for Gonzales , we should be worried about the future of the nation 's " justice " system .
( Okay , I concede that the Justice Department has as much to do with justice as the Defense Department has to do with defense or the Education Department has to do with education . )
The one good thing that can be said about the Gonzales resignation is that it eliminates the Democratic leadership 's latest gambit for attempting to derail the impeachment movement .
As support for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney has grown , both among the public at large and in Congress , where there are now at least 20 co-sponsors for Rep.
Dennis Kucinich 's Cheney impeachment bill , the Democratic leadership in the House scrambled to get behind a purely inside - the - beltway " campaign " to impeach Gonzales - - a move that did succeed in dividing the real , authentic impeachment movement .
The interesting thing is that in backing the impeachment of Gonzales , those leaders and senior House Democrats who have been brushing off the broader impeachment movement gave the lie to two of their main arguments against impeachment -- that it would be " too divisive " and that there " is n't time " for impeachment .
Clearly if it was n't too late to impeach Gonzales , and if impeaching Gonzales would not be too divisive , neither is it too late to impeach Cheney and neither would impeaching Cheney be " too divisive . "
So let 's hail the departure of Gonzo , let 's demand a thorough vetting of the demonstrably incompetent and unprincipled Chertoff , and most importantly , let 's move forward with the campaign to impeach Cheney , starting with a full - court campaign to get all those who so readily signed on to Washington Rep.
Jay Inslee 's Gonzales impeachment bill to now sign on to Rep. Kucinich's H. Res. 333 , a resolution to impeach the vice president .

Researchers in a remote jungle in Indonesia have discovered a giant rat - five times the size of a typical city rat - and a tiny possum that are apparently new to science .
Unearthing new species of mammals in the 21st century is very rare .
The discoveries by a team of American and Indonesian scientists are being studied further to confirm their status .
The animals were found in the Foja mountains rainforest in eastern Papua province in a June expedition , said US - based Conservation International , which organised the trip along with the Indonesian Institute of Science .
Rumours suggesting that BioWare could be working on a follow - up to Knights of the Old Republic have been circulating for some time .
Today , there 's a little more substance to the stories as LucasArts has announced it 's teaming up with the KOTOR developer once again , on an undisclosed " interactive entertainment product " .
LucasArts is remaining tight - lipped however , merely noting that the collaboration " will push the boundaries of the gaming market by utilising the strengths of both companies to deliver an innovative , high - quality experience " .
Specific details are set to be revealed at a future event .

Meanwhile , Greg Zeschuk , president of BioWare added , " The collaboration with LucasArts allows us to combine our passion for creating high quality and innovative experiences with those of a company dedicated to bringing only the finest games to market " .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - The United States could unleash vastly superior firepower if it attacked Iran but Tehran could strike back against its forces in Iraq and threaten oil supplies crucial to the world economy .
Speculation is growing that President George W. Bush could launch military action before he leaves office in January 2009 even though Washington says it is committed to resolving the crisis over Iran ’s disputed atomic ambitions diplomatically .
“ It should be a walkover militarily , ” said London - based defense analyst Andrew Brookes about any U.S. attempt to knock out the Islamic Republic ’s atomic installations .
“ The hard bit is what comes afterwards and that is opening Pandora ’s box , ” said Brookes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) think - tank .
Western powers suspect Iran is seeking to build atom bombs .
Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more of its oil and gas .
A former Iranian official with links to the country ’s highest authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , suggested Tehran would respond by using allies in the region to take the fight elsewhere in the Middle East .
“ If they want to play games with us , I believe in a few ways we can turn Iraq into a fiery battlefield , ” he said .
“ GRIE F ”
Security experts voiced different opinions about the strength of Iran ’s armed forces in a showdown with the United States , which they believe would involve a U.S. air campaign but not an invasion by ground forces .
The military , under an arms embargo imposed by Washington , still partly relies on fighter aircraft and hardware bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S. - backed shah , topped up with domestically produced equipment as well as imports from Russia and others .
A Western diplomat said Iranian leaders were confident U.S. aerial bombardment would not threaten their hold on power .
“ A bombing campaign has never removed a government and especially not in a country like this when there is no organized opposition , ” the Tehran - based diplomat said .
Iran ’s confidence has grown as it watched America ’s failure to get a grip on Iraq despite its overwhelming military supremacy .
Iran says it has missiles that could hit Israel and other state of the art weaponry and that the West would regret any attack , warning of a “ quagmire deeper than Iraq . ”
Such statements may be exaggerated and aimed at a domestic audience , but some analysts say Iran could retaliate by , for example , using speed boats to launch guerrilla - style hit - and - run attacks on oil shipping , so - called “ asymmetric ” warfare .
Iran , blamed for bomb attacks carried out by Shi’ite militants against U.S. interests in Beirut in the 1980s , could also resort to its old tactics , some add .
An Iranian commander last week said “ martyrdom - seeking ” militia would be able to disrupt Gulf transport routes .
“ Iran can not win a military campaign in a conventional sense but what it can do is cause considerable amount of grief afterwards , ” Brookes said .
This line of thinking was reflected in a commentary in Iranian daily Siyasat-e Ruz which said the elite Revolutionary Guards had held exercises in the “ strategy of irregular combat . ”
“ We are confident we can defend this country ...
In case of a war , Iranians will do everything that they can do , ” said Iranian analyst Abbas Maleki .
“ MAJOR BATTLEFIELD ”
Tim Ripley , a defense analyst who works for Jane ’s Defense Weekly , said Iran ’s armed forces had shown resilience during their 1980s war with Iraq and the nightmare scenario for Washington would be launching a war it could then not finish .
The United States had the capability for another “ shock and awe ” campaign but fighting Iran would not be like the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and parts of the Iranian military would likely “ put up a real good fight , ” he said .
“ If you compare like for like the Iranians may not be as good as the Americans but their leadership ... know how to use what they ’ve got to really great effect , ” Ripley said .
He said Iran could simply declare the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance of the Gulf a war zone to send oil prices , already nearing $ 100 a barrel , soaring without a shot being fired .
How to prevent any spillover effect in Iraq , where Shi’ite militants loyal to Tehran operate , is also likely to preoccupy U.S. planners in case of conflict with Iran .
The United States often accuses Iran of fomenting violence in Iraq but the Western diplomat said Tehran at the moment actually seemed to be restricting the flow of arms to Iraqi militias , a policy it could reverse if it felt threatened .
“ The major battlefield is Iraq , ” said Dubai - based security analyst Mustafa Alani .
One Western expert said Iran ’s military was in a better state “ than people give it credit for ” with good technology and equipment including Russian anti-aircraft missile defense .
But Alani was less impressed .
He said he did not think Iran could either prevent an American attack or strike back by , for example , shutting down the Strait of Hormuz .
“ We believe there is a huge exaggeration about Iranian military capability , ” Alani said .
“ The only problem is Iraq . ”
This article was inspired by a book I read called “ No More Mr. Nice Guy ” by Danny Glover .
It seems American society is being flooded with nice guys .
Every women reading this article knows EXACTLY what a nice guy is .
There ’s no need to pull out Websters here .
In addition to that , every woman reading this knows AT LEAST one nice guy in her social circle .
For the men reading this , chances are if you are an American male , you have a very strong possibility of being a nice guy .
Here ’s the litmus test you can use in order to determine if you are one .
Do you constantly seek approval from women ?
Do you try to “ buy ” love from women with fancy dinners and gifts ?
Do women that you like tell you you ’re like a brother to them ?
( that ’s the kiss of death btw )
When you ask women out , do they reply “ Let ’s just be friends . ” ?
Do you think it ’s bad to be male ?
If you find yourself nodding along to these questions , I ’m sorry to be the one to point out to you that you are a 100 % Certified Grade A Nice Guy with all the trimmings , but do n’t despair , there is hope .
A lot of theories have been tossed around regarding why women do n’t go for the nice guys .
“ They ’re not a challenge . ”
“ They ’re too boring . ”
“ There ’s no excitement . ”
“ They ’re too easy to get . ”
“ They ’re pushovers . ”
These to me , are the superficial reasons why women do n’t go for nice guys .
We need to dig a bit deeper .
What ’s the root reason why nice guys ca n’t get the girls ?
In my opinion , there are actually two root reasons .
1 . They do n’t embrace their masculinity .
2 . They put women on a pedestal .
1 . They do n’t embrace their masculinity .
The book I mentioned lists several reasons as to why men of this generation have become nice guys .
One reason that really struck me was radical feminism .
Glover stated that radical feminism led to a social climate that was extremely hostile toward men .
“ All men are pigs . ”
“ Men are the cause of all the problems in the world . ”
“ Men are rapists . ”
“ All men are good for nothing animals who treat women like pieces of meat . ”
Therefore , boys concluded that women did not like men , so they strive to hide their masculinity .
After all , men were pigs right ?
And women do n’t like that right ?
So do n’t be a man , and you wo n’t be a pig and women will like that right ?
Twisted reasoning indeed .
The result ?
Women all over America becoming extremely frustrated with the lack of real men today .
Radical feminism has tasted the fruits of its labor and it is very bitter .
Do n’t mess with nature .
If you ’re male , be male .
If you ’re female , be female .
Do n’t hide it .
Embrace it .
Get the notion of “ It ’s bad to be male ” out of your head right this second .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being male .
Just like there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with being female , there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with being male .
Embrace your masculinity .
Do not be ashamed of it .
2 . They put women on a pedestal .
The book also states that because of a shift from an agrarian to a manufacturing society in America , as well as several wars in between , boys were left without fathers at home .
Furthermore , the educational system was primarily comprised of females .
With the absence of male influence at home and at school , boys were conditioned to look to women for definition and approval .
This habit carries on to adulthood in the form of guys seeking approval from women .
Nice guys see women they like and automatically put them on a pedestal , wondering what they can do to gain their approval .
Maybe write them a 10 page love letter , or make them a mix tape , or shower them with expensive gifts , all in a vain attempt to gain her approval and win her love .
They do all this in the beginning of a relationship , hence having the quality of “ coming on too strong , being too eager and not being enough of a challenge . ”
By doing these things from the very beginning , men silently imply that they are not good enough and must resort to other tactics to deem themselves worthy of women .
Nice guys see women and think , “ Man , I have to do something in order to get that girl .
They ’re way up there and I ’m way down here so I have to compensate somehow ” .
As a result , nice guys spend their every waking moment , dreaming of how they can get the girl .
They spend all their free time around the girl , going shopping with her , listening to all her complaints , sympathizing with the problems she is having with her boyfriend , all in a vain attempt to gain her approval in hopes that one day she will come racing into his arms .
Women are human .
They eat , breath , sleep , and go to the bathroom on a regular basis just like the rest of us .
Women are not goddesses .
They have the same insecurities ( if not more ) as you and I .
There ’s nothing different about them .
They ’re human .
Do n’t think that you have to gain approval from them .
All right , so how can you stop being a nice guy ?
Do n’t be afraid to be male .
Embrace your masculinity .
But what does it mean to embrace your masculinity ?
What does it mean to be male ?
Let ’s break down attraction to the most basic elements .
Male and female .
Males are attracted to females .
Females are attracted to males .
Biologically speaking , what makes somebody male ?
Testosterone .
Biologically speaking , what makes somebody female ?
Estrogen .
Testosterone is attracted to estrogen .
Estrogen is attracted to testosterone .
Ever wonder why the jocks got the girls in high school ?
They worked out and played in competitive sports ; two things conducive to promoting testosterone in the body .
Ever wonder why “ bad boys ” and criminals get the women ?
They ’re risk takers .
They pay no attention to law .
They ’re reckless and dangerous .
Again , symptoms of high testosterone .
Research has linked high testosterone to criminal behavior .
Research has linked competition and weight lifting to high testosterone as well .
Women are attracted to the jocks and bad boys simply because they are male in the sense that they have high testosterone .
Is the flip side true ?
Are men attracted to beautiful women simply because they are women in the sense that they have high estrogen ?
Yes , studies have shown that men are attracted to women with high estrogen levels as well .
( Btw , you will find women use make up as well in order to give the illusion of the physical characteristics of high estrogen in order to attract males )
There ’s a deeper science that goes into this about how high levels of testosterone and estrogen reflect underlying health and fertility , but I wo n’t get into that .
Strictly speaking in biological terms , testosterone makes the man and estrogen makes the women .
Is this surprising ?
No .
Drill down to the basics .
I am male , she is female .
Act accordingly and attraction will not be a problem .
Now , am I advocating that you go and inject yourself with 500 liters of testosterone ?
Absolutely not .
Injecting yourself with synthetic testosterone shuts down your body ’s ability to produce it naturally .
I am advocating however , that you engage in activities that will raise your testosterone levels .
Lifting heavy weights on a consistent basis coupled with proper nutrition and rest will raise levels of testosterone in the body .
When you lift heavy weights , you literally create little tears in your muscle tissues .
Testosterone , an anabolic hormone responsible for muscle growth among many other things , is produced by the body in order to rebuild the muscle to resist against future weight .
So instead of sitting on your butt playing World of Warcraft , Playstation , or X Box , get out there and pick up the weights .
You will find that by building your testosterone , your demeanor toward women and theirs toward you will change .
When you lock eyes with a beautiful women , you wo n’t immediately shift your eyes to the ground and be embarrassed .
You ’ll lock eye contact with her and be comfortable about it .
SHE will be the one who looks away .
You will find that women will start paying more attention to you .
It ’s as if they ’re equipped with incredibly sensitive receptors to testosterone .
( studies have shown that women are capable of identifying individuals with high testosterone simply by smelling sweaty t- shirts )
Try a regimen of weightlifting and compare your attitude and results with the opposite sex after a short period of time .
You ’ll be pleasantly surprised .
If you want more information on building muscle as well as losing fat , two things that are conducive to increasing testosterone in the body , check out Tom Venuto ’s book Burn the Fat , Feed the Muscle .
And do n’t become so obsessed with testosterone that you start letting it control you , in terms of your behavior and attitude .
Then you ’ll turn into the jerk or the criminal .
The key is to have testosterone and control it .
Do n’t let it control you .
Just be true to your nature .
To illustrate my point even further , imagine a woman with a thick beard , mustache and a deep voice hitting on you at the bar .
You would be repulsed right ?
Of course you would !
This woman is not embracing her true nature as a female .
Women are a million times more repulsed because nice guys do exactly the same thing .
They do n’t embrace their true nature as a male .
If you ’re male , be male .
If you ’re female , be female and let nature take its course .
You do n’t need the memorize pick up lines .
You do n’t need to psych yourself up to meet women .
You do n’t need to make a ton of money .
You do n’t need to have a great job .
You do n’t need the BMW .
You just need to be male .
Everything you need is already inside of you .
Use it .
Do n’t make women the focal point of your life .
Nice guys revolve their entire lives around the women .
Nice guys spend all their time dreaming of all the future possibilities with her .
They do all this from the get go .
What must I do to get her ?
I ’ll write her poetry .
I ’ll take her out to the most expensive restaurant and show her how wealthy I am .
I ’ll buy her favorite pair of shoes that she mentioned in a conversation nine years ago .
They ’ll drop whatever they are doing at a drop of a dime and be at their beck and call 24/7 .
All acts reeking of extreme desperation .
What ’s the solution ?
Is it to try not to act desperate ?
These are when the “ rules of dating ” come into play .
Call her three days later , act aloof , be a challenge .
That ’s all utter garbage .
That ’s all smoke and mirrors .
Do n’t try to fake not being desperate by following these “ rules ” .
Just do n’t be desperate naturally .
How ?
Do n’t make women the focal point in your life .
Have something else going for you .
Have a worthy goal or dream you are pursuing that is of higher priority than women .
Have a dream .
Have a goal and work toward it .
Women will not seem that intimidating anymore .
You wo n’t spend all your time with her .
You wo n’t become “ too easy ” or “ boring ” because you ’ve got something else going for you .
Instead of using all your time , money , and energy pursing women , use all that to accomplish your own goals .
Napoleon
Hill refers to this as sexual transmutation .
Channel all that energy into fulfilling your own goals and you will find yourself unstoppable .
Go on your own program of self improvement .
Nice guys place their worthiness and happiness on getting the girl .
Instead of doing that , make your own life happy and worthwhile by pursuing your own goals and ambitions .
Then , she ’ll be the one asking , “ What can I do to get him ? ”
So nice guys , do n’t feel so bad .
Society is structured to easily make nice guys of any male but the key is not to blame society and if you ’re a frustrated nice guy , the key is not to blame women in general .
It ’s just to become aware that the common factor is YOU and that you change by embracing your right to be male .
Embrace your masculinity , take women off the pedestal , and do n’t make women the focus of your life .
Harness all that time , money , and energy and apply it toward realizing your own goals and dreams and the nice guy within will never appear ever again .

As she puts it , Christina Parascandola has the bad luck of having an unusual name .
The 37 - year - old attorney was mentioned in news reports and blog posts about a heated dispute between residents of her Washington neighborhood and a noisy local bar that hosted some gay - themed events .
Ms. Parascandola was worried that she came across in the articles as homophobic , particularly to potential employers .
" When you Google my name , it looks like I 'm some kind of monster , " she says .
Ms. Parascandola set out to minimize the bad publicity .
She hired a company called ReputationDefender Inc. that promises to help individuals " search and destroy " negative information about them on the Internet .
Businesses and others have long employed so - called search - engine - optimization techniques to try to make themselves appear higher in Web - search results .
Now services like ReputationDefender and DefendMyName are charging fees that can run into hundreds of dollars to help clients remove or downplay unflattering online information .
Bloggers and hackers are n't the only ones sticking it to iPhone maker Apple Inc. for its closed minded approach to user - customization of the touch - screen handsets —
Nokia has taken advantage of the situation by launching a print and web campaign dubbed " Open to anything . "
" We believe the best devices have no limits .
That 's why we 've left the Nokia Nseries open , " the Finland - based handset maker wrote on its new " Open to anything " website .
" Open to applications .
Open to widgets .
Open to anything .
So go ahead and load it up .
What it does is up to you . "
The campaign , which was accompanied by the posting of similarly - worded bills in New York City this past weekend , is an obvious response to the latest iPhone update on Thursday .
As Apple had warned , the software patch disabled versions of the Apple handset that had been " unlocked " to operate on wireless carries other than AT&T , while adding a couple of new features like the Wi-Fi iTunes Music Store .
In addition , however , the update wreaked havoc on a number unmodified iPhones and those iPhones which had been only modified to run third - party software applications but had otherwise remained locked to the Apple - approved carrier .
Users who reached out to Apple for help in reactivating those phones were turned away ( video ) in the same manner as those users who had unlocked the devices against Apple 's stated policy .
The Cupertino - based firm's harsh stance was met with considerable outrage because , unlike unlocking , users who had installed third - party applications simply to increase the usefulness of their pricey handsets — in addition to those who had done nothing at all — were suddenly being informed that they had voided their warranty on the handset as a whole and were on their own in attempting to somehow reactivate those phones .
The matter is complicated by a number of factors , primarily what is now being perceived by some as a poor job on Apple 's part to convey its stance on third - party applications to iPhone users earlier in the handset 's lifecycle .
Recent comments from an Apple executive even made it appear as if the company was taking an indifferent stance to the development and installation such third - party apps .
Additionally , Apple 's public warning seemed only to target unlockers rather than those installing applications .
What 's more , third - party iPhone apps and simple point - and - click applications to easily install them had become as commonplace on the Internet in recent weeks as shareware applications .
Therefore , some iPhone owners may have used such applications without a full understanding of the consequences .
As a result of these and other gripes with Apple 's iPhone policies , users are now banding together in an attempt to drum up support for a class - action lawsuit against the company under three theoretical classes .
The first class would contain iPhone owners who have used third - party software to access the flash storage on an iPhone , without having altered firmware or installed a program on the device .
A second would include owners who had installed third - party apps in the past , but who have since restored their phones to factory defaults but are still suffering from hardware problems such as bad touchscreens .
A third and final class would challenge the whole unlocking issues , which is reportedly legal under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act but discouraged by Apple , which states on the iPhone 's packaging and marketing material that an AT&T contract is required for usage .
Nokia bills posted in New York City and shown in the MacRumors forum .
In the meantime , the whole iPhone mess is garnering national recognition from the the mainstream media and slowly snowballing into a public relations nightmare for Apple .
The New York Times recently ran a piece that quotes Apple spokesperson Jennifer Bowcock as saying those iPhone owners who are experiencing problems following the recent iPhone update should " purchase a new iPhone . "
And overseas , the Guardian syndicated Gizmodo 's updated recommendation to its readers , which is " Do n't Buy " an iPhone :
" Screw the unlock for a second .
Let 's talk about the those third - party apps , " wrote Brian Lam , an editor at the widely read and Apple " approved " gadget blog .
" While my 4GB iPhone is a brick , and the 8GB phone , which I kept on a totally legit AT&T contract , is now stripped down .
Programs like the faux - GPS , IM clients , Flickr Upload , and NES emulator — what did they ever do but make the iPhone far better than the stock original ?
They made it far more competitive with open - platform superphones like the Nokia N95 , to which I will now be switching . "
Bin Laden looks drawn and tired in the video
Bin Laden tape A new video tape purportedly made by al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has urged the American people to embrace Islam in order to stop the war in Iraq .
Unnamed US officials said they believed the speaker , who makes no overt threats against the US , was indeed Bin Laden .
It is his first video in three years .
The release of the tape comes near the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks .
US President George W Bush said the message was " a reminder of the dangerous world in which we live " .
" It 's important that we show resolve and determination to protect ourselves , deny al - Qaeda safe havens , " said the president , who is on a visit to Australia .
Date references suggest it may have been made as recently as this summer , US officials studying the tape said .
' Two choices ' A short excerpt from the 30 - minute tape was aired by al - Jazeera TV on Friday evening .
It shows Osama Bin Laden sitting at a table , dressed in a white robe and turban and beige cloak .
His beard looks shorter and darker than in the video issued in 2004 .
You permitted Bush to complete his first term , and stranger still , chose him for a second term , which gave him a clear mandate from you ... to continue to murder our people in Iraq and Afghanistan
Bin Laden tape
Excerpts from video Bin Laden in media - savvy war Beneath him a banner reads in English : " A message from Sheikh Osama Bin Laden to the American people . "
The speaker makes no overt threats to the US and did not directly call for attacks , according to transcripts of the tape obtained by several media organisations in the United States .
Instead , he tells the American people that they have failed to persuade the Bush administration to stop the war in Iraq .
" You permitted Bush to complete his first term , and stranger still , chose him for a second term , which gave him a clear mandate from you ... to continue to murder our people in Iraq and Afghanistan , " the speaker in the tape says , according to the transcript obtained by ABC News .
The speaker tells the American public that there are two ways to end the war in Iraq : " The first is from our side , and it is to continue to escalate the killing and fighting against you . "
The second way , he continues , is to reject America 's democratic system and convert to Islam .
" It has now become clear to you and the entire world the impotence of the democratic system and how it plays with the interest of the peoples and their blood by sacrificing soldiers and populations to achieve the interests of the major corporations " .
" I invite you to embrace Islam , " the speaker says .
" The leaders of the West - especially Bush , [ Tony ] Blair , [ Nicolas ] Sarkozy and [ Gordon ]
Brown - still talk about freedom and human rights with a flagrant disregard for the intellects of human beings , " he adds .
The reference to French President Nicolas Sarkozy would indicate that the tape was recorded after Mr Sarkozy 's victory in May .
' New plots ' Correspondents say a new video would serve to dispel persistent rumours that the al - Qaeda leader has died .
Al - Qaeda is focusing on targets that would produce mass casualties , dramatic destruction and significant economic aftershocks
Michael Hayden
CIA director
The US Department of Homeland Security said it had no credible information of an imminent threat in the wake of the video announcement .
Deputy state department spokesman Tom Casey said : " I do n't think that anything he is likely to say or do is going to change our resolve or the resolve of our international partners to confront extremism . "
But in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Friday , CIA director Michael Hayden warned that al - Qaeda was plotting new attacks on the US .
" Our analysts assess with high confidence that al - Qaeda 's central leadership is planning high impact plots against the American homeland , " he said .
" Al - Qaeda is focusing on targets that would produce mass casualties , dramatic destruction and significant economic aftershocks . "
$ 50 m bounty In his October 2004 video , Osama Bin Laden threatened new attacks against the US on the eve of the presidential election .
Another tape - audio - was released in January 2006 .
It referred to identifiable events , including the situation in Somalia .
Bin Laden did appear in footage on a militant website in July this year but the clip was undated and correspondents said it might be old footage , which had been recycled .
Al - Qaeda second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahiri has appeared in a greater number of videos , including one berating the Pakistani army 's assault on radical Islamists in Islamabad 's Red Mosque in July .
The US Senate voted to double the bounty on Bin Laden to $ 50 m ( £ 24.6 m ) in July .

Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said 80 of his country 's 1,200 islands had experienced tidal surges earlier this year , most of which are no more than one meter above sea level .
LISBON - The President of the Maldives on Wednesday called for urgent global action against climate change , saying rising sea levels are threatening the survival of his country 's low - lying islands .
LISBON - The President of the Maldives on Wednesday called for urgent global action against climate change , saying rising sea levels are threatening the survival of his country 's low - lying islands .
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said 80 of his country 's 1,200 islands had experienced tidal surges earlier this year , most of which are no more than one meter above sea level .
" Never in our documented history have so many islands been affected to such an extent .
These surges were a grim reminder of the devastating tsunami of 2004 and a clear warning of future disasters , " Gayoom said at a conference on development and climate change in Lisbon .
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates sea levels to rise between 18 - 59 centimeters by 2100 .
Since 80 percent of the Maldives ' 1,200 islands are about 1 meter above sea level they could be partly submerged by the end of the century .
" Unless climate change is addressed quickly and effectively your fate could be similar , " he said .
According to the United Nations , about 50 million people will become environmental refugees by the end of this decade .
The U.N. estimates about 40 percent of the world 's population lives near the coast and most of the world 's largest cities are on the coast or estuaries .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said failure to meet targets for reductions in emissions by 2050 could make the consequences of climate change " irreversible and uncontrollable . "
" To be more specific , it will directly hinder our efforts to reduce poverty and hunger in the world , " Barroso said .

The European Union has taken the lead in the fight against global warming by setting up a landmark EU emissions trading scheme in 2005 which aims to reduce emissions by putting a price on carbon that businesses use .
The three - day conference , known as European Development Days , comes ahead of what is set to be Europe 's first summit with Africa in seven years , in December .
Barroso said the summit will aim to establish an EU - Africa energy partnership , which will include renewable energy .

Radiohead has decided to respond to the previous coverage of their social experiment of offering their album online at a name - your - own price .
According to a study ( by a third party , comScore ) , only 38 % of downloaders paid something while the 62 % majority paid nothing .
And of those paying , most paid less than $ 4 .
While it was fun to speculate on what this could mean for the music industry , turns out any speculation was based on more speculation ( comScore ’s ) .
Here ’s what Radiohead had to say :
“ In response to purely speculative figures announced in the press regarding the number of downloads and the price paid for the album , the group ’s representatives would like to remind people that … it is impossible for outside organisations to have accurate figures on sales .
However , they can confirm that the figures quoted by the company comScore Inc are wholly inaccurate and in no way reflect definitive market intelligence or , indeed , the true success of the project . ”
“ True success ? ”
So I take it the results were better than what comScore assumed .
Whatever the case , the band has to know the world is interested in these numbers .
I mean , come on , how can we speculate on the fate of the music industry if we do n’t know Radiohead ’s “ true success ? ”
* Update * ComScore stands by its original numbers and says , “ We ’re confident in our data …
There ’s a minimal margin of error based on the size of the sample we used and the narrow range of values . ”
In the mean time , Radiohead tells BBC News that the real data is “ not for public consumption ” as “ people were still downloading [ the album ] . ”
Now I ’m curious to know why Radiohead is uninterested in sharing .
“ People still downloading ” is a weak excuse at best ; the band could simply release numbers for the initial month of October .

The technique is to be brought into clinical trials
They have built a device to beam waves of ultrasound into the body , generating bubbles at the site of a tumour .
When these bubbles " pop " , they release energy as heat - killing rogue cells .
The UK team plans to apply its new technique in clinical trials ; it will be used in treating patients with kidney and liver tumours .
These clinical trials of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( Hifu ) are being conducted at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford .
No surgery required
Hifu is non-invasive : studies have shown that it is at least as effective as surgery , without the risks of opening up the patient .
It also limits the damage to healthy tissue which occurs in radiotherapy .
But by harnessing the energy released by the bubbles that form when tissue is exposed to intense ultrasound waves , the researchers say they can provide faster and better targeted Hifu treatment .
I like to call it the ' energy shovel ' , because it allows us to grab this energy and use it where it is needed
Constantin Coussios , University of Oxford
When any wave moves through matter , it weakens ; and some of the energy is turned into heat .
This is why microwaves heat up food and light waves from the Sun warm the Earth .
In Hifu , ultrasound waves from outside the human body are brought to a focus inside the body , causing intense local heating which kills cells .
The principle is the same as burning a hole in paper by focusing sunlight through a magnifying glass .
But the existing Hifu technique has two important limitations compared with surgery that are hindering its clinical uptake .
First , it is very slow : it takes up to five hours to treat a 10 cm tumour , compared with the 45 minutes or so it takes a surgeon to cut the tissue out .
Secondly , clinicians are working in the dark : without invasive surgery , the results can only be assessed after the treatment is over .
Temperature boost
By harnessing the tiny bubbles that form in tissue when it is exposed to focused ultrasound , the researchers found they could boost the heating effect by factor of 6 - 10 compared with conventional Hifu treatment .
The enhanced technique , being pioneered by Dr Constantin Coussios from Oxford 's Biomedical Ultrasonics and Biotherapy Laboratory ( BUBL ) , is based on a principle called inertial cavitation .
" Phantom " , a gel that mimics the properties of tissue , is used in tests
The bubble continues to grow until it reaches a critical pressure threshold .
It then collapses and redistributes the energy as high - frequency " broadband noise " - effectively triggering a miniature explosion .
The energy from this little bang gets absorbed locally , so that tumour cells are killed , but healthy tissue is left unscathed .
" I like to call it the ' energy shovel ' , because it allows us to grab this energy and use it where it is needed , delivering it as heat , " Dr Coussios told BBC News .
Treatment and diagnosis
While bubbles are created spontaneously when ultrasound is focused on a target inside the body , these bubbles normally form and collapse very quickly .
The ultrasound technique is tested in a tank of water
Their solution is a machine that beams ultrasound waves into the body and also has a highly - tuned sensor at its centre .
The sensor can " hear " the tiny bubbles collapsing - a sound which is a thousand times too high for dogs , let alone humans .
Currently , temperature changes in tissue are used as an indication of the success of Hifu treatment .
But by the time these can be picked up , tissue in the focal region - and sometimes healthy tissue surrounding it - has often boiled .
Clinical trials
Dr Coussios commented : " If we can use cavitation to accelerate the treatment , better localise the treatment - meaning that you will never get pre-focal damage - deliver the treatment at a lower frequency so you can go deeper in the body , and if we can also use these bubbles to monitor the treatment in real time , we have solved all the major limitations of Hifu in one go . "
However , the treatment is not suitable for all types of tumour .
Where the cancer has " metastased " , or spread to other tissue , the therapy would probably not be effective , said Dr Coussios .
Dr Coussios said he was working with a team at the Churchill Hospital to incorporate the technique he has developed into clinical Hifu trials currently underway there .
He said candidates for the procedure would generally be patients with isolated solid tumours in the kidneys or liver .

Giuliani -Huckabee contest could split GOP
Hardly anyone saw Mike Huckabee coming .
At best it seemed the affable ex-governor of Arkansas might be able to parlay his debate quips and Ames Straw Poll showing into the second slot on the Republican ticket .
If the " Huckaboom " continues , he may be a legitimate contender for the first .
Advertisement
Not only do polls consistently show Huckabee leading in Iowa , but he appears to be surging in other key states like South Carolina and even Florida .
He has even started eating into former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 's lead nationally , cutting it to just 2 points in the RealClearPolitics average .
Huckabee is tied with Giuliani in an early December American Research Group poll ; Rasmussen puts the Arkansan in the lead .
A Giuliani-Huckabee race may be a surprise , but for Republicans it would not be a welcome one .
Ideologically and geographically , the two candidates are almost perfectly positioned to tear apart their party .
Giuliani , the Northeastern social liberal , is strongly favored by many fiscal conservatives and national security hawks .
He is a tax - cutter who emphasizes supply - side doctrines in his ads , and many on the right hope his law - and - order record in New York will translate into success in the war on terror .
Writing in the Weekly Standard , Noemie Emery acknowledged Giuliani 's deficiencies on abortion and other social issues but argued " in a time of national peril " such litmus tests are " a luxury we cannot afford . "
By contrast , Huckabee , the Southerner and onetime Baptist preacher , is reliably conservative on abortion , same - sex marriage and the role of religion in the public square .
Addressing the evangelical - led Family Research Council 's Values Voter Summit earlier this year , he was able to say he was " one who comes from you " rather than an outsider .
Huckabee is also well to Giuliani 's right on the issue of gun control .
While Huckabee may be everything to social conservatives that Giuliani is n't , others on the right have serious problems with his ascent .
He has been pilloried as a tax - hiker who has been soft on crime and will be similarly weak on terror .
The anti-tax Club for Growth gives Huckabee its lowest marks and Giuliani its highest .
Former Bush aide and ubiquitous conservative writer Peter Wehner panned Huckabee 's recent Foreign Affairs magazine essay as " stunningly silly , " " misguided " and " an unholy mess . "
Both Giuliani and Huckabee had hoped to avoid directly challenging hostile Republican factions .
Giuliani has emphasized his respect for social conservatives while moving rightward on both guns and abortion .
Huckabee has taken the taxpayer protection pledge , embraced a controversial conservative tax reform plan and ratcheted up his rhetoric against radical Islam .
Pitting the two candidates against one another will complicate this rapprochement .
Important parts of the Republican coalition will come away feeling shortchanged , no matter the outcome .
Throughout the Bush years , libertarian - leaning Republicans have frequently blamed evangelicals for the advent of big government conservatism .
New York Post columnist Ryan Sager , a Giuliani supporter , devoted an entire book to the subject .
Now some social conservatives see hostility to their wing of the movement in criticisms of Huckabee .
Redstate.com blogger Erick Erickson argued " it 's a sad day in the conservative movement when the conservative intelligentsia has sustained harsher words for a socially conservative governor than a serial adulterer who has said this year that the government should provide assistance to poor women wanting abortions . "
As his colleague Josh Trevino put it , " Probably without realizing it , and for reasons rooted in a generally inchoate frustration , one faction of the conservative coalition has roused itself to war against another . "
It remains to be seen whether this war can be avoided .
But this much is clear :
No matter what happens with Rudy Giuliani or Mike Huckabee , a significant number of fiscal conservatives seem uninterested in social issues and vice versa .
That fact — and the inability of the Republican Party to produce a viable presidential candidate who satisfies all major factions — does not bode well for the future of the Reagan coalition .

The US team has developed a new method for handling the donor egg
A team in the US created dozens of cloned embryos from a 10 - year - old male macaque , the journal Nature reports .
This could make it easier to clone human embryos for use in research .
It raises the prospect of developing transplant tissues to treat diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson 's that will not be rejected by the body .
The American group was able to extract stem cells from some of the cloned monkey embryos , persuading them to develop into mature heart and nerve cells in the laboratory .
Other scientists have welcomed news of the advance .
Robin Lovell - Badge , a UK stem cell scientist at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill , near London , said : " Although this work has not been published yet , it is potentially significant .
" There has been a worry that primates may prove to be difficult in terms of cloning . "
Medical promise
This would have been a huge setback for researchers working to develop new medical therapies based on embryonic stem cells .
In cloning to obtain stem cells , DNA from an adult animal is inserted into an unfertilized egg that has had its own genetic material removed .
The egg is then encouraged to grow into an early embryo , from which stem cells can be extracted .
STEM CELLS
Stem cells are master cells , obtained from early - stage human embryos , with potential to develop into any of the body 's tissue types
There are different types , but scientists believe the most useful stem cells come from the tissue of embryos
The copy pre-embryo created for therapeutic cloning is destroyed in the process
Because stem cells are the forerunners of all tissues in the body , scientists hope they might one day be able to use these progenitors to create transplant tissues that are genetically matched to patients with degenerative conditions - such as diabetes - without the fear of rejection by the body .
Human cloning has been dogged by technical difficulties and controversies over faked research .
In 2004 , a South Korean team announced that it had created the first cloned human embryos and extracted stem cells from them .
But the study was later retracted when it emerged the lead author , Dr Hwang Woo-suk , had fabricated his work .
The only other published example of a human embryonic clone was created at Newcastle University , UK .
But the clones survived for only a few days and did not produce any stem cells .
Human cloning clues
The technique used to generate the cloned macaque embryos is called somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) .
This is the same basic procedure used to create Dolly the sheep and other cloned mammals .
But the lead author of the latest study , Dr Shoukhrat Mitalipov , has pioneered a novel way of handling the donor eggs during the cloning process .
The macaque monkey is a standard animal in laboratory work
However , Dr Mitalipov and his colleagues believe both of these could damage primate eggs .
Instead , they used an illumination technique which allowed the scientists to efficiently remove the cell 's nucleus without resorting to the traditional approaches .
The new technique , called Oosight , uses polarised light to visualise microscopic cells in real time .
The scientists found this resulted in a much improved survival rate for developing clones .
' Convincing evidence '
In a statement , Professor Alison Murdoch and Dr Mary Herbert , of the North - East England Stem Cell Institute ( NESCI ) , said the work " provides the first convincing evidence that nuclear reprogramming is feasible in primates " .
They added : " This is a very exciting development which takes us several steps closer to the production of patient - specific stem cells to treat life - limiting conditions such as Parkinson's , motor neurone disease , Huntington 's disease and cystic fibrosis .
" By providing proof of principle in a primate model , Dr Mitalipov and his colleagues have made an important step towards realising the therapeutic potential of nuclear transfer in humans . "
Professor Ian Wilmut , director of the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh , commented : " Cloned cells produced with the genetic material of a patient who has inherited a disease would have the abnormalities associated with the disease . "
The researcher , who led the project which resulted in Dolly the sheep , added : " The methods in this paper are a significant step towards this objective . "
Implantation efforts
But the development was not welcomed by everybody .
Josephine Quintavalle , director of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics ( Core ) told BBC News : " Bringing a clone to term is the only way to show that the cloned tissue is safe . "
Ms Quintavalle pointed out that clones were not the only potential source of embryonic stem cells , and that other options such as cord blood existed .
The scientists behind the latest work reportedly tried to implant about 100 cloned embryos into the wombs of around 50 surrogate female macaques .
However , their efforts did not result in the birth of any offspring .
But one author of the study said this could be down to bad luck .
For example , Dolly the sheep - the first clone of an adult mammal - was only created after 277 attempts .
Dr Mitalipov is affiliated to the Oregon National Primate Research Center and the Oregon Stem Cell Center .

Food that costs less and solves your health problems AND builds a new world for all of us .
With the economy tanking and the weight of fear hanging over us , the future looks bleak .
Right now many Americans are facing the reality of becoming homeless and hunger and malnutrition will most likely become a reality to Americans who thought that impossible for even the poorest among us .
You need to take action now .
Americans depend on the food they get from the grocery store more than ever before .
The unpalatable fact is that food from the local , corporate grocery store is going up in price so rapidly that people who have not shopped for a while are having sticker shock .
The price you pay is only one issue , however .
That food , and how it is produced , is also causing many of your health problems .
The grocery store food has changed since it came from local farms .
The advent of factory farming converted the food we eat into the profits of corporations .
Looked at from the viewpoint of a corporation , who have only one goal , to make money for themselves , each aspect of production becomes an issue of minimizing their costs and maximizing their profits .
That hits you in ways you cannot imagine .
Until now .
You need to know so you can make an informed decision about what is best for your family and yourself .
We are going to look at what you are buying and what it is really costing you and show you ways to rebuild the economy while you rebuild your health .
Factory farms produce food that is designed to keep for long periods .
Therefore factory growers identified varieties of plants that can be harvested green and ripen later .
Monsanto has genetically engineered many of the foods used by factory growers to augment their profits and allow them to own what was once viewed as the property of God.
Monsanto wants to own the DNA of the food you eat , making the seeds you buy sterile .
They have taken steps in court and law to give them ownership through the twisted ideas of privatization , which is really an ongoing corporatization of everything we need to live .
Monsanto leaves no leaf unmolested in its quest for profits as this writer shows .
“ Monsanto scouts out farmers who it feels have unlawfully planted patented seeds , or who have saved seeds from one generation to the next , and collects damages by threatening legal action ( through either infringement or breach of contract charges ) .
The company claims to pursue as many as 500 infringement cases every year .
But no farmer can control the wind , which indiscriminately cross-pollinates crops without regard for their genetic makeup .
And some farmers , like Schmeiser , claim that Monsanto strong - arms innocent farmers who never wanted to grow GM crops to begin with . ”
The seeds sold by Monsanto are not designed for your health .
Corporations are not held accountable for the long range impact of what they sell .
Factory food has been described as actually growing hydroponically , in soil that has none of the microminerals or organic content that the plants can use to ensure their own health – and yours .
Pesticides used to diminish the impact of insects that are drawn to unhealthy plants like wolves are drawn to the diseased deer in a herd and killed through the use of pesticides that remains on the plant and becomes part of your dinner .
What is not healthy cannot nourish you .
Today the residue of such pesticides are everywhere and accumulating in the milk suckled by babies from their mother 's breast .
Factory farming , plants and animals , are inherently unhealthy because of these kinds of practices designed to burnish that corporate bottom line .
So you need to know that a revolution is going on in America today .
All across the country people who have taken a hard look at the world corporations are creating have said no and are changing how they , and those around them , eat .
You can join that revolution by learning how to grow your own and eat locally .
On our show this Friday we will hear from one of the people who are leading the revolution back to locally produced food , Joel Salatin of the three generation Polyface Farm .
“ IN 1961 , William and Lucille Salatin moved their young family to Virginia ’s Shenandoah Valley , purchasing the most worn - out , eroded , abused farm in the area near Staunton .
Using nature as a pattern , they and their children began the healing and innovation that now supports three generations .
Disregarding conventional wisdom , the Salatins planted trees , built huge compost piles , dug ponds , moved cows daily with portable electric fencing , and invented portable sheltering systems to produce all their animals on perennial prairie polycultures .

The Tokyo Institute of Technology has created a solar - powered laser which is the first to use " Fresnel lenses made of neodymium - doped yttrium aluminium garnet doped with chromium . "
OK .
Whatever .
For all I care they can call it " fansworthtricorderium doped in darthvadium " — as soon as it delivers on its promise of providing unlimited energy from a practically - never - ending source : Magnesium .

This element has ten times the energy storage density of hydrogen , with 1,800 trillion metric tons readily available in sea water .
The solar laser - based magnesium combustion process produces extreme heat , hydrogen and magnesium oxide .
The heat could be used to power turbines while the hydrogen could power cars with hydrogen - based engines .
Meanwhile , according to Prof .
Yabe the magnesium oxide could get recycled back into magnesium again using the laser itself .

Apparently , the solar - powered laser created by Prof .
Yabe is three times more efficient than existing solar lasers , like similar concepts previously touted by the Osaka University Institute of Laser Engineering to beam solar power to Earth .
The fresnel lenses can focus 80 % of the ambient light .
The power of this type of lenses increases exponentially : with a 1.3 - meter - squared lens they get a 25 - watt laser but they " are expecting 300 to 400 watts with the four - meter - squared Fresnel lens . "

ALGIERS ( Reuters ) -
The family of a suicide bomber who killed 17 U.N. staff in Algiers this week said he joined Islamist rebels after failing to get a taxi license and was motivated by “ ignorance , not poverty ” , a newspaper reported .
“ We got nothing from al Qaeda , we are still very poor , ” Bechla Rabah ’s oldest son Younes told Echorouk .
“ Ignorance , not poverty , this is what pushed my father to blow himself up . ”
Al Qaeda ’s North African wing claimed responsibility for twin car bombs on Tuesday that killed more than 30 people at the U.N. offices and a court building , saying it had targeted “ the slaves of America and France ” .
It was the deadliest assault in Algiers in years and followed a string of similar bombings after Islamist rebels in the country adopted the al Qaeda name at the start of the year .
Algerian newspapers said Rabah ’s days were numbered as he was in a final stages of cancer .
They said two of his sons were members of the Islamic Armed Group also known by its French initials GIA and were killed by security forces in the 1990s .
Rabah ’s 82 - year - old mother told Echorouk she heard of his death from the newspapers and had not seen her son in more than a decade .
Rabah , who was 63 , joined Islamist rebels in 1995 .
“ The police came to do a DNA analysis .
They told me the results will be ready by Saturday .
I continue to believe my son is innocent .
I need strong evidence to change my mind , ” she told the national daily in an interview at the family ’s home in Heraoua , a poor village 20 km ( 12 miles ) east of Algiers .
“ He wanted to work as a taxi driver , ” said Rabah ’s daughter Asia .
“ But he did not get the go - ahead from the administration .
That ’s why he decided to join the FIS in the 1990s . ”
“ I could have been one of the victims , ” she added .
Algeria plunged into violence in 1992 after the then military - backed government scrapped legislative elections which the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) , a radical Islamic party , was poised to win .
The violence had subsided since the 1990s but in the past twelve months has regained some of its former intensity .
Algerian officials say poverty does not produce terrorism , but local commentators often point to a bleak social background of poverty and unemployment to explain the rebels ’ ability to recruit suicide bombers .
Turkish troops have massed on the Iraqi border
The army said it fired on a group of about 50 rebels , though the statement did not say troops entered Iraq .
In October , Turkey 's parliament voted to allow the military to launch operations into Iraq to combat the PKK , which had stepped up attacks in Turkey .
But Iraq and the US have urged Turkey not to carry out its threat .
" As part of intelligence work , a group of 50 - 60 PKK terrorists was spotted inside Iraq 's borders , " south - east of the Turkish town of Cukurca in Hakkari province , the army said on its website .
" The terrorists came under intensive fire from fire support assets that were deployed near the region , " the statement said , and " sustained heavy casualties " .
The army said it could take further action in the region " with other components " when necessary , in a possible reference to ground troops .
Public pressure
An anonymous senior PKK leader was quoted by the AFP news agency denying any attack had taken place .
" Our area is quiet .
Nothing has happened , " he said .
However Firat , a pro-Kurdish news agency , cited Iraqi Kurdish officials reporting shelling in the area on Saturday " that lasted nearly two hours " .
Turkish forces have periodically shelled suspected rebel positions in Iraq , and sometimes Turkish troops have crossed the border briefly in " hot pursuit " of the PKK .
But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that his cabinet had authorised the armed forces to launch major cross - border operations , without the need to refer back for approval .
It followed October 's parliamentary vote , in which MPs overwhelmingly backed a resolution giving the government permission to send troops into Iraq .
The government has been under intense pressure from the Turkish public to respond to a spate of deadly attacks on troops and civilians in south - eastern Turkey , says the BBC 's correspondent in Istanbul , Sarah Rainsford .
As many as 3,000 PKK members are believed to be based inside northern Iraq .
Turkey has accused the local Kurdish authorities of supporting them , our correspondent says .
Producing 1 kg of beef results in more CO2 emissions than going for a three - hour drive while leaving all the lights on at home , scientists said today .
A team led by Akifumi Ogino at the National Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science in Tsukuba , Japan , trawled through data on aspects of beef production including calf raising , animal management and the effects of producing and transporting feed .
They are calling for an overhaul of the beef industry , after their audit revealed producing the meat caused substantial amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants .
Most of the greenhouse gas emissions are emitted in the form of methane from belching cattle , but the meat production process also releases fertilising compounds that can wreak havoc in river and lake ecosystems .
Warming potential
The study , which is published in today 's New Scientist magazine , shows that the production of 1kg of beef releases greenhouse gases with a warming potential equivalent to 36.4 kg of carbon dioxide .
The production process also led to fertilising compounds equivalent to 340g of sulphur dioxide and 59g of phosphate , and consumed 169 megajoules of energy .
Over two - thirds of the energy is spent on producing and moving cattle feed .
The emissions are equivalent to the amount of CO2 released by an average car every 160 miles , and the energy consumption is equal to a 100W bulb being left on for 20 days , says New Scientist .
But the total environmental impact will be higher than the study suggests because the calculations do not include emissions from managing farm equipment and transporting the meat .
The scientists behind the study are calling for a range of measures to reduce the carbon footprint of the industry .
These include better waste management and reducing the interval between calving by a month , which the authors say could reduce the environmental impact by nearly 6 % .
A Swedish study conducted in 2003 claimed that raising organic beef on grass rather than feed , reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % and consumed 85 % less energy .
Iran and Kurdish leaders have been trying to improve relations
They were among five Iranians who Tehran insists are diplomats seized in the Kurdish city of Irbil in January .
The announcement came as Iran opened two consulates in northern Iraq to improve ties with the Kurdish region .
Iran 's ambassador said the detention of the five men was an " illegal act against Iraqi sovereignty " .
The Iranian consulate in Irbil was located in the same building that was raided by the US forces in January .
A US military spokesman said the individuals being released were of " no continuing value , nor do they pose a further threat to Iraqi security " .
No details were given about the other seven that the spokesman , Rear Admiral Greg Smith , said would be released " in the near future " .
Separately , Rear Adm Smith said five US soldiers were killed in two roadside bomb attacks in Iraq on Monday .
Washington accuses Tehran of training and supplying Shia militias with weapons and military training used against US soldiers in Iraq .
Iran denies the charge and blames continued violence on the US - led invasion of the country in 2003 and the presence of US troops .
Also on Monday , the US military said a mass grave had been discovered north - west of Baghdad , containing 22 bodies .
The grave was found by Iraqi troops on Saturday in the Lake Thar Thar region , during an operation targeting al - Qaeda militants .
The Iraqi authorities are trying to establish the identities of those found in the grave , and the causes of their deaths .

The bravest soldier becomes a coward when he follows an order to shoot unarmed people .
The slaughter reported in this week 's news of people on a Baghdad bus that did n't stop for soldiers at a roadblock is a case in point .
The rule in such a case is to shoot first and ask questions later .
They call it a " rule of engagement " but there 's no romance in it .
We 're talking about the engagement of hostile forces .
Except that we 're not .
A bus driver who misinterprets a signal from foreign soldiers at a checkpoint can hardly be said to have engaged the soldiers , and that 's what happened here .
" Engagement " suggests a contact that both parties are aware of .
An assault on an unwitting or escaping victim is not an engagement .
The rationale for killing innocents is that they might not be innocent .
In the overwhelming number of cases , they turn out to be innocent , but they might not be , and so it 's OK to kill them .
For the men in suits who order the soldiers around , that 's fine .
No sleep is lost .
But for the soldiers who have to do the killing , there 's quick recognition that courage and valor are lacking in these " engagements , " and the soldiers are hurt by this knowledge .
You can read their accounts on the Internet , in dozens of recent books , and in transcripts of the rare legal proceedings that have come on the heels of checkpoint killings .
As the words of the soldiers so consistently tell us , there 's nothing like a diminutive severed limb to take the excitement out of carrying a rifle .
It 's probably safe to assume that the images of slaughter will stay with them always and color the rest of their lives , especially when they cuddle their own kids .
These damaged young people put on a uniform to demonstrate their commitment and bravery and selflessness and they found themselves part of a brutal slaughter .
Instead of valor , they were forced to acts of self - preservation against harmless women and children , acts so drenched in cowardice as to confer on them a badge of lifelong shame and dishonor .
It should n't come as a surprise that young vets are killing themselves at an unprecedented rate .
Last week I asked Speaker Pelosi this question :
Dave Johnson ( of Seeing the Forest ) :
We seem to be at a historic time right now with an administration that is starting to frankly assert that they are above the rule of law , and I 'm wondering if you as Speaker can give us a short statement on this issue and what Congress is prepared to do to re-assert the rule of law of the people of the country .
( Follow the links to read her response . )
Then Mike Stark asked about impeachment .
In the response she said ,
I made a decision a few years ago , or at least one year ago , that impeachment was something that we could not be successful with and that would take up the time we needed to do some positive things to establish a record of our priorities and their short - comings , and the President is ... ya know what I say ?
The President is n't worth it ... he 's not worth impeaching .
We 've got important work to do ...
If he were at the beginning of his term , people may think of it differently , but he's at the end of his terms .
The first two years of his term , if we came in as the majority , there might be time to do it all ...
Mike , of course , responded ,
Mike Stark : Respectfully , that 's not the question .
Respectfully , the question is whether or not the Constitution is worth it .
Many argue that impeachment will distract the Congress from passing a progressive agenda .
That is a pipe dream .
The Republicans in the Senate are blocking everything .
The President will veto anything that passes .
And if something somehow manages to become law the Republicans and the President will just ignore it anyway .
And now there has been yet another action against the Rule of Law .
Not long after that conversation the President used his power to keep a convicted and sentenced crony out of jail - also removing any incentive to testify against the President and Vice President .
And here we are .
We are at a moment in our history where we can choose to restore ourselves as a nation of laws , or we can let yet another incident pass without taking action .
Is the Constitution worth it or not ?
If Bush and the Republicans can support the absolute politicization of our system of law and justice - and our Department of Justice - what wo n't they do ?
What are n't they capable of ?
The key question that this behavior brings up for me is : what about 2008 ?
Will they let the people vote them out ?
Will they leave office or will they just put an official stamp on what has already occurred ?
I do n't know of a country that has gone as far down the path to authoritarianism as we have already gone and recovered .
Can anyone come up with an example ?
P.S. I think that yesterday 's " Special Comment " by Keith Olbermann should be remembered in history as an important speech at a perilous time .
I ask all of my readers to watch it , ask others to watch it , and print the transcript to leave in coffee shops , etc. Crooks and Liars has the video and the transcript .

Meet Varvara Akulova , the world ’s strongest girl .
Now she is 13 , but most of the photos featured in this post depict her at the age of six .
She already was a champion at the age of four and expressed unbelievable strength .
She comes from a very poor family from Ukraine , they were always short on food and basic things – but nevertheless she started doing sports at the very early age and at the age of four she could lift 220 lbs weights !
It was so fantastic that The Discovery channel has made a documentary about her – “ The Worlds Strongest Girl ” .
Since then each year her personal weight grew by 2 lbs each year ( 2 kg a year ) but her lifting power increased by 25 lbs ( 11 kg ) each year .
さて、前回の下準備を経てようやく本題です。
先日のJTPAのギークサロンで、飛ぶ鳥を落とす勢いのRockYouの創業メンバーである石塚さんがFacebookアプリの作り方をハンズオンで教えてくれたのがすごく面白かったので、ちょっと自分でも遊んでみました。試しにRailsで作ってみたので、その手順を紹介したいと思ったのが今回の動機。
Facebookではサクッと作って出したアプリが3日で100万ユーザとかいうことが普通に起きているらしく、石塚さんいわく「そういうヒット作を作ったら、RockYouがン千万円で買い取るよ」だそうです。気合い入りますね。:)
環境：
開発機 ：Mac OS X ( Leopard or Tiger )
サーバ ：Linux ( Debian Etch )
フレームワーク ：Ruby on Rails ( 2.0.2 )
目標 ：Railsを使って自分の友達リストを取得・一覧するFacebookアプリを作ってみる
動作イメージ ：
Facebookアプリケーションの典型的な動作イメージは、だいたい以下のような感じです。
このダイアグラムを頭に入れて次へ進みます。
1. Facebookにサインアップ＆ログイン
サインアップは当然必要なので、とっとと済ませましょう。
友達がいないと激しくつまらないので、同時に誰かを誘うと吉です。あるいはKenn Ejimaで検索してぼく をAdd To Friendsしてくれて構わないのですが、もれなく飼育中の吸血鬼に噛みつかれたりゾンビに喰われたりすると思いますので、その点はご了承ください。
2. Facebook Developersを追加
Facebook Developersのページか らGet Started → Add Facebook Developer Application をクリックして 「 Developer」というアプリケーションを追加。
これで左側のアプリケーション一覧の 「 More ...」のところに「 Developer」が表示されていればOKです。
そ の「 Developer 」をクリックして、右上の「 Set Up New Application 」をクリックします。
ここ でOptional Fieldsを展開し、実際に設定していきます。具体的に設定が必要なのは以下の3つです。
Application Name :
あなたのアプリケーション名です。今回は「 My First Facebook Demo」とします。
Callback Url :
あなた のRailsサーバが稼働するURLです。生IPやDynamic DNSでもOK だと思います。今回 は 「 http://bar.com:3000/」とします。
Canvas Page URL :
Facebook内からそのアプリケーションにアクセスするためのURLです。今回は「foo-demo」とします。
あとは規約に合意のチェックボックスをチェックして保存すると、以下のように登録が完了します。
ここで発行され たAPI KeyとSecretは後で必要になるのでメモしておきます。
これ でFacebook側の準備は完了です。
3. RFacebookをインストール
前回、Railsのセットアップまでは完了しているので、Rails用のFacebook APIライブラリであるRFacebookをインストールしましょう。
ここに書いてある通りにやればいいのですが、前回からの流れに沿ってゼロからという前提で説明すると、まずSubversionをインストールしておきましょう。
$ sudo port install subversion
次に、RFacebookのインストール。
$ sudo gem install rfacebook
最後に、RFacebook のRails Plug-inのインストール。
$ cd ~/ Documents / rails - demo $ script / plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rfacebook/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails
A / Users /[ Your_home ] /Documents/rails-demo/vendor/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails
A / Users /[ Your_home ] /Documents/rails-demo/vendor/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails/test
A / Users /[ Your_home ] / Documents/rails-demo/vendor/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails/test/test_helper.rb ( 中略 ) A / Users / [ Your_home ] / Documents/rails-demo/vendor/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails/install.rb
A / Users /[ Your_home ] /Documents/rails-demo/vendor/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails/uninstall.rb
Exported revision 54 .
ここまででインストールは完了です。
4. RFacebookのセットアップ
続けて、RFacebookとfacebook.ymlの設定です。同じく rails - demo ディレクトリで以下を実行します。
$ rake facebook : setup ( in / Users / [ Your_home ] / Documents/rails - demo ) ======================================================
Setting up RFacebook on Rails Plugin [ 1 ]
Created config/facebook.yml
<-- BE SURE TO CHANGE THE API KEY AND SECRET Done .
======================================================
この手順でconfigディレクトリにfacebook.ymlというファイルが生成されたので、これを編集します。今回は開発マシン上で作業をするので、development環境を設定します。
development : key : YOUR_API_KEY_HERE secret : YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE
canvas_path : /yourAppName / callback_path : / path/to/your/callback/ tunnel : username : yourLoginName host : www.yourexternaldomain.com port : 1234 local_port : 5678
これを、先ほ どFacebookに登録した情報に従って変更していきます。
development : key : 2024a5994d0f655912bc0c6f0acdffff ... 登録時に発行されたAPI
Key secret : 566eb41e9c33f9100af3eb50e9deffff ... 登録時に発行され たSecret canvas_path : / foo-demo / ... 登録した Canvas Page URL callback_path : / ... Canvas Page URL と1対1 で 対応するローカルのルートパス tunnel : username : foo ... サーバのアカウント host : bar.com ... サーバのホスト名また はIPアドレス port : 3000 ... サーバのポート番号 local_port : 3000 ... 開発マシンのポート番号
最後の「tunnel」パラメータ群は、とりあえず無視しておいても構いません。
5. SQLite3 のセットアップ
ちょうどこのブログを書いている時にRailsのバージョンが2.0.2へと変更になり、デフォルトのデータベースがMySQLからSQLite3へと変更されました。
この変更のおかげで、データベースを含めた初期セットアップが圧倒的に簡単になっています。というのも、SQLite3本体はMacに標準添付だからです。
今回はDBを使わないのですが、せっかくなのでこの機会にSQLite3をセットアップしてDBが使える通常の状態にしておきたいと思います。
まず、前回の手順6 で config/environment.rb に DBを使わない設定をしてあった場合、その行を取り除きます。
また 、Rails 2.0.2よりも古いものを使っていた場合には、以下を実行してRails本体をアップデートし、SQLite3のRuby用クライアントライブラリ（Leopardはこれも標準添付）をインストールしておきましょう。
$ sudo gem install sqlite3 - ruby # Leopardの場合は不要 $ sudo gem update rails $ rails -v Rails 2.0.2
そして config/database.yml が以下のようになっていることを確認してください。
development : adapter : sqlite3 database : db/development.sqlite3 timeout : 5000
なっていなければ、作成した rails - demo ディレクトリをゴミ箱に捨て、復習を兼ね
てRails 2.0.2ベースで前回の手順を手順4からやり直すのが手っ取り早いでしょう。
次に 、Railsディレクトリで以下を実行してデータベースを初期化します。
$ rake db: migrate
さて、この手順で生成されるデータベースの実体は db/development.sqlite3 というファイルになります。この設定は config/database.yml に書かれているものが使われます。
次に 、SQLite3にアクセスしてみましょう。
$ sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3 SQLite version 3.3.13 Enter " .help " for instructions sqlite > . schema CREATE TABLE schema_info ( version integer ) ; sqlite > .quit
こんな感じで対話的にデータベースを操作できます。
以上でデータベースのセットアップは完了です。
6. Facebookから開発マシンへ のCallbackの準備
さて、今回の最大の山場です。
Facebookのアーキテクチャは、サーバがグローバルIPを持っていることを前提としています。
ここで取れる選択肢は二つです。
ルータのポートフォワード設定で、Facebookから開発マシンに直接アクセスさせる（自宅向け）
SSHでトンネルを開け、サーバへのアクセスを開発マシンへフォワード（ルート権限つきサーバ所有者向け）
前者は、ルータのグローバル側IPアドレスをFacebookに登録し、ルータのポートフォワード設定で3000番を開発マシンにつなぐか、思い切って開発マシンをDMZに置いてしまうなどします。いずれも一般的な家庭用のルータで設定が可能だと思います。
後者は、外部に置いてあるサーバにSSHでトンネルを空け、その外部サーバの3000番にアクセスがあったときに、それを開発マシンの3000番へと転送させるというアクロバティックな方法です（そのサーバのルート権限が必要です）。
ここでは後者の方法について説明します。
まず、サーバにログインし、SSHサーバの設定を変更します。
おそらくデフォルトではSSHトンネルは外部からのアクセスを許可していません。そこでDebianの場合、
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/ sshd_config
を実行し 、
GatewayPorts yes
という行を追加（あるいはGatewayPortsの設定がすでにある場合には変更）します。そして設定を反映するため、SSHサーバを再起動します。
$ sudo /etc / init.d/ ssh restart
これで 、Facebookからサーバへのアクセスを開発マシンに転送できるようになりました。 config/facebook.yml の設定を確認してから、新しくターミナルウィンドウを開いて以下を実行します。
$ cd ~/ Documents / rails - demo $ rake facebook : tunnel : start ( in / Users / [ User_home ] / Documents/rails - demo )
======================================================
Tunneling bar.com:3000 to 0.0.0.0:3000 ( 中略 ) ======================================================
Password :
ここで入力するパスワードは、サーバのパスワードです。この状態で待ち状態になっていればひとまずOKです。
次に、開発マシン上のrailsを起動してみましょう。上記のSSHトンネルを実行しているのとは別のもう一方のターミナル上で
$ cd ~/ Documents / rails - demo $ script / server
を実行します 。
ここまできたら、ブラウザで
http://bar.com:3000/
にアクセスして、RailsのWelcomeページが表示されれば成功です。
ここで注目すべきは、bar.com上では3000番を待ち受けしているプロセスは存在しておらず、あくまでSSHトンネルによって開発マシン上で動いているRailsがこの画面表示を実行しているということです。ちょっと不思議な感じがしますが、デバッグにはとても便利です。
7. Hello World on Facebook !
さて、いよいよ準備が整いました。
前回作成し た app/controllers/hello_controller.rb をテキストエディタで開いてみましょう。
class HelloController < ApplicationController def world render ( : text => ' Hello World ! ' ) end end
これに2行加えて以下のように変更します。
class HelloController < ApplicationController before_filter :require_facebook_login skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token def world render ( : text => ' Hello World ! ' ) end end
この skip_before_filter の行は Rails 2 で導入され たCSRF 対策が RFacebook と相性が悪いので、チュートリアルの都合上いったん無効にしてしまうおまじないです。詳しくはこちら。
さて、いよいよ実行してみましょう。
手順6で、2つのターミナルでRailsとSSHトンネルのそれぞれが実行中であることを確認します。
$ rake facebook : tunnel : start
$ script / server
さて、ブラウザか ら
http://apps.facebook.com/foo-demo/hello/world
へとアクセスしてみましょう。ここで /foo-demo/ 以下が開発マシンの / 以下とマッピングされ、Facebookからは
http://localhost:3000/hello/world がアクセスされていることに留意してください。
上のよう に 「 Hello World!」がFacebookのページに埋め込まれて表示されていたら成功です！
8. 友達の一覧を表示
いよいよ大詰めを迎えました。
先ほ どHello Worldを表示した箇所には通常のHTMLタグや、FBMLと呼ばれるFacebook独自のタグを埋め込むことが可能です。
また、SQLライクなFQLという問い合わせ言語により、同じセッション内で、今度は逆方向にサーバからFacebookに問い合わせてデータを取得することが可能です。
今回は RFacebook というライブラリを使っているので 、FQLを直接さわることはありませんが、内部的にはそういうものを呼んでいるのだと知っておくとよいでしょう。
さて app/controllers/hello_controller.rb に友達一覧を表示する friends というアクションを追加してみましょう。
class HelloController < ApplicationController before_filter :require_facebook_login skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token def world render ( : text => ' Hello World ! ' ) end def friends friendUIDs = fbsession.friends_get.uid_list @friendsInfo = fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids => friendUIDs , : fields => [ " first_name " , " last_name " , " pic_small " ] ) end end
fbsession は require_facebook_login によってセットされるセッションオブジェクトで、friends_getは facebook.friends.get を呼んでいます。その結果得られたUser IDのリストをローカル変数friendUIDsに格納し、次にそのUser IDのリストをもとに users_getInfo で facebook.users.getInfo
を呼んでいます（そろそろ命名規則がわかってきたかな？）。こんな感じで、fbsessionを使ってあらゆるFacebook APIメソッドにアクセスできます。
そして、実際に取り出したいフィールドをFQLデータ定義一覧から取り出し、Viewからも参照できるように@friendsInfoというインスタンス変数にセットしています。
今回はrenderメソッドではなく普通にViewから表示したいので
app/views/hello/friends.rhtml
というファイルを作成し、以下のように書き込みます（Rubyの書き方やテンプレート書式eRubyについては説明を省きます）。
<h1 > Hello Friends !</h1 > < ul > <% @friendsInfo.user_list.each do |friend| -%> < li><%= image_tag( friend.pic_small ) %> <%= friend.first_name %> <%= friend.last_name %></li > <% end -%> </ul >
これで完成です。ブラウザから
http://apps.facebook.com/foo-demo/hello/friends
を実行してみてください。これで以下のように表示されたら成功です。
うまくいきましたか ？
ぼくの環境はもうだいぶ手垢がついてて、本当に初めてやる人がうまくいくかどうか知りたいので、うまくいったとか、うまくいかなかったとか、フィードバックいただければ、しばらくエントリをアップデートしておくようにします。
ともあれ、これでもう皆さんはRailsを使ってFacebookアプリが開発できるようになりました。ぜひ誰かRockYouに売れるようなサービスを作って一山当ててください。:)

The 2009 Jaguar XF is as majestic as it can be .
Designed as rival to the BMW 5 - Series and Mercedes E-Class , the XF dons a more sporty look with a lower roofline and more aggressive stance .
It comes standard with fender vents and a bulging hood that add to this perception .
Replacing the aging S - Type early next year , the XF is based on the C - XF Concept car , with considerably less dramatic headlights and a tamer exterior .
Powering the ride is a naturally - aspirated 4.2 - liter V8 and a supercharged 4.2 - liter V8 , making 300 horsepower and 420 horsepower , respectively .
The Supercharged version will hit 0 - 60 mph in an estimated 5.1 seconds , while the other versions will trail behind the tarmac at 6.2 seconds .
Roughly five inches longer than the old S - Type , the 195 - inch XF provides ample room for five adults , despite its coupe - like roof .
U.S people can opt for a XF with 18 , 19 or 20 - inch wheels .
The Supercharged is the only car in its class to have 20 - inch wheels as standard .
One unique feature that made its way from the concept to the production XF is the JaguarDrive Selector .
It features a rotary shift interface unlike anything else currently on showroom floors .
The device rises into the palm of the hand when the car is turned on , and can be rotated to select park , reverse , neutral , drive , and sequential mode .
RAW STORY is reporting on a segment run on Scarborough where Biden is cited stating that Bush has no authority to attack Iran and if Bush does , he will move to impeach him .
Why he wants to wait until after we attack to remove this madman from power defies logic .
But in any case , he is considering to support impeachment for the same reason ( or one of the same reasons ) Dennis Kucinich has .
Dennis rightfully believe Bush has abused his authority for war since invading Iraq .
This statement about pursuing impeachment gives another boost to the impeachment campaigns being waged against Dick Cheney and George W. Bush .
The Dialogue for Democracy held by Kucinich yesterday added to the campaigns for impeachment too .
Every little thing gets the impeachment movement to the next level .
Will Biden help the masses defend the Constitution or not ?
My blind hope is that he starts pursuing impeachment before we attack Iran but that 's wishful thinking .
I know .
But it 's never a bad thing to dream .
Dreams are what create change .
And change is needed in America right now .
The Eugenists , racists , and members of white supremacist groups have n’t gone away - they ’ve simply found a new home : the anti-immigrant movement .
FAIR , the Federation for American Immigration Reform , has employed white supremacists in key leadershpi roles , has accepted over a million dollars from a eugenics foundation AND , as if that were n’t enough , has helped to bolster racist conspiracy theories throughout the country .
FAIR is not the voice of the mainstream , it ’s the voice of individuals who have helped fuel the 40 % increase in the number of hate groups in the US .
These are n’t citizen advocacy groups , or simply groups of concerned folk - they are hate groups plain and tall .
The most terrifying number in all of this ?
A 35 % increase in hate crimes against latinos .
There has certianly been a similar increase in hate crimes against South Asians and Arabs , and increases in hate crimes against other marginalized groups .
A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center , outlines the story of FAIR as a hate group , and it justifies their official addition to the national list of hate groups maintained by the organization .

This is a guest - post from Tim Ellis , author of Seattle Bubble , a blog and forum dedicated to discussing real estate market conditions in the Seattle area .
“ If you rent , you 're throwing away your money . ”
“ Owning your own home is a forced savings plan . ”
“ Home ownership is an excellent path to build wealth . ”
You 've probably heard statements like these plenty of times .
On television , radio , the internet , and in casual conversation .
Such sentiments are common in any discussion that involves home - buying and personal finances .
It 's common knowledge that buying a home is a better financial move than renting .
After all , you 're building equity instead of throwing away your money , right ?
Well , maybe not quite …
Rather than assuming the “ common knowledge ” on this subject is accurate , let 's take a look for ourselves at some of the financial differences between renting and home - buying .
A Real - World Example
For the purpose of comparing renting to owning in this article , I 'll be using real - world data gathered from my area ( northeast of Seattle ) .
Although most first - time buyers tend to move from renting an apartment to buying a larger , stand - alone house , as much as I can I will compare apples to apples .
For rent , I located a 3 - bed , 2.5 - bath , 1,840 sqft house with an attached 2 - car garage , on 0.2 acres .
Monthly price : $ 1,495 .
For purchase I found a 3 - bed , 2.5 - bath , 1,850 sqft house with an attached 2 - car garage , on 0.22 acres .
Price : $ 424,950 .
The two homes are located within two miles of each other in similar neighborhoods , and neither is located on a busy road .
We 'll assume that our hypothetical homebuyer is a married couple with $ 85,000 in the bank to make a 20 % down payment .
To calculate mortgage payments we will use a recent 30 - year fixed interest rate of 6.25 % .
Let 's look at how the monthly costs break down ( approximately ) for our hypothetical potential first - time homebuyer :
Renting Buying Rent / Mortgage : $ 1,495 $ 2,093 Insurance : $ 20 $ 163 Property Tax : – $ 407 Tax Savings * : – ( $ 327 ) Maintenance : – $ 354 Total : $ 1,515 $ 2,690 * : ( less standard deduction )
Right off the bat , you see that simply trading straight across from renting to owning results in a 78 % more expensive monthly bill .
That 's not exactly chump change .
With even a slight upgrade from renting to buying ( which most first - time buyers are prone to do ) , you can easily see how the total monthly costs would be more than double .
“ If You Rent , You 're Throwing Away Your Money . ”
Common knowledge says that despite today 's large premium , buying a home is a “ good investment ” .
Hey , at least you 're not “ throwing away ” your money , right ?
True , the renter in our scenario spends $ 1,515 every month that they will never see again .
I would n't exactly say it has been “ thrown away ” any more than money spent on any other good or service is “ thrown away , ” but granted , there is zero financial return on that money .
However , when you take a look at the breakdown of the homebuyer 's monthly expenses , a large amount is money that will never return , either .
Insurance , property tax ( less tax savings ) , and maintenance , add up to $ 517 every month that is being “ thrown away . ”
Even worse is the amount spent on mortgage interest .
Consider how much of a mortgage payment is applied toward loan interest throughout the life of a 30 - year fixed loan :
Years % toward interest 0 - 5 ~80 % 6-10 ~70 % 11-15 ~60 % 16-20 ~50 % 21-25 ~35 % 26-30 ~10 %
In the first five years , approximately 80 % of the mortgage payment goes toward interest .
That 's an additional $ 1,674 , for a total of $ 2,191 being “ thrown away ” every single month by the homebuyer for the first five years .
Ouch !
In fact , not until the homebuyer has been paying down the mortgage for over 20 years will the amount they are “ throwing away ” be less than the renter .
“ Owning Your Own Home is a Forced Savings Plan . ”
As you can see above , if home buying is like a savings plan , it 's probably the worst savings plan on Earth .
Would you voluntarily sign up for a savings plan where well over half of the money you deposit in the first 20 years simply vanishes , and from which you can only withdraw money by relocating and paying a 6 - 9 % fee ( not on the amount you have “ saved ” mind you , but on the total sale price of the home ) ?
Of course not .
That does n't sound anything like a savings plan .
If our potential homebuyer has that $ 85,000 saved up for a down payment and deposits it along with just half of the monthly savings over buying ( $ 578 per month ) into an account at 8 % interest , the balance will be nearly $ 300,000 in just 10 years .
That 's a liquid investment , that can be used for whatever you want , no relocation required .
Buying a home is not a savings plan .
Actually saving money every month is a savings plan .
“ Home Ownership is an Excellent Path to Build Wealth . ”
If your goal is to build wealth , you will be much better off investing your money in the stock market than buying a home .
While both stocks and housing are cyclical markets , long - term historic trends show that housing appreciates at a rate barely above inflation , while stocks tend to return an inflation - adjusted 7 - 10 % .
In our hypothetical scenario , a renter who invested in the stock market with the $ 85,000 down payment plus the monthly difference between the $ 1,515 rent and the $ 2,690 home - buying costs would be over $ 500,000 better off after 30 years than the homebuyer , assuming 4 % average appreciation .
An important thing to consider is that home prices in the United States are just now beginning to correct from an enormous unprecedented run-up in recent years .
Despite what those in the business of selling real estate may insist , the correction in housing is still in the early stages .
Four percent is most likely overly optimistic for most areas in the next 5 - 10 years .
The only thing we know for sure is that double - digit gains are gone and wo n't be coming back any time soon .
Also keep in mind — I mentioned it above but it bears repeating — in order to cash in on any “ wealth ” you build through your home you will need to sell that home and move .
No , “ extracting equity ” does not count , since that simply results in a larger debt .
Debt is not equal to Wealth .
Conclusion
For most people buying a home will result in their largest monthly bill ( by far ) , and because they believe that it will bring them wealth or that they are “ throwing away their money ” if they rent , they often take on a much larger home debt than a prudent budget would allow .
It is a real shame when people are driven to get into the housing market because of misplaced notions of imagined financial benefits .
Of course , everyone 's circumstances are different , and for some ( particularly those that live away from the coasts ) the numbers may actually work out in favor of buying .
Do n't misunderstand me here .
I am not saying that no one should buy a home , or that my example scenario is a golden standard of truth for all .
Do n't take my word for it .
Run the numbers for yourself , check out other articles ( a small collection is listed below ) , and do what works for you .
I highly recommend the great graphical calculator from The New York Times for comparing the financial aspects of renting and buying .
Many people will consider all of the consequences — financial , emotional , etc. — and conclude that buying a home is the best decision .
Just do n't trick yourself into thinking it's a good financial decision if it's not .
I myself intend to buy a house some day .
However when that day comes , I will be buying a house because I want a nice , “ permanent ” place to live where I 'm the boss , not because I think it will help me get me rich .

Force Yourself To Save ! 15 Painless Ways To Pay Yourself First
Some painless and effective ways to fool yourself into saving .
Often , we find ourselves wondering how we can put more money in our savings accounts .
Why is it that by the end of the month , it just seems like all our money has evaporated into thin air ?
Sometimes it feels like our expenses , bills and debts are taking over .
For some of us , saving can be a chore , or can find itself as a lower priority to all other things that occupy us financially .
Anyway , to address these issues , I came up with a few suggestions to try to get ourselves to save more .
Here ’s how you can trick yourself into saving money .
Trick Yourself Into Saving More !
# 1 Treat yourself like another entity and pay yourself first .
This is one of those classic savings approaches that we can easily employ .
If we imagine ourselves as someone as important as any other creditor we have , then we can deploy payments to our own accounts on a regular basis just as we do our own bills .
Set up an arbitrary savings amount — a good rule of thumb is at least 10 % of earnings — and stash it in a savings account each month .
I find 10 % a good start to a savings plan but a stretch goal should be something higher , such as 20 % or more of your income .
Another term for this activity is “ tithing yourself ” and is a great habit to develop .
In the course of doing this , it may become a more automatic procedure as time goes on since you find yourself doing it out of habit .
If you need a little more help with your saving endeavors , you can take a look at a budgeting tool like YNAB ( or You Need A Budget ) .
It ’s a desktop application that ’s proven to help users quickly reduce their debt and get a handle on their spending .
Features built into the tool strongly encourage you to pay yourself first .
Check out my review of the YNAB personal budget software product .
# 2 Take advantage of retirement accounts .
The closest you can get to free money is what you get when you build your savings in tax deductible and / or tax deferred retirement accounts .
When these retirement accounts are matched by an employer , such as in the case of a 401 K account , it is a huge incentive to participate in such programs .
Of course , you may need to weigh your ability to save for retirement against more pressing financial obligations such as paying down “ expensive ” debts or building up savings for shorter term goals .
Early withdrawals from a retirement account can potentially trigger penalties so if you open such an account , make a commitment to give this fund a chance to grow with time .
# 3 Automate your savings .
Direct deposit is one way of ensuring you get your money safely into your account without worry .
Without it , I tend to second guess myself wondering if I ’ve received all my payroll checks and whether I ’ve deposited them all .
Direct payroll deductions are a superb way to channel money into savings if you ensure that part of your paycheck is automatically earmarked for a savings account and not your daily expense or checking account .
# 4 Make extra mortgage payments .
By accelerating your mortgage payments , perhaps by making an extra payment towards your mortgage , you ’re contributing to your equity and thus , your pocketbook .
Just another way to help pay down a good debt obligation .
Here ’s a quick way to see how many years you ’ve cut off from your mortgage by making extra principal payments .
# 5 Save your windfalls after paying down debt .
If you receive a windfall , pay down your debts first .
If you do n’t have any debt , save that entire windfall and better yet , invest it .
Windfalls have truly helped us make great progress with our savings program so we always take the opportunity to invest any “ unexpected ” monetary amount ( e.g. gift , raise , inheritance , etc ) that we are fortunate enough to receive .
# 6 Pretend you did n’t get a raise .
So you were lucky enough to secure a raise !
Congratulations !
Now if you ’re able to pretend you never received it and instead sock this additional money away especially in an investment account that compounds with time , you may surprise yourself further down the road with a substantial nest egg .
I agree , not being able to celebrate a raise may not be that much fun , so use a small portion of it to reward yourself ( but I ’d avoid those big ticket items ) !
# 7 Pretend you have n’t paid down your debt even if you already have .
You may be accustomed to paying down debt , but the time will come when you ’ll have paid them all down .
When this time comes , you may find yourself with money freed up raring to go elsewhere !
This is a great opportunity to route this “ newly found ” money towards a savings account for your goals .
# 8 Bank the savings you receive from coupons , sales and discounts .
Big sales can save you a bundle , so how about writing yourself a check each time you score some savings while shopping ?
If you were prepared to pay full price but discover a savings of 10 % , bank the 10 % you save into your savings account .
This could be a painless strategy of building up your nest egg that you incorporate into your daily shopping habits .
# 9 Open investment accounts and automate contributions .
Learn about how to invest your savings .
The next step beyond saving your money is to find a way to make them grow .
Once you are comfortable with investments , you can open accounts and actually set up automatic monthly contributions to these accounts .
This will help you take advantage of the concept of dollar cost averaging , a powerful way to grow your money .
# 10 Create secondary sources of income .
If you are able , exploring other ways to supplement your income should help boost your savings .
By increasing your income , but keeping your expenses the same or lower , you have more money freed up to line your accounts .
I especially like to hear about how secondary income sources come about by accident , as when someone has a hobby that turns into a business , or when someone fortuitously stumbles into an income generating project they actually enjoy doing .
# 11 Cut down on impulse buying and avoid unnecessary purchases .
Just say no to that inner voice in your ear telling you that you ca n’t live without the attractive XYZ sitting on the retail shelf .
If you give yourself a few days to mull over your buying dilemma , you may realize quickly it ’s not something you really need and you ’ll forget about it in a few days .
Get yourself distracted with other matters as much as possible !
# 12 Save your extra paycheck .
There are payment schedules that involve getting paid every other week or even weekly .
If you get paid on alternate weeks , live on two paychecks a month .
If you get weekly paychecks , live on four paychecks a month .
You will inadvertently end up getting an extra paycheck in some months and you ’ll find yourself saving 10 % a year in no time !
# 13 Reinvest interest and dividends from investments .
Another painless way to beef up your investments : reinvest any interest and dividends and give your investments a chance to build .
# 14 Request for higher income withholding .*
I would n’t normally recommend this method of saving , but for some people who have a hard time doing so or are not disciplined enough to save incrementally , this can be a helpful strategy .
Have your employer withhold higher amounts for income taxes from your pay check .
Though the government has interest free use of your money during the year , the upside is that once you get it back via a tax refund , you can treat it as a windfall to be immediately funneled into your savings account .
This strategy may backfire if you are tempted to use that tax refund for things other than debt payments or savings .
# 15 Use unconventional savings vehicles .*
Again , this may not be the best way to save but could be the only ways to save for some people or “ non-savers ” who lack the discipline to set aside money any other way .
For instance , if you have insurance policies tied to savings vehicles , you may consider these relatively more complex programs rather than simpler insurance plans , in order to effectively “ force ” yourself to save .
Examples of unconventional savings vehicles include universal or whole life insurance , annuities , or even real estate , which allow you to make monthly payments towards a fund or goal .
The last couple of points marked with *’s are more unconventional and even controversial .
I personally would not apply these strategies myself since they are not optimal ways to save money , but for those who have a challenging time with saving on their own volition , these methods may be what it takes to force them into the habit .
Whatever works !

Democrats drop push for immediate withdrawal in apparent effort to blame Republicans Nick Juliano

This A move to shift responsibility for war Unable to attract enough war - weary Republicans , Senate Democrats are abandoning calls for a full withdrawal of US troops from Iraq as the chamber resumes debating the war this week .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said Democrats will push for a deadline of June 2008 and make a " stronger effort " to cut off war funding rather than calling for an immediate withdrawal to begin , according to an article in Wednesday 's Washington Post .
" It 's all definite timelines , " Reid said .
The move appears part of a political maneuver by Reid , who , speaking to reporters Tuesday , indicated he would n't allow Bush ' wiggle - room , ' by bringing forth an amendment by Sen.
Carl Levin ( D - MI ) whose bill calls for end of combat by summer 2008 .
Democrats are not believed to have the support for such a measure -- and as such appear to be putting forth doomed proposals to shift responsibility for the war 's success or failure onto Republicans .
" I think they 've decided definitely they want this to be the Senate Republicans ' war , not just Bush's , " Reid said .
" They 're jealous . "
Indeed , Levin even said he would temper his amendment non-binding , but leadership said no .
Debate over an annual defense policy bill that is beginning today will set the stage for senators to introduce amendments aimed at changing course in Iraq .
Two Democratic proposals have attracted some Republican support , the Post reports .
An amendment from Sen. James Webb ( D - VA ) would ensure that US troops spend as much time at home as they do in a war - zone between tours of duty .
The amendment , which fell four votes short of the 60 needed to move forward earlier this summer , would end the practice of sending troops to Iraq for up to 15 months with only a year or less at home in between .
Although it does not explicitly call for a troop withdrawal , Webb 's measure is seen by some Democrats as a way to limit combat operations by making fewer troops available , the Post reported .
" I 've tried to explain to them this is no backdoor way to focus on the war in Iraq , " Reid said .
" It 's to replenish and restore -- I keep using those words -- our military . "
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) a Democratic presidential candidate , has introduced another measure with bipartisan support that would endorse the partition of Iraq into three regions .
Leaders from both parties met Tuesday to discuss two other proposals seen as having bipartisan support .
Reid panned a move to implement the Iraq Study Group recommendations , and said the group 's proposal would need to be strengthened to attract Democratic support .
( He called the measure being considered " weak tea , " the Post said . )
Another amendment -- from Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) and Susan Collins ( R - ME ) -- would shift troops ' focus from combat to border security , counterterrorism and training Iraqi security forces .
Collins said senators from both parties were exploring the possibility of combining her measure with the Iraq Study Group 's recommendation to garner 60 votes .

Print This Email This Lobbyist pressured to recant story about Abramoff meeting Rove on street corner Part I of this series explored the long - term involvement of two men -- GOP consultant Bill Canary and Alabama Attorney General William Pryor -- in the events leading to the imprisonment last summer of former Alabama Democratic governor Don Siegelman .
That train of events began in 1998 , when Canary managed Pryor 's campaign for re-election as Alabama attorney general .
Immediately afterwards ,
Pryor began the investigation of Siegelman that eventually led to the newly - elected governor 's conviction on corruption charges in 2006 .
Canary 's wife , Leura Canary , federalized Pryor 's investigation in 2001 , after President George W. Bush appointed her as US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama .
Closely tied to Pryor , whose campaign was advised by her husband , Canary also appointed the wife of the Attorney General 's lawyer and close advisor , Christopher Weller , as her first assistant .
As Canary 's investigation proceeded , Siegelman 's potential Republican challengers began to hammer him hard on ethics issues , drawing heavily on leaks from the Pryor and Canary investigations to do so .
In a letter to the Department of Justice requesting Leura Canary 's recusal , Siegelman 's lawyer noted that he had traced the leaks to a source in Bill Canary 's office .
There is no evidence that the Justice Department ever investigated any of these leaks .
In the 2002 race for Alabama governor , Bill Canary advised the campaign of Siegelman 's Republican opponent , Rep. Bob Riley .
Pryor ensured Riley 's victory in that extremely close race when he declared that unsealing the ballots for a recount would be a crime .
The following April , Pryor was nominated by George W. Bush to serve as a federal judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals .
He was eventually installed by a recess appointment , against the objections of Senate Democrats .
Bill Canary , Karl Rove , and the 2002 Elections Karl Rove is known to have worked with Bill Canary on numerous political races in Alabama , beginning in 1994 and including William Pryor 's campaign in 1998 .
Canary and Pryor both enjoyed a close political and social relationship with Rove  who went on to become a senior adviser to the president , before Bush 's " brain " resigned earlier this year .
Two Republican lawyers who have asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation allege that Canary and Rove also worked together on the 2002 Alabama governor 's race .
One of the lawyers is close to the Republican National Committee in Alabama .
According to the lawyers , Rove and Canary initially supported Republican Lieutenant Governor Steve Windom in his bid for the nomination to challenge Governor Siegelman but then switched their allegiance to Rep.
Bob Riley after his victory in the primary .
The Windom campaign was well known to be sluggish , however , prompting many observers to wonder just how serious an undertaking it really was .
By 2002 , George W. Bush was president and Karl Rove was working in the White House as his special assistant with the highest level of security clearances .
Rove , however , did not lose his security clearances , even after he was identified as one of the sources in the CIA leak case , in which the cover of covert CIA officer , Valerie Plame Wilson was exposed to journalists in 2003 as an apparent act of reprisal against her husband Joseph Wilson .
Rove could not be reached for comment for this article .
A call placed to the White House for forwarding information was answered but not returned .
Windom , after being told about the article and the name of this publication , said , " Im not interested , thanks . 
According to the Alabama RNC source , Rove met regularly with operatives for the Riley campaign .
The source 's allegations are confirmed in part by campaign disclosure forms , which show that Windom paid Canary as a consultant between 1999 and early 2001 and later received large contributions from Canary 's business partner , a pattern that is duplicated with Riley and Canary .
According to public records , Windom paid Canary 's firm $ 38,022 for consulting and polling between 1999 and 2001 .
At the same time , PACs associated with Canary 's business partner , Patrick McWhorter , donated heavily to Windom 's campaign , contributing $ 149,000 in 2001 and another $ 75,000 in 2002 .
After Windom lost the primary , PACs associated with McWhorter and Canary switched their donations to Bob Riley , giving him $ 85,000 in the days immediately preceding the November election .
After the election victory , Windom emerged immediately as a close confidant of Riley's , advising him on the appointment of a new Insurance Commissioner , Walter A. Bell , and other matters .
Canary also emerged as a key Riley advisor .
Public records also show that at the same time Canary was consulting for Bob Riley 's campaign , his lobbying group , the Business Council for Alabama , donated $ 678,000 to the campaign of his client .
This was the third largest donation the campaign received , exceeded only by those from the Republican National State Elections Committee , for $ 2,475,000 , and from Bob Riley himself , who contributed $ 1,070,000 to his own campaign .
Rove on the Corner Rove 's meetings with Riley campaign operatives are said to have taken place on street corners in Washington at prearranged times .
" Riley 's people went up to DC and had a couple of meetings with [ Rove ] , " one of the Republican attorneys stated .
In addition , Rove and his wife purchased a property in Rosemary Beach , Florida in November of 2002 , about 2 - 1/ 2 hour drive from Alabamas capital 
Montgomery , a little over an hour 's drive from Mobile , and less than an hour by jet .
" He would never discuss anything on the phone .
He would tell you to meet him at some corner and then you get there and sure enough he is standing in the middle of the intersection waving at you . "
Riley did not return calls seeking comment .
These allegations are similar to those made by consultant Marc Schwartz in The Architect : Karl Rove and the Master Plan for Absolute Power by James Moore and Wayne Slater , describing a meeting that took place in March of 2002 : " I gotta meet Rove , " Jack Abramoff told Schwartz one afternoon as they talked in the backseat of the lobbyist 's car .
Abramoff 's driver , Joseph , was working his way through the crowded streets of Washington .
The lobbyist gave Joseph a location for a rendezvous , and he set a course in the direction of the White House .
" Really ? " Schwartz asked .
" We 're going to the White House ? "
" No . No .
We do n't do that , " Abramoff answered .
" Why not ? " Schwartz joked .
" I 'm sure George would want to see me . "
He explained to Schwartz why they were not going to see Karl Rove at the White House .
" They 've got movement logs over there and everything , and we like to keep things kind of quiet .
So just watch .
You 'll really get a kick out of it . "
A few minutes later , Abramoff pointed through the front windshield at an approaching street corner and turned to smile at Schwartz .
" You recognize him ? " the lobbyist asked his client .
" Son of a bitch , " Schwartz muttered .
" He 's just out in the middle of the street . "
" Uh - huh . "
Moore told RAW STORY that Schwartz tried to backtrack on his remarks after his book 's publication .
" After telling us a story with great detail about being in a car with Jack Abramoff as he met with Karl Rove on a Washington street corner , Marc Schwartz then clammed up , " Moore said last week .
" When our book , The Architect , was published and national news political correspondents realized Schwartz had told the only first hand story of a meeting between Rove and Abramoff , Schwartz began to get phone calls .
" His approach was to dissemble and deny his own words , which was not very productive since we were in possession of notes and the conversation had been recorded , " Moore added .
" He got numerous calls from network television news producers but refused to sit for a TV interview citing concerns about his business and professional life in El Paso , claiming GOP political connections in his work that Rove could pressure to harm Schwartz 's income . "
The Hatch Act Under the Hatch Act of 1939 , federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity .
The Act provides an exemption , however , for an employee paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President .
According to former Nixon counsel and legal Scholar John Dean , Rove would have been exempt .
" The Hatch Act does not apply to the president 's immediate staff , " Dean told RAW STORY last week .
Marthena Cowart , Director of Communications for the Project for Government Oversight , concurred , saying in an early Thursday phone conversation that " it is because [ Karl Rove ] is paid via the Appropriations Committees , so yes , he would be exempt . "
Yet the Hatch Act was one reason given by the White House to explain why email accounts on Republican National Committee servers were used by White House senior aides in preference to White House email accounts  they claimed they did n't want to use federal resources for political campaigns .
Although the use of these these accounts had been known for some time , they came under increased scrutiny last April as a result of the US Attorneys scandal " because some White House aides used them to help plan the U.S. attorneys ' ouster .
Democrats were questioning whether the use of the GOP - provided e-mail accounts was proof that the firings were political . "
" The Republican National Committee set up the accounts for about 20 Bush aides , such as Karl Rove and his deputies , who get involved in politics , spokesman Scott Stanzel told AP earlier this year .
" Having the GOP create non-White House addresses and provide separate BlackBerries , laptops and other communications gear was designed to avoid running afoul of Hatch Act rules barring federal employees from engaging in political activities with government resources or on government time , " he added .
Rove 's resignation had no effect on the ongoing Office of Special Counsel probe of alleged Hatch Act violations , however a spokesman noted , " Once a person leaves government service , they are out of our jurisdiction . "
A Web of Rovian Connections Since most of the Riley campaign 's services were provided by local Alabama firms , the few payments it made to companies that operated on a national level stand out sharply .
The most eye - catching of these is a payment of $ 100,000 in November 2002 , which went to Mentzer Media Services of Towson , MD for a last - minute advertising campaign .
A very similar payment of $ 85,000 had gone to the same firm from Steve Windom 's campaign just before the June 2002 primary .
Mentzer Media is best known for having handled the advertising for the two most prominent attack groups of the 2004 presidential election -- the Progress for America Voter Fund and the Swift Boat Veterans .
Progress for America was founded in 2001 by Tony Feather , a former Bush - Cheney 2000 political director who had known Karl Rove since the 1970's and had worked with him on political campaigns in the 1980's and 1990's .
During the year leading up to the 2004 elections , PFA solicited soft - money donations and poured $ 29 million into supporting Bush 's reelection campaign , $ 27 million of which went to Mentzer Media .
Most of that was spent on a massive last - minute advertising campaign featuring an ad in which Bush comforted a girl whose father had died on 9/11 .
Almost as much -- $ 19 million -- was paid to Mentzer by the Swift Boat Veterans for ads attacking John Kerry .
The Swift Boat Veterans and PFA were linked in other ways besides their use of Mentzer Media , both employing the same legal expert on election law and the same media advisor .
There were widespread suspicions at the time that Rove was closer to both groups than campaign laws allowed .
For example , the New York Times noted that the primary backers of the Swift Boat Veterans were wealthy Texans , including " two men with ties to the president and his family -- one a longtime political associate of Mr. Rove 's .
... Mr. Rove , Mr. Bush 's top political aide , recently said through a spokeswoman that he and Mr. [ Bob ]
Perry were longtime friends , though he said they had not spoken for at least a year .
Mr. Rove and Mr. Perry have been associates since at least 1986 , when they both worked on the gubernatorial campaign of Bill Clements . "
Salon.com further pointed out that " Rove had already convinced Perry to begin raising money to elect state judges -- funds used to help launch the Texas Civil Justice League .
The Civil Justice League was Rove 's initial surrogate organization and carried the message that trial lawyers were bad people who were screwing up the business climate with frivolous lawsuits .
The chorus singing about the evils of lawyers in Texas was later joined by Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse ( an organization that Rove helped grow and with which he maintains close contact today ) , and yet another front group called Texans for Lawsuit Reform .
...
Thus an entirely artificial movement , conceived and funded by Rove , was used to change the state 's judicial system and , of course , became an essential step in Rove 's master plan to elect Bush governor and then president . "
When Karl Rove started working with William Canary in Alabama in 1994 , it was as a direct extension of the strategy for electing pro-corporate Republican judges that he had begun in Texas .
Rove 's first major victory in Alabama was the election of Judge Perry Hooper in a race that was decided only after a year - long legal battle resulted in the disqualification of 2000 absentee ballot , making Hooper the victor by a mere 262 votes .
When viewed in the context of a long - term plan to make the Republican Party dominant in Alabama , events in that state in 2002 take on the appearance of being as much a part of what Salon calls " Rove 's master plan " as any in Texas .
Beyond that , the electoral strategy that was carried out in Alabama in 2002 might be seen as a trial run for Rove 's successful national election strategy of 2004 .

McDonald 's says its jobs are challenging and rewarding
The Oxford English Dictionary currently describes a McJob as " an unstimulating low - paid job with few prospects " .
McDonald 's says this definition is now " out of date and insulting " , and claims a survey found that 69 % of the UK population agree it needs updating .
The campaign by the firm's UK arm is backed by the government 's skills envoy and former CBI boss Sir Digby Jones .
' Making a stand '
" The current definition is extremely insulting to the 67,000 people who work for us within the UK , " said McDonald 's senior vice president David Fairhurst .
" It is also insulting for everyone else who works in the wider restaurant and tourism sectors .
The McDonald 's logo is one of the world 's most recognisable
McDonald 's says that in its staff surveys , 90 % of employees agree they are given valuable training that will be of benefit for the rest of their working lives .
And 82 % of its workers would recommend working at the company to their friends .
' Derogatory '
McDonald 's is now inviting its customers to sign petition books in its stores , or alternatively via a new website , entitled Change The Definition .
HAVE YOUR SAY Dictionaries deal with the world as it is , not the world companies might like to portray
Ian Smith , London
Send us your comments
McDonalds says it will hand the petition into the Oxford English Dictionary in the autumn .
Its campaign is further supported by British Chambers of Commerce director general David Frost , British Retail Consortium director general Kevin Hawkins and City & Guilds director general Chris Humphries .
The word McJob was first used in the US in the 1980s and was popularised by Douglas Coupland 's 1991 book Generation X .
It first appeared in the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2001 .
Last year McDonald 's tried to improve the image of its employment opportunities with the slogan : " McProspects - over half of our executive team started in our restaurants .
Not bad for a McJob . "

The lower house of the French parliament approved a bill that would allow immigrants to provide DNA samples in support of their applications to join relatives in France .
The National Assembly voted 91 to 45 to allow a trial run of DNA testing for immigrants until 2010 - a measure that critics say betrays France 's humanitarian values , and that even some Cabinet ministers dislike .
" This is no longer a debate between left and right - it's a debate within our own conscience , " said Patrick Braouezec , a law - maker from the opposition Communist Party .
An amendment on DNA use passed in a thinly attended , late - night session .
It is part of a broader immigration bill presented by Brice Hortefeux , a longtime friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy who heads the newly created Ministry of Immigration and National Identity .
For the bill to become law , the upper house - the Senate - also must approve it .
The higher chamber is expected to take up the bill on 2 October .
The bill would allow consular officials at French embassies to request DNA tests from applicants seeking long - term visas to join their family members in France .
The DNA tests would be voluntary .
The measure is aimed at proving familial ties in cases where officials have doubts about the authenticity of a marriage certificate , birth certificate or other official document presented .
Proponents say DNA tests would help speed up processing of applications .
The author of the amendment - ruling conservative party lawmaker Thierry Mariani - argued that it would give immigrants another way to support their applications .
Opponents call the measure discriminatory .
The DNA tests would be at the expense of the applicants , which Mariani estimated at about £ 210 each .
Another of the bill 's most controversial provisions would require candidates for entry to undergo French language tests - or even receive language training before moving to France .
France , like many European countries , has been looking for ways to curb illegal immigration , mainly from Africa .
The French government has recently pressed police to step up expulsions of illegals in France .
Hagel : Gonzales has ' failed this country , ' and ' should resign now '
Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday May 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel , who has been flirting with the idea of running as an independent candidate for president , released a statement today calling on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign immediately for failing the country .
 The American people deserve an Attorney General , the chief law enforcement officer of our country , whose honesty and capability are beyond question , " the Nebraska Senator wrote in a statement obtained by RAW STORY .
" Attorney General Gonzales can no longer meet this standard . "
Hagel added , " He has failed this country .
He has lost the moral authority to lead .
Comeys testimony yesterday brings to light the latest episode in a series of questionable actions by Attorney General Gonzales .
It is another part of a pattern of flawed decision making by the Attorney General . "
" America is a nation of laws , " Hagel continued .
" In the interest of the American people , Alberto Gonzales should resign now . "
At the liberal blog Think Progress , former White House Privacy Counsel Peter Swire writes that the beleaguered Attorney General may face " new legal problems after yesterdays testimony of former Deputy Attorney General James Comey . "
" In a 2006 hearing , when Sen . Chuck Schumer asked him about Comeys objections to the NSA wiretapping program , Gonzales denied there was any ' serious disagreement about the program , ' " Swire notes .
Swire sees two possibilities ; either " Comeys objections apply to the NSA warrantless wiretapping program that Gonzales was discussing , " which would mean that " Gonzales quite likely made serious mis-statements under oath " or " [ p ] erhaps Comeys objections applied to a different domestic spying program . "
The latter possibility would be " a big advantage for Gonzales  he wasnt lying under oath . "
" But then we would have senior Justice officials confirming that other ' programs ' exist for domestic spying , something the Administration has never previously stated , " Swire concludes .
Log homes have always been a part of the American scene ( thanks , in part , to Abe Lincoln ) , but they became increasingly popular beginning with the earth movement in the late 1960s .
In response , many new producers entered the market , selling their homes as do - it - yourself kits to people looking for an inexpensive house and a way to get closer to nature .
In time , the movement evolved into the more sustainable and quite permanent country lifestyle .
Consumers gradually began considering log homes as their primary residences .
Homeowners still wanted a low - key lifestyle when they were away form work , but they did not want a home considered only for vacations .
Log homes have finally moved away from being inexpensive , do - it - yourself dwellings and into the mainstream of American housing .
If you live in Russia you can get a wooden PC .
Instead of all this boring plastic panels you get a masterpiece made of finest mahogany with each smallest detail precisely curved and polished .

I met you for the first time , and after a decent dinner of grilled chicken , roasted redskin potatoes and asparagus , you asked me to your place .
You were harmless .
We talked for weeks .
You were n't a creep - so I obliged .
During the movie you suggested , ( Who the hell makes a girl sit through Full Metal Jacket on a first date ? ) you appeared next to me , stealthily and poked your penis in my face , and in the midst of silently pleasuring yourself , asked if you could " come on my face .
" After I shot up in disgust , you continued to stroke yourself , and told me that I was so pretty that you could n't help it .
Then , as I RAN for the door ( thank god I was wearing slip on shoes ! ) you proceeded to " finish " all over the dining room floor .
Thanks for that , Firefighter .
Please , PLEASE put your HOSE away .... you disgusting pig ..............
In a side project that I ’ve been working on I built a quick - and - dirty function for doing simple method overloading .
For those of you who are n’t familiar with , it ’s just a way of mapping a single function call to multiple functions based upon the arguments they accept .
Here ’s the function in question :
// addMethod - By John Resig ( MIT Licensed ) function add Method ( object , name , fn ) { var old = object [ name ] ; object [ name ] = function ( ) { if ( fn.length == arguments .
length ) return fn.apply ( this , arguments ) ; else if ( typeof old == ' function ' ) return old.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; }
and here is how you might use it :
function Users ( ) { add Method ( this , " find " , function ( ) { //
Find all users ... } ) ; add Method ( this , " find " , function ( name ) { //
Find a user by name } ) ; addMethod ( this , " find " , function ( first , last ) { //
Find a user by first and last name } ) ; }
Or , if you wanted to use it with an object prototype :
function Users ( ) {} addMethod ( Users.prototype , " find " , function ( ) { //
Find all users ... } ) ; add Method ( Users.prototype , " find " , function ( name ) { //
Find a user by name } ) ; addMethod ( Users.prototype , " find " , function ( first , last ) { //
Find a user by first and last name } ) ;
And here ’s what the end result would look like to the user :
var users = new Users ( ) ; users.find ( ) ; // Finds all users.find ( " John " ) ; //
Finds users by name users. find ( " John " , " Resig " ) ; //
Finds users by first and last name users. find ( " John " , " E " , " Resig " ) ; //
Does nothing
Obviously , there ’s some pretty big caveats when using this :
The overloading only works for different numbers of arguments – it does n’t differentiate based on type , argument names , or anything else .
( ECMAScript 4 / JavaScript 2 , however , will have this ability – called Multimethods – I ’m quite excited . )
All methods will some function call overhead .
Thus , you ’ll want to take that into consideration in high performance situations .
Now , the secret sauce is all going back to the fn.length expression .
This is n’t very well known , but all functions have a length property on them .
This property equates to the number of arguments that the function is expecting .
Thus , if you define a function that accepts a single argument , it ’ll have a length of 1 , like so :
( function ( foo ) {} ) .
length == 1
I did some basic testing and this technique seems to work in all modern browsers – please let me know if I ’m wrong .
If you ’re concerned about adding a function call overhead when binding only a single function , then you can give this version of addMethod a try :
// addMethod - By John Resig ( MIT Licensed ) function add Method ( object , name , fn ) { var old = object [ name ] ; if ( old ) object [ name ] = function ( ) { if ( fn.length == arguments .
length ) return fn.apply ( this , arguments ) ; else if ( typeof old == ' function ' ) return old.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; else object [ name ] = fn ; }
That one will attach the first bound function with no additional checks – keeping it nice and speedy .
Once extra functions are bound , things will slow ever so slightly .
This , also , has the added benefit of being able to bind default “ catch all ” functions which will handle all the calls that pass through .
The result would look something like this :
var users = new Users ( ) ; users.find ( ) ; // Finds all users.find ( " John " ) ; //
Finds users by name users. find ( " John " , " Resig " ) ; //
Finds users by first and last name users. find ( " John " , " E " , " Resig " ) ; // Finds all
This function wo n’t change the world , but it ’s short , concise , and uses an obscure JavaScript feature – so it wins in my book .
The World Intellectual Property Organization wants to educate you about copyright .
Well , not so much you as your 9 to 14 - year old children , who are the targets of a new 72 - page workbook ( PDF ) filled with " colorful examples " of copyright law in action .
The most surprising thing about the booklet ?
The fact that it devotes eight pages to coverage of the public domain and other limitations on copyright .
The booklet is called " Learn from the Past , Create the Future " and is designed to be used in school classrooms .
It 's only available in English at the moment , but Arabic , Chinese , French , Russian , and Spanish versions are all coming .
The book is peppered with amusing ( * cough * ) games for kids to play , including " Clear the Rights , " " Public Domain Detective , " and " Spot the Infringement . "
Unlike Captain Copyright and similar past efforts to educate kids , the WIPO document actually covers both sides of the equation .
Public domain works get several pages of explanation , though the booklet rightly notes that finding something available for free on the Internet does n't mean it's in the public domain .
Fair use even gets some love .
" National laws allow works protected by copyright and related rights to be freely used in special situations , " the booklet says .
" In other cases , national laws allow works to be used without asking the right holder for permission as long as he is compensated for such use .
Thanks to these copyright limitations , even works that are not in the public domain can sometimes be used without asking for permission or paying royalties to the author or other right holders . "
That 's refreshing to see , but the approach is still not without its critics .
William Patry , senior copyright counsel at Google , praises the balance shown by the document but questions the use of " Young Author " profiles scattered throughout the book .
The small snippets highlight young authors from around the globe , apparently trying to make this issue relevant for the booklet 's target audience .
But Patry wonders if " the idea of transference [ could ] be at play , a desire to have children identify with young authors their own age ( or others they are told they ' admire ' ) and then transfer that identification to multinational corporate copyright owners ?
I do n't defend piracy if defined as counterfeiting , but I think we have to be very careful not to manipulate young children under the guise of educating them . "
Still , even Patry admits that WIPO " has made a genuine effort to present a balanced view . "
Given the criticism the group comes up for when it overreaches in favor of copyright owners , it 's only fair to pat them on the back when such issues are handled with more fairness .
When Bill Gates started to make an impact in the software business , he reportedly said : " I want to be the IBM of software . "
It looks as though he succeeded all too well - Microsoft looks as bloated and bureaucratic as its giant model , where programming was famously compared to prehistoric monsters wrestling in tar - pits .
Where he is breaking with the tradition of his predecessors , IBM's Tom Watsons , Sr and Jr , is that he is getting out early .
Last week , Gates announced stage two of a multipart retirement strategy , which started when he stopped being Microsoft 's chief executive six years ago .
He will still be Microsoft 's chairman , but will reduce his day - to - day workload over the next two years .
Watson
Sr , who founded IBM , clung on tenaciously into his 80s , and many thought Gates would do the same .
But for more than a decade , he has had another interest : trying to improve the lot of the world 's poorest .
He started devoting his fortune to good causes , now done through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Gates 's plan is to reverse the balance of the time he devotes to Microsoft and his charitable works .
At the hastily arranged press conference to announce the change , Gates said : " In the early days , I liked to review every line of code , to interview every job applicant .
Today , our products include millions of lines of code , we hire thousands of people a year , I 've had to lighten up in both of those areas . "
Clearly he has n't been reviewing the code for Vista , the next version of Windows , which has exhibited all the tar - pit tendencies described in Fred Brooks 's classic book on programming , The Mythical Man-Month .
Brooks was writing about the development of the IBM 360 mainframe family , launched in 1964 , which was by far the largest private project of the age .
Vista is on a similar scale , and in a blog post called Broken Windows Theory , Philip Su describes it as " the largest concerted software project in human history .
The types of software management issues being dealt with by Windows leaders are hard problems , problems that no other company has solved successfully .
The solutions to these challenges are certainly not trivial . "
Usual suspects
Having " managed developer teams in Windows for five years " , he writes ( at www.tinyurl.com/z2wlo) about " the usual suspects " - Windows code is too complicated , and the process has " gone thermonuclear " .
He also writes about more important cultural effects : there 's too much random micro-management , and no one really wants to know if something is going wrong .
" Every once in a while , Truth still pipes up in meetings , " he writes .
" When this happens , more often than not , Truth is simply bent over an authoritative knee and soundly spanked into silence . "
No doubt this is true of all large companies .
But do n't feel too bad , Philip Su : Windows Vista could be doing better than average , by software industry standards .
In the US , for example , a Standish Group survey found that more than a third of software projects were simply abandoned unfinished .
The average project was 90 % over budget and exceeded its schedule by 120 % .
" In the larger companies , the news is even worse : only 9 % of their projects come in on time and on budget , " the report said .
" And , even when these projects are completed , many are no more than a mere shadow of their original specification requirements .
Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42 % of the originally proposed features and functions . "
That certainly sounds like Vista - but it was written a decade earlier .
The same problems have affected many British projects , including the Stock Exchange 's failed Taurus ( Transfer and Automated Registration of Uncertificated Stock ) , and a significant proportion of UK government IT projects .
For a recent example , the NHS 's current IT development was budgeted to cost £ 6.2 bn ; it will now cost £ 12.4bn , and could end up at £ 20 bn or more .
It 's also late .
And it 's still considered relatively successful .
Either way , the problem is n't getting easier .
The Standish Group called its first survey , in 1994 , The Chaos Report .
By 2001 , it was Extreme Chaos .
So the real question is : why ?
We have known since the IBM mainframe software debacle , more than 40 years ago , that very large software projects are very hard to do .
Why do we keep making the same mistakes ?
More to the point , will Microsoft make the same mistake again ?
Or have we seen the last blockbuster version of Windows ?
Viable alternatives
The other thing we know today is that there are viable alternatives , as shown by Apple 's development of OS X , by companies such as Google , and the open source movement .
Apple had its own struggles in the tar - pits , until it abandoned its operating system development and went out shopping for a replacement .
Even after buying NeXT ( a little company run by Steve Jobs ) for $ 400 m at the end of 1996 , and getting the complete Unix - based NextStep operating system , it took more than four years to release OS X 10.0 ( Cheetah ) .
Since then , there have been regular " point releases " : Puma , Jaguar , Panther and Tiger .
If Leopard ( 10.5 ) arrives alongside Vista , that will be six releases since 2001 - the year both OS X and Windows XP came out .
To be fair , Microsoft has also released Media Center and Tablet PC versions of Windows XP , plus SP2 and versions of Windows CE and Windows Server .
It 's clearly more manageable to target useful point releases than embark on a five - year death march to finish something like Vista .
Apple even manages to charge for them .
Another idea is to compartmentalise the development and have teams working independently , which is more or less what happens in the open source market .
Whether this would be a practical or economically viable option for Windows involves a lot of other issues .
Windows is already a combination of parts from separate teams , and Vista combines multiple developments .
Some parts are even released separately , such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player .
But that could be tricky given the notorious interdependencies that afflict Windows .
Also , most copies of Windows are bought by companies who hate " touching the desktop " because it costs them time and money .
They like to have one desktop for as long as possible and , if they can , will skip whole versions .
Microsoft has traditionally felt it needed to produce a blockbuster version of Windows just to get companies to upgrade .
And pay for another copy .
It has tried to get around this by introducing a licensing scheme , Software Assurance , where companies pay a regular fee and get upgrades free .
This has not been wildly successful , and it can't be easy to sell a three - year scheme if there are up to five years between free upgrades .
The third option is to run development as a continuous process , essentially what happens with online companies such as Google .
This simplifies software development , but again it is hard to sell the idea to companies that want to control and test their own updates .
Users can give up control and buy centralised services .
But that was one of the planks of Microsoft 's .
Net strategy - which included an online version of Office - and it did n't take off .
The most likely result is a combination of all these approaches .
Microsoft is not going to stop producing things like Windows XP , Windows Server and Microsoft Office , because that is how businesses buy software - and it brings in $ 1bn a month in profits .
But , at the other extreme , Microsoft is spending heavily on web developments to compete with Google , Yahoo and other web - based companies .
You can expect to see a very wide range of ideas floated .
Last year , Martin Taylor , Microsoft 's general manager of competitive strategy , said the firm was planning to deliver " software as a service " , but not using the hosted ASP ( application service provider ) model it tried with .
Net .
" We have got a strategy for all of our products of how we deliver value to customers via the cloud .
Stage two is how we monetise that value , " he said .
In other words , Microsoft will extend its packaged offerings via a mixture of free ( supported by advertising ) and premium ( subscription ) online services , such as OneCare and Office Live .
IBM went through a similar transformation .
After cheap Intel - based servers appeared in the 1980s , companies were less willing to install giant mainframes , and the company recorded multibillion - dollar losses .
But IBM did n't go away - it is still more than twice as big as Microsoft .
Nor did mainframes : they still run the country .
But IBM changed from a supplier that depended on shipping " big iron " to one selling software and services .
Microsoft has to make the same sort of transition , and it wo n't be easy .
You'd have thought this was just the sort of huge challenge that someone like Bill Gates would find irresistible .
Apparently not .

Strong Typing
M- J. Dominus
Plover Systems Co .
Talk given to Philadelphia and St. Louis Perl mongers September 22 , 1999
You might want to read this while following the original slides for the talk .
Sometimes when you read Usenet or whatever , and you see folks arguing endlessly about the same religious topics that they 've been arguing about for years , it can be hard to believe that it could ever come to an end .
But sometimes these holy wars do come to an end .
For example , the biggest holy war of holy wars was the war over structured programming .
It started in the 1960s , with Edsger Dijkstra 's famous letter to the Communications of the ACM titled GOTO Statement Considered Harmful .
For years and years it seemed as though this argument was never going to come to an end , but it has , and the bodies of the goto folks are buried pretty deep .
( At this point in the talk , Walt claimed that the goto folks had not lost completely , because for example you could find use of goto all through the Linux kernel .
I replied that the mere fact that Walt could say that was evidence of the tremendous magnitude of the anti- goto forces :
It was only because he was unfamiliar with 1960 's programming styles that he thought that one goto every fifty lines was a frequent use of goto . )
Anyway , the real point is that nobody disbelieves the structured programming manifestos any more .
Everyone thinks it is better to structure your program into explicit while and for loops and to reserve use of goto for special circumstances .
When people want to argue the other side , they argue for extremely feeble positions , like ``Well , sometimes goto is useful when you want to break out of a deeply nested conditional . ''
That is the extent of the support for goto these days .
A holy war that 's even further back is the subroutines vs. no subroutines war .
On one side , programmers who say that use of subroutines improves modularity and maintainability .
On the other side , the programmers who say that the gains are not that great , and that subroutine calls are slow .
You know who won that one .
Probably the oldest holy war of all is high - level languages vs. assembly language .
From our vantage point in 1999 , it can be hard to imagine that this was ever a subject for debate at all .
But I caught the tail end of this one when I was first learning to program in the 1970s .
Here 's one that is n't resolved yet :
Are formal verification methods and correctness proofs valuable ?
I think that it 's not yet clear .
Certainly they are n't very useful today .
But just as I can easily imagine a future in which correctness proof research has been abandoned , I can easily imagine a future in which everyone takes for granted the idea that a program should come with a formal correctness proof .
I just can't see either of those things happening in less than twenty - five years .
One of these holy wars that I find particularly interesting , and the one I 'm going to talk about , is the war over `strong type checking ' .
What makes this one interesting is that many people think it 's over , but it is n't .
I 'm going to spend a little time talking about the history of type checking up to about thirty years ago , and then I 'll move on to the state of the art .
Why have types at all ?
What are they for ?
Well , imagine that you are a programmer in 1962 , so you are writing an assembly language program .
You store the string " More yummy eels , please " into the computer 's memory , say at locations 2001 - 2024 .
Some time later , a mistake occurs , because your program has a bug .
The four - byte quantity at locations 2012 - 2015 is loaded into a floating - point register and used as a floating - point number .
What happens when the four bytes eels are used as a floating - point number ?
1.87292264408661e+31 , that 's what .
Well , the actual value will vary depending on your computer , but it wo n't be anything sensible .
In fact , we could interpret that four - byte quantity as a four - byte integer also , in which case it turns into the number 1,936,483,685 .
We would like to prevent this sort of error from occurring .
The idea we have is that the computer is going to keep track of the type of value stored at each part of its memory , whether it 's part of a string , or an integer , or a floating - point number , or whatever .
Each operation such as multiplication will also have a type .
The compiler or assembler can check to make sure that the types of an operator and its operands match , and raise a compile - time error if they do n't , and so hopefully detect some sorts of bugs early on before they have a chance to cause real trouble .
As far as I can tell , this idea first appeared in COBOL .
To give you a flavor of what early type systems were like , we 'll look at Fortran , a very popular language that originally dates from about 1955 .
Fortran had a bunch of integer types in 2 , 4 , and 8 - byte sizes , called respectively INTEGER * 2 , INTEGER * 4 , and INTEGER * 8 .
It had several sizes of boolean types , which in Fortran were called LOGICAL * 1 and so forth .
It had real number types , also in several sizes , called REAL * 4 and so on .
And it had complex number types of various sizes , from COMPLEX * 8 through COMPLEX * 32 .
You could also omit the sizes ( the * 8 parts ) and get a default size .
If you wrote a Fortran program that contained the code
INTEGER I REAL R , S R = I + S
the compiler could generate the correct instructions , including the implicit conversion of the value of the integer variable I to the entirely different floating - point representation of the same number .
This is called static type checking , because it is performed once at compile time .
The Fortran type system had some other interesting properties .
You could omit the explicit type declarations , in which case variables defaulted to INTEGER if their names began with I , J , K , L , M , or N , and to REAL otherwise .
Fortran had array types also ; the declaration
INTEGER A( 10 )
declared A to be an array of ten integers , of which A ( 3 ) was the third .
And functions also had types , so for example :
FUNCTION F(X ) INTEGER F , X F = X+1 RETURN N = F ( 37 )
Here the compiler can tell that both the argument to F and its return value are integers and check that F is being used appropriately .
Once again , this is all happening at compile time .
The assembly language output of the compiler has no type checking at all .
The compiler has already made sure that you did everything right , so rechecking at run time would be a waste of time .
This strategy is called static type checking .
Since we 're taking a tour of the programming world of the 1950's , let 's look at the other successful language from that era , Lisp .
Lisp is quite different from Fortran .
Instead of static type checking , it has dynamic type checking .
This means that each value carries around its type with it , and that each time an operation is invoked , it checks to make sure its operands have the correct types .
If not , it raises a run -time type error .
For example :
(+ 1 2 ) 3 (+ 1 2.0 ) 3.0 (+ 1 " eels " ) Error in + : " eels " is not a number .
This run-time type checking incurs a performance penalty , of course , but it also lends tremendous flexibility to the language .
It means that you can write one function that does the `right thing ' for many different types of values , and it means that you can extend the type system at run time , which in turn enables techniques such as object - oriented programming .
All of these are impossible ( or at least very difficult ) in Fortran .
The ALGOL language of 1960 was tremendously influential , and spawned a number of successful descendants , of which Pascal and C ( and C++ ) are among the best - known .
The type systems of C , Pascal , and ALGOL 60 are all quite similar .
ALGOL attempted to extend type systems beyond simple scalars to aggregates of various sorts .
They contain :
array of type
type pointer to type ( Algol uses `reference ' here )
type ( Algol uses `reference ' here ) set of type ( Pascal only )
type ( Pascal only ) record of type ( C calls this a struct )
type ( C calls this a ) function returning type
And also arbitrary compositions of these , so for example we have the C type
int *(( * pf [ 17 ] ) ( int ) ) ;
which is an array of 17 pointers to functions that take integer arguments and which each return a pointer to an integer .
The problem with all this was that it turns out to be more complicated to get `right ' than scalar types were .
What do I mean by `right '?
Well , remember that the goal here is to enable compile - time checking of the soundness of your program .
If it compiles , and there are no type errors , you 'd like to be able to feel safe about your code .
Now there are two kinds of possible failures here .
There might be some real type error that is not caught by the compiler ; that 's a `false negative ' .
It 's bad because then you run your program and it does something bizarre , like interpreting eels as the number 1.87292264408661e+31 .
It 's also possible that the compiler might report an error where there is n't one ; that 's a `false positive ' .
It 's also bad because you are trying to do something reasonable , and the compiler refuses to compile your program because it is afraid something will go wrong .
Another way in which this is bad is that it encourages you to ignore the correct error messages when they do appear --- that 's the `Boy Who Cried Wolf ' syndrome .
The use of warning signs shall be kept to a minimum as the unnecessary use of warning signs tends to breed disrespect for all signs .
( Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices , Millennium Edition , section 2C.02 . )
Pascal is noted for crying Wolf .
Here is an example of a common problem with the type checking in Pascal :
var s : array [ 1..10 ] of character ; s := ' hello ' ; {
You wish }
You declare s to be an array of ten characters , and then you try to assign the string hello to s .
No , sorry ; this is illegal .
hello is an array of five characters , not ten , so its type does not match that of s and you are not allowed to make the assignment , or even to compile the program .
Here is a similar example :
We are trying to write a function to emit an error message .
We define a string type for the argument to this function :
type string = array [ 1..40 ] of character ; procedure error ( c : string ) begin write ( ' ERROR : ') ; write ( c ) ; writeln ( '' ) ; end ;
Now you would like to issue an error message this way :
error ( ' File not found ' ) ;
but you can't , because the argument is an array of 14 characters , and is is required to be an array of 40 characters .
You have to write this instead :
error ( ' File not found ' ) ; error ( ' Please just kill me , Mr. Wirth ! ') ;
Well , Wirth agrees that this was a mistake .
I imagine he fixed it in his later languages , although I am not sure .
I see the C programmers snickering .
Just to show that this is not a problem that is unique to Pascal , here 's an example from C .
int main ( void ) { unsigned char * c ; float f = 10 ; for ( c = ( char *) &f ; c < sizeof ( float ) + ( char *) &f ; c++ ) { printf ( " %u " , * c ) ; } putchar ( '
' ) ; return 0 ; }
This is one of the programs that I wrote while I was computing that the representation for eels was the same as for 1.87292264408661e+31 .
It does the opposite conversion , and finds the four - character string whose representation is the same as that of the float 10.0 .
When I compiled this with a popular compiler , I got this error message :
float.c :
In function `main ' : float .c:10 : warning : comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
Now this is very interesting .
What does it mean ?
After some investigation , I discovered that it was complaining about the comparison
c < sizeof ( float ) + ( char *) &f
Why the complaint ?
The expression on the right of < has type `pointer to char ' , whereas c on the left has type `pointer to unsigned char ' .
Now this is a totally spurious error message , because the sizes of char and unsigned char are guaranteed to be the same , so no harm can come of making the comparison between the pointers .
( Note that this is different from comparing a signed and an unsigned char value , which really is unsafe ; here I am only comparing the pointers to such values . )
But okay , let 's stipulate that this might be an indication of a real mistake , and that it is worth warning about this so - called problem that can never cause anything bad to actually happen .
Fine .
Then why , if this is so terrible , why did the compiler complain about the comparison , and remain completely silent about the assignment
c = ( char *) &f
on the same line , which commits the exact same type error ?
Surely if the pointers are so incompatible that they cannot even be compared , then it must be even worse to assign one to the other ?
Well , this is all nitpicking .
We could argue all day about ( char *) versus ( unsigned char *) and whether it should have emitted one warning or two , but this is ignoring the real failure here .
The real failure here is that the entire program is one gigantic type violation ; the whole point of the program is to take a float and print it out as if it were an array of char s .
The program is printing out floats as if they were strings , and all the compiler can find to complain about is this ridiculous triviality about the signedness of the characters I want to print out .
I call that a big fat failure .
Okay , my conclusion is that type checking , as practiced by C and Pascal , is a failure .
We have seen several examples of basically spurious errors , where the compiler complained about something that was not a problem at all , or should not have been a problem if the type system - had been better designed .
These spurious errors waste the programmer 's time ; they have to be investigated , and understood , and worked around .
Then when the real errors come , the programmer is tempted to ignore them or work around them in the same ways .
As a larger and more general sort of argument to show that the type systems of C and Pascal are failures , I 'm going to point out that each language has several mechanisms specifically designed for disabling or otherwise working around the brokenness of the type system .
For example :
Casts ( char *) &f ( C only )
Automatic conversions ( C only ) int i ; i = 1.42857 ; ( 1.42857 is silently truncated here to 1 . )
Variadic functions ( C only )
Union types ( Both C and Pascal ) var u : case tag : integer of 0 : ( intval : integer ) ; 1 : ( realval : real ) ; 2 : ( stringval : array [ 1..20 ] of character ) ; 3 : ( boolval : boolean ) ; end ; r : real ; u.intval = 1428457 ; r = u.realval ;
We committed a type error here .
One I forgot to put on the slide :
If you define a function in one file and use it in another file , Pascal has no way to check that the types are consistent .
This is a hole in the type system .
It would n't be fair to hold it against Pascal , except that it has been used and advertised over the years specifically as a way to evade the requirements of the Pascal type system .
This proliferation of methods for evading or disabling the type systems is demonstration that those type systems are failures .
If they worked properly , then why do we need all these ways to evade them ?
So given my conclusion , that static typing , as implemented by languages like C and Pascal , is a failure , what can we do about it ?
One strategy is to simply give up and forget about static typing .
This strategy has been very successful .
Languages that do this include APL , the perennially popular Lisp , the Unix scanning language AWK , and of course Perl .
In fact , Perl gives up even more than these other languages , because instead of raising a type error when you try to add a number to a string , it just silently converts the string to a number and proceeds .
+ ( 8/2 ) . " . " .0.0.0
Yields 4.00 in Perl .
( This is due to Abigail , who was at the talk . )
So that worked pretty well , and a lot of people draw the conclusion from this that type checking is basically a failure , and that the trend in the future will be away from type checking .
Those that do n't come to this conclusion still have the idea that type checking has been pushed as far as it can go and it is at its pinnacle with Pascal and C .
If you ask people to name a strongly typed language , they frequently mention Pascal .
This is unfortunate , because almost everyone hates the Pascal type system .
And why not ?
It is terrible .
But that rotten image is what strong typing has to contend with .
However , there is another strategy that you can use to cope with the failure of Pascal .
You can try to do better .
Pascal dates from around 1968 .
In the last thirty years , research has not stood still , and we can in fact do better , as evidenced by languages like ML , Haskell , and Miranda .
It may come as a surprise to you that this strategy has also worked pretty well .
The next part of the talk is going to show that type checking does not have to be a failure , and , contrary to what you might think , Pascal is not a strongly typed language , but a weakly typed one .
We saw from the examples that the typing in C and Pascal failed for several reasons .
It was too fine - grained , as in Pascal 's useless distinction between an array of twelve characters and an array of thirteen characters .
It led to many spurious error messages , which means warnings that are ignored and waste everyone 's time .
It was too easy to violate the type systems though union types and casts , and it had to be so , because of the preponderance of spurious errors .
In places it was too coarse - grained , as in C's structs ; a pointer to any sort of struct is required to be equivalent to a pointer to any other sort of struct .
And finally , they are inconvenient to use because you have to cover your program with zillions of type declarations everywhere .
People are so used to C and Pascal that they take these problems for granted and assume that they are inherent in the idea of static typing .
Then when I say that you can solve this problem by making the type system stronger , they are surprised .
If Pascal 's type system is a problem , then surely a stronger type system is an even bigger problem .
But no , that 's not right , because most of the problem is with the clumsiness of the system ; it is always getting in your way and preventing you from doing what you want .
If the type system were smarter , so that it always did what you wanted , you would be happy that it was stronger .
Neither C nor Pascal is state of the art ; they are both thirty years old , and it shows .
All the problems of their type systems are surmountable , not some time in the future , but with languages that are available today .
I am going to show examples from the ML programming language .
I picked ML because I felt that it made the point , and because I was most familiar with ML at the time .
Since then I 've learned Haskell , which is a more recent development ; I like it even better than ML .
But ML is good enough .
ML dates from about 1970 , and was originally a research language used for developing theorem - proving systems .
It is very strongly typed , and its type system solves the problems that C and Pascal had .
ML has the usual sorts of scalars : strings , integers ( called int ) , real numbers ( called real ) , and also a boolean type , called bool with values true and false .
17 int 17.3 real " brain d foy " string true bool
Note that in ML , unlike in C or Pascal , string is a basic scalar type , and not an array or a pointer or anything like that .
ML also has tuple types , including pairs and triples :
( 17 , " foo " ) int * string ( 12.5 , 13.5 , 9 ) real * real * int ( true , false , true ) bool * bool * bool
Note that each of these has its own type , such as real * real * int .
( ML has record types too , but they are much less frequently used than the tuples . )
ML has lists :
[ true , false , true ] bool list [ true , false , true , false ] bool list [ 1,2,3, 4,5 ] int list [ " brain " , " d " , " foy " ] string list [ 17 , " foo " ] ILLEGAL [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,6 ] , [ 0,233 ] ] int list list
They are something like lists in Lisp ; they have a head and a tail like Lisp lists .
But in ML , all the elements of a list must have the same type .
This is necessary , or else when you pulled an element out of a list you would n't know what you were going to get .
In contrast , you can mix types in tuples , because a tuple has a fixed length and each position is typed separately , so you still always know what you are going to get .
[ ] 'a list [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ ] , [ ] ] int list list [ [ " b " , " d " , " f " ] , [ ] , [ ] ] string list list
ML also has polymorphic types .
The simplest example of a value with a polymorphic type is the empty list , which has type ' a list The 'a here is pronounced `alpha ' , and is a type variable which could be any type at all .
That 's because the empty list of integers looks the same as the empty list of strings or the empty list of anything else .
So it is okay to include the empty list as a member of a list of int lists , or as a member of a list of string lists , as we did above .
We 'll see more examples of this later .
Finally , these types can be composed arbitrarily .
For example , you might have the type ( bool * ' a list ) list , which is the type of lists whose elements are pairs where the first item in the pair is a boolean and the second item is a list of some unspecified type .
In ML , unlike most languages , there are no implicit conversions .
An int is an int and a real is a real and if you want to add an int to a real , you have to use an explicit function that converts ints to reals .
3 + 4.5
This is a compile - time error because the types do n't match .
real ( 3 ) + 4.5
This works , and the result is the real 7.5 .
real is a built - in function which takes an int argument and yields a real result , so its type is int ->real .
The arrow here indicates a function type .
The types of some other built - in functions are :
floor real -> int sqrt real -> real not bool -> bool explode string -> string list
explode takes a string and breaks it up into a list of strings of length 1 .
mod int * int -> int
mod is declared to be an infix operator , so you must write it in between its two int arguments , like 12 mod 5 instead of mod( 12,5 ) .
rev 'a list -> ' a list
Notice that rev , which reverses a list , is polymorphic .
Its argument is any sort of list , and it produces another list of the same type as its result .
: : 'a * ' a list -> ' a list
: : is the `cons ' operator .
It takes a head of type ' a , and a tail , which is a list of 'a s , and puts together a new list of 'a s with the specified head and tail .
That 's how lists are normally constructed , and the usual syntax is defined to be syntactic sugar for a sequence of cons operations .
For example
1::2::3 : :[]
and
[ 1,2,3 ]
are exactly the same .
Okay , we 've now seen the ML type system .
It is rather complicated , and there are a lot of types .
But what is the big deal ?
The big deal is that in spite of the complexity of the type system , it is all automatic .
We do not have to put any type declarations into our programs .
Here 's a little story about what it is like to program in ML .
We want to write a factorial function , so we type in the following :
fun fact 0 = 1 | fact n = n * fact ( n - 1 ) ;
The | here is pronounced `or ' .
The first clause says that the factorial of 0 is 1 , and the second clause says that the factorial of some number n ( other than 0 ) is n * fact ( n - 1 ) .
Notice how there are no type declarations .
Nevertheless , the compiler sees the 0 , and says , `` Oh , 0 is an int , so the function must be a function on int s. ''
This means that n must also be an int .
Since n is an int , the expression n- 1 is legal .
Now , * , the multiplication operator , requires two arguments of the same type , and n is an int , so the return value from fact must also be an int .
The return value of 1 in the first clause is consistent with that .
Everything has checked out , so the compiler accepts the definition , and prints out :
val fact = fn : int -> int
This means that fact is a function with type int -> int .
The compiler has figured this out all by itself .
Now all you have to do is check to make sure that it is what you were expecting .
It is , so you go on to the next function .
If the type deduced by the compiler was not what you expected , it almost always means your program has a bug .
Not a pernickety annoying bug like some string that is the wrong length , but a real bug , one you would be glad to find out about because it means that your program was really going to generate the wrong answers .
Here 's another example .
It 's a function to add up the elements of a list .
fun sumof [ ] = 0 | sumof ( h : :t ) = h + sumof t ;
The sum of the elements in the empty list is 0 ; the sum of the elements in a list of the form h::t is computed by adding h to the sum of the elements in t .
Notice again that there are no type declarations .
What does the compiler do with this ?
It sees that the argument in the first clause is [ ] , so the function must operate on some kind of list , say an 'a list , where 'a is presently unknown .
In the second clause , the argument is h::t , which must also be an 'a list , and since the compiler knows the type of :: it can deduce that h must be an 'a and t must be an 'a list .
Now the return value in the first clause is 0 , which is obviously an int , and that means that the function returns an int .
Since h is being added to this return value in the second clause , h must also be an int .
We now know what 'a represents :
It is int , and t and h::t are both int list .
Everything else is consistent with this .
The compiler then prints out
val sumof = fn : int list -> int
sumof is a function that takes an int list as argument and produces an int as its result .
This is exactly correct .
If we were to replace the 0 with a 0.0 , it would have deduced real list -> real instead .
If we replaced the 0 with true , the compiler would have signaled a type error .
Union types were big trouble in Pascal and C , because they let us store a value of one type and read it back again as another type .
Let 's see how ML handles union types .
datatype MyNum = IV of int | FV of real ;
Here we create a union type ; the new type is called a MyNum .
It can contain an integer or a real value .
Every MyNum either has the form IV i for some int i , or FV f for some real f .
We can write either of these in our program and the result is a value of type MyNum :
val n = IV 5 ;
This creates a variable named n bound to the MyNum with value IV 5 .
The IV is a constructor which is a lexical marker for a literal value of MyNum type ; you can also think of it as a function for converting int s into MyNum s. FV is similar .
When we create this value , ML prints out a message that its type is MyNum .
This data type really is useful as a union type .
We can't make a function that accepts both int and float arguments , because a function must have exactly one type .
But we can certainly make a function that is defined on all values of the type MyNum .
For example , here is a function that converts a MyNum to a real :
fun Num_to_real ( IV i ) = real i | Num_to_real ( FV f ) = f ;
The compiler deduces the type MyNum -> real for this function .
Or we could write a function that takes the square root of a MyNum , yielding a new MyNum as the result :
fun Numsqrt n = FV ( sqrt( Num_to_real n ) ) ;
The compiler says this has type MyNum -> MyNum .
Or we could construct a function that turns a MyNum into an integer , throwing away the decimal part if it has one :
fun Numtrunc ( IV i ) = i | Numtrunc ( FV f ) = trunc f ;
if the MyNum has the form IV i , then we just return i ; if it has the form FV f then we take f , which is a real , and truncate it and return the result .
This function has type MyNum -> int .
Now let 's see if we can abuse the union type the way we did in Pascal and C , by storing one type of value into the union and extracting a different type .
Here 's our first try :
fun intval ( IV x ) = x ;
It 's a function that takes a MyNum in the form IV x and just returns the integer x value .
We suspect that having defined this function , we can pass it a MyNum of the form FV f and it will return the real value f but think that it is an int .
But things start to go wrong right away :
We get a non-fatal warning :
Warning : match nonexhaustive IV x => ...
This means that we forgot to define the intval function in all possible cases , which is correct .
But it also compiles the function and elaborates the correct type , which is MyNum -> int .
Now let 's go ahead with our plan of handing intval a value that it is not prepared to deal with :
intval ( FV 3.5 ) ;
ML does not interpret 3.5 as an int .
Instead , we get a run-time fatal error :
uncaught exception Match ...
In ML , you can make a union type , but it is impossible to store a value of one type and read it back as another type .
The intval function extracts the integer part of a MyNum , but only in a type - safe way ; it refuses to work if there was no integer part to extract .
We did get a run-time error , which was a shame .
But we got a compile - time advance warning that run-time errors were possible , because we did not define the function for all the possible values it was supposed to operate on .
ML can do this sort of case coverage analysis for lists also :
fun Nth ( 0 , ( h : : t ) ) = h | Nth ( n , ( h : : t ) ) = Nth ( ( n - 1 ) , t ) ; Warning : match nonexhaustive ...
Here ML is warning us that our function is undefined when the second component of the tuple is the empty list .
Let 's try again to screw up the union types .
fun intval ( IV i ) = i | intval ( FV f ) = f ;
This function takes a MyNum and just extracts the data part of it .
Maybe ML will get confused and treat both parts the same ?
No , this does n't even compile ; instead , it raises a type error :
Error : rules do n't agree ( tycon mismatch ) expected : MyNum -> int found : MyNum -> real rule : FV x => x
The first clause implies that this function is going to take a MyNum and produce an int .
But the second clause says to take a MyNum and to produce a real .
This is inconsistent , and if ML let us define this function we would not know what kind of value we were getting back from it .
Let 's make one final try :
We 'll construct a MyNum based on an integer , and try to pass it to the square root function :
val n = IV ( 3 ) ; sqrt (n ) ;
No , this fails .
We can construct n , but when we try to take the square root , ML refuses :
Error : operator and operand do n't agree ( tycon mismatch ) operator domain : real operand : MyNum in expression : sqrt ( n )
It was expecting a real , and we gave it a MyNum .
Let 's skip this slide ; I think it 's belaboring the point .
It may not be obvious at first how powerful ML 's polymorphic types can be .
Here 's an example .
fun map(f , [ ] ) = [ ] | map ( f , ( h : : t ) ) = f(h ) : :( map ( f , t ) ) ;
This is something like Perl 's map function .
It takes a function f and a list , applies f to every member of the list , and produces a list of the results .
How does ML deduce the type of this function ?
The arguments to map are f , which has some totally unknown type , and [ ] which has type ' a list for some ' a .
Since the arguments in the second clause must match , the compiler knows that h has type 'a and t has type 'a list .
On the right - hand side of the second clause , h is used as an argument to f , so f must be a function of type ' a -> 'b for some type 'b , which is pronounced `beta ' .
The return value of f is used as the first argument to the :: operator , and the second argument is the return value from map itself , so map must be returning a 'b list .
This is consistent with the return value from the first clause .
Everything else checks out okay , and no new constraints are discovered , so ML reports that the type is
( 'a -> 'b ) * ' a list -> 'b list
It takes a pair whose first element is a function of type ( ' a -> 'b ) and whose second element is a list of 'a s , and it returns a list of 'b s .
Here 'a and 'b could be any types at all .
It is now perfectly legal to write
map ( sqrt , [ 1.0,2.0,3.0 ] )
and get back a list of reals , or to write
map ( rev , [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] , [ 7,8,9 ] ] )
and get back a list of int list s. map will work on lists of any type , but in a type - safe way .
Actually the map function I just showed is not the way you would normally do it .
ML supports something called currying , which is easier to show than to explain .
The normal definition of map is like this :
fun map f [ ] = [ ] | map f ( h : : t ) = ( f h ) : :( map f t ) ; val map = fn : ( ' a -> ' b ) -> ( ' a list -> 'b list )
The type here says that map gets one argument , which is a function of type ' a -> 'b , and returns another function , which is of type ' a list -> 'b list .
If we apply map to sqrt , which has type real -> real , we get as the result a function of type real list -> real list .
We could re-invoke this result function on a real list directly :
map sqrt [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 ] ; val it = [ 1.0 , 1.414 , 1.732 , 2.0 , 2.236 ] : real list
in which case it does n't look too different from the version on the previous slide .
But we can also use the returned function as a value :
val sqrtall = map sqrt ; val sqrtall = fn : real list -> real list
Here map has transformed the sqrt function into a sqrtall function that operates on lists of reals :
sqrtall [ 1.0,4.0,9.0 ] ; val it = [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 ] : real list
So a curried function is more flexible than a regular function :
We can invoke it on all of its arguments in the normal way , or just on the first few arguments , in which case it yields a function that is a special case of the original curried function .
I find the ML type system really interesting , and I should n't have put so many examples in the talk , because it was too long .
But I got carried away .
I think this slide has low value , and if I were doing it over I would leave it out .
What 's life like as an ML programmer ?
As we 've seen , ML has a lot of unspectacular successes .
Day after day , you get a lot of type errors , and they indicate real problems .
I made a lot of typos while I was making up the examples for the slides , omitted parentheses and commas and the like , and even when the result was syntactically correct , the ML type checker usually caught the error .
For example , I wrote an example that should have looked like this :
fun first ( Node (d , Nil , _ ) ) = d | first ( Node ( _, left_tree , _ ) ) = first left_tree ;
But instead I wrote this :
fun first Node(d , Nil , _ ) = d | first Node( _, left_tree , _ ) = first left_tree ;
This is syntactically correct , but does n't mean what it appears to ; it defines a curried function first of two arguments , of which the first argument is taken to be the Node function .
So this would define first as a function , which , given the Node function , yields a function which , when given one of the specified triples , yielded the value on the right hand side .
Do n't worry if you do n't understand this , because it does n't make any sense .
And because it did n't make any sense , it did n't pass the type checker .
Programming in ML is very pleasant .
More than almost any other language I know , you can just write down the definitions of the functions as they come into your head .
You do n't need to bother with declarations ; everything is just figured out for you automatically .
And you do get a lot of type errors , both actual failures and also places where the type emitted by the compiler is not what you thought it should be .
But unlike in C or Pascal , every one of those errors indicates a real , serious problem in your program , not merely something you have to groan over and try to work around the compiler 's stupidity yet again .
As I said , ML has many unspectacular successes , finding mistake after mistake in your programs every day .
But here 's a really wonderful example of a spectacular success , which I got from Andrew R. Koenig of Bell Labs .
Koenig wanted to write a merge sort function .
To do merge sort , we break our input list into two lists , sort each one separately , and merge the sorted lists together .
For concreteness , let 's assume that we 're going to write a merge sort function that works on lists of integers only , so we will expect it to end up with type int list -> int list .
fun split [ ] = ( [ ] , [ ] ) | split [ h ] = ( [ h ] , [ ] ) | split ( x ::y : : t ) = let val ( s1 , s2 ) = split t in ( x::s1 , y:: s2 ) end
Splitting apart the input list is not too hard .
You should be able to read off the first two cases .
The third case makes use of a feature we have n't seen before : let .
let says to compute the value of split t , and to bind the two values in the result to the variables s1 and s2 , and then return as the result the expression following the in .
So in that third case , where the input list is more than one element long , the first two elements get named x and y , and the tail of the list is t .
We split up t , and then append x and y to the front of the two result lists , and that 's the final answer .
The type assigned to the split function is ' a list -> ' a list * ' a list --- it gets a list of some kind of data , and returns a pair of lists of the same kind of data .
Now to merge two lists back together is about equally simple :
fun merge ( [ ] , x ) = x:int list | merge ( x , [ ] ) = x | merge ( h1::t1 , h2::t2 ) = if h1 < h2 then h1::merge ( t1 , h2::t2 ) else h2::merge( h1::t1 , t2 ) ;
If either of the input lists is empty , then the result of merging it with the other list is just the other list .
And in the third clause , if neither list is empty , we compare the heads of the two lists , and whichever is less gets put on the head of the result .
That x:int list in the first clause is a type declaration for x .
I lied about the type declarations .
On certain very rare occasions you have to put one in .
Why can't it deduce the type in this case ?
It almost can ; the only problem is that < is ambiguous , and could operate on either int s or real s , and ML has no way to tell which .
One way to solve this problem is by requiring an occasional type declaration , as here , to disambiguate the situation ; the other solution would have been to use a different symbol for the real version of < , in which case < would no longer be ambiguous and the type declaration would be unnecessary .
The designers of ML chose the first solution , but it 's not clear that it was the right choice .
( Some dialects of ML , such as OCaml , do it the other way , and so the type annotation would be unnecessary . )
In any case , merge gets the type int list * int list -> int list .
Now we have split and merge , we can build our sort function :
fun sort [ ] = [ ] | sort x = let val ( p , q ) = split x in merge ( sort p , sort q ) end ;
The result of sorting the empty list is just the empty list .
And to compute the result of sorting some other list x , we first split x into p and q , we sort p and q , and we merge the results .
All fine , except that the type that comes out of the compiler is a shock .
We expected it to be int list -> int list , and instead we get ' a list -> int list .
This says that we can put in any kind of list at all ; that is a surprise because we hardwired the < operator into merge , and it should n't work properly for a list of , say , MyNum .
The type also says that no matter what we put in , even a list of MyNum s , we will always get an int list out .
This is impossible .
Has the vaunted ML type checker screwed up ?
It certainly has produced an impossible result .
Will we have to disable it or work around it to get our program to compile , like we had to in C and Pascal ?
No .
The type checker has the type correct in this case .
The fact that the type is not what we expected means that there is a bug in our program , not in the type checker .
How can the impossible occur ?
One way is if it never actually occurs .
That 's why you can promise to renew your NSI registration when Hell freezes over .
Are you going to have to renew ?
No , because Hell is not going to freeze over .
If we put a list of strings into our sort function , the compiler says that when it returns , it will have turned it into a list of int s .
This is impossible .
One possible explanation is that the sort function never returns .
And in fact this is the case .
The sort function , as we wrote it , goes into an infinite loop on any input except the empty list .
This means that the type checker has found an infinite loop bug in our program .
Ponder that for a minute .
Now try to imagine the Pascal type checker detecting an infinite loop .
Where is the bug , anyway ?
Suppose we are trying to sort the one - element list [ x ] .
It 's not empty , so we split it into two lists , sort the split lists , and merge them back together .
But when we split the list , it splits into [ x ] and [ ] .
Sorting [ ] works out fine , but when we try to sort [ x ] it does indeed put us into an infinite loop .
We need to add another special case to sort to tell it how to sort a one - element list without recursing .
We just add another clause to the definition :
fun sort [ ] = [ ] | sort [ x ] = [ x ] | sort x = let val ( p , q ) = split x in merge ( sort p , sort q ) end ;
Now the type is
int list -> int list
as we expected .
We could make the sort function a little better by having it take the comparison operator as an argument .
Then the type becomes
( 'a * ' a -> bool ) -> ' a list -> ' a list
Incidentally we can get rid of the type declaration in merge if we do this .
Then we can use our sort function like this :
sort string_less_than [ " fred " , " bill " , " andrew " ] ; val [ " andrew " , " bill " , " fred " ] : string list
or we can use it to manufacture sorting functions :
val sort_strings = sort string_less_than ; val sort_strings = fn : string list -> string list sort_strings [ " fred " , " bill " , " andrew " ] ; val [ " andrew " , " bill " , " fred " ] : string list
OK , this was supposed to be a talk about Perl , and I finished talking for two hours about Cobol , Fortran , Lisp , and ML with hardly a word about Perl .
This part of the talk is the part about Perl .
We saw that ML is pretty cool , and that it has this fabulous type - checking system , and that type - checking systems do n't have to suck , which is quite a surprise after seeing Pascal .
Perl is also pretty cool , and has a history of adopting good ideas from other languages , so maybe we can borrow the ML type checker for Perl .
Well , it 's a nice thought , but I really can't see how to make it work .
Perl and ML are just too different , and Perl has just gone too far in the other direction .
Perl hardly has any type checking at all , not even at run time .
Here are some of the things that you 'd have to give up in Perl if you wanted to put in ML - style type checking .
while ( <> ) { $ total += $ _ ; }
Here $ _ is a string , read from a file , and is being implicitly converted to a number .
That is going to foil your type checking .
@a = ( 1 , 3.1416 , " A painted lotus flower " ) ;
Here we have a list with many different types of items in it .
You can not know at compile time what type $ a [ 1 ] is going to turn out to have later on .
In an ML list , all the elements have the same type .
@a = localtime ( ) ; $s = localtime ( ) ;
Here the localtime ( ) function returns two totally different things depending on context .
That is going to give the ML type checker fits .
More to the point , if any possible use is legal , there are no errors to raise , and there is no point of checking if there are no erroneous circumstances to report .
print ;
Here 's a good one .
We print out the value of $ _ , regardless of whether it is a number or a string or a reference or whatever , and it is automatically converted to a string .
If you want type checking , you want this to be an error unless $ _ is a string .
But who would want that ?
if ( @a ) { ... } $s = @a ;
Here we 're using an array like a scalar .
Again , if you want this to be an error , you do n't want Perl .
And if you do n't want this to be an error , then what do you mean when you say you want type checking ?
$ a[ 100000 ] = ' big ! ' ; $ h{nosuchkey} =
' It means " to chop " ' ;
Finally , here we are assigning values to out - of - range and nonexistent array and hash elements .
You could make this into an error , but the result would n't be very Perl - like .
The conclusion here : Type checking is nice , and so is Perl , but not in the same way .
Adding type - checking to Perl would be like making a hot fudge sundae with mashed potatoes instead of ice cream and with gravy instead of fudge .
It might be perfectly edible , but it would n't be a hot fudge sundae .
Perl 's present design is simply not consistent with most of the goals of compile - time type checking .
Having said that , let 's look at some of the places where Perl does manage to do a little type checking .
The most important is the
use strict ' refs ' ;
declaration .
Normally ,
Perl is happy to convert a string to a reference ; if you use the string foo where Perl expects to see a hash reference , for example , foo is taken to be a reference to the hash % foo .
The use strict ' refs ' declaration makes this into a run-time error .
The -w optional warning flag also enables warnings for some type errors .
For example , if -w is enabled , then this code :
$s = ' some string ' ; $r = $s + 13 ;
generates the warning Argument " some string " is n't numeric in add .
Perl is even getting a little bit of compile - time type checking .
Here 's the idea behind this very new feature : People use hashes for objects all the time in Perl .
The hash keys are member data names , and the corresponding values are the object 's member data .
The member data is then looked up in the hash by key , every time the program does a member data access .
This is inefficient , because the object probably only has a few keys , and they have to get looked up over and over again .
Also , it wastes memory , because Perl 's hashes are designed to be expanded dynamically and to support all sorts of operations like each and delete that are actually irrelevant for objects .
So we would like to use an array instead of a hash , and look up the attributes by number instead of by name .
This will save time and memory .
Of course , the down side is that it is now hard to remember which number goes with which attribute .
So we will have a compromise :
The object will be an array , but the first element of the array will be a hash that maps the attribute names to array indices .
If the expected keys are declared at compile time , you can write $ object ->{NAME} and the compiler can pretend that you wrote $ object - > [ 3 ] instead .
For keys that vary at run-time , Perl can look up the key in the hash at run time and use that to figure out the right index .
So here is an example .
A typical object looks like this :
$ octopus = [ { tentacles => 1 , hearts => 2 , favorite_food => 3 } , 8 , 3 , " crab cakes " , ] ;
This octopus has eight tentacles , three hearts , and its favorite food is crab cakes .
We can write
$ octopus -> {tentacles} ;
and get 8 , because when the Perl sees $ octopus -> {tentacles} it looks up tentacles in the $ octopus - > [ 0 ] hash , finds the index 1 , and then returns $ octopus - > [ 1 ] .
Similarly ,
$ octopus ->{noses} = 1 ;
can generate a run-time error .
( `` No such array field '' )
Now for the compile - time checking .
We have to warn the compiler which attribute names to expect .
We do that with two declarations .
First , in the package that defines our Octopus class , we include a use fields declaration :
package Octopus ; use fields qw( tentacles hearts favorite_food ) ; sub new { ... }
This declares the field names tentacles , hearts , and favorite_food so that they can be resolved at compile time .
Now , in the main program , we have to warn Perl that a particular object is an Octopus :
use Octopus ; my $ fenchurch = new Octopus ; my Octopus $ junko = new Octopus ;
Notice the type declaration in the third line ; this is new .
$ fenchurch -> {tentacles} = 8 ;
This is resolved at run-time , by looking up tentacles in the hash $ fenchurch - > [ 0 ] , and then indexing $ fenchurch with the resulting number .
$ junko->{tentacles} = 8 ;
However , because of the declaration , this is simply resolved to $ junko - > [ 1 ] = 8 at compile time , as if we had written it that way all along .
So the $ junko version is much more efficient than the $ fenchurch version , even though they look the same .
This code will generate a run-time error
No such array field :
$ fenchurch -> {noses} = 1 ;
because $ fenchurch - >[ 0 ] does not contain an entry for noses .
But the corresponding code for $ junko will generate a compile - time error :
$ junko -> {noses} = 1 ;
This says
No such field " noses " in variable $var of type Octopus .
