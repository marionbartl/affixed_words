Advertisement New carbon capture technology is being tested for the first time in the UK on a working coal - fired power station .
A 30 - tonne test unit will process 1,000 cubic metres of exhaust gas per hour from Longannet power station in Fife .
Carbon dioxide will be removed using chemicals and turned into a liquid , ready for storage underground .
Energy company ScottishPower wants to test technology which could lead to a full scale carbon capture plant becoming operational by 2014 .
The UK government recently gave the go - ahead for a new generation of coal - fired power stations provided they were able to limit their CO2 emissions .
The scientists have focussed on the post - combustion method of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) which aims to trap greenhouse emissions after fossil fuels have been burnt .
The plant , developed by Aker Clean Carbon , will enable them to assess the effectiveness of chemicals , known as amines , at removing CO2 .
Researchers from the University of Edinburgh will join the project , testing three different types of amine solution over the next three months .
We believe that the UK can lead the world with CCS technology , creating new skills , jobs and opportunities for growth
Ignacio Galan
Chairman , Iberdrola ScottishPower chief executive Nick Horler said : " This is the first time that CCS technology has been switched on and working at an operational coal - fired power station in the UK .
" It 's a major step forward in delivering the reality of carbon - free fossil fuel electricity generation . "
ScottishPower 's parent company Iberdrola said the UK would be its global centre of excellence for CCS development , bringing together academics , industry experts and engineers .
A professorship of CCS will be based at Edinburgh University , but other academic institutions will also be involved including Imperial College , London .
Iberdrola Chairman Ignacio Galan said : " We believe that the UK can lead the world with CCS technology , creating new skills , jobs and opportunities for growth .
" There is the potential to create an industry on the same scale as North Sea Oil , and we will invest in Scotland and the UK to help to realise this potential . "
The Longannet power station opened in 1969 and is the second largest in the UK .
The station chimney is 183 m tall , the second highest free - standing structure in Scotland .

It 's B minus one , the day before Bilderberg .
And it is definitely happening : I 've seen the guns .
I thought it might be a good idea to go to the Astir Palace resort for lunch .
See just what kind of a cheese omelette the president of the Federal Reserve is going to be enjoying .
I did n't get far .
At the gates , there were machine guns and men in loose jackets and guards checking under cars for bombs with those mirrors on sticks that morbidly obese people use to check whether they 've taken their knickers off .
I should have come for breakfast .
Maybe I would have got in .
A security guard opened the cab door , leaned in , and asked me if I was staying at the hotel .
I gave it my best shot .
Not much of a shot , but my best one .
" I 'm here for lunch . "
Smile feebly .
" We 're closed now .
Only guests . "
And to the driver , a bark of instructions to turn around .
We turned around .
I explained to the driver what was happening at the hotel , trying to avoid words like " globalisation " , " corporatocracy " and " dissolution of sovereignties leading to supranational control structures " .
I think he got the gist .
" They come to here ?
The leaders of the world ? "
He honked amiably at a girl in a bikini .
" To have conference , or to have holiday ?
Now is time for holiday !
Look to the beach ! "
I looked to the beach .
Everyone was splishing about in the shallows , batting tennis balls at each other and reading whatever the Greek equivalent of John Grisham is .
John Grisham , probably .
The sky is blue ; the sea is calm .
Even the dogs that sleep on the sand are well fed from the restaurant bins .
What could possibly be wrong with the world ?
Just up the hill , a small group of people are meeting for the weekend .
Might play a bit of ping pong .
Where 's the harm in that ?
Might thrash out a few broad brushstroke policies .
Microchipping ?
World Bank ?
These things need to be discussed .
And this is as nice a place as any to discuss them .
The hotel offers " gourmet dining , atmospheric bars , and extensive meeting & events areas and services . "
And the spa has a steam room .
And you know how much Kissinger loves to steam ( " Hotter !
I vont it hotter ! " )
Independently of me , Jim Tucker failed to get in for a snoop .
He stubs out a weary cigarette .
I do n't sense it 's his first .
I ask him about the order of business .
" This year ?
They 'll be talking about that ridiculous swiiiiiiine flu . "
And in the five raked - out syllables he gives the word " swine " , he paints his distaste of the subject .
" They want to use it to turn the World Health Organisation into the global department of health . "
I have to ask .
" Is n't it already ? "
" Only for members of the United Nations .
Also , they 'll be talking about ratifying the international criminal court .
Obama is waiting until he gets a sympathetic senate , after the 2010 elections .
Then he 'll pass it one evening , late in the week : too late for the Sunday papers , too late for the talk shows .
It 'll happen , and no one will notice .
First part of 2011 . "
I 'll say this for Mr Tucker : for a fortune teller , he 's giving us details .
Nothing about " You will travel overseas " or " Watch out for a man with a D in his name . "
Like David Rockefeller ?
" He 's 93 , but if he 's alive , he 'll be here , " growls Jim .
But again , why is this a problem ?
Why is anyone bothered that a bunch of powerful psychopaths – sorry , sociopaths ... sorry , bankers and politicians – have a yearly get - together ?
Many people admit to attending .
As one of the commenters on my previous piece rightly points out , George Osborne mentioned going to Bilderberg 2008 in his official expenses ( apparently he paid for the flights himself ) .
So why worry ?
Why interrupt your John Grisham for a single second as the limousines roll up the hill ?
Perhaps the problem is not that people are meeting up .
If there 's a problem at all , it 's whether or not there is a coherent global agenda , whether this agenda is something towards which people in power are doing their best to advance things , and whether this agenda ( if it exists at all ! ) is a benign one .
For now , my jury is out .
Except to say that when it comes to global politics I 'm reminded of that Edgar Allan Poe short story : the one in which [ WARNING : SPOILER ] a purloined letter is concealed out in the open , where everyone can see it .
Like large letters written across a map , so large they can't be seen .
I can't for the life of me remember which tale it is , Murders on the Rue Morgue or The Purloined Letter .
One of those two .
I 'm going back to the Astir Palace now .
The heat of the day is passing , and afternoon sun looks good on the barrel of a machine gun .
Charlie Skelton will be filing regular updates from Athens until he is arrested by shadowy figures in dark glasses
Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum , Wiwa v. Anderson , and Wiwa v. Shell Petroleum Development Company are three lawsuits filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) and co-counsel from EarthRight International on behalf of relatives of murdered activists who were fighting for human rights and environmental justice in Nigeria .
The lawsuits are brought against the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Shell Transport and Trading Company ( Royal Dutch / Shell ) ; the head of its Nigerian operation , Brian Anderson ; and the Nigerian subsidiary itself , Shell Petroleum Development Company ( SPDC ) .
The defendants are charged with complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people in Nigeria , including summary execution , crimes against humanity , torture , inhumane treatment , arbitrary arrest , wrongful death , assault and battery , and infliction of emotional distress .
The cases were brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act ( ATCA ) and the Torture Victim Protection Act ( TVPA ) .
The case against Royal Dutch / Shell also alleges that the corporation violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act .
Royal Dutch / Shell began using land in the Ogoni area of Nigeria for oil production in 1958 .
Pollution resulting from the oil production has contaminated the local water supply and agricultural land upon which the region 's economy is based .
Also , Royal Dutch / Shell for decades worked with the Nigerian military regime to suppress any and all demonstrations that were carried out in opposition to the oil company 's activities .
The oil company and its Nigerian subsidiary provided monetary and logistical support to the Nigerian police and bribed witnesses to produce false testimonies .
In 1995 , the company and its subsidiary colluded with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni 9 .
The Ogoni 9 was a group of activists that were hanged on November 10 , 1995 after a " trial " before a special military tribunal based on fabricated charges .
One of the nine , Ken Saro - Wiwa , was an internationally renowned writer and activist and was the leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ( MOSOP ) .
He is represented in this case by Ken Wiwa , Mr. Saro - Wiwa 's son and the executor of his estate .
Mr. Saro -Wiwa was outspoken in condemning Shell for polluting and destroying the Ogoni ecosystem , and he led the struggle for the autonomy of the Ogoni people and for an equitable distribution of Nigeria 's oil riches .
Other MOSOP leaders include John Kpuinen , the Deputy President of MOSOP 's youth wing , the National Youth Council of Ogoni People ( NYCOP ) , and Dr. Barinem Kiobel , the Honorable Commissioner of the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism and member of the Rivers State Executive Council .
These MOSOP activists , along with six others , including Saturday Doobee , Felix Nuate , and Daniel Gbokoo , were known as the Ogoni 9 .
Human rights groups and political leaders around the world condemned both the executions and the lack of due process that was accorded to the victims in connection with the so - called trial .
Other incidents of torture and detention include that of Owens Wiwa , who was detained for more than a year under false charges to prevent him from protesting .
During his detention he was beaten repeatedly .
Michael Vizor , then a NYCOP vice - president , was beaten by police in front of his children when he would not confess to a false charge .
He also had 400,000 ( Naira ) in cash and documents stolen from his house during his arrest .
He was further tortured and denied medical assistance during his wrongful detention .
Another plaintiff , Uebari N-nah , was shot and killed in October 1993 near a Shell flow station at Korokoro , Rivers State , Nigeria .
Other plaintiffs were attacked by troops summoned by Royal Dutch / Shell during a peaceful demonstration against Shell and the Nigerian military regime for bulldozing farmland in Bira Gokana for a pipeline contracted by Willbros West Africa , Inc. Karalolo Kogbara was shot by Nigerian troops while she was speaking out against the bulldozing of her crops .
Plaintiff Michael Tema Vizor was arrested , beaten and detained for four days without charge for participating in the same protest .

US reporting on the $ 165 m ( £ 116 m ) bonuses pledged to executives of bailed - out insurer AIG has focused on the anger felt by many Americans at what is widely seen as Wall Street looking after itself at taxpayers ' expense .
Mr Obama has to be careful not to alienate financiers , analysts say
President Barack Obama joined the chorus of condemnation on Monday , telling Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to " pursue every single legal avenue " to block the payouts .
The Washington Post reported a " tidal wave of public outrage " swamping the firm , to the extent that armed guards were posted outside the Connecticut offices of AIG 's Financial Products division .
" Inside , death threats and angry letters flooded e-mail inboxes .
Irate callers lit up the phone lines .
Senior managers submitted their resignations .
Some employees did n't show up at all , " the paper reports .
Meanwhile , ABC News 's White House correspondent Jake Tapper , writing for his Political Punch blog , cites a suggestion by Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley that the AIG executives " should consider following what he described as the Japanese model of shamed corporate executives : apology or suicide " .
AIG : QUICK FACTS 30 million US policy holders Operates in 130 countries Provides insurance to 100,000 companies and other entities
Obama ' outraged ' at AIG bonuses
The Huffington Post news site 's Nicholas Graham charges the Obama administration with shifting position on AIG - having previously suggested its contracts would have to be respected - in the face of " a growing chorus of national outrage " .
By Monday , he writes , " the populist backlash had reached a level which the Obama administration could not dismiss , and the result was the president promising to use every means available to stop AIG from paying out these bonuses " .
USA Today similarly reports that Mr Obama " latched on to the latest round of populist anger over corporate greed " .
That anger was roundly expressed by leaders of both parties in Congress , the newspaper says , and " outrage dominated the day on blogs , cable news and radio talk shows " .
' Obama 's bind '
But there are also those who argue that , however much politicians may need to appear to share public fury over the bonuses , the approach may prove counterproductive .
AIG built this bomb , and it may be the only outfit that really knows how to defuse it
Andrew Ross Sorkin
New York Times
New York Times business writer Andrew Ross Sorkin says in its Dealbook blog that while " it sure does sting " to see AIG executives get their bonuses , taxpayers may have to " swallow hard and pay up , partly for our own good " .
His reasoning ?
If US businesses start worrying that the government will force them to break inconvenient contracts , it will set the financial system on an even more slippery slope .
More soberingly , he adds , it may be in taxpayers ' best interests to keep the firm's " brainiacs " in their seats simply because " AIG built this bomb , and it may be the only outfit that really knows how to defuse it " .
It is a view echoed by the Wall Street Journal 's Jonathan Weisman , Sudeep Reddy and Liam Pleven , who talk of " the bind that Mr Obama finds himself in " and the resultant confusion in the White House response .
" [ Mr Obama ] needs to convince Americans he shares their mounting fury over the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being pumped into companies like AIG , " they write .
" At the same time , he needs the executives and employees of those companies to help the government untangle the current financial mess . "
For Mr Obama the issue " has become a critical political test " , they add , because " anger over the bonuses could make it harder for the administration to extract any additional funds it needs from Congress " for the bailout of the financial sector .
Now 's a time when everyone in Washington is suddenly going to be channeling his / her inner-populist
Domenico Montanaro
NBC News's First Read
Writers for the US political website Politico agree , saying " AIG 's woes threaten to severely complicate Obama 's hopes of returning to the well - again - for more bailout cash " .
And for all that the Obama team has tried to stress that it was the Bush administration that supported AIG 's bailout last year , the haste of the White House 's response to the latest crisis " underscored a new reality : This is President Barack Obama 's bailout now " .
Domenico Montanaro , writing in NBC News 's First Read column , says the current anger at Wall Street could help the Democrats push to allow the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy to expire .
" Still , now 's a time when everyone in Washington is suddenly going to be channelling his / her inner-populist .
Who will have the most credibility doing it ? " he asks .
" As for the short term , Congress is going to want a pound of flesh ( and then some ) from AIG . "

Making parallels to the Nuremberg trials , U.S. Sen .
Chris Dodd told a gathering of liberal bloggers in New Haven he ’d support bringing charges against any Bush administration officials found responsible for the policy of waterboarding terrorism suspects .
The five - term Connecticut senator made the comments Sunday at The Playwright , his latest New Haven stop in what has become a nonstop Dodd Career Resuscitation Tour in the wake of recent damaging press disclosures .
“ Not to prosecute people and pursue them when these acts occurred , ” he said following the gathering , “ is in a sense to invite them to do it again in a future administration . ”
The event was as notable for what Dodd said — the torture remarks ; a vow not “ to get burned again ” on executive bonuses — as for where he said it .
A week after the last D.C. - based reporter from a Connecticut newspaper was laid off , Dodd turned to local bloggers to help communicate with constituents back home .
It ’s “ Torture ”
Toward the end of the hour - long afternoon session in a second - floor room at the Temple Street pub , veteran blogger Al Robinson of My Left Nutmeg asked Dodd a two - part question :
Is waterboarding , the near - drowning technique used by the CIA interrogators on al Qaeda suspects , a form of torture ?
And does the senator believe that Bush administration officials who OK ’d the technique should be held accountable ?
The issue has exploded to prominence in Washington ( in between news of a Senate defection , a flu possible pandemic , and a Supreme Court retirement ) since the Obama administration released memos last month showing the CIA waterboarded two suspects 266 times , long after receiving any useful information .
“ I believe waterboarding is torture , ” Dodd responded .
Not only was it torture — it did n’t work , he said .
He noted that one suspect was waterboarded 183 times .
“ How effective could that be after the 90th ? ”
Dodd supported a call by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont to have a select committee investigate the case .
Now that President Obama has released the memos , they should be put to use rather than ignored , he argued .
“ If people in fact did something that was illegal they should be pursued , ” Dodd said , no matter how high up in the Bush administration the trail leads .
He spoke of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II in making the case that people responsible for the torture should be prosecuted ; Dodd ’s father was a prosecutor at the trials .
Click on the play arrow at the top of this story to watch his response .
Leahy arguing for select committee to review .
Playwright , The Sequel
When the session ended , Dodd spoke of why he had his staff organize it .
He noted that last week the Connecticut Post laid off D.C. correspondent Peter Urban .
“ We have no one [ left at the Capitol ] — zero — covering a seven - member delegation ” for readers back home , he said .
Even when he ’s back in Connecticut he sees fewer reporters at events than in the past .
Meanwhile , the “ universe ” of bloggers is growing , getting more diverse , and playing a role in communicating with voters .
Dodd and five staffers sat around a table prepared , and little utilized , for drinks and food with the five bloggers who attended .
Pictured from left are Tessa Marquis of Milford Democrats , among other sites ; “ CT Bob ” ; Edward Anderson ; and Al Robinson .
One blogger ( Bob ) ordered a draft ; Dodd had a Splenda - sweetened coffee ; a staffer ordered a soda ; and Anderson brought in a Starbucks cup .
( Also there was Gabe Rosenberg of CT Local Politics . )
That was it .
A waiter brought in two baskets of bread which remained covered atop the room ’s bar counter .
The beer was flowing more prodigiously , and the atmosphere was more electric , when many of those same bloggers assembled to participate in a different Senate campaign .
They came to pay homage to proto-liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of the Daily Kos website and to Ned Lamont , the insurgent Democrat whom the bloggers were at the time helping to raise money and visibility .
( Click here to read that story ; Lamont went on to defeat Lieberman in a Democratic primary , then lose the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent . )
It was clear from Sunday afternoon ’s more subdued gathering that the group of bloggers is inclined to support rather than trash the latest incumbent senator from the state in danger of losing his seat .
The questions were for the most part supportive of Dodd ’s stands , especially his bill to limit credit - card companies ’ predatory practices .
Dodd ’s bill passed the Banking Committee last week ; he predicted a tough fight before the full Senate .
And he enlisted the bloggers in getting the word out .
( Read about the bill here . )
Unlike at a mainstream press conference , there were no “ gotcha ” questions , and few sound bites .
Dodd and the bloggers dissected the credit - card bill , the bank bailout , and other issues in depth , at a leisurely pace .
In the Irish - themed pub , there were no questions about the latest scandal that threatens to sink Dodd ’s career next year , a profitable land deal in Ireland tied to a businessman on whose behalf the senator won a presidential pardon .
( Read about that here . )
There were no questions about the story in that day ’s Courant about the $ 500,000 a year Dodd ’s wife is pulling in serving on corporate boards .
Nor were there questions about Dodd ’s receipt of two mortgages on favorable terms from the head of a subprime lender he was supposed to regulate as chair of the Senate Banking Committee .
But there were lots of real questions , not softballs .
Like when Robinson asked Dodd if he has learned anything from the episode that first made his favorability ratings tank : an amendment he pushed that enabled AIG execs to collect bonuses out of government bailout money .
Public outrage was so intense that the normally untouchable Dodd , whose term expires in 2010 , is now running behind Republican Rob Simmons in the polls .
Dodd was ready to respond to Robinson ’s question , with no hint of defensiveness .
The answer : He “ wo n’t get burned again . ”
He said he plans to play an independent role in analyzing the regulations that the Treasury Department draws up based on the amendment that passed last fall .
He repeated the theme that he had agreed to the provision that allowed the bonuses as part of a larger amendment in which he inserted strong pro-taxpayer protections ; that the Treasury Department pushed for it at a time when senators were urged to act fast to prevent an imminent economic collapse ; and that no other senators objected , either .
In short , he argued , he was left out to dry by the Obama administration .
But he also said that moving forward he would act differently .
“ You [ Treasury ] tell me what you want to do , and I ’ll tell you whether I think it ’s right or not , ” Dodd said .
He vowed he would n’t “ nod and say that sounds good to me .
I ’ve been down that road again .
I wo n’t do that again . ”
Dodd said he ’s “ not hostile ” to performance - based bonuses that reward execs for coming in and turning around a troubled bank .
He said he does flatly reject retention bonuses with taxpayer money : “ It ’s a phony argument that nobody else will do these things .
A lot of people who have been laid off in this business will be happy to take the job . ”
Even though we love Pandora , there was a time when most of us , even Pandora 's founder , saw little hope that the startup could survive if Internet royalty rates for music were to rise .
Now , less than one year later , Pandora is seeing sunny skies and reporting that the company should reach profitability in 2010 thanks to their ability to serve highly targeted advertisements .
In an interview with Bloomberg , Pandora 's founder , Tim Westergren , said that " Revenue may double this year to about $ 40 million , " and that the site , " has 27 million registered users and is adding members at 50,000 to 60,000 a day , faster than in previous years . "
The article also reports that the astronomically popular iPhone app and new BlackBerry app are helping the service attract tons of new users .
Westergren attributed Pandora 's iPhone app to having 5 million total users , and attracting upwards of 18,000 new users per day .
Those are some impressive numbers .
With an ever expanding user base that Pandora can segment and target to advertisers ' niche audience needs ( based on music listening tastes ) , Pandora is able to capitalize on its growth , and attributes its financial wellness to desirable advertising verticals .
Even though the outlook is bright for 2010 , that pesky matter of Internet royalties has yet to fade away .
Westergren did tell Bloomberg that he was optimistic , but negotiations have yet to finalized between the service and the powers that control the purse : recording companies , artists , and copyright holders .
We could n't be happier for Pandora 's success , and hope to see 2010 turn out to be as profitable for them as they anticipate .
" ... to common security vulnerabilities such as protocol tampering , buffer overflows , persistent , and non-persistent rootkits and code propagation .
These vulnerabilities could result in attacks to the Smart Grid platform , causing utilities to lose momentary system control of their Advanced Metering Infrastructure ( AMI ) Smart Meter devices to unauthorized third parties .
This would expose utility companies to possible fraud , extortion attempts , lawsuits or widespread system interruption .
If security is not addressed in the design and implementation of these emerging technologies , it may prove cost prohibitive to address them once the devices are fully deployed . "

A security firm has warned that the Smart Grid for delivering and managing energy is rife with security holes , and could easily become a hacker 's playground , endangering the nation 's entire power - delivery infrastructure .
Because the Smart Grid will also be used by IT pros to manage electricity use in the enterprise and the data center , it also means that the grid could be used by hackers to crawl their way into company networks as well .
The security firm IOActive warns that the Smart Grid , as currently being built , is so insecure that it 's vulnerable to the kind of attacks that have bedeviled Internet sites and ordinary users for years .
In fact , from the company 's description of the dangers , it sounds as if ordinary users may be more secure than the grid itself , because users at least have installed security software .
The report concludes that the grid is vulnerable :
In other words , hackers could bring down parts of the grid , or possibly the entire grid itself , and could resort to extortion or blackmail .
Left unsaid was that terrorists could attack the grid as well .
The Smart Grid will be used not only by power companies , but by enterprises as well .
Intelligent devices will live inside corporate firewalls and communicate via the grid and with each other , and be used to manage power and resources .
If the very fabric of the grid is insecure , it wo n't matter how well a corporation protects itself --- hackers can make their way inside enterprise firewalls via the Smart Grid .
The solution , according to IOActive , is that the grid from the beginning should be built for security .
Joshua Pennell , President and CEO of IOActive , told the Committee of Homeland Security and DHS in a presentation that the grid needs to include best practice security assessments and that the industry should " follow a proven formal Security Development Lifecycle , as exemplified by Microsoft ’s Trustworthy Computing initiative of 2001 , to guide and govern the future development of Smart Grid technologies .
" There 's no doubt that IOActive has an axe to grind here --- after all , it specializes in security , and so stands to gain if more security were embedded in the grid .
But the company is also absolutely right :
If security is n't baked into the Smart Grid from the beginning , it spells potential disaster .

World oil production peaked in July 2008 at 74.82 million barrels / day ( mbd ) and now has fallen to about 71 mbd .
It is expected that oil production will decline slowly to about December 2010 as OPEC production increases while non-OPEC production decreases .
After 2010 the resulting annual production decline rate increases to 3.4 % as OPEC production is unable to offset cumulative non-OPEC declines .
The forecast from the IEA WEO 2008 is also shown for comparison .
World Oil Production
World crude oil , condensate and oil sands production peaked in 2008 at an average of 73.78 million barrels per day ( mbd ) which just exceeded the previous peak of 73.74 mbd in 2005 , according to recent EIA production data .
Production is expected to decline further as non OPEC oil production peaked in 2004 and is forecast to decline at a faster rate in 2009 and beyond due mainly to big declines from Russia , Norway , the UK and Mexico .
Saudi Arabia 's crude oil production peaked in 2005 .
By 2011 , OPEC will not have the ability to offset cumulative non OPEC declines and world oil production is forecast to stay below its 2008 peak .
My estimate of 1.95 trillion barrels ( TB ) of total Ultimate Recoverable Reserves ( URR ) of oil is used to generate the forecast shown by the red line below .
If Colin Campbell 's estimate of 2.20 TB is used , which is 250 billion barrels ( Gb ) greater than my estimate due mainly to more optimistic assumptions about OPEC reserves , the peak production date remains at 2008 .
This shows that an additional 250 Gb of recoverable oil reserves does not change the peak oil date and instead increased production rates occur later as indicated by the green line below .
Additional reserves and the related production from prospective areas such as the arctic , Iraq , and Brazil 's Santos basin are highly unlikely to produce another peak but should decrease the production decline rate after 2012 .

World Liquids Production
The definition of oil used by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) also includes natural gas liquids ( NGL ) , bio-fuels , processing gains and other liquids derived from natural gas and coal .
OPEC NGLs were supposed to cause a significant net increase in world NGLs but this has not happened yet as NGL production is struggling to exceed 8 mbd .
According to the EIA NGL data , 2007 production was 7.96 mbd , 2008 was 7.94 mbd and 2009 year to date was lower again at 7.80 mbd .
Although bio-fuels production has been growing exponentially , world liquids production has probably passed peak in July 2008 at 87.9 mbd as shown below .
In 2008 , US ethanol production was 0.6 mbd , Brazilian ethanol production was 0.4 mbd , and bio-fuels production outside the US and Brazil was 0.5 mbd .
The average oil price should stay below $ US 80 / barrel for the remainder of the year as average demand is forecast to be only slightly greater than supply from July 2009 to December 2009 .
Furthermore , OPEC is unlikely to cut supply further which reduces the upward pressure on oil prices .
Some recent evidence of increased demand is shown by US crude oil stocks dropping from a recent peak of 26.2 days at the end of April down to 25.5 days in early May .
However , oil prices could exceed $ 100 in late 2010 as world liquids production drops further .
High volatility of future oil prices is also expected due partly to delays in investment causing future oil capacity additions to decline sharply to 2012 .

Sources of Future Liquids Production
There are many sources of future liquids production but it is highly unlikely that production from these sources will cause liquids production to increase above its July 2008 peak because the cumulative declines from existing crude oil production sources are too great .
Key sources of future production are future discoveries .
The chart below , from Colin Campbell 's newsletter , shows that annual discoveries have been decreasing since the mid 1960s .
It also shows that production has exceeded discoveries since 1984 which is clearly unsustainable .
Campbell also forecasts future discoveries to be 110 billion barrels ( Gb ) which is also the number assumed for the forecasts in Fig 2 above .
Fig 4 - World Oil Discoveries and Production , excluding Extra Heavy , Deepwater and Polar Oil - click to enlarge
Jean Laherrere also produced a discovery and production chart below from his 2008 presentation .
Future discoveries , represented by the area under the dashed green line , are about 120 Gb being slightly higher than Campbell 's estimate .
Laherrere 's discovery curve includes deepwater discoveries and also indicates that production peaked in 2008 .
Many of these future discoveries are likely to be either deepwater or in arctic regions .
These discoveries may be significant but the time between discovery and first oil can easily be ten years which will probably not change the peak production year of 2008 but should lessen the future production decline rate .
Fig 5 - World Oil Discoveries and Production , excluding Extra Heavy Oil - click to enlarge
The arctic region is prospective for both oil and gas but quantities need to be estimated .
Jean Laherrere estimated that the ultimate recoverable oil reserves are about 40 Gb while Colin Campbell estimates 52 Gb .
There was a panel presentation at the 2009 Offshore Technology Conference ( OTC.09 ) which discussed arctic energy challenges .
One of the speakers was from Wood Mackenzie who confirmed that the arctic was prospective but mainly for gas not for oil .
A report by Wood Mackenzie and Fugro Robertson estimated that the arctic will produce only about 3 percent of the world 's oil and that arctic oil production , at best , would peak at 3 mbd several decades from now .
Future production from the arctic region should help decrease future oil production decline rates but will probably not change the peak oil production year from 2008 .
Fig 6 - World Arctic Cumulative Discovery Oil and Gas - click to enlarge
Other regions considered prospective are the US outer continental shelf ( OCS ) and Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) .
( Please note that the oil production potential of ANWR has also been included in the discussion above of the arctic ) .
At this OTC.09 panel presentation on energy challenges , there was much discussion about allowing further drilling on the OCS and the ANWR .
The American Petroleum Institute ( API ) was represented by its CEO at the panel and the API recently released this ICF report detailing potential reserves and future production from currently restricted areas in the OCS and the ANWR .
This report concluded that an additional 1.1 ( middle case ) to 2.0 mbd ( alternative case ) of oil production , the majority from ANWR , might be possible by 2030 if drilling was allowed in these restricted areas .
This additional production would benefit the US but would not change the peak oil date of 2008 .

Canada often states that its oil reserves are almost 180 Gb .
However , it is critical that 173 Gb of these reserves relate to oil sands which are not easy to produce .
The chart below is from a recent presentation by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and indicates the potential of Canada 's total oil production to reach over 4 mbd by 2020 .
The forecast indicated by the red line in Figure 2 assumes that Canada oil sands production will reach a maximum of 2 mbd .
Oil sands production was 1.2 mbd in 2007 and the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) is forecasting 2009 oil sands production to be slightly greater at 1.34 mbd.
David Hughes , a Canadian geologist estimates that oil sands production will stay below 2.5 mbd due to constraints on natural gas , water and diluents .
Oil sands production may reach 2.5 mbd but will not change the peak oil year .
Fig 8 - Canada Oil Sands Production Forecast to 2020 - click to enlarge
A promising area of future liquids production is the Santos basin , offshore Brazil .
There are technical challenges , explained during a Petrobras OTC.09 presentation , with the pre-salt discoveries such as very high pressures and temperatures but Petrobras is optimistic about the Santos basin , stating that this basin may almost double Petrobras ' oil reserves .
This implies that the Santos basin could hold as much as 15 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
However , it is always important to focus on the potential future production rates in addition to the size of the reserves .
The Tupi field was discovered in November 2007 in the Santos basin and an extended well test ( EWT ) started in early May at a rate of 15 thousand barrels per day ( kbd ) , to be increased to 30 kbd by the end of 2009 .
The Tupi EWT will run for about 16 months to better understand the flow characteristics of the pre-salt reservoir .
If this EWT performs well , then a pilot test of 100 kbd should start in late 2010 .
If the pilot test is satisfactory then plans for full scale commercial production would be implemented .
However Petrobras CFO expects a long ramp up period with Tupi peaking at over 200 kbd at the earliest in 2017 .
A Wood MacKenzie analyst predicted that Tupi could peak at around 1 mbd in 2022 which appears significant but Petrobras will need this increased production from the Santos basin to maintain total production at 2 mbd .
The reason is that declines from existing offshore fields are about 10 % or 0.2 mbd per year as confirmed by the Petrobras CFO .
Future production from the Santos basin will benefit Brazil but will probably have only a negligible impact on the world production past 2012 ( see Fig 2 above ) .

Iraq is perhaps the most promising country in the world for future potential oil production .
However , it has not been an attractive country for investment not just because of terrorism but also the lack of petroleum legislation which includes national revenue sharing from the oil fields of the semi-autononous region of Kurdistan .
The chart below shows that Iraq 's production might reach 8 mbd by 2020 if sufficient investment was available , peace prevailed and satisfactory petroleum legislation was passed .
The ultimate recoverable reserves of oil of 130 Gb is based upon Laherrere 's 2003 analysis .
Colin Campbell had originally forecast 4.5 mbd being reached by 2014 but now has revised that lower to 2.65 mbd in his June 2008 newsletter .
In mid May 2009 , the former Iraq oil minister said that Iraq 's output could reach 4 mbd by 2014 and 7 mbd by 2019 if satisfactory petroleum legislation is passed in 2010 .
My forecast , shown by the red line in Fig 2 , assumes that Iraq will produce 2.7 mbd in 2012 .
If the former Iraq oil minister 's predictions become true then future production may be closer to the green line in Fig 2 rather than the red line .
The peak oil year of 2008 would be unchanged .

The application of advanced technology on existing discoveries is often thought to have potential for increasing production rates and recovery factors .
The first production wells developed were vertical then horizontal wells became common practice .
Next maximum reservoir contact wells were used for some reservoirs .
Finally extreme reservoir contact wells , graphically illustrated below , are being researched by Saudi Aramco in an effort to boost recovery efficiencies .
Generally , more horizontal laterals in a production well allows faster extraction of the oil but at the expense of higher production decline rates later .
This recent Uppsala University report on decline rates of giant oil fields stated the following :
The important conclusion is that higher decline rates must be applied to giant fields that enter decline in the future .
Prolonged plateau levels and increased depletion made possible by new and improved technology result in a generally higher decline rates .
Detailed case studies of giant oilfields suggest that technology can extend the plateau phase , but at the expense of more pronounced declines in later years .
In conclusion , this analysis shows that the average decline rate of the giant oil fields have been increasing with time , reflecting the fact that more and more fields enter the decline phase and fewer and fewer new giant fields are being found .
The increase is in part due to new technologies that have been able to temporarily maintain production at the expense of subsequent more rapid decline .
Growing average decline rates have also been noted by IEA ( 2008 ) .
The difference between using a constant decline in existing production and an increasing decline rate is significant and could mean as much of a difference of 7 Mb/d by 2030 .
There are other technologies such as injection to increase pressure in the reservoir .
Natural gas , water , nitrogen and carbon dioxide injection can all help to maintain reservoir pressure and production rates .
In 2008 , Saudi Aramco injected a massive 13.7 mbd of water to maintain reservoir pressure so that 8.9 mbd oil could be produced .
Fracing or fracturing the reservoir formation is another technology which can help increase production rates .
The fracing can be done by forcing fluid into the formation causing fractures which are held open by special frac sand .
Acid can also be used for fracing as the acid can dissolve some of the rock and increase permeability .
New technologies can extract the oil faster but can the recovery factor be increased ?
Schlumberger has stated that the average recovery factor for all reservoirs is about 35 % .
This BP study stated that the average global recovery factor is about 30 - 35 % based on 9,000 fields from the IHS Energy database .
Conversely , Saudi Aramco stated in its 2008 Annual Review that they are targeting recovery factors of 70 percent partly through the use of reservoir nano - bots known as Resbots .
These Resbots would be deployed with the fluids injected into a reservoir to record pressure , temperature and fluid type which could be retrieved later in an effort to increase recovery rates .
The OTC.09 Panel Presentation on Technology discussed the importance of technology and one of the presenters believed that technology will allow companies to recover over 3 trillion barrels of oil .
It appears that recovery factors can be increased by using new technology but the magnitude of the increase is not clear yet .
However , it is unlikely that the improved recovery factors will cause oil production to exceed its 2008 peak .
Fig 11 - Extreme Reservoir Contact Well - click to enlarge
Mexico's Cantarell field is an excellent example of the use of advanced technology to stimulate the production rate , followed later by a steep decline rate .
This field once produced over two million barrels per day ( mbd ) in 2004 and now production is less than one mbd with an annual production decline rate of over 30 % .
The chart below , from Matt Simmons ' OTC.09 peak oil presentation , shows the steep production decline continuing into 2009 .
In early 2000 , Pemex started using the technology of nitrogen gas injection to keep up pressure to increase production rates which was successful .
However , production began to decline after 2004 and Pemex drilled horizontal wells in 2006 in an effort to extract more oil .
These horizontal wells probably helped to slow the production decline rate .
These technologies of nitrogen injection and horizontal wells have helped to keep production rates high .
As the impact of these technologies weakens , the annual production decline rate has increased to over 30 % .
The expanding gas cap in the Cantarell dome continues to intersect more production wells which decreases the production rate leading to an expectation that Cantarell could become uneconomic as early as 2014 .

Implications
The future sources of liquids production discussed above will help decrease the future rate of decline but it is highly unlikely that the 2008 peak will be exceeded because there are not enough countries with increasing oil production able to offset those countries with decreasing oil production .
IEA oil supply warnings have been made in late 2008 when chief economist Birol said that the world needs the equivalent of four new Saudi Arabias just to maintain existing production to 2030 .
In April 2009 , IEA 's executive director Tanaka said that the world may face a crude oil shortage by 2013 .
As world oil production declines , consumption must also decline .
Consequently , action must be taken now to reduce oil consumption and switch to alternative renewable energy sources .
These sources include electricity generation from wind turbines , photovoltaic panels and geothermal sources .
Other sources might be ocean energy which includes tidal energy , wave energy , thermal energy and ocean algae biofuels .
Ocean thermal energy conversion was the subject of an OTC.09 panel discussion .
The IEA has recently published some recommendations to improve energy efficiency which apply not just to individuals but also to industry .
For example , in the transport sector , the IEA is encouraging the use of fuel efficient tires and introducing mandatory fuel efficiency standards for light duty vehicles .
In addition , this IEA document , called Energy Efficiency Policy , also encourages energy efficiency by providing links to almost 30 documents containing energy efficiency policies .
One of these documents called Saving Oil in a Hurry suggests many conservation actions including increased use of public transit , car - pooling , telecommuting and speed limit restrictions .
For further information , the IEA has its own energy efficiency web page .
This recent Oil Drum story proposes many oil conservation ideas for individuals such as moving to a walkable neighbourhood and trading in your car for one with better mileage .
There is no simple solution to the problem of declining world oil production .
A simultaneous multipronged approach will emerge which not only addresses oil conservation but also the development of alternative renewable energy sources .
As oil production declines , a possible solution is to secure long term oil supply contracts ahead of the next oil price shock .
China has been securing long term oil supplies from Russia , Venezuela and Iran .
As oil remains critical for economic activity there is a high probability that some countries will act more aggressively in securing oil supplies , even to the extent of oil resource wars .
In mid May 2009 , Russia raised the prospect of war to enforce its claims on Arctic oil and gas riches .

May 12 , 2009  --
As President Bush 's top lawyer , Alberto Gonzales pressed counterterror officials to use brutal interrogation techniques on terror suspect Abu Zubaydah in 2002 , even when those techniques hindered Zubaydah 's cooperation , a former FBI agent who was present is expected to testify Wednesday before Congress .
In the first public testimony of anyone directly involved , former bureau agent Ali Soufan is expected to directly contradict assertions by CIA officials and former Vice President Cheney that the " enhanced interrogation techniques " were successful in prying information out of al Qaeda detainees .
Cheney has said that the CIA interrogation program that began in Thailand in 2002 " saved thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives . "
Soufan , a star FBI agent fluent in Arabic and English , met Abu Zubaydah in Thailand , just days after the al Qaeda suspect was captured after a gun battle in Pakistan .
Zubaydah was then the most important operative captured after the 9/11 attacks .
The U.S. government selected Soufan and another FBI agent , Steve Gaudin , because they were considered experts at getting al Qaeda suspects to crack .
Soufan will testify that within an hour of Abu Zubaydah 's arrival at the secret prison , he was revealing parts of the 9/11 plot and had identified the mastermind , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Soufan has contended publicly that the FBI approach to interrogation had been so successful , George Tenet ordered that the gravely ill Zubaydah be kept alive .
According to a former intelligence operative at the scene , Zubaydah 's confessions and intelligence collected by Soufan and Gaudin resulted in the CIA determining that " death was not an option " for the prisoner .
Tenet wanted Zubaydah kept alive , and to continue talking .
A top Johns Hopkins surgeon was flown in to treat Zubaydah , and the two FBI agents helped nurse the terrorist into good health .
The former operative tells ABC News that the intelligence continued to flow , as Soufan interviewed Zubaydah in the hospital while tending to his recovery .
But that all ended when the CIA 's team of specialists and a contractor arrived to take over interrogations .
The CIA Takes Over
When Mitchell arrived in Thailand , a source tells ABC News , the CIA ordered Soufan to follow the psychologist 's plan for interrogation .
It was , Soufan will tell the Senate , a big mistake .
Soufan intends to testify that most of the useful intelligence from Abu Zubaydah came well before the CIA interrogation team even arrived in Thailand .
Soufan is said to be angry and mystified , eight years later , that Washington overruled him and his team during interrogations of Zubaydah , and handed the reins over to Mitchell .
The CIA has defended its interrogation program as lawful and productive , citing the arrest of so - called Dirty Bomber Jose Padilla , and identifying Mohammed as the result of brutal regimen .
Mitchell has refused to comment about his involvement in the CIA interrogation program , telling ABC News that " I have a non-disclosure agreement that will not allow me to comment . "
Click here to see Mitchell refusing to talk to ABC News .
White House Role
" It was imposed upon us , " says the source .
" And not only [ at CIA ] headquarters , they were getting requests specifically from the White House . "
According to an intelligence officer involved in Abu Zubaydah 's interrogation , Mitchell had " no idea about intelligence , no idea about interrogations , no idea about interviews . "
" Who the hell authorizes these things ? "
Soufan reportedly asked the chief CIA officer in Thailand , as Mitchell began stripping the prisoner and blasting him with music from the Red Hot Chili Pepppers .
Tactics Bred Resistance
Mitchell used a program that he told those present was called " force continuum , " an ascending interrogation program that began with forced nudity , followed by loud music and white noise , temperature manipulation and sleep deprivation for up to 48 hours .
According to one officer on the scene , Mitchell said the program was a " strategic approach to diminish his ability to resist " the interrogators .
Soufan , will testify that Zubaydah did n't begin resisting until Mitchell began his tactics , according the source familiar with his upcoming testimony .
So , Soufan blew the whistle .
According to a Department of Justice inspector general report , Soufan told his superiors at FBI headquarters that Mitchell 's interrogation was " borderline torture " and told FBI superiors that he wanted to arrest Mitchell for the treatment of Zubaydah .
Each step of the Mitchell regimen failed , according to the source present at the time .
Afterwards ,
The CIA would ask Soufan and his FBI partner to start interrogating Zubaydah again .
" They asked , ' Why does the information stop ? ' " said the source .
" We go in again and we have him re-engage again , and we start producing information . "
Mitchell then wanted to resume control of the interrogation , telling Soufan , " Now we can do it in a way that we really can break him . "
Soufan told Mitchell and others that he was " 100 percent sure it was going to fail . "
" Could n't Even Dream "
Former Vice President Cheney has requested that two intelligence reports that he said came from the CIA interrogation program be declassified , saying that the reports will prove that water boarding worked .
Soufan , according to a source , does n't buy it .
Soufan intends to tell the Senate on Wednesday that he " could n't even dream that the United States would do something like that . "

His book , about the CIA rendition program , will be published later this year by Simon & Schuster .

Back in April , the Department of Energy issued a Notice of Intent of its plans to use stimulus money to fund smart grid projects .
In order to get things moving quickly , the DOE had a short timeframe for public comments .
Nevertheless , a variety of companies and groups provided their input before the deadline , and the DOE has already acted to implement some of their suggestions .
We 've gone through some of the feedback provided to the DOE and talked with Loraine Hariton , Director for Public Policy at Echelon and part of the Demand Response and Smart Grid ( DRSG ) Coalition , to get some feel for how the industry views the DOE 's proposed funding .
According to Hariton , the focus of the feedback , both from her organization and others , is to help ensure that the DOE spends its money in a way that 's more consistent with the overall goals .
" We 're saying ' Let 's enable what the stimulus package is trying to do , " she said , " let 's focus on that . "
And , while there is some obvious self - interest and difference in focus , that seems to be a reasonably accurate statement .
There was almost uniform agreement on one aspect of the NOI : the ceiling on grants , capped at $ 20 million , was too small to provide the sort of major infrastructure investments that the stimulus was ostensibly designed for .
As a result , Monday saw Steven Chu announce that the cap had been raised to $ 200 million .
Demonstration projects also got a raise , going from a $ 40 million cap to $ 100 million .
This should go a long way towards enabling larger deployments .
Another major issue , highlighted both by Google and the DRSG , was that the NOI had little in the way of assurances that smart grid hardware would actually wind up in the hands of consumers ( both individuals and institutions ) .
There 's a degree of self - interest in this , as the DRSG contains a number of hardware makers , and Google 's focus on displaying data to consumer - level users mean that its smart grid efforts need hardware in place before there 's anything to display .
Still , the administration has apparently promised to have 40 million smart meters in place , and the DOE 's stimulus spending provides no obvious path for getting there .
Things are a bit more complex when it comes to interoperability requirements .
Google simply wants them in place , since the company would be happier if it could interface with all the data it wants to obtain via a single method .
The DRSG is afraid that the standards that the DOE proposed to use are currently a work - in - progress ; that concern is shared by the GridWise Alliance , which is somewhat ironic , given that the DOE had initially proposed to use standards developed by GridWise .
The DOE has since announced that it will be going with standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and technology .
It 's not clear that this step will make anyone happier , as the NIST also calls its standards a work - in - progress , and is using a Wiki to develop them .
Both the DRSG and GridWise argue that a number of problems arise from the tendency of the DOE 's proposal to treat the whole thing as a way of gathering information .
" This comes from the fact that the office of electricity , which wrote this , is a very small office of only four people , " Hariton told Ars , " and it 's staffed by people who think from a scientific standpoint , and asked for a lot of information as if they 're science experiments . "
Part of the issue is that we should be past this already ; the DRSG notes that " pilots have been done on most aspects of smart grid , in particular customer acceptance and participation .
Proven technologies are available . "
But there are also some complaints about specific requirements .
For example , GridWise argued that some disclosures expected as conditions of funding may reveal proprietary business information or go against security best practices .
The DRSG notes that an expectation that programs randomize deployments across their customers would make it much more expensive to roll out the communications networks needed for smart grid devices .
Finally , there are issues regarding some of the proposed work with demand - response management and variable pricing .
These often require approval by local or state utility boards , and the DOE does n't allow for any mechanism for navigating what might be overlapping requirements .
Still , Hariton emphasized that it would be unrealistic to expect a perfect document on the first pass .
She said that she recalled that , last year , the group that formulated the NOI had a budget of $ 160 million , so this represents a radical change for them .
Still , the document they produced is apparently a decent foundation .
" I think this was a first draft , " Hariton said , " they 're moving in the right direction , and we hope that this will all come back as a more effective document . "

As the presumable kabbalistic ben Yosef ( Video - German ) , his task will be to pave the road for the Jewish Messiah , ben David , through " Armageddon " .
I have written much more on Putin´s Freemasonry - i.a. quoting you .

Now former John Scarlett pupils ran a blog " John Scarlett : The Eggman " http://johnscarlett.blogspot.dk/2006/12/john-scarlett-eggman.html .
This blog brings a comment on 9 Febr. 2007 at 1:57 o´clock from a person calling himself " Anonymous " claiming to have been initiated to anoint Vladimir Putin , who in 1979 was chosen to be the Illuminati Antichrist .
Anonymous anointed Putin in 1993 - and " left the Royal Arch in 1994 ″ .
However the anointer claims that after Putin was anointed , his career sped upwards - and that only began in 1994 !
At that time Putin had been through a severe Royal Arch brainwashing - acc. to Tomlinson .
In your latest post , today 13 Oct. 2018 https://www.henrymakow.com/2018/10/the-reasons-for-anti-semitism.htm you write that Vladimir Putin is a Royal Arch Mason .
This is correct , of course , but nevertheless a rather superficial description of what that man is .
You mention John Scarlett - also called the Eggman - who was both Tomlinsin´s and Putin´s teacher , the MI6 , MI5 and the KGB agents being educated together .
I am a frequent reader of your blog - and often use material from your blog on my blog new.euro - med.dk .
I think Tomlinson 's website falls into the category of what Hoffman and Heimbichner call Revelation of the Method .
The alchemical processing of the Group Mind proceeds apace whether the revelations are true , co-intel pro or whackjob tell - alls .
Its all the same .
When the Minister for Health can apologize to the victims of Jimmy Savile in the House of Parliament and acknowledge that ' we ' - the establishment - have let you down badly
I think we must draw the conclusion that the revelations of Savile 's activities ( of which I am sure we know very little ) are not the prime fact of matter .
Neither is the failure , incompetence , negligence of the relevant authorities .
What the Savile story reveals is the vertical integration of every aspect of British society ( rather like the pyramid on the M16 logo ) and that the psychopathic control grid , under and through which all authorities in every institution operate : is total .
Here is a man , Savile , who had access across the board to every institution in British society and to every authority in Britain .
He committed atrocities in all the institutions he visited , stayed and ' patroled ' .
Five decades of multiple , congruent victim reports and outraged staff who caught him - even in the act - to the relevant authorities failed to curtail his activities .
In his last BBC interview he was bragging ' I got away with it . '
Imagine being a doctor or a forensic with a position of authority in a place like the Broadmoor hospital and knowing that Savile has clearance to regularly visit and stay at your hospital for his ' charity work ' .
Imagine that you know for a fact - one of his activities in your hospital is his necrophilia in the morgue - and you are prevented from interfering with his visit or activities in any way .
The police are not interested in any report .
The press hangs up on you .
Your MP does not return your calls .
That was the deal with Savile , he was absolutely teflon .
And he bragged on American television how he brought a girl to Prince Phillip at night in Buckingham Palace .
With Savile , how far does it go ?
Frankly - I think the revelations of his pedophilia and necrophilia are only on the surface of his activities which were so important [ wicked ] that the entire establishment covered for him .
" We know ... that the whole world ( aion ) is seated in the power of wickedness and the evil one " 1 John 4:19
Once upon a time , that idea was fairly abstract and hazy in terms of whatever authority was in the tier above your social level .
Now it is crystal clear .
Decency and morality begin to appear the farther down the social pyramid you go .
And this is the ground that must be occupied and held at all costs .
Thank you for your work helping to identify the psychopathic control grid and de-program your Jewish and Gentile readers .

“ Vitrik . ”
That ’s the name of the patented coating that allows the Nottage G - 1 pool table to be a pool table .
Made of toughened glass , the table ’s surface with the Vitrik coating on it mimics the rolling resistance of felt , meaning that although it looks like you ’re just playing on glass , the balls behave as though they ’re on a regular felt surface with slate underneath .
The rest of the table looks slick but is built entirely to competition specs , with the possible exception of a rather creative ball return system .
The G - 1 pool table is also available with a frosted top that can be lit from below to make the entire surface softly glow .
The base price of the table is about $ 25,000 which , while it seems like a lot , is apparently not too terribly expensive compared to other high quality pool tables .

weird things talks to the bad astronomer
Weird
Things talks to Phil Plait about astronomy , skepticism , and correcting people who are wrong on the internet .
If you read popular science blogs , then you ’ve probably heard of Phil Plait , aka the Bad Astronomer ; scientist , author , blogger , lecturer , skeptic and the president of the James Randi Educational Foundation dedicated to exposing pseudoscience and famously offering a $ 1 million reward for demonstrable proof of the paranormal .
By now , he ’s covered everything from Moon landing hoaxes to the anti-vaccination campaigns in Australia and the U.S. as well as big news about space exploration and astronomy .
Earlier today , I got the chance to talk to Dr. Plait about his thoughts on popular science and skepticism .
Q : What motivated you to start the Bad Astronomy blog ?
A : Oh the fame and fortune …
But seriously , I was ticked off by people saying silly things about astronomy , so I started writing posts back in 1993 and eventually got the [ bad astronomy ] domain .
Basically , I started writing for the same reason any skeptic starts writing .
We see something is n’t right and we feel compelled to try and correct it with something real .
Q : What do you think of the recent increase of scientists with blogs ?
A : I ’m really glad to see more scientists out there doing blogging .
Many newspapers and magazines started losing readers and I ’ve seen cases where lots of science writers have been let go .
There used to be dozens of reporters covering astronomy conventions , now it ’s a big deal if there are twelve of them there .
Half the people covering [ these events ] are bloggers .
I ’m also glad to see medical doctors blogging , especially because of the whole anti-vaccination issue .
The most devoted anti-vaxers are out there , telling people not to vaccinate their kids and we see a lot of preventable diseases coming back , and babies are dying because of it .
So it ’s good that doctors with that kind of expertise can weigh in on the vaccination debate .
And of course , scientists trying to reach out and inform the public is definitely something I like seeing .
Q : How did you get involved with JREF ?
How did you become the organization ’s president ?
A : Through sheer bravado .
I knew about Randi since I was a teenager and was always interested in what he did .
When I wrote my first book , we were looking for people to provide blurbs for the cover and we thought that it would be good to get a review from a skeptic .
So I got in touch with Randi , told him that I wrote a book and if he could read it and let me know what he thinks that would be great .
He replied that yes , he would .
Then , soon after that , he e-mailed me and asked if I would n’t mind giving a lecture at a conference he was having .
I said I ’d do it and spoke at what became the first Amazing Meeting .
Randi kept inviting me back again and again and one day asked if I wanted to become the president of JREF .
I told him I had nothing else to do and agreed .
Q : What do you think of the sentiment that skeptics are also very cynical ?
A : That ’s not true at all .
A skeptic is just someone who wants evidence for a claim .
It just means to doubt , not to outright reject .
For example , if you were to come to me and tell me that UFOs are coming to Earth and aliens are kidnapping you in the middle of the night and sticking things up your butt , I would ask if you had any proof .
Do you have videos , pictures , or alien devices with the right isotopes ?
And it would be the same exact story if a scientist came to me and said that Milky Way was eating another galaxy .
I would ask if he had star maps or if he had the right data .
If you ’re a real scientist , you would of course have real evidence .
So it works both ways , for science and for non-science .
A cynic just outright denies whatever evidence he has .
I try to examine the evidence .
I ’ve examined hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence , it ’s just that none of that evidence turned out to be any good .
I do not accept eyewitness testimony because people are very unreliable when it comes to extraordinary events and the fuzzy videos and blurry pictures … they ’re just really not convincing at all .
Q : What motivates you to keep doing what you do ?
A : It ’s a couple of things .
One is to make sure that people appreciate reality for what it is .
The universe is cool enough for us not to have to make things up about it .
One practical reason [ to keep writing ] is because people who believe something that is n’t true could harm themselves or deny themselves medicine , or if they thought they could talk to the dead , went to a psychic and interrupted the normal grieving process .
And it just ticks me off when I see people constantly spreading stuff that is n’t true .
Another reason comes once a week when people e-mail me to say “ thank you for doing what you ’re doing , I used to believe this or that and now I see what ’s really going on ” or tell me they want to go back to school and study astronomy because of a Hubble picture I put up .
To know that I have an effect like that on some people is just awesome .
Q : What do you dislike about doing what you do ?
A : It ’s heartbreaking to read stories of people who believed something and messed up their lives .
And when babies are dying because people are listening to anti-vaxers …
That ’s just really the worst thing in the world to read about .
It ’s also very hard to keep up with everything .
There are only so many hours in a day and between blogging and being the president of JREF and being a father , a lot of things that deserve attention slip by or I ca n’t get to it fast enough and it has to wait .
It can get kind of frustrating , especially when there are lots and lots of deadlines that I have to meet .
I have multiple issues that I need legal help and advice on .
Customer Question
I was the web developer ...
I have multiple issues that I need legal help and advice on .
I was the web developer for a company from September of 2008 to April of 2009 .
I was their only IT professional on site and had to wear " multiple hats " to do my job at a very reduced pay rate ( no benefits ) with hours worked both on - site and from home totaling over 80 - 90 hours per week to conduct my job productively .
Under no circumstances , even with trying to work something out , did the owner of the company have any interest in providing reasonable concession to me so that I could reduce the hours worked in order for me to be able to continue to work there .
When it became clear that I could do nothing further with the company , I made the decision to resign .
Now , note : while I was there , there were health code violations that did effect my health but I have had no resources or insurance to actually go more than see a doctor for the very expensive tests involved ( more than $ 1000 ) to show that my workplace was effecting my health .
Secondly , the owner of this company consistently made lewd jokes about things that I made clear I did n't like to be around , and worse also started to obsess over my own wife making comments about her to me directly ( even in front of his own emotionally battered wife ) and even eventually giving my wife improper gifts with said comments .
That amongst sever incompetence at managing a business caused me to fear my future , career , health , and well being , by staying there and I decided to leave .
That should have been the end of it .
Instead , I am now being retaliated against for quitting my at - will job , reporting their office to OSHA , and also now being retaliated against further for filing unemployment benefits claims that were approved when they found I was working in a hostile work environment based on the evidence I provided the state department .
This individual continues , even to this day , to threaten me with legal action and has claimed to have contacted the " FBI IT criminal division and DA office " for supposed sabotage and extortion , of which I have nothing to do with .
This individual is bullying me into doing additional work for him for free .
That is the only goal here outside of his personal enjoyment at my distress .
This individual also has violated federal labor laws and also has not paid my final paycheck in full as additional retaliation for resigning my position .
I signed no contracts with this person , nor am I under any obligations to his company for any work left undone .
I need to seek advice on what the heck I can do here to stop all of this .
I have a right to live my life and get on with my life .
That is what I intended to do when I left that job .
Yet he somehow things he owns me .
I have been having trouble sleeping because of all of this and I am about to collapse and end up in the hospital anyway because of all the undue stress from this .
I need help with this somehow right away as I need to separate myself from this and not feel threatened or bullied by this man any further .
I start a new job very soon .
but now I fear that once he finds out where I work ( he runs my credit without my permission periodically ) he will harass me there and call my employers with further lies if he has n't already done so to other prospective employers in my job hunt thus far ( I mysteriously had a job offer declined days after it was offered to me and I , at the final interview , was told they will be contacting all references and past employers ) .
Do you know of any actual criminal complaints I could file with law enforcement ?
It is very bad how little an employee is protected here in the states .
This guy has claimed to me on multiple occasions that he is above the law and he would easily ruin me if I quit .
So far what I have seen , that can be the case .
Additional information , his most recent harassing and bullying e-mail makes claims that he is going to sue me for " your all salary we paid you plus our business loss of $ 500,000 Plus etc. " ( he does n't speak English very well )
And in this e-mail the employer cc'd a copy of this to what he claims is his lawyer ( lawyer in which I tried calling today to confirm that he is representing this employer , but he was out of the office ) .
Thanks

May 7 , 2009 Dear XXXXX XXXXX , Thank you for the opportunity to help you obtain the education of your choice .
As a student loan provider for the past 50 years , Citi has provided financial aid assistance to millions of students and parents nationwide .
Given the challenging economy and continued increases in the cost of higher education , it is critical that the U.S. student lending system serves the best interests of students and their families .
If you believe that competition and choice among student loan providers is valuable , you have an opportunity to make your voice heard .
Why Get Involved ?
The government budget outline proposes offering federal student loans solely through the federal government 's Direct Lending Program starting July of next year .
While this proposal will not impact a borrower 's ability to obtain a federal student loan , it will eliminate your ability to choose a student loan provider .
It will also substantially increase the national debt since each and every federally - insured student loan will be funded by the Federal Treasury through the issuance of treasury securities .
This proposal impacts you as a citizen - both as a taxpayer and as a borrower .
Why Does Competition And Choice Matter ?
Without private lender involvement through the Federal Family Education Loan Program , students and their families will not enjoy the benefits that competition has made possible for more than 40 years .
This competition has provided not only a choice of lenders , but also innovative products and services , such as : a variety of borrower benefits that lower your cost of borrowing
financial literacy programs that educate you on how to borrow responsibly
web - based tools and resources to advise you about your financing options
default prevention services to help you pay back your loans
Competition also has driven increased customer satisfaction as a result of the responsiveness , personal attention and on - campus support that student loan lenders have provided to borrowers and schools nationwide .
Make Your Voice Heard
If you value the ability to shop for , evaluate and choose your student loan provider , make your voice heard by contacting your Members of Congress and by signing one of the online petitions that support borrower choice and competition in federal student lending .
Sincerely , The Student Loan Corporation

Hotmail® has ever - growing storage !

This was my response :
Dear Citi ,
I do n't want choice of lender for its own sake , I want the lowest possible interest rate .
Under president Obama 's new plan for student lending all that will happen is that you will lose the ability to disperse taxpayer money for profit .
The fact that your corporation has the gall to send an e-mail asking me to do your lobbying for your government subsidized profit is incredible to me .
I am not your employee and I am not your agent .
I am a customer - debtor , I took your money not because I was pleased with your website , your corporate headquarters or your television advertising .
I took an educational loan from your corporation for one reason only , I needed the money and you offered the lowest interest rate .
If the federal government had offered me the money at I lower interest rate I would have taken the loan from the government instead of you .
Now after you have received a debt in my name that I cannot possibly remove except by full payment of principle and interest , due to the lobbying efforts of you and your fellow bankers to change bankruptcy laws to make student debt non-dischargeable , you want me to call congress on your behalf , I belief that your corporation has misinterpreted our relationship .
You want to maintain all of your subsidized profit after receiving $ 300 billion dollars last November in federal bailout funds , you probably want to keep making subprime junk loans as well .
Well the times are changing right here , right now and you are no longer in charge .
I will continue my efforts to contact my representatives to encourage them to pass President Obama 's student loan reform .
Thank you for the list of representatives but I already have that information bookmarked in my web browser .
Furthermore , I 'm formally requesting that you no longer send me any messages of this particular nature .
Please continue to contact me with account information , payment schedules , deferment offers and other electronic mail appropriate to our business relationship .
I however find your message requesting grassroots phone banking on my part personally offense .
Again I must reiterate please do not send me messages of this particular type ever again .
From an angered customer ,
XXX XXXXX
The Unmitigated gall of these Assholes to try to make me a toll of their lobbying effort !
I 'm so pissed that I will be forwarding this message to my member of congress and Senators , and telling them to again support President Obama 's Student Loan Reforms .
Please
Do the same :
congress
Senate
Update Wow the Rec List First time for me .
You know what we need , a restriction on the lobbying efforts of TARP .
The 1st amendment is for people , not government subsidized megabanks .
Credit where its due Lib Stone 's diary on the same spam from last thursday .
The Guardian obtained this footage of Ian Tomlinson at a G20 protest in London shortly before he died .
It shows Tomlinson , who was not part of the demonstration , being assaulted from behind and pushed to the ground by baton - wielding police guardian .co.uk
The police officer seen on a video by millions of people assaulting a man at the G20 protests minutes before he died will be questioned by investigators today after coming forward last night .
The territorial support group officer identified himself to his manager and the Independent Police Complaints Commission as fresh pictures suggested he had removed his shoulder number and covered his face with a balaclava before hitting Ian Tomlinson with a baton and pushing him to the ground last week .
But the officer has not been arrested on suspicion of assault or suspended from duty by the Metropolitan police .
He came forward along with several other police officers shown in the video obtained by the Guardian after a day of developments which saw :
• The IPCC reverse its decision to allow City of London police officers to investigate the death .
• A second postmortem examination ordered as the IPCC confirmed it would conduct a criminal investigation .
• Several top - level crisis meetings inside Scotland Yard .
• The Crown Prosecution Service liaising with the IPCC over possible charges .
• The emergence of Channel 4 footage taken from another angle which clearly shows the riot squad officer hitting Mr Tomlinson with his baton before pushing him to the ground .
The officer involved could face a manslaughter charge if a link is proved between the assault and Tomlinson 's fatal heart attack minutes later in Cornhill in the City of London .
" There is no excuse for what he did , " a senior police source told the Guardian , adding that at the very least he had committed a serious disciplinary offence and a criminal assault .
Scotland Yard said yesterday four
Met officers had come forward including one who had told his team leader that he was potentially involved in the assault .
Mr Tomlinson was on his way home at about 7.20 pm last Wednesday when he was hit with a baton and pushed to the ground by a riot officer near the Bank of England .
Witnesses suggest the attack , which was caught on film , was at least the second time police assaulted him .
At first the City police investigating the death said only that he died of natural causes , but the video footage forced the IPCC yesterday to review their role in the inquiry .
Deborah Glass , senior commissioner , said yesterday that as a result of the footage the watchdog was removing the investigation from City police and taking it over as a totally independent inquiry .
" People are rightly concerned about this tragic death and this footage is clearly disturbing , " she said as she announced that she had ordered a second postmortem on Mr Tomlinson .
The first found he had died of a heart attack , but neither the police nor the IPCC would reveal whether any marks suggesting an assault had been found on his body .
The family thanked the media for their help .
Jules Carey , their solicitor , said they now requested " that their privacy be respected while they come to terms with the tragic loss of Ian " .
There had been intense pressure on the IPCC to use its powers to conduct an independent investigation after the Guardian footage was released on Monday .
Brian Paddick , a former deputy assistant commissioner at the Met , had demanded that police be removed from the case and said any officer who struck the innocent passerby could face a manslaughter charge .
He said the officers from the City of London force would be key witnesses in the investigation .
" How can the City of London do the investigation independently ? " he asked .
" I 'm sorry but there are three City of London officers in that video , how can they do the investigation ?
" It certainly needs to be a full - blown criminal investigation ... [ into ] whether there is a provable link between the death and assault , because an assault is a criminal offence . "
Sir Paul Stephenson , the Met commissioner , said the images " raise obvious concerns " and his force fully supported an inquiry .
But he stopped short of suspending the officer involved pending the completion of the IPCC investigation .
Earlier Nick Hardwick , the IPCC chairman , demanded the officer seen in the footage first striking Tomlinson on the leg with a baton , and then shoving him from behind , should give himself up .
He made clear all officers " are required by the new standard of conduct for police officers to report any wrongdoing " .
" If that officer has an explanation it must be in his interest to come forward , " he said .
A source close to the IPCC said the issues for the investigation were : " Was an offence committed .
Secondly did it contribute to his later death .
Would that incident have caused the heart attack ? "
Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , said it was important the IPCC inquiry was completed as soon as possible , adding : " If it identifies the need for a criminal investigation then that also needs to be pursued . "
Support for The Pirate Bay does n't stop at the Swedish border , nor it is limited to blogs and forums .
Today , a group of Russian Pirate Bay supporters will throw a street party at Pushkin Square in the center of Moscow , with the full approval of the Russian government .
Pirate Bay supporters can be found everywhere .
Aside from tens of millions of ‘ regular ’ site users , there are other more prominent supporters too .
Novelist Paulo Coelho , who wrote the 65 million - selling book “ The Alchemist ” , is an avid supporter of the ‘ bay , and even offered to testify in their favor during their court case .
Today , in the Russian capital Moscow , there will be a street party thrown by fanatical Muscovite BitTorrent fans .
The event will be held in Pushkin Square and is symbolical of their support for The Pirate Bay Four , who will discover the court ’s decision from their copyright infringement trial tomorrow .
There will of course be entertainment at the event , including a live performance from independent musicians Simon and Shlimmer .
Open Wi-Fi will also be provided at the party which means that no one has to miss out on the latest torrent releases .
In Russia all public demonstrations have to be approved by the government .
Until recently the local authorities had refrained from issuing a permit , but luckily the event eventually got the green light .
The organizers of ‘ The Street Pirate Party ’ are confident that the final verdict in the trial will demonstrate the relevance of justice not only to The Pirate Bay , but also file - sharing as a whole .
“ The trial of the Pirate Bay is an excellent example of how ugly , stupid companies motivated only by their greed and inertia , want to prevent people sharing music , movies , or anything , on a purely altruistic basis , ” they said in a statement .
For those who are planning to join in and attend the event , please feel free to send us some pictures .
“ Support The Pirate Bay and its wooden prosthetic legs , ” say the organizers , “ take your own three cornered hat , parrot and do n’t forget your eyepatch .
Say Y ‘ aarrrr !!! ”
OPEC : World will pay for low oil prices by 2013
OPEC , the supplier of 40 percent of the world ’s crude oil , said low prices may lead to a supply crunch by 2013 and rejected consumers ’ arguments that cheap oil will help the world economy to recover .
“ If the current low - price environment persists , this short - term relief may not translate into long - term gains , ” OPEC Secretary Abdalla el - Badri said in an e-mailed statement today .
“ The failure of the industry to invest will result in a supply crunch by 2013 and beyond . ”
Badri was responding to Nobuo Tanaka , the executive director of the International Energy Agency , who was cited in yesterday ’s Financial Times as saying the global economy would get the equivalent of a $ 1 trillion stimulus if oil prices stayed at $ 40 a barrel this year .
The IEA advises 28 oil importing nations on energy policy .
Crude oil for April delivery rose $ 1.47 , or 3.4 percent , to $ 45.08 a barrel at 9:58 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are down 69 percent from the record $ 147.27 a barrel reached on July 11 .
Badri cautioned against a move by the U.S. to seize on the low prices in order to increase in taxes on petroleum fuels .
Such measures would increase the burden on consumers and may prompt oil - producing nations to reconsider investments to expand output capacity , he said .
Badri did n’t specify whether the 12 - member OPEC is likely to decide to cut production at March 15 meeting in Vienna .
“ It should be noted that the IEA ’s own demand forecasts have been continually revised down in recent months , ” he said , responding to Tanaka ’s call for OPEC to monitor the market “ carefully ” before deciding to cut supply again .
The group agreed on Dec. 17 on output constraints that would reduce supplies in January by 2.2 million barrels a day from December levels .
That followed pledges to remove 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of last year .
The 11 members with quotas were producing at a rate of 25.39 million barrels a day in February , according to Bloomberg estimates .
Their target is to produce 24.845 million barrels a day .
Iraq is allowed to produce at will .

Scores of internet scam artists are trying to cash in on the threat of a worldwide " swine flu " pandemic , according to the Better Business Bureau .
Linda Pasacreta , the president of the BBB in British Columbia , says hundreds of websites about swine flu , real and fake , have been created in the days since H1N1 started grabbing headlines .
" They 're trying to hit your wallet as fast as possible .
It 's amazing to see how fast they came out with websites , " Pasacreta said .
" Any time we see some panic , trauma , or emergency -- including hurricane Katrina -- scammers try to cash in on any top headline of the day . "
With issues of a potential pandemic of high global importance , scammers are trying to capitalize on people 's hunger for the latest news .
" It happens because people start Google searching for ways to protect themselves , " Pasacreta said .
" They do things that are very , very clever to catch people 's eyes . "
Some spam emails use celebrities to catch attention .
Two popular letters circulating have subject lines that read ' Madonna caught swine flu ' and ' Swine flu hits Hollywood . '
Opening the emails drives you to online pharmacies to order some vaccinations , emergency preparedness manuals and even " cure - alls " for the flu .
" Some of these promise masks and pharmacies are even running short of them .
People are promising things that do n't exist , " Pasacreta said .
The Better Business Bureau offers tips to keep you safe :
Do n't open an email from an unknown source
If you did n't ask for it do n't open it .
Just delete it
Visit the Canadian Centre for Disease Control website for accurate information
Do n't believe unbelievable headlines
Do n't believe in any ' cure - alls . '
Check out any claims with regulated agencies
Update your spyware and spamware
Pascreta warns that one particular spam email going around has malware which can contain a nasty virus that infects your computer .
" And that one is going to hit your wallet extra hard , " she said .
" Not only will the scam take your cash but you 're going to have to spring for a new hard drive too . "
In 2006 , soon after returning from military service in Ramadi , Iraq , during the bloodiest period of the war , Captain Matt Stevens of the Vermont National Guard began to have a problem with PTSD , or post - traumatic stress disorder .
Stevens 's problem was not that he had PTSD .
It was that he began to have doubts about PTSD : the condition was real enough , but as a diagnosis he saw it being wildly , even dangerously , overextended .
Preparations under way for first series of Doctor Who featuring Matt Smith as the Time Lord
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The BBC has appointed a new Doctor Who production team in preparation for the shooting of the first series featuring Matt Smith , the 11th incarnation of the Time Lord , later this summer .
BBC Wales , which is responsible for the Cardiff - based production , has appointed Tracie Simpson , producer of last weekend 's Easter special Doctor Who : Planet of the Dead , and Torchwood producer Peter Bennett to oversee the new series .
The new series producers both have previous experience as part of the Doctor Who production team .
In addition Beth Willis , the producer of BBC drama Ashes to Ashes , joins Doctor Who 's new showrunner Stephen Moffat and Piers Wenger , the BBC Wales head of drama , as an executive producer on the show .
Willis will also work across a range of other BBC Wales dramas .
The BBC described the appointment of the new team as the " start of a new chapter " for the hugely popular Doctor Who franchise .
Pre-production begins next month with shooting due to get under way in the summer around Cardiff .
" Tracie and Pete are the backstage stars of Doctor Who and having them on board as producers is n't just the best possible news for Matt Smith 's first series , it 's a massive relief , " said Moffat , the show 's lead writer and executive producer .
Wenger added : " In their time on the show , Tracie and Pete have worked miracles .
Joining forces with a talent like Beth will ensure that Doctor Who remains one of the most exciting and , frankly , formidable production teams around . "
Former EastEnders star Michelle Ryan starred alongside David Tennant in Saturday 's first Doctor Who special , Planet of the Dead .
Three more Doctor
Who specials will air this year as the swansong for Tennant as the Doctor and Russell T Davies – the executive producer and showrunner responsible for the sci - fi drama 's hugely successful revival in 2005 .

Giving free emergency contraceptive pills to girls and women may have reduced the number of abortions performed , the Auckland District Health Board says .
A six - month pilot programme , which cost $ 300,000 , ends tomorrow but the board said it was too early to say if offering the Levonelle 1 pill free at Auckland city pharmacies had had any effect on teen pregnancies .
The board 's planning and funding manager , Wendy Hoskin , indicated in a paper it may have affected the number of terminations performed at the board 's Epsom Day Unit , the region 's main abortion provider .
She said the number of abortions had dropped by 13 percent from October - December .
She said there could be a variety of reasons but early results showed a positive trend , The New Zealand Herald reported today .
However , the figures would need to be studied in more detail before it could be determined whether the pill project had really had an effect .

WASHINGTON  Hospitals and insurance companies said Thursday that President Obama had substantially overstated their promise earlier this week to reduce the growth of health spending .
Mr. Obama invited health industry leaders to the White House on Monday to trumpet their cost - control commitments .
But three days later , confusion swirled in Washington as the companies ’ trade associations raced to tamp down angst among members around the country .
After meeting with six major health care organizations , Mr. Obama hailed their cost - cutting promise as historic .
“ These groups are voluntarily coming together to make an unprecedented commitment , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Over the next 10 years , from 2010 to 2019 , they are pledging to cut the rate of growth of national health care spending by 1.5 percentage points each year  an amount that ’s equal to over $ 2 trillion . ”
Yep , here 's your everyman folks !
Lord knows if you let them " Queers " near your children they might catch " the gay " or something .
Joe the Plumber is a walking , talking troll .
That 's it .
Fuck this guy .
Jesus could hang with the prostitutes but this plumber can't let his kids anywhere near those " Queers . "
These people have n't lost enough ( politically ) yet .
I really , truly , deeply want to be above vindictive and petty politicking but shit like this just drives me up the goddamned wall .
Joe the Plumber was held up as some kind of exemplar of what we all are , or could be .
I 've got absolutely NOTHING against plumbers , but I 've got a laundry list of problems with Joe Wurzelbacher .
These people do n't just want to ban gay marriage .
They want to keep gays out of polite society .
They want the right to be bigoted , which they have , but they also demand that nobody call them on it .
Fuck that .
If one 's faith compels one to disassociate completely from one slice of God 's creation , well , that faith is simply fucked .
Your children , Joe , are going to meet the " Queers " more and more in life .
And the best part is that one day they 'll probably see them as just regular folks .
And you 'll have failed , because what you wanted for them was another generation of bigotry .

This video is afor anyone who wants to understand just how " effective " the Fed is at safeguarding taxpayer money .
Apparently nobody at the Federal Reserve haswhere the trillions of dollars that have come from the Fed 's expanded balance sheet have gone .
Additionally , nobody there seems to have any idea what the losses on the Fed 's $ 2 trillion portfolio really are .
As for the pittance of $ 9 trillion in Fed off - balance sheet transactions over the past 8 months , well , yeah , that 's also somewhere out there ...
Just do n't ask the Federal Reserve where .
Rep .
Alan Grayson summarizes it best " I am shocked to find out that nobody at the Federal Reserve is keeping track of anything .
" ( P.S. Zero Hedge uses the term " anyone " generically , with the presumption that the Fed 's Inspector General should traditionally receive most memos on memorandum items that deal with a dollar sign and +/- 12 zeros after it ) .
Reports indicate that domestic communications are monitored holistically , with computers searching for patterns among the metadata - think of subject lines in e-mails .
The NSA continues to work with telephone companies ; it has enlisted the cooperation of companies that operate major internet hubs , as a good chunk of foreign internet traffic flows through routers controlled by American companies .
NSA whistleblowers and anonymous officials have spoken of " thousands " of American citizens whose calls were monitored , although the NSA and CIA will not cop to those numbers .
The program expires at the end of 2009 , at which point the Obama administration is expected to mount a vigorous fight to reauthorize it in full .
The government , in a filing yesterday , argues that the Jewel will disclose state secrets if it proceeds , and that if such secrets are needed for the case to be litigated - i.e , to be argued on its merits -- it can not be litigated .
There is ample precedent for this argument .
As I 've written before , the state secrets privilege is one of the most powerful instruments of executive power .
There are no uniform standards for judges to use in order to determine whether the government is simply asserting the privilege because they 're embarrassed , or whether the privilege 's assertion really protects vital secrets .
Obama has criticized this lack of accountability , but his Justice Department has not figured out how to retract the privilege in a bevy of Bush - era cases without damaging the privilege itself - something they do n't want to do .
The government also makes a complex argument about sovereign immunity ; it argues that the case against particular persons performing their government jobs can't proceed unless Congress waives immunity .
Such immunity is being challenged elsewhere , but only , in this understanding , can a basic case asking for injunctive relief from the government proceed .
( Glenn Greenwald makes a persuasive case about why this assertion is fairly radical . )
Fine .
But that 's where the state secrets privilege is invoked .
Plaintiffs ' Complaint quite clearly seeks disclosure of whether or to what extent the Government may have utilized certain intelligence sources and methods after the 9/11 attacks in order to detect and prevent further attacks .
It also seeks disclosure of whether any of the alleged activities ( if they exist ) are ongoing . "
As the government notes , previous courts have given the executive branch the authority to determine whether such information would harm national security , requires judges to give the government the " utmost " deference , and does not even require the judge to assess the nature of the evidence in camera .
" ... the DNI has explained that the disclosure of information concerning whether or not plaintiffs have been subject to alleged NSA intelligence activity would inherently reveal NSA intelligence sources and methods . "
The government claims that the program under which the illegal " dragnet " is alleged to have occurred - the TSP - or the first Bush Terrorist Surveillance Program - is " no longer operative . "
But - the government claims - in order to prove that in court , it would have to disclose information about what the NSA is doing right now - and darn it , would n't you know , that 'd be a secret the government cannot do without .
The Government 's privilege assertion also precludes plaintiffs from establishing standing as to any statutory claim that may survive the Government 's motion to dismiss .
For each cause of action , plaintiffs must establish , as a threshold matter , that they have been " aggrieved " -- that is , subject to the alleged action being challenged .
Because plaintiffs cannot adduce proof that the content of their communications has been collected by the Government , or that their communications records likewise have been obtained by the Government , the most basic element of every claim -- their standing as " aggrieved persons " -- cannot be established .
It bears emphasis that plaintiffs ' allegation of a " dragnet " of surveillance by the NSA -- the alleged interception of communication content and records of millions of domestic and international communications made by ordinary Americans , see , e.g. Compl .
¶ 7 -- does not establish their standing .
Even if that allegation were sufficient to avoid dismissal on the
pleadings , plaintiffs would be required to demonstrate that they personally have been subject to the alleged communications dragnet , and the information relevant to doing so is properly protected by the state secrets privilege . "
Last week , President Obama signed legislation that limits the credit card industry ’s ability to raise rates , penalize late payers and issue credit cards to people under 21 .
As consumers , we are thrilled .
But as professional communicators , we believe that Congress and the White House have overlooked a simple innovation that could be as powerful as these reforms , if not more so .
Inspired by the Nutrition Facts label found on food packaging , we designed its equivalent for credit cards : an easy - to - understand chart that would simply and clearly lay out interest rates , card fees and payment terms so consumers could understand their accounts .
Just as Nutrition Facts help us make smart choices about food , Credit Card Facts would enable consumers to make informed choices about acquiring and using credit cards .
This is an example of the disclosure chart that has appeared on American credit card solicitations since 2000 .
A great idea at its inception , the box has been unable to keep up with our increasingly complex credit card offerings .
The type is too small , the headings are not prominent enough and many critical facts are buried in the fine print below the actual chart .
Unless credit card companies are told what they have to disclose and exactly how they have to disclose it , the consumer will still be drowned in text .
As Mr. Obama recently said , “ You should n’t need a magnifying glass or a law degree to read the fine print that sometimes does n’t even appear to be written in English . ”
Finally we have some hands - on info on the new Palm Pre courtesy of a Palm Pre forum member who gained some early hands - on time with the new smartphone .
The review says the Palm Pre feels great and solid but is kind of organic ?
The images of the screen blend well and you do n’t tell the difference when touching the phone or screen .
The slider mechanism is very simple and well balanced .
The keyboard was n’t a problem and the webOS seemed responsive although he would n’t say it was fast .
Anyway the reviewer managed to make an extremely short video of their time with the Palm pre which you can view below .
Destroying Pakistan to Make It Safe
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
PARIS —
The US keeps kicking hornet ’s nests around the globe and wondering why it continues getting stung .
The latest example : Pakistan ’s once beautiful Swat Valley has been turned into a battlefield .
Last week , Pakistan finally bowed to Washington ’s angry demands to unleash its military against rebellious Pashtun tribesmen of Northwest Frontier Province ( NWFP ) — who are collectively mislabeled " Taliban " in the west .
They are not the Afghan Taliban , but it ’s convenient for the western media and Pentagon to slap that label on them .
The Obama administration had threatened to stop $ 1.2 billion annual cash payments to bankrupt Pakistan ’s political and military leadership , and block $ 5.5 billion future aid , unless Islamabad sent its soldiers into Pakistan ’s turbulent NWFP along the Afghan frontier and crushed attempts to reestablish Islamic Law and autonomy .
Many people in the region want Islamic law because in utterly corrupt Pakistan it represents the only honest and swift judicial system .
The only other " law " available has to be bought .
Pakistan ’s army and air force claimed to have killed 1,000 " terrorists " ( read : mostly civilians ) and almost emptied the valley of its inhabitants .
UN sources now say the operation has created close to 2 million refugees .
Pakistan ’s armed forces , who are being paid by the US to fight Pashtun tribes , have scored a brilliant victory against their own people .
Too bad Pakistan ’s military does not manage to do as well in wars against India .
Blasting civilians at home , however , is much safer and more profitable .
Unable to pacify Afghanistan ’s Pashtun tribes ( again , lumped together as " Taliban " ) , a deeply frustrated Washington has begun tearing Pakistan apart in an effort to end Pashtun resistance in both nations .
CIA drone aircraft have so far killed over 700 Pakistani Pashtun .
Only 6 % were militants , according to Pakistan ’s media , the rest civilians .
Pashtun , also improperly called Pathan , are the world ’s largest tribal people .
Fifteen million live in Afghanistan , forming half its population .
Twenty - six million live right across the border in Pakistan .
Up to three million Afghan Pashtun are refugees in Pakistan .
True to their strategy of divide and rule , Britain ’s imperialists split the Pashtun by an artificial border , the Durand Line ( which became today ’s Afghan - Pak border ) .
Pashtun reject this artificial border .
Many Pashtun tribes agreed to join Pakistan in 1947 provided much of their homeland remain autonomous and free of government troops .
Pashtun Swat , where Islamic Sharia law was in force , only joined Pakistan in 1969 after assurances of autonomy and religious freedom .
As Pakistan ’s Pashtun increasingly aided Pashtun resistance in Afghanistan , US " Predator " drones began attacking them .
Washington forced Islamabad to violate its own constitution by sending troops into Pashtun lands .
The result was the current explosion of Pashtun anger .
I have been to war with Pashtun and have seen their legendary courage , strong sense of honor , and determination .
They are also hugely quarrelsome , feuding , prickly , and notorious for seeking revenge .
One learns never threaten a Pashtun or give him ultimatums .
These mountain warriors defied the US by refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden because he was a hero of the anti-Soviet war and their guest .
Doing would have violated their ancient code of " Pashtunwali " that still guides them .
Now , Washington ’s ham - handed policies and last week ’s Swat atrocity threaten to ignite Pakistan ’s second worst nightmare after invasion by India : that its 26 million Pashtun will secede and join Afghanistan ’s Pashtun to form an independent Pashtun state , Pashtunistan .
This would rend Pakistan asunder , probably provoke its restive Baluchi tribes to secede , and might tempt mighty India to intervene military , risking nuclear war with beleaguered Pakistan .
The Pashtun of Northwest Frontier have no intention or capability of moving into Pakistan ’s other provinces , Punjab , Sindh and Baluchistan .
They just want to be left alone .
Alarms of a " Taliban takeover of Pakistan " are driven by ignorance or propaganda .
Lowland Pakistanis have repeatedly rejected militant Islamic parties .
Many have little love for Pashtun , whom they regard as mountain rustics best avoided .
Pakistan ’s Islamist parties have traditionally won less than 10 % of the national vote .
Nor are Pakistan ’s well - guarded nuclear weapons a danger — at least not yet .
Alarms about Pakistan ’s nukes come from neoconservative fabricators worried about Israel .
The real danger is in the US acting like an enraged mastodon , trampling Pakistan under foot , and forcing Islamabad ’s military to make war on its own people .
Pakistan could end up like US - occupied Iraq , split into three parts and helpless .
If this continues , at some point nationalistic Pakistani soldiers may rebel against the corrupt generals and politicians on Washington ’s payroll .
Equally ominous , a poor people ’s uprising spreading across Pakistan — also mislabeled " Taliban " — threatens a radical national rebellion similar to India ’s spreading Maoist Naxalite rebellion .
As in Iraq , ignorance and military arrogance continue to drive US Afghan policy .
Obama ’s people have no more understanding what they are getting into in " Afpak " than did the Bush administration .
They will learn the hard way .

Frank Ricci -- a firefighter in New Haven , Conn. -- spent months listening to study tapes as he drove to work and in the evenings , preparing for a promotional test .
It was a once - a - decade chance to move up to a command rank in the fire department .
Ricci earned a top score but no promotion .
The city had coded the test takers by race , and of the top 15 scorers , 14 were white and one was Latino .
Since there were only 15 vacancies , it looked as though no blacks would be promoted .
After a racially charged debate that stretched over four hearings , the city ’s civil service board rejected the test scores five years ago and promoted no one .
Advertisement
“ To have the city throw it out because you ’re white or because you ’re not African American is insulting , ” Ricci said when he and 19 other firefighters sued the city for racial discrimination .
Their case , scheduled to be argued this month , is the first to come before the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. that broadly raises the issue of race in the workplace .
The outcome could reshape hiring and promotion policies for millions of the nation ’s public employees -- and possibly for private employers as well .
Roberts , leading a five - justice majority , has made clear that he believes it is time to forbid the use of race as a factor in the government ’s decisions .
The Obama administration , taking its first stand on race and civil rights , sided with the city officials and said they were justified in dropping the test if it had “ gross exclusionary effects on minorities . ”
While blacks make up about 31 % of New Haven ’s 221 firefighters , 15 % are officers -- eight of the department ’s 42 lieutenants and one of its 18 captains .
Advertisement
At issue in the New Haven case is whether an employer can weigh the racial effect of a hiring or promotional standard .
Lawyers for the firefighters say the city violated the Constitution ’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws as well as the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 when it threw out the test scores .
They say the law forbids employers from “ discriminating against one group of individuals to benefit another group on account of race . ”
The white firefighters “ ask nothing more than the basic right to be judged by who they are and what they have accomplished , not by the color of their skin , ” the lawyers say .
But the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said the claim ignored the history of discrimination that excluded blacks from fire and police departments .
In many cities , including New Haven , the “ fire department was the preserve of white males , ” said John Payton , who is also counsel for the defense fund .
“ African Americans were virtually excluded . ”
That ’s why cities across the country have fought discrimination lawsuits involving their fire departments , he said .
Many of the cases have stretched over decades .
In the 1970s , civil rights lawyers sued many cities because minorities were excluded for city jobs .
In response , cities often signed consent decrees promising to hire and promote more blacks .
However , in the decades since , cities have fought long - running lawsuits from whites who say they were victims of reverse discrimination .

Last month , Chicago paid a $ 6 - million settlement to 75 white firefighters who said they lost promotions when test scores were scrapped in 1986 .
“ This was very similar to what is before the court in the Connecticut case , ” said Linda Friedman , a Chicago lawyer for the firefighters there .
“ The city of Chicago saw itself in a predicament .
They thought they could be sued by blacks if they used the exam .
And they were sued [ by whites ] when they decided against using the exam scores . ”
These cases highlight a conflict in federal civil rights law .
The Constitution and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 say employers may not discriminate against people because of their race .
However , employers also have been told they may not use hiring or promotional standards -- including tests -- that have a “ disparate impact ” on minorities .
Advertisement
The court adopted this rule in a 1971 case .
Congress added it to federal law in 1991 .
The new provision said employers may not use a job standard that has a “ disparate impact on the basis of race ” unless it is “ required by business necessity . ”
For example , it is not certain that the knowledge tested by the firefighter ’s exam was required to be a lieutenant in the fire department .
In New Haven , the city ’s lawyers cited this “ disparate impact ” rule as their reason for scrapping the test scores in 2004 .
“ I understand their disappointment , ” Victor Bolden , the city ’s corporation counsel , said in an interview , referring to the white firefighters .
“ But this test had an adverse impact [ on minorities ] .
The city did the right thing .
It made a measured response in a difficult circumstance .
Someone was going to be disappointed , and we could be sued either way . ”
Payton emphasized that New Haven had not rejected the white firefighters because of their race , but rather rejected the use of the written exam as the sole determinant of who would be promoted .
Advertisement
“ New Haven ought to be able to go back to the drawing board , ” he said , to devise a fairer promotion system .
New Haven is a racially mixed city of 124,000 .
About 44 % of its residents are white , 37 % black and 21 % Latino .
The Obama administration told the court that New Haven officials were justified in scrapping the test results if they had “ a reasonable belief ” they could be sued by blacks for discrimination .
Lawyers for the white firefighters insist that “ racial politics ” and “ cronyism ” were behind the city ’s decision .
They said Boise Kimber , an outspoken black minister , was a key political ally of Mayor John DeStefano Jr. , and that he pressured the city civil service board into rejecting the test results .
Advertisement
“ You have a responsibility of making this fire department look like New Haven , ” Kimber told the board in one heated session .
“ And it ai n’t looking like New Haven . ”
Citing the “ voluminous record in this case , ” the Obama administration said the court should send the case back to a judge in Connecticut to consider whether the white firefighters were victims of racial politics .
Yale law professor Drew Days , a former chief of the Justice Department ’s civil rights division , said he was surprised the justices agreed to hear the case of Ricci vs. DeStefano .
Now that they have , he added , a ruling for Ricci “ could have very far - reaching consequences because it may well apply to all employers . ”

More Democrat Carolyn Maloney leads
House effort to change credit card rules .
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Are the stars finally aligned for a Washington crackdown on credit cards ?
President Obama on Thursday will attend a meeting of administration officials and card company executives .
He is expected to press CEOs to adopt practices designed to protect consumers .
Meanwhile , Congress is pushing ahead on legislation that in past years has been introduced - and even approved by the House - but that has never advanced very far .
This year might be different .
Many insiders on both sides of financial services issues say they expect legislation to ride the populist wave that swept Democrats into the White House and to Congress in greater numbers .
A key House committee could vote as soon as Wednesday .
" If not now , then when ? " asked Kathleen Day of the Center for Responsible Lending .
" The momentum is certainly there . "
The bills would , among other things , ban card companies from abruptly jacking up interest rates and fees and prevent young adults from getting credit cards .
But if the bills advance all the way to President Obama 's desk , it wo n't be without a fight .
Even as legislation last week moved further than ever before , financial sector lobbyists are redoubling their efforts to knock it off course .
Their aim : prevent Congress from passing anything stronger than new Federal Reserve changes already set to take effect in July 2010 .
Banking lobbyists warn that tougher rules , especially those proposed in the Senate , could make credit card lending more costly or curb the issuance of new cards - and in turn slow the recovery of slumping credit markets .
The credit card sector gave as much as $ 7.3 million to lawmakers in both political parties during the 2008 election cycle , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Since last October , Visa spent $ 1.7 million on lobbying , according to government lobbying registries .
Meanwhile , credit cards are weighing on consumers ' minds and wallets .
In February , credit card debt that companies can't collect - and thus give up on and write down - reached a 20 - year high , according to Moody 's Credit Card Index .
The rate at which consumers made late credit card payments also rose to a 17 - year high .
" Lots of people are calling and writing their representatives and saying : ' You ca n't let these guys get away with this , ' " said Travis Plunkett a lobbyist with the Consumer Federation of America .
Obama has n't indicated his preference on existing credit card legislation .
During the campaign he advocated for many of the same reforms that the tougher Senate bill proposes , such as banning credit card issuers from making " unilateral " changes to the consumer 's contract .
If Congress does nothing , Federal Reserve rule changes set to kick in next year would stop higher interest rates from being imposed when consumers are late paying unrelated bills .
The changes also stop companies from averaging finance charges from two previous cycles , a practice that dings consumers who carry a balance and pay it off .
The House bill , sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , is similar to the Federal Reserve changes , with a few more reforms .
It would also prevent card companies from marketing and issuing cards to those younger than 18 .
And it bans credit card companies from charging a fee for payments made over the phone .
" For too long the playing field has been tilted against the American consumer as they have battled against unfair and deceptive acts and practices related to their credit cards , " Maloney said while presenting the bill earlier this month .
A similar bill she sponsored last year passed the U.S. House but never made it out of a Senate committee .
This year , credit card legislation made it out of a Senate committee , but just barely , by 12 - 11 .
The Senate bill is even tougher than the House bill , preventing credit card issuers from raising interest rates and fees even if the consumer 's general credit risk goes up .
A top industry advocate , Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable , said that if credit card companies can't charge fees and interest based on general risk , all card holders will have to pay more because customers with good credit scores will have to subsidize those with weaker credit scores .
" It 's going to reduce credit and make it more expensive for everyone , " he said .
" That 's not what we need for the financial markets . "
Many Senate Republicans and a few Democrats have said they do n't like the Senate 's legislation , making passage unlikely without concessions .
The sponsor , Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , has said he 's willing to consider some compromises .
The Senate bill also prevents those under 21 from getting credit cards unless a parent or guardian backs them up or if they take a government - approved financial literacy test .
The Senate bill also prevents retailers from charging " dormancy " fees on gift cards that are n't redeemed within a certain period of time .
While veterans political watchers expect a credit card bill of some type to pass this year , the bill may also give the financial sector industry a couple of things they 've been seeking .
For example , in an attempt to woo the industry , the Senate bill now also offers an unrelated that banking interests like .
It would increase Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .'s ability to borrow from the Treasury to $ 500 billion , up from $ 100 billion .
It also allows the National Credit Union Administration to borrow from Treasury up to $ 18 billion , up from $ 6 billion .
Humans excel at recognizing faces , but how we do this has been an abiding mystery in neuroscience and psychology .
In an effort to explain our success in this area , researchers are taking a closer look at how and why we fail .
A new study from MIT looks at a particularly striking instance of failure : our impaired ability to recognize faces in photographic negatives .
The study , which appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week , suggests that a large part of the answer might lie in the brain 's reliance on a certain kind of image feature .
The work could potentially lead to computer vision systems , for settings as diverse as industrial quality control or object and face detection .
On a different front , the results and methodologies could help researchers probe face - perception skills in children with autism , who are often reported to experience difficulties analyzing facial information .
Anyone who remembers the days before digital photography has probably noticed that it 's much harder to identify people in photographic negatives than in normal photographs .
" You have not taken away any information , but somehow these faces are much harder to recognize , " says Pawan Sinha , an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and senior author of the PNAS study .
Sinha has previously studied light and dark relationships between different parts of the face , and found that in nearly every normal lighting condition , a person 's eyes appear darker than the forehead and cheeks .
He theorized that photo negatives are hard to recognize because they disrupt these very strong regularities around the eyes .
To test this idea , Sinha and his colleagues asked subjects to identify photographs of famous people in not only positive and negative images , but also in a third type of image in which the celebrities ' eyes were restored to their original levels of luminance , while the rest of the photo remained in negative .
Subjects had a much easier time recognizing these " contrast chimera " images .
According to Sinha , that 's because the light / dark relationships between the eyes and surrounding areas are the same as they would be in a normal image .
Similar contrast relationships can be found in other parts of the face , primarily the mouth , but those relationships are not as consistent .
" The relationships around the eyes seem to be particularly significant , " says Sinha .
Other studies have shown that people with autism tend to focus on the mouths of people they are looking at , rather than the eyes , so the new findings could help explain why autistic people have such difficulty recognizing faces , says Sinha .
The findings also suggest that neuronal responses in the brain may be based on these relationships between different parts of the face .
The team found that when they scanned the brains of people performing the recognition task , regions associated with facial processing ( the fusiform face areas ) were far more active when looking at the contrast chimeras than when looking at pure negatives .
Other authors of the paper are Sharon Gilad of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and MIT postdoctoral associate Ming Meng , both of whom contributed equally to the work .
The research was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Jim and Marilyn Simons Foundation .

Filtering Software Still Allows So -Called “ Ex - Gay ” Sites
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NASHVILLE , TN - As many as 107 Tennessee public school districts could be illegally preventing students from accessing online information about lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues , according to a letter to sent to school officials by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The letter demands that Knox County Schools , Metro Nashville Public Schools , and the Tennessee Schools Cooperative unblock the Internet filtering category designated “ LGBT ” so that students can access political and educational information about LGBT issues on school computers .
“ When I found out about this web filtering software , I was n’t looking for anything sexual or inappropriate – I was looking for information about scholarships for LGBT students , and I could n’t get to it because of this software , ” said Andrew Emitt , a 17 - year - old senior at Central High School in Knoxville .
“ Our schools should n’t be keeping students in the dark about LGBT organizations and resources . ”
In its letter , the ACLU gives the districts and the Tennessee Schools Cooperative until April 29 to come up with a plan to restore access to the LGBT sites or any other category that blocks non-sexual websites advocating the fair treatment of LGBT people by the beginning of the 2009 - 2010 school year .
If that deadline is not met , the ACLU will file a lawsuit .
“ Students at Knox County and Metro Nashville schools are being denied access to content that is protected speech under the First Amendment as well as the Tennessee state constitution , ” said Tricia Herzfeld , Staff Attorney with the ACLU of Tennessee .
“ This kind of censorship does nothing but hurt students , whether they ’re being harassed at school and want to know about their legal rights or are just trying to finish an assignment for a class . ”
The Internet filtering software used by Knox County and Metro Nashville school districts blocks student access to the websites of many well - known national LGBT organizations , including :
Parents , Families , and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ( PFLAG )
The Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network ( GLSEN )
Human Rights Campaign ( HRC )
Marriage Equality USA

In its demand letter , the ACLU notes that websites that urge LGBT persons to change their sexual orientation or gender identity through so - called “ reparative therapy ” or “ ex - gay ” ministries – a practice denounced as dangerous and harmful to young people by such groups as the American Psychological Association , the American Psychiatric Association , the American Medical Association , and the American Academy of Pediatrics – can still be easily accessed by students .
“ One of the problems with this software is that it only allows students access to one side of information about topics that are part of the public debate right now , like marriage for same - sex couples , ” said Karyn Storts - Brinks , a librarian at Fulton High School in Knoxville , pointing out that the software blocks access to organizations that support marriage for same - sex couples like the Religious Coalition for Freedom to Marry or the Interfaith Working Group while allowing access to organizations that oppose marriage equality .
“ Students who need to do research for assignments on current events can only get one viewpoint , keeping them from being able to cover both sides of the issue .
That ’s not fair and can hinder their schoolwork . ”
“ Public schools are supposed to be a place where students learn from the open exchange of ideas , ” said Eric Austin , a senior at Hume - Fogg High School in Nashville , which also uses the filtering software .
“ How are we supposed to be informed citizens and learn how to have respectful debate when our schools rule out an entire category of information for no good reason ? ”
No federal or state law requires school districts to block access to LGBT sites .
Tennessee law , Tenn .
Code § 49-1-221 , only requires schools to implement filtering software to restrict information that is obscene or harmful to minors .
About 80 percent of Tennessee public schools , including those in the Knox County and Metro Nashville districts , use filtering software provided by Education Networks of America ( ENA ) , and the software ’s default setting blocks sites ENA categorizes as LGBT .
The ACLU believes that most of the 107 Tennessee school districts that use ENA ’s filtering software keep the LGBT category blocked .
ENA blocks access to a wide category of “ LGBT ” sites described on the organization ’s website as
Sites that provide information regarding , support , promote , or cater to one 's sexual orientation or gender identity including but not limited to lesbian , gay , bi-sexual , and transgender sites .
This category does not include sites that are sexually gratuitous in nature which would typically fall under the Pornography category .
Examples : glsen.org , gsanetwork.org , hrc.org
“ When public schools only allow access to one side of an issue by blocking certain websites , they ’re engaging in illegal viewpoint discrimination , ” said Hedy Weinberg , Executive Director of the ACLU of Tennessee .
“ Over a hundred other school districts in Tennessee use the same filtering software used in Metro Nashville and Knox County , and we ’re eager to find out whether any of those systems are also violating students ’
Constitutional rights by restricting access to LGBT sites . ”
Tennessee students , teachers , or school librarians whose schools use the ENA web filtering software and find that their access to LGBT websites is restricted are encouraged to contact the ACLU of Tennessee by phone at 615-320-7142 or by email at aclutn@aclu-tn.org .
Austin , Emitt , and Storts - Brinks are represented by Herzfeld , Chris Hansen and Catherine Crump of the ACLU First Amendment Working Group , and Christine Sun of the ACLU LGBT Project .

For those out in about in the early hours this morning , you may have been treated to an unusual site , the moon and venus right next to each other in the sky .
This dance between the moon and venus has been going on for a few months , but this morning , the crescent moon actually passed in front of a crescent venus ( known as an occultation in astronomy ) .
I ’m not what you would call a morning person ( I much prefer to shoot in the late evening ) , but I drug myself out of bed to take some pictures of this .
This conjunction was bright enough that I could actually shoot it from my front yard , without having to drive away from the bright lights .

( New York ) - Iraq should institute an immediate moratorium on the death penalty in the aftermath of a large number of executions on May 3 , 2009 , Human Rights Watch said today .
According to United Nations officials in Baghdad , the Iraqi government hanged 12 people in Baghdad on May 3 who had been convicted of criminal offenses .
The UN officials said they believed that another 115 prisoners could face execution in the near future .
" This is a major step backward for human rights in Iraq , " said Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" In a country that has had so much violence , the government should focus on fixing its flawed justice system instead of executing people . "
Human Rights
Watch said it was particularly concerned that Iraq continues to admit into judicial proceedings confessions obtained under duress .
The organization called on the Iraqi government to disclose all information regarding the identities and status of prisoners on death row , the crimes for which they have been convicted , the manner in which they were charged , tried , and sentenced , the prisons in which they are detained , and details of any impending executions .
Human Rights
Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inhumane nature and its finality .
International human rights law requires that , where it has not been abolished , the death penalty be imposed only in cases where the judicial system has scrupulously complied with fair trial standards , including the rights of the defendant to competent defense counsel , to be presumed innocent until proven guilty , and to not be compelled to confess guilt .
Criminal trials in Iraq routinely violate these minimum guarantees .
In a December 2008 report , Human Rights Watch documented that even the country 's flagship Central Criminal Court has failed to meet basic international fair trial and due process standards .
In monitoring court proceedings in Iraq , Human Rights Watch found that the majority of defendants had ineffectual legal counsel and were unable to pursue a meaningful defense or challenge evidence against them .
Many were subjected to abuse in detention , typically with the aim of extracting confessions , and lengthy pretrial detention without judicial review was the rule .

A Newcastle pub has been condemned as " wretched " in Parliament for offering free drinks to women who exposed their breasts to bar staff .
Labour MP Denis MacShane said his daughter , who is a student at Newcastle university , had taken part in a protest at Sinners in the city centre .
Licensing Minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the pub had behaved irresponsibly .
North Shields - based Ladhar Group , which owns the bar , apologised and said a member of staff had been disciplined .
Mr McShane , who is the MP for Rotherham , said the bar had promoted the degradation of women customers by encouraging them to go topless on one night in March .
We apologise to any customers who saw the notice and were offended
Ladhar Group spokeswoman
Mr Sutcliffe said : " Clearly this is irresponsible advertising .
It is not what we want to see , particularly where alcohol is concerned . "
He said he would consider strengthening rules to outlaw similar promotions .
Last month women 's rights group , Object , also criticised the bar , in the city 's Newgate Street , as promoting sexism " which should be stamped out . "
A spokeswoman for the Ladhar Group said : " The offensive notice in question was displayed without the knowledge of the directors of Ladhar or senior management at the bar .
" After an investigation a male member of staff was disciplined and given a final written warning .
" We apologise to any customers who saw the notice and were offended . "
A Newcastle City Council spokesman said : " The licensing authority took this matter very seriously and called the management of Sinners to a meeting .
Subsequently the practices ceased . "
I learned long ago , while working at the media watch group FAIR , to be wary of New York Times headlines .
Hearing news that President Obama has a shortlist of candidates to replace David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court , I dug up a front - page New York Times Week in Review piece written soon after Obama ’s inauguration about his possible impact on the Court .
It was headlined : “ To Nudge , Shift or Shove the Supreme Court Left . ”
I ’d like to see Obama shift or shove the Court leftward .
But after reading the article , I realized that it could just as easily have been headlined : “ Will Obama Move Supreme Court Rightward ? ”
The centerpiece of the Times article was a fascinating study conducted by two University of Chicago law professors ( one of whom is a conservative federal appeals judge ) analyzing the judicial records of the 43 justices who ’ve served on the Supreme Court since 1937 .
Four of the five most conservative judges of the last seven decades ( Thomas , Scalia , Roberts , Alito ) now sit on the Court .
With Anthony Kennedy at number ten , five of the ten most rightwing judges are currently on the Court .
The current majority , in other words , is almost a conservative all - star team .
By contrast , among the ten most liberal judges since 1937 , the only sitting justice is Ruth Bader Ginsburg – she ’s number nine .
Today ’s other three “ liberal ” justices ( Stevens , Breyer , Souter ) are in the top 15 , but outside the top ten .
All in all , that ’s a rightwing - dominated Supreme Court .
The study gives credence to the claim of Justice John Paul Stevens ( age 89 ) that he has n’t moved left since being appointed by President Ford in 1975 , but that the Court has moved right .
And it backs Stevens ’ assertion that “ every judge who ’s been appointed to the Court ” since 1971 “ has been more conservative than his or her predecessor ” – with the exception of Ginsburg ( who recently underwent surgery related to pancreatic cancer ) .
The question facing Obama :
Will he continue this trend of shifting the Court rightward ?
Unfortunately , from what we ’ve seen of Obama ’s general penchant for “ moderate ” appointees who do n’t inflame Republicans , it ’s quite possible the Court will continue trending rightward – if liberals get replaced with less liberal appointees .
After Souter , the seats Obama is most likely to fill are those of the two most liberal justices : Ginsburg and Stevens .
One of the most depressing aspects of the Obama era is how he has gotten away with so many centrist / corporatist appointees with such muted criticism from the left .
That better change when it comes to crucial LIFE - LONG judicial appointees .
Whom Obama chooses for these posts is arguably more important than his choices of Biden or Gates or Hillary Clinton .
On this topic ( like others ) , Obama speaks eloquently .
. . out of both sides of his mouth .
In revealing comments to the Detroit Free Press last October about his models for Supreme Court picks , Obama praised liberal lions Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan of the Warren Court as “ real heroes of mine . ”
Then he added : “ But that does n’t necessarily mean that I think their judicial philosophy is appropriate for today . ”

After noting the Warren Court ’s powerful role in taking on racial segregation , Obama added a typically frustrating caveat : “ I ’m not sure you need that .
In fact , I would be troubled if you had that same kind of activism in circumstances today .
. .
So when I think about the kinds of judges who are needed today , it goes back to the point I was making about common sense and pragmatism as opposed to ideology . ”
Obama is a smart guy .
He knows that even the most “ common - sense / pragmatic ” nominee will bring ( often - feigned ) outrage from conservatives .
Rightwing groups are gearing up to raise funds and build their mailing lists by pouncing on whomever he chooses .
They ’d yell even if he selected 79 - year - old recently Republican Arlen Specter .
After Souter announced his retirement , rightwingers jumped on Obama ’s sensible statement that he would look for “ that quality of empathy , of understanding and identifying with people ’s hopes and struggles . ”
That ’s code , claimed conservatives , for a liberal activist judge .
And Obama is looking to replace Souter with a woman , person of color or both .
Rightwing theatrics aside , the reality is that unless Obama restrains his compulsion toward centrist consensus and appoints real progressives to replace not only Souter but Ginsburg and Stevens , our rightwing court may get even more conservative .
George W. Bush appointed mostly rightwing ideologues to the federal courts , and put Alito and Roberts on the Supremes .
Republican - appointees and rightists now dominate the federal judiciary .
Meanwhile , Bill Clinton prided himself on choosing mostly moderate judges – praised by the same elite pundit chorus that now praises Obama ’s “ pragmatic ” choices .
A tepid replacement for Souter ( and Stevens and Ginsburg ) would maintain a rightwing status quo on the Supreme Court ; as University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone told the Times : “ The right side is very bold and very conservative .
The liberal side is not bold .
They are incrementalists .
They do n’t set the agenda . ”
But if Obama were to break his habit and replace retiring liberals with a bold progressive or two , Professor Stone argues it would seriously change things : “ A really powerful , articulate , moral , passionate voice on the left would really change the dynamic on the Court .
It would pull the other justices who are inclined to be sympathetic to that voice in that direction .
It would shift the center of the discussion — about what ’s the middle . ”
With a Democratic - dominated Senate , President Obama is free to make a bold choice .
I ’m not holding my breath .
Especially after seeing this clueless comment from Senate Judiciary chair Pat Leahy , who ’s gone over possible Souter replacements with Obama : “ I do n’t like to see an ideologue of either the right or the left .
I do n’t think we ’re going to have one . ”

“ If there ’s a Mecca for avalanche control , it ’s Little Cottonwood , ” said Doug Abromeit , the director of the United States Forest Service National Avalanche Center .
“ It ’s kind of the birthplace for the avalanche program of the United States . ”
What now confounds resort officials and highway managers is that many of the alternatives to artillery are loaded with consequences , too .
Newer types of weapons , of which the Army has plenty on hand , shoot explosives farther than the current gun system does , elevating the risk of overshooting targets .
Snow sheds and tunnels to cover the highway are hugely expensive , and snow fences that restrict snow on high slopes raise aesthetic and environmental issues .
Some proposals might even backfire and worsen avalanche risks .
Alta is considering , for example , building a new chairlift on a slide - prone area called Flagstaff Mountain .
Demolition experts could then plant hand charges , the preferred method in most resorts , and skiers using the lift would compact the snow , reducing its propensity to slide .
But Flagstaff Mountain is also considered a prime gateway to backcountry ski areas outside the resort boundary and not patrolled by anyone .
More skiers on one side of the mountain packing down the snow , avalanche experts said , would probably mean more people on the other , venturing into areas where they could be in more avalanche danger than ever .
Backcountry skiing and snowmobiling have been the fastest - growing categories in avalanche deaths in recent years , especially last year , when 36 people died nationwide , the worst year since 1950 .
Twenty - four people have died so far this winter in avalanches around the West .

“ You would quite likely have a lot of people venturing out there who should n’t , ” said Liam Fitzgerald , who leads the Highway Avalanche Safety Program at the Utah Department of Transportation .
“ No one has come up with how we are going to deal with that issue . ”
The Amazon is surprisingly sensitive to drought , according to new research conducted throughout the world 's largest tropical forest .
The 30 - year study , published in Science , provides the first solid evidence that drought causes massive carbon loss in tropical forests , mainly through killing trees .
" For years the Amazon forest has been helping to slow down climate change .
But relying on this subsidy from nature is extremely dangerous " , said Professor Oliver Phillips , from the University of Leeds and the lead author of the research .
" If the earth 's carbon sinks slow or go into reverse , as our results show is possible , carbon dioxide levels will rise even faster .
Deeper cuts in emissions will be required to stabilise our climate . "
The study , a global collaboration between more than 40 institutions , was based on the unusual 2005 drought in the Amazon .
This gave scientists a glimpse into the region 's future climate , in which a warming tropical North Atlantic may cause hotter and more intense dry seasons .
The 2005 drought sharply reversed decades of carbon absorption , in which Amazonia helped slow climate change .
In normal years the forest absorbs nearly 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide .
The drought caused a loss of more than 3 billion tonnes .
The total impact of the drought - 5 billion extra tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - exceeds the annual emissions of Europe and Japan combined .

" Visually , most of the forest appeared little affected , but our records prove tree death rates accelerated .
Because the region is so vast , even small ecological effects can scale - up to a large impact on the planet 's carbon cycle , " explained Professor Phillips .
Some species , including some important palm trees , were especially vulnerable " , said Peruvian botanist and co-author Abel Monteagudo , " showing that drought threatens biodiversity too . "
The Amazon accounts for more than half of the world 's rainforest , covering an area 25 times as great as the United Kingdom .
No other ecosystem on Earth is home to so many species nor exerts such control on the carbon cycle .
The study involved 68 scientists from 13 countries working in RAINFOR , a unique research network dedicated to monitoring the Amazonian forests .
To calculate changes in carbon storage they examined more than 100 forest plots across the Amazon 's 600 million hectares , identified and measured over 100,000 trees , and recorded tree deaths as well as new trees .
Weather patterns were also carefully measured and mapped .

In the wake of the 2005 drought the RAINFOR team took advantage of this huge natural experiment , and focused their measurements to assess how the drought had affected the forest .
The study found that for at least 25 years the Amazon forest acted as a vast carbon sink .
A similar process has also been occurring in Africa .
In fact , over recent decades the tropical forests have absorbed one fifth of global fossil fuel emissions .
But in 2005 this process was reversed .
Tree death accelerated most where drought was strongest , and locations subject even to mild drying were affected .
Because of the study , we now know the precise sensitivity of the Amazon to warming and drought .
If repeated , Amazon droughts will accelerate climate warming and make future droughts even more damaging .
The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation .
ahahha so many unsatifactory answers provided when atheist ask a geniune questions , yet someone still want to ask a questions that he think atheist cant answer .
we are supposed to believe that god exist thats why all the amazing creations and yada yada .
yet if we say coincidence , no one buy that .
i do n't know whether your religion is a conspiracy to make the whole human population stupid so that alien can attack us .
man , you are the like a white hole , just that you throw out stupid
DNA if i want to put it , i can say its a infomation consisting of compilation of trials and error .
what do i mean ?
well , evolution is a process in which a living being evolve to better suit the newer enviroment provided for them .
unnecessary part is gradually removed and necessary part is gradually formed .
all this is saved into the DNA .
DNA = what you are , if you were to evolve to the point you need 4 hand instead of 2 , your DNA will subsequently changed too .
somehow , you manage to see it as a language and think its definitely god work and atheist are stupid .
well then hold on to that thought .
doesnt hurt us , we are backed with hundreds of scientific facts while you guys , just 1 book in which you guys cant even get yourself to agree on one single interpretation .

Steve Martin once said “ there ’s someone out there for everyone - even if you need a pickaxe , a compass , and night goggles to find them . ”
For some people in Calgary ’s GBLT community , they are also using the extra tool of a gay matchmaking agency – Entre - Nous .
But will you walk away with the person of your dreams , or will you just end up with the money sucked from your wallet ?
Entre-Nous bills itself as “ Canada ’s only matchmaking service catering exclusively to same - sex relationships . ”
Like most matchmaking services , there are fees to be paid ; fees which are not cheap , but fees which people have paid in hopes that the service is using the money to find you an appropriate match .
“ Sam ” , an IT consultant , has been together with his partner for a year ; to that he credits Entre - Nous .
When it comes to public knowledge of his sexuality , he described himself as “ reserved ” .
He used the dating service out of frustration – Sam wanted to meet someone he could settle down with ; of the men he had been dating , none of them were considered long - term material .
He admits the membership cost is n’t cheap , but he felt you get what you pay for .
Regarding the fees , due to the confidentiality agreement with Entre - Nous , Sam could n’t tell us what he paid , but he did confirm that he and his partner have guessed they paid roughly the same .
Prior to the agency introducing him to his current partner , Sam met with two other men , but no sparks flew .
As he did find his partner through the service , he felt it was worth the money – or as he said , “ you ca n ’t put a price on a relationship ” .
When asked if he ’d heard of any negative feedback on Entre - Nous from his friends , he admitted he had n’t , but he also said he had n’t told anyone he used a dating agency .
However , finding negative feedback about Entre - Nous was not hard .
John Freriksen is the owner of a successful business in downtown Calgary .
The one thing missing from his life was a romantic partner .
He did n’t like meeting people at the bars , did n’t use the chat lines or any of the various dating websites , and was too busy to look into any other alternatives for mating and dating .
He considered using Entre - Nous to match him with a potential mate .
All he had heard about them was that they were good , but not cheap .
Last Spring , John took a chance , and was soon in a small meeting room going through their interview process – which consisted of filling out about twenty pages of forms to help build a profile of him and what he wanted in a partner .
The Entre - Nous staff checked on him periodically , but the set up felt odd – like a marketing scheme : “ You feel really weird , because you know these people are not from here ( Calgary ) , and you ’re sitting in a small room filling out forms ” .
This sent up red flags for John – he started to sense something was n’t right .
Finally , when he asked how much Entre - Nous wanted to charge , he was told it would cost anywhere from $ 10,000 - $ 20,000 to sign up .
This was a large investment , even for a successful businessman .
John hesitated , and asked for more time to think about it …at which point Entre - Nous staff gave him more forms to fill out .
In this time , John decided against signing up : “ I told them , it ’s not about the money .
I do n’t know you from a hole in the wall .
I do n’t know where you ’re from ; you told me you ’re leaving tomorrow for Vancouver , so that means you ’re here for only one day .
… As a business person – you know when people scheming something .
” Unfortunately , Entre - Nous was n’t going to let John get away that easily .
“ They come back with a receipt – $ 15,000 on my Visa .
I said , excuse me , I have not given you any permission to put this on my Visa .
I said I want it back , and I ’m not leaving until I get it back .
” He waited there for almost 2 and a half hours , as they tried to convince him they could n’t refund the money .
John told them , “ I want a signed piece of paper showing me you owe me the $ 15,000 . ”
Then they had to phone management and further delay him .
He was livid – he never permitted them to charge his card nor had he seen any form indicating this was going to happen .
“ They were just trying to push it through that you would pay for it .
” This happened on a Saturday .
On Monday John got a call back from Montreal .
Again they gave him excuses , but John was adamant – especially after verifying the amount was charged to his Visa .
Then it got more interesting .
“ I was offered to keep my mouth shut , ” John said .
“ I was offered for $ 5000 - a membership . ”
He did n’t bite , and insisted on getting a full refund .
John promised that if he was not given a refund , he ’d make a loud and very public stink about what occurred through his media contacts .
A week and a half later he finally got his money back .
He does n’t think it was a simple mistake or miscommunication .
“ It is a scheme , absolutely a scheme . ”
As a business owner , John has encountered situations where errors are made , and he knows that the manner in which such errors are handled is a sign of how professional a person or company is .
While he would not use their services , had Entre - Nous at the start simply told him “ so sorry , it was a mistake , we keep our word , here ’s your full refund , ” he would have been happy to forget the whole situation .
After this encounter he does n’t believe a word Entre - Nous says .
“ They might find - once in a while - the right person for someone , ” John said , but he thinks they are swindling a lot of people in the meantime .
“ A lot of people keep their month shut .
Like me …I said to myself , it ’s over and done with , I should have known better , and I ’m glad I found that out before I paid a dime .
” Fortunately , John did n’t sign any confidentiality agreements .
This is important because that agreement keeps you from disclosing your fee to other people ( including any prospective dates they send to you ) .
Both from researching news stories on the web and speaking ( anonymously ) to other Entre - Nous clientele , I discovered the price can vary from around $ 500 to $ 8000 .
One gentlemen commented Entre - Nous ’ screening of applicants seemed to be based on whether you can pay .
He offered his credit card and was swiftly approved as a member – no time seemed to be taken verifying other important details – such as “ no substance abusers , or persons with criminal convictions ” as stated on their website .
While I ca n’t speak to the drug equation , I can tell you the only time you can request a record of someone ’s criminal history ( or lack thereof ) is if you are an existing or potential employer .
This is another misrepresentation – a promise that they can’t possibly deliver on .
Indeed , regardless of the amount charged for membership , the product provided by Entre - Nous seems to come up short not just in Calgary , but in several other cities .
I had a quick conversation with Fred Kuhr , writer with GBLT weekly Xtra !.
His paper and Xtra !
West have reported on several similar situations .
In January , Xtra ! reported the Ontario Ministry of Small Business and Consumer Services “ charged Entre - Nous with two counts of failing to deliver on a valid contract , two counts of failing to deliver a refund within 15 days and two counts of false , misleading and unfair practices . ”
Additionally , “ in 2006 Terry Wong of Toronto filed a small claims suit against the company for alleged misrepresentation and allegedly failing to live up to its contractual obligations .
Last June ,
Wong won his suit and was awarded close to half of the nearly $ 8,000 he claims to have paid to the dating service .
” Digging a little deeper into additional reports from Xtra !
West , Entre - Nous themselves admitted fees can vary .
Patricia Ross , their client service representative stated “ desirability ” could play a factor in deciding to charge someone less for the service .
As well , hesitancy may lower the fees , as another gentleman found out .
Paul F. , a 74 - year old retiree from Vancouver balked at the price and Entre - Nous eventually lowered their rates to $ 500 in installments over five months .
His experience with the service was less than stellar , as the company did n’t honor his requirements in a potential date .
Additionally , he discovered the fee disparity when one of his dates told Paul he paid even less than $ 500 for the service .
Interestingly enough , dubious behavior in a matchmaking agency is not unique to the GBLT community alone .
In 2008 , CBC ’s Markeplace broadcast an episode on a straight matchmaking service ( “ Ca n’t Buy Me Love ” ) .
They found out much like Entre - Nous , the straight dating agency ’s fees could vary based on desirability .
Women of different ages were charged different rates ranging from $ 2.00 to thousands of dollars .
Again , like Entre - Nous , members of this service were not aware such price differentials existed .
While clients of Entre - Nous may – for the most part – be keeping quiet , a paper trail is forming .
A search on the Better Business Bureau of Ontario ( where Entre - Nous is based ) came up with multiple complaints and a ranking of “ F ” . That being said , in our community small slights can get magnified to dramatic levels .
I sent a list of my questions and concerns to Entre - Nous , with the hopes of including their side of the story in this article .
At the time of publication , I had yet to hear back from them ( even though , I ’m told , they had time enough to contact my editor with concerns over the article and my questions ) .
This was not surprising , because according to Kuhr , Entre - Nous has a reputation of being secretive when it comes to the inner workings of their company .
That non-response , along with other concerns , might raise warning signals .
Here we have a business which legally binds their customers to keep quiet about their prices , but does n’t have a set price for rendering what is conceivably a similar service .
Imagine walking into a store and being required to put on a blindfold , then told that the amount of the product you want is based on what ’s in your wallet .
No , you ca n’t check out their inventory – they ’ll bring out the product for you .
And if you even think of comparing notes with another customer , there could be consequences .
Of course the target market for this service would likely have a large component of closeted or semi-closeted males and females , and / or people who might not want to admit that they used a dating agency .
This means that if this agency is truly doing their customers wrong , they can count on the fact that most will not fight back for fear of outing themselves in more ways than one .
While Sam has proof of success through Entre - Nous ’ service in his ongoing relationship , John on the other hand would not recommend Entre - Nous whatsoever .
His philosophy toward business mistakes is to admit them , fix them , and move on .
With Entre - Nous , he got the run-around and the feeling that ( and I quote ) “ … they did n’t give a shit . ”
When you ’re feeling vulnerable in the search for your future spouse , the last thing you want is for someone to mess with your mind , and your wallet .
LOS ANGELES 
A scene from the new journalistic thriller “ State of Play ” says it all .
Jeff Daniels , as the politician George Fergus , squares off with Russell Crowe , as the pen-wielding journalist Cal McAffrey .
Two men .
One notebook .
Four chins .
Hollywood ’s pool of leading men is getting larger  and not necessarily in a good way .
Based on a close look at trailers , still photos and some films already released , at least a dozen male stars in some of the year ’s most prominent movies have been adding on the pounds of late .
In “ The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 , ” a subway heist movie due from Columbia Pictures and MGM in June , Denzel Washington , 54 , goes cheek - to - jowl with the bulky John Travolta , 55  and they are beginning to look like a matched set .
Mr. Washington is no longer the lean , mean boxing machine he portrayed in “ The Hurricane , ” 10 years ago .

Release : ConfigObj 4.6.0 and Validate 1.0.0
Finally a fresh release ConfigObj and Validate .
Note ConfigObj and Validate development is now done in Google Code project and subversion repository .
Please post any bug reports or feature requests on the project issue tracker .
ConfigObj Google Code Project Page
Issue Tracker
The best introduction to working with ConfigObj , including the powerful configuration validation system , is the article : An Introduction to ConfigObj
ConfigObj is a simple to use but powerful Python library for the reading and writing of configuration ( ini ) files .
Through Validate it integrates a config file validation and type conversion system .
Features of ConfigObj include :
Nested sections ( subsections ) , to any level
List values
Multiple line values
Full Unicode support
String interpolation ( substitution )
Integrated with a powerful validation system including automatic type checking / conversion and allowing default values repeated sections
All comments in the file are preserved
The order of keys / sections is preserved
Powerful unrepr mode for storing / retrieving Python data - types
Release 4.6.0 fixes bugs and adds new features , particularly making configspec handling more flexible .
The full changelog for ConfigObj 4.6.0 is :
Pickling of ConfigObj instances now supported ( thanks to Christian Heimes )
Hashes in confgspecs are now allowed ( see note below )
Replaced use of hasattr ( which can swallow exceptions ) with getattr
__many__ in configspecs can refer to scalars ( ordinary values ) as well as sections
in configspecs can refer to scalars ( ordinary values ) as well as sections
You can use ___many___ ( three underscores ! ) where you want to use __many__ as well
( three underscores ! ) where you want to use as well
You can now have normal sections inside configspec sections that use __many__
You can now create an empty ConfigObj with a configspec , programmatically set values and then validate
A section that was supplied as a value ( or vice - versa ) in the actual config file would cause an exception during validation ( the config file is still broken of course , but it is now handled gracefully )
Added as_list method
method Removed the deprecated istrue , encode and decode methods
, and methods Running test_configobj.py now also runs the doctests in the configobj module
Through the use of validate 1.0.0 ConfigObj can now validate multi-line values
As a consequence of the changes to configspec handling , when you create a ConfigObj instance and provide a configspec , the configspec attribute is only set on the ConfigObj instance - it is n't set on the sections until you validate .
You also ca n't set the configspec attribute to be a dictionary .
This was n't documented but did work previously .
In order to fix the problem with hashes in configspecs I had to turn off the parsing of inline comments in configspecs .
This will only affect you if you are using copy =True when validating and expecting inline comments to be copied from the configspec into the ConfigObj instance ( all other comments will be copied as usual ) .
If you create the configspec by passing in a ConfigObj instance ( usual way is to pass in a filename or list of lines ) then you should pass in _inspec=True to the constructor to allow hashes in values .
This is the magic that switches off inline comment parsing .
As the public API for Validate is stable , and there are no outstanding issues or feature requests , I 've bumped the version number to 1.0.0 .
The full change log is :
BUGFIX : can now handle multiline strings
Addition of ' force_list ' validation option
You should be able to install ConfigObj ( which includes Validate in the source distribution on PyPI ) using pip or easy_install .
Innapropriate Python
Python is not always appropriate in every circumstance .
As if proof was needed two recent news stories confirm it :

Another Podcast
Sod
This is a new podcast by well known .
NET MVPs , Devexpress evangelists and all round ( figuratively of course ) raconteurs : Gary Short and Oliver Sturm .
Episode 3 is now up , and it's an interview with me on dynamic languages in general and IronPython in particular .
( Before becoming a .NET programmer Gary was a smalltalk developer . )
The interview took place during the BASTA conference in Germany ; in a bar , so the audio starts of a bit rough but improves as the interview progresses .
I even reveal my mystery past and what I did before programming in Python .
Oh , and just for the record - I was the first Microsoft dynamic languages MVP .
Setting Registry Entries on Install
On Windows Vista setting registry entries on install is hard .
It is likely that Microsoft do n't care - the official guidance is to set entries on first run and not on install , but there are perfectly valid reasons to want to do this .
The problem is that for a non -admin user installation requires an administrator to authenticate , and the install then runs as the admin user not as the original user .
So if you set any registry keys using HKEY_LOCAL_USER then they will be set for the wrong user and not visible to your application when the real user runs it .
The answer is to set keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE , which is not an ideal answer but at least it works .
The problem comes if you need write access to those registry keys ; the non-admin user does n't have write access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE .
When you create the key you can set the permissions though , but you need to know the magic incantations .
In IronPython ( easy to translate to C# if necessary ) the requisite magic to allow write access to all authenticated users is :
from Microsoft .
Win32 import Registry
from System .
Security .
AccessControl import RegistryAccessRule , RegistryRights , AccessControlType
from System .
Security .
Principal import SecurityIdentifier , WellKnownSidType
REG_KEY_PATH = " SOFTWARE\\SomeKey\\SomeSubKey "
key = Registry .
LocalMachine .
CreateSubKey ( REG_KEY_PATH )
ra = RegistryAccessRule ( SecurityIdentifier ( WellKnownSidType .
AuthenticatedUserSid , None ) ,
RegistryRights .
FullControl , AccessControlType .
Allow )
rs = key .
GetAccessControl ( )
rs .
AddAccessRule ( ra )
key .
SetAccessControl ( rs )
key .
Close ( )
Of course the next issue is what happens when you make your application run as 32 bit on a 64 bit OS ( to workaround in part the horrific performance of the 64bit . NET JIT ) .
Hint , the registry keys will have been created in the WOW6432 Node .
If you want to use the standard locations and share between 64 and 32 bit applications then you need to look into reflection ( which copies keys between the 32 and 64 bit registry trees ) with RegEnableReflectionKey ( although it 's not entirely clear whether you need to enable or disable reflection to share keys , but thankfully I have n't yet needed to experiment with this ) .
More Fun at PyCon 2009
PyCon 2009 was awesome fun , as many others have charted .
The highlights of the conference were , as always , meeting and mixing with such a rich combination of clever and fun people - all of whom I have Python in common with .
It was a mix of new friends and old friends , far too many to mention all of them .
The Hyatt hotel in which PyCon was held in had the rooms on all four external walls , interconnected with a grand structure that someone nicknamed the fragatorium :
The tenth floor made an ideal launching point for the balsa aeroplanes being given out by the Wingware guys .
The fleet :
Mr. Tartley getting ready to launch :
We did manage to get one to the other side , and even caught a photo of plane in flight .
Unfortunately I 'm rubbish at remembering to take photos , about the only genuine conference photo I took was of the VM panel discussion .
During the sprints there was much ridiculousness around the Django Pony , that somehow ended up with the domain ponysex .us being hosted on my server !
As an added bonus I was elected to membership of the Python Software Foundation ( PSF ) during the conference .
This means two things in practise ; a new opportunity to bikeshed on the PSF mailing list and new opportunities to volunteer for extra work !
D'oh .
Distributed Test System at Resolver Systems
There is quite a discussion going on the Testing in Python mailing list .
A lot of it was kicked off by Jesse Noller discussing the new distributed testing framework he wants to build .
Just for the record , here is a rough outline of how we do distributed testing over a network at Resolver Systems .
It is a ' home - grown ' system and so is fairly specific to our needs , but it works very well .
The master machine does a full binary build , sets up a new test run in the database ( there can be multiple simultaneously ) , then pushes the binary build with test framework and the build guid to all the machines being used in the build ( machines are specified by name in command line arguments or a config file when the build is started ) .
The master introspects the build run ( collects all the tests ) and pushes a list of all tests by class name into the database .
When the zip file arrives on a slave machine a daemon unzips and deletes the original zipfile .
Each slave then pulls the next five test classes out of the database and runs them in a subprocess .
Each test method pushes the result ( pass , failure , time taken for test , machine it was run on , build guid and traceback on failure ) to the database .
If the subprocess fails to report anything after a preset time ( 45 mins I think currently ) then it kills the test process and reports the failure to the database .
Performance tests typically run each test five times and push the times taken to a separate table so that we can monitor performance of our application separately .
The advantage of the client pulling tests is that if a slave machine dies we have a maximum of five test classes for that build that fail to run .
It also automatically balances tests between machines without having to worry about whether a particular set of tests will take much longer than another set .
A web application allows us to view each build - number of tests left , number of passes , errors and failures .
For errors and failures tracebacks can be viewed whilst the test run is still in progress .
Builds with errors / failures are marked in red .
Completed test runs with all passes are marked in green .
Easily being able to see the total number of tests in a run makes it easy to see when tests are accidentally getting missed out .
A completed run emails the developers the results .
The web page for each build allows us to pull machines out whilst the tests are running .
If a machine is stopped then it stops pulling tests from the database ( but runs to completion those it already has ) .
Machines can be added or re-added from the command line .
We have a build farm ( about six machines currently ) typically running two continuous integration loops - SVN head and the branch for the last release .
These run tests continuously - not just when new checkins are made .
This works very well for us , although we are continually tweaking the system .
It is all built on unittest .
The system that Jesse Noller will have as its foundation a text based protocol ( XML or YAML ) for describing test results .
These can be stored in a database or as flat files for analysis and reporting tools to build on top of .
For a test protocol representing results of test runs I would want the following fields :
Build UUID
Machine identifier
Test identifier : typically in the form package.module.Class.test_method ( but a unique string anyway )
( but a unique string anyway ) Time of test start
Time taken for test ( useful for identifying slow running tests , slow downs or anomalies )
Result : PASS / FAIL / ERROR / SKIP
Traceback
Anything else ?
What about collecting standard out even if a test passes ?
Coverage information ?
We sometimes have to kill wedged test processes and need to push an error result back .
This can be hard to associate with an individual test , in which case we leave the test identifier blank .
Extra information ( charts ? ) can be generated from this data .
If there is a need to store additional information associated with an individual test then an additional ' information ' field could be used to provide it .
A lot of the other discussion on the mailing list has been around changes and potential changes to the unittest module - changes that started in the PyCon sprint .
I 'll be doing a series of blog posts on these in the coming days .
Essential Programming Skills : Reading and Writing
As a programmer there are two basic skills vital to your productivity : how fast you can type and how fast you can read .
On typing , Steve Yegge said it best of course in Programming 's Dirtiest Little Secret .
I often mock Mr. Tartley for being a hunter pecker , but he can really type quite fast with his two fat fingers .
I taught myself to touch type with Mavis Beacon back when I was selling bricks and found it enormously freeing .
Being able to type without having to look at the keyboard makes a massive difference .
There are a host of tools that will help you learn or practise touch typing .
I 've just discovered ( via Miguel de Icaza ) a fun web based one , that you can fire up at any time .
You race against other players typing short passages from books , with visual cues when you make mistakes .
It even lets you setup private games to race against a set of friends .
My only criticism is that there is n't enough punctuation to really practise typing for programmers ( programmer specific version anyone ? ) :
The combination of competition , short doses and interesting passages make it fun , addictive and actually useful .
My average WPM is 52 at the moment , but I reckon if I practise a few times a day I 'll pick up speed .
The correlating skill essential for programmers needing to browse countless pages of documentation and information from blogs that may or may not be useful is speed reading .
The following tool is great for practising , but I 'm also finding it useful for quickly reading long passages of text .
It shows you the text a line at a time , moving the focused part quickly ( at a speed you can configure and control from the keyboard ) from left to right .
This mirrors ( unsurprisingly ) the way I skim read blogs etc .
The problem is that I often involuntarily skip passages whilst skim reading - this tool is good for practise but also helps me to read quickly without missing bits .

WHEN THE 1981 - 82 recession put a dent in steak sales , things could have gotten dicey for A1 Steak Sauce .
Yet the 100 - year - old brand turned adversity into great advertising .
You might remember the TV spot :
As a family sits around the dinner table , an incredulous kid catches sight of his uncle drowning a burger in A1 .
“ Mom , ” the kid blurts out , “ he ’s putting A1 Steak Sauce on his hamburger ! ”
The boy ’s uncle responds , “ My dear nephew , what is hamburger , chopped ham ?
No .
It is chopped steak .
And what tastes better on steak than A1 ? ”
And then the killer tagline : “ A1 makes hamburgers taste like steakburgers . ”
It was brilliant repositioning .
In one bold stroke , A1 shed its filet mignon pedigree in favor of a recession - proof staple .
( And it ’s been there ever since ; Burger King ’s $ 3.79 Steakhouse Burger is slathered in the sauce . )
This episode illustrates the cardinal rule of recession marketing :
When life gives you hamburger , make chopped steak .
If only it were still so easy .
After years of being sold useless stuff , we media - savvy consumers can spot a con job when we see one .
We know advertising is a game ; our idea of entertainment is watching the cigarette smoke - and - mirrors heyday of Madison Avenue on Mad Men or Trust Me‘s Sarah Krajicek - Hunter as she comes to terms with shilling for Dove shampoo ( which is , in itself , a genius bit of shilling ) .
So when we see Dodge dealerships offering two - for - one deals or Ed McMahon joking about his home foreclosure while flacking for Cash 4 Gold , we ’re less likely to be swayed than wonder if that ’s truly the best our sharpest marketing minds can come up with .
Still , one feels a twinge of empathy while imagining the flop sweat of the modern - day Don Drapers as they try to figure out how to help their belt - tightening clients keep their belt - tightening customers .
And all this at a time when print media seems to be on its deathbed and Internet marketing looks like the Wild West .
In a striking admission of the chaotic new reality , in March the advertising goliath Ogilvy & Mather — which counts Coca - Cola , Ford , Kraft , and IBM among its blue - chip clients — launched a dedicated Recession Marketing Practice .
Brochures announcing the new venture ooze confidence , but also give off a slightly ominous vibe ; they open with a quote from Charles Darwin ( “ It is not the strong , nor the intelligent who survive , but those who are quickest to adapt ” ) and prominently feature Ogilvy ’s fatalistic motto : “ We sell — or else . ”
Forget dog eat dog .
This is Wild Kingdom meets Glengarry Glen Ross .
The timid are about to be culled from the herd .
The key to brand survival , Ogilvy asserts , is for companies to do anything but “ go dark ” — i.e. , fire their ad agency .
Conveniently for ad firms , students of recession and depression economics ( from Wharton professors to basement - dwelling business bloggers ) advise spending as much on ads as possible — to “ steer into the skid , ” rather than slam on the brakes and wind up in the ditch .
According to Ogilvy ’s own stats , companies with enough cojones “ to increase marketing spend ” will dramatically enlarge their market share during the recession and — just as enticingly — recover an average of three times faster once happy days return .
Counterintuitively , product visibility , more than price cuts or gimmicks like BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , drives consumers ’ purchases in tough times .
Better , in short , to blow your budget on aggressive advertising than to lose money offering discounts .
But the real challenge — the art , even — of recession marketing is perfecting a pitch that does n’t emphasize your hunger for your cash - conscious buyers ’ cash .
Ogilvy recommends using “ reassurance messages ” — acknowledgments of the current situation , couched in a spirit of we ’re - in - this - together - ness .
A good example is a recent Allstate commercial , in which Dennis Haysbert ( known as 24‘s crisis - plagued first black president ) intones over a Ken Burns - style slideshow of Depression - era photographs , “ 1931 was not exactly a great year to start a business , but that ’s when Allstate opened its doors . ”
He goes on , “ After the fears subside , a funny thing happens : People start enjoying the small things in life — a home - cooked meal , time with loved ones , appreciating the things we do have , the things we can count on .
It ’s back to basics , and the basics are good . ”
What exactly home cooking has to do with car insurance is unclear , but that ’s the point .
Allstate is feeling our pain .
Not that any of this has to be true or even reflect consumers ’ best interests :
Reassurance messages , Ogilvy notes , “ do n’t need to be purely rational , of course .
Indeed , there is growing evidence that emotionally based messages are more persuasive than rational ones . ”
Hard to believe companies pay big bucks for news flashes like this .
Ogilvy ’s already tried to work its magic for Kool - Aid , a Kraft brand that competes with soft drinks — one of the first things it claims recession - spooked consumers stop buying .
“ For the price of one bottle of soda , you can mix up five big pitchers of Kool - Aid , ” the ad announces , closing with this feel - good tag : “ For pennies a glass , keep the whole family refreshed and smiling ! ” Seriously ?
Is that all it takes to keep consumers drinking the Kool - Aid ?
Maybe so .
Like Ogilvy emphasizes , it ’s not about intelligence ; it ’s about speed .
In March , after a year of heavy losses , Starbucks announced a new line of instant - coffee packets that sold for less than a dollar apiece .
Right idea , but way too late :
The coffee juggernaut ’s competitors had been attacking its upscale image for months .
Dunkin’ Donuts had orchestrated an online “ Friends Do n’t Let Friends Drink Starbucks ” viral campaign .
McDonald ’s was even blunter , rolling out a line of specialty coffees with the in - your - face slogan “ Four bucks is dumb .
Now serving espresso . ”
And just like that , fancy - schmancy coffee had been reclaimed for the masses .
So if a $ 4 mocha latte is now a ridiculous extravagance , how do aspirational brands advertise their way out of this ?
The current downturn hit just as Hyundai was completing its transformation from economy to luxury brand , unveiling the $ 37,000 Genesis 4.6 sedan .
It could hardly pitch its new line of Lexus wannabes as a frugal investment , nor could it slash prices .
In January , it revealed the ultimate reassurance ploy , the Hyundai Assurance Plan .
The premise was simple and eye - catching : Buy one of our cars , and if you lose your job , we ’ll buy it back .
Once you get into the fine print , of course , the deal is n’t as great as it sounds .
The offer is only good for the first year of ownership , if you have made several payments already ( or made a steep down payment ) , and if you can prove that you lost your job involuntarily or went bankrupt .
Even then , the Assurance Plan only covers up to $ 7,500 worth of depreciation .
But what ’s remarkable about the promotion is that Hyundai is betting that most buyers will keep their jobs and any returned cars will retain a significant percentage of their value — two assumptions that echo the gamble that landed us in so much trouble in the housing market .
The genius of subprime lending was supposed to be the invincible collateral of a big - ticket item .
But when too many buyers default on their payments , that same collateral floods the market and swamps new sales — be that for a house or a car .
Still , the pitch worked , at least for a month : Hyundai ’s January sales jumped 14 percent compared with January 2008 , even as the rest of the auto industry ’s dropped 37 percent .
With numbers like those , other companies are bound to mimic the strategy .
( JetBlue already has . )
Whatever it takes to make the unnecessary seem less unnecessary .
Of course , it ’s not a bad thing if the recession encourges consumers — and by extension , corporate America — to live more within their means .
Just in the past few months , GM has announced that it will eliminate its Hummer brand as part of its restructuring ; communities across the country , saddled with the closures of chains like Circuit City and Linens ‘n Things , have passed bans on superstores ; and sagging sales for the four largest bottled water labels have led their parent companies to cut back on production .
Maybe this truly is the dawning of a new market Darwinism .
Who will mourn if gas - guzzling SUVs , big - box stores , and mountains of plastic waste go the way of the dodo ?
Madison Avenue will , but it will still find a way to repackage our newfound distrust of the big , the slick , and the entitled .
Consider a recent Cheetos campaign that never explicitly mentions the economy but plays out like textbook class warfare .
In a spot first aired during what some pessimists dubbed the “ Dust Bowl Super Bowl , ” a woman munches Cheetos while she listens to a snooty soccer mom go on about her son ’s “ trilingual immersion program . ”
In the end , the beleaguered woman smears her orange - cheese - tipped fingers all over the back of the snob ’s white jacket .
Another spot features a guy named Alejandro eating Flaming Hot Cheetos until his eyes water and his nose runs ; when his Gordon Gekko - type boss mistakes him for sick and orders him home , Alejandro responds in an ironic monotone , “ Okay , I ’ll do it for the sake of this great American corporation . ”
The message : Your mass - produced corporate junk food hates rich people as much as you do .
Space shuttle Atlantis is poised to lift off on NASA 's final trip to the Hubble Space Telescope .

BAGHDAD  Violence erupted across Iraq on Monday in attacks that left at least 32 people dead and scores wounded , including a suicide bombing at a crowded wake that killed at least 19 mourners .
The suicide attack took place just after sunset at a wake for the brother of an official of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party near Jalawla , a small town in Diyala Province .
Mourners had gathered when a man detonated a belt of explosives , sending a powerful blast through the crowd and wounding 39 people , security officials said .
Parts of Diyala Province remain a haven for Sunni extremists , who have taken refuge in the province ’s palm groves , mountains and sparsely patrolled deserts .
Jalawla is particularly unstable , however , as it lies along a volatile fault line across the country of territories claimed by the Kurdistan region to the north and the Arab - majority governments in Baghdad and the provinces .
Tensions have run high in towns in the area , which stretches east from Syria to Mosul and then drops southeast toward the Iranian border .

China and Russia forge closer military cooperation
By John Chan
26 May 2009
As the US war in Afghanistan and US - sponsored fighting in Pakistan intensify , Russia and China are stepping up military cooperation , with 25 joint manoeuvres announced this year .
Previously , China had held a total of just 21 military exercises with foreign countries since 2002 .
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) Council of Defence Ministers meeting held on April 29 confirmed the plans .
The meeting issued a political disclaimer , denying the body was becoming a military alliance .
All drills , it stated , were focussed on the “ war on terror , ” not against a third country .
There is little doubt , however , that military ties between China and Russia are aimed at countering the US .
Last December , Chinese president Hu Jintao called for closer defence cooperation , saying : “ I hope ... to advance the China - Russia strategic partnership and the relationship between the two militaries from a new historical starting point to better and faster development toward the future . ”
The SCO was established in 2001 in response to growing US relations with former Soviet republics in energy - rich Central Asia , which both China and Russia regard as vital strategically .
The organisation expanded in scope following the US invasion of Afghanistan .
In 2005 , China and Russia held their first joint military exercises , which in 2007 were enlarged into a SCO - wide event .
The SCO includes Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan .
India , Pakistan , Mongolia and Iran have observer status .
This year ’s war games have already begun .
In April , SCO held a joint “ anti- terror ” exercise in Tajikistan near the border with Afghanistan .
The main exercise — “ Peace Mission 2009 , ” planned for July - August — will resemble a conventional drill operation , involving more than 2,000 Russian and Chinese troops and heavy weapons such as tanks , transport planes , self - propelled artillery and possibly strategic bombers .
The three - stage exercise , which is being planned in Russia , will take place in northeastern China , close to the border with Mongolia .
The announcement of closer Russo - Chinese military cooperation came just as Russian relations with NATO deteriorated over Georgia .
Tbilisi accused Russia of being behind the mutiny of a Georgian tank battalion in late April , while Moscow condemned NATO ’s 27 - day military exercise in Georgia that started from May 5 .
On April 28 , Chinese Defence Minister Liang Guanglie headed a delegation to Russia ’s North Caucasus military district to discuss regional security with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev .
On April 30 , Russia signed five - year defence agreements with Georgia ’s two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , allowing Russian forces to guard their borders .
The driving force behind closer Russo - Chinese relations is their mutual concern over US strategic plans to bring the energy - rich Eurasian heartland under its wing .
The Obama administration has made friendly gestures toward Russia , China and Iran , but escalated the war in Afghanistan and now Pakistan .
Beijing and Moscow regard these moves as even more menacing than the Bush administration ’s war in Iraq .
The Asia Times commented on May 14 : “ Think of Afghanistan , then , as an overlooked subplot in the ongoing Liquid [ oil and gas ] War .
After all , an overarching goal of US foreign policy since president Richard Nixon ’s era in the early 1970s has been to split Russia and China .
The leadership of the SCO has been focused on this since the US Congress passed the Silk Road Strategy
Act five days before beginning the bombing of Serbia in March 1999 .
That act clearly identified American geostrategic interests from the Black Sea to western China with building a mosaic of American protectorates in Central Asia and militarising the Eurasian energy corridor .
Afghanistan , as it happens , sits conveniently at the crossroads of any new Silk Road linking the Caucasus to western China , and four nuclear powers ( China , Russia , Pakistan and India ) lurk in the vicinity . ”
Increasingly , Central Asia has become an arena of rivalry between the major powers .
Under pressure from Moscow and Beijing , the SCO called in 2005 for the removal of US bases from Central Asia .
Uzbekistan shut down the US air base and earlier this year Kyrgyzstan announced the closure of the Manus base , which had been used by the US military to ferry supplies to Afghanistan .
The latter announcement coincided with a Russian offer of $ US2.15 billion in aid .
With the border areas of Pakistan increasingly embroiled in war , the Pentagon has been searching for alternative supply routes into landlocked Afghanistan .
Given that Washington has no relations with Iran , the only option is through Central Asia .
The US signed agreements this year with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , two SCO states bordering Afghanistan , to allow the transit of limited military cargo .
However , most routes through Central Asia require the tacit approval of Russia , which has looked for significant concessions in return , such as the ending of plans to incorporate Georgia and the Ukraine into NATO .
The Pentagon is attempting to develop a new supply route from the Black Sea via Georgia and Azerbaijan to Turkmenistan , bypassing Russia .
Russia is boosting its influence in Central Asia with aid and military cooperation .
In February , Moscow established a rapid response force of 3,000 troops as part of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO ) , comprising the former Soviet republics of Russia , Belarus , Armenia , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan .
The plan is to enlarge the force to 10,000 .
Not all Central Asian members of SCO are firmly under Moscow ’s influence .
Uzbekistan , for instance , refused to take part in the three - day SCO anti-terror exercise on the Tajik - Afghan border in April .
Uzbekistan was an important US partner in Central Asia until 2005 , when it turned sharply to Moscow , after Western criticisms of its crackdown on political opposition .
Last October , the EU lifted its sanctions on Uzbekistan , which sent security personnel to Germany to discuss the possibility of a transit route to Afghanistan — without consultation with Russia .
In November , Uzbekistan withdrew from the Eurasian Economic Community , in opposition to plans by Russia , Kazakhstan and Belarus to create a custom union .
A major focus of US strategy is gas - producing Turkmenistan .
Russia has been looking to Central Asia to provide gas as its own Soviet - era fields reach the end of their life .
Moscow cannot , however , afford to pay the high prices promised to Turkmenistan last year .
Washington is seeking to persuade the Turkmen leadership to bypass Russia and use alternative pipelines to export directly to Europe .
The US is also backing a gas pipeline linking Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India , via Afghanistan .
The US also faces challenges from China , which is in a strong position to exploit Russian and Central Asian energy supplies .
In February , Beijing signed oil deals worth $ 25 billion with Russia and $ 10 billion with Kazakhstan .
In Turkmenistan , Beijing is building the world ’s longest ( 7,000 kilometres ) and most expensive ( $ 26 billion ) pipeline for transporting gas to southern China .
In signing the deal , Beijing insisted that its interests should not be threatened by “ third parties ” — a clear reference to barring US bases .
Heightened Russo - Chinese military cooperation in response to the US wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan is another indication of the potential for wider conflicts over the key strategic region of Central Asia .

The best thing anyone can do to continue making the Internet more closed , restrictive , and prohibiting is to use Adobe Flash as it exists today .
The Internet was created to allow for the open and unconfined infrastructure to share information ; yet , it is being used today for the opposite purpose : to stop this information torrent .
Many people do not see Flash as an issue , and do n’t view Adobe as a malevolent authoritarian .
In fact , though , Flash is the biggest bottleneck on the Internet ’s effectiveness in the same way that the variety of world languages spoken worldwide is the biggest bottleneck on the global social network .
A change in Adobe ’s business strategy with regards to Flash is the only way to turn this unnecessary throttle on the potential of the Internet - connected community into a true innovation and synergistic technology .
Some may not notice the restrictions we experience in our everyday lives .
One such restriction is that of software like Flash .
In the video market alone , Flash is the number one method used to control access to “ intellectual property ” .
Flash does much more than just restrict video content , though .
Unlike HTML and Javascript , which are saved in human - readable formats , Flash files are in a format that only computers can read , so nobody is able to see exactly what these files are doing to their computers .
Because of this , anybody can restrict access to the content of the file itself , or even include viruses or other malicious software through the use of Flash Player .
The biggest restricting factor , though , is the fact that consumers must use the software distributed by Adobe in order to view Flash files in their entirety .
This is a major problem because , with a 99 % market penetration , Adobe can do anything it would like .
Adobe Flash is installed on more computers than even Microsoft Windows , which naturally gives them a huge amount of power .
The dependency of people on Flash Player is so great that Adobe could chose any day to shut all installations of Flash Player down until the user payed a $ 40 ransom fee .
If Adobe ever fell short of money , this would be a convenient and no-hassle way to gain money , considering most people would end up paying this fee for access to games , videos , and a multitude of other possibilities online we often take for granted .
This is only the tip of the iceberg , though .
Adobe could block out competitors ’ software , spy on the users , or even include a “ back door ” to allow employees to remotely control anybody ’s computer .
With Flash ’s massive install base , Adobe could technically do anything they want to your computer .
Devoted individuals have begun developing alternatives through reverse engineering , such as “ Gnash ” and “ swfdec ” , but those are still unable to be completed due to the lack of cooperation by Adobe .
Adobe initiated the “ Open Screen Project ” to give the appearance that it promoted choice in platforms and ease any fears regarding Adobe ’s obsessive control , yet it really just restates the knowledge that was already gained through the effort of previous reverse engineering techniques .
The only benefit of the Open Screen Project was the promise Adobe made not to sue any Flash - alternative projects , yet this promise , in reality , just affirms the excessive control Adobe has over the platform .
Recently , Adobe sent a Cease and Desist to SourceForge , a company that hosts community - developed software projects , regarding a hosted project called “ rtmpdump ” .
This project opened up features of Flash to average people that were previously only available in Adobe ’s Flash Player .
Despite Adobe ’s claim to transparency and neutrality , SourceForge was required to remove rtmpdump from its site , confirming yet again the massive amount of power Adobe has .
A further issue with the Flash format is its dependency on software patented by multiple companies .
These patents make Adobe ’s promise worthless , as other companies also have the right to sue when their own patents are violated .
Patent law was created to encourage innovation , but when computers entered the scene , corporations found they could benefit from the law by exploiting loopholes that allowed software to be patented .
Eventually , trying to patent as many elementary concepts as possible became a business strategy , and any company who did n’t follow this strategy risked a lawsuit .
Software patents have ranged from online tests to pop-up windows to hyperlinks to progress bars .
In addition , almost all of the major audio , video , and image formats are or have been covered under numerous patents .
As you can well imagine , nearly all computer software is covered by multiple patents from various companies .
The biggest companies pool their patents together and agree not to sue each other in exchange for access to the patents from the other biggest corporations .
In this way , Adobe can not be sued for using certain components in Flash , but everyone else can for using those same components .
With the inability for consumers to use any alternative Flash players besides the one created by Adobe , one would expect the official player to be of high quality , right ?
Studies have found the opposite to be true .
Not only does Flash have a huge number of security problems , but it also slows down computers significantly , especially computers that run operating systems other than Microsoft Windows .
Flash consumes an average of 50 - 80 % of system resources on Mac OSX .
The leading cause of crashes in the Mozilla Firefox web browser , according to the bug reports submitted by users , is the Flash Plugin .
Unfortunately , this is something Mozilla cannot improve , no matter how badly their users want it , because Adobe will not allow it .
Efficiency can be measured in more than just performance , though .
Flash users who want to minimize their carbon footprint will be unhappy to know how negatively Flash affects power usage .
Flash , especially banner ads cause ones computer to use much more energy .
Simply disabling Flash saves an equivalent amount of power to turning off a light bulb .
The most logical solution to this problem would be for Adobe to allow open access to view , modify , and distribute to the code programmers will understand used to develop Flash .
This strategy would have a multitude of benefits for not only consumers and Adobe as a company , but for society as a whole .
Collectively , consumers would like the best possible experience online , and Adobe would like to make as much money as possible .
Both of these private interests would be stimulated .
Consumers would benefit greatly with Adobe ’s decision to allow open and unrestricted modification and distribution to its platform .
Consumers would no longer have to worry about what would happen if Adobe tried to exercise excessive control over users , because anyone would be able to modify Flash to exclude the offending features .
If this were to happen , Adobe would no doubt lose its reputation ; however , if it were to happen today , it is possible that nobody would ever find out .
It has been shown by projects such as the Linux kernel that those who can , will make changes to software to scratch personal itches .
Corporations will naturally make changes to improve community - developed software when it will help that corporation ’s own products .
A multitude of corporations currently depend on Flash , making them all candidates to assist in improving Flash Player for the benefit of all .
Speed is important to everybody , especially wealthy corporations that want their employees to be as productive as possible .
As demonstrated by the Linux kernel , security and stability problems in community - developed software get fixed incredibly quickly .
Adobe is the party that would yield the largest benefit from opening up Flash .
Adobe ’s business strategy with regards to Flash is to develop a massive number of technologies centering around Flash , and then sell a really expensive software to create Flash videos .
The vast majority of these technologies have opened source code to stimulate usage and entice those who like modifiable and redistributable software .
Unfortunately for Adobe , these have not penetrated the target market because the product they depend on , Flash , does not allow modification or redistribution .
Adobe ’s other income with regards to Flash come from licensing versions of Flash Player for use on embedded platforms , such as cell phones .
While it is logical to expect monetary reimbursement from large corporations for the ability to use Flash Player , problems arise when these corporations choose not to pay for the license .
A notable example of this is with the iPhone .
The lack of cooperation by corporations results in Adobe losing control , because it limits access to the software from potential users .
Through the exploitation of this target market ( all Internet - connected users )
Flash has the potential to become a true standard ; in this case , Adobe would hold the key to producing content for the standard : “ Adobe Creative Suite 4 ” , its flagship product .
Allowing public access and modification to a company ’s software is the only way to allow other corporations to help increase that company ’s market share .
For example , Flash could be improved by search engine companies to allow content to be indexed more easily , benefiting all companies involved and allowing for further standardization .
There are other possible solutions to this problem , though they are not as elegant or effective .
For instance , it is possible for some devoted activists to start a new software project to replace Flash .
It would have similar features , but would not be compatible with existing Flash scripts .
Though many appreciate the value of this type of project , it would nevertheless advance very slowly in what we have come to expect out of modern Internet - based technologies .
It would also make extra overhead for the consumer , creating the need to install yet another web browser plug - in .
Finally , this solution would divert developer time away from Flash Player alternative projects , such as Gnash and swfdec , which are increasingly necessary , and make it impossible to use the existing jungle of Flash scripts .
Another solution , though much less plausible , is for consumers to stop using Flash altogether .
The problems that come attached to this solution are obvious , though .
First of all , it is nearly impossible to raise awareness for any cause , especially one that takes a long time for people to understand .
In addition , Flash has become too embedded within the lifestyles of many Internet - connected users to “ just quit ” .
With dependencies on video sharing sites , education material , games , and more , only the most devoted users would be able to resist the pressure .
This option would be much more effective as a protest technique to convince Adobe to allow modification than it would be as a solution on its own .
As you can see , Flash started out as a slightly obnoxious insect , but it grew over time into the monster that it is today .
Adobe has too much control over the software .
The control it has makes it impossible for Internet content to be truly accessible to everyone , and requires every user to subject his / herself to Adobe .
It also carries a large number of problems along with it that Adobe has no desire to solve , as solving them would not increase its market share .
By allowing the modification and redistribution of Flash , both Adobe and its consumers would benefit from the synergy that would be achieved .
Nobody can build a skyscraper alone .
Until Adobe makes
Flash more permissible , Flash users have no choice but to sit in the monster ’s mouth and hope it does n’t get hungry .

A SHOCKING study reveals one in four maintenance workers on Scotland 's busiest roads have tested positive for drugs .
The Record can reveal that a quarter of staff at BEAR Scotland who were randomly selected failed a drug test .
But a letter to all employees , passed to the Record , confirmed that boss Bill Taylor took no action against his workers despite admitting the figures were " alarming " .
The managing director also stated : " All of the people who failed tests work on the high - speed trunk road network and some operate large vehicles and equipment . "
Last night , politicians , road watchdogs and drugs agencies called for a probe into the " astonishing and unacceptably high " numbers , claiming lives were being put at risk .
The firm employ 440 staff to carry out safety repairs and maintenance for Transport Scotland after being awarded two five - year multimillion - pound contracts for the north and south - east .
In the north , they look after major roads leading to Inverness , Fraserburgh , Aberdeen , Dundee , Perth and Stirling , including the busy A90 , A92 , A9 and M876 route to Kincardine Bridge .
And in the south , they maintain the M8 from the outskirts of Glasgow to Edinburgh as well as key routes from the capital to the Borders .
They are also responsible for the M9 motorway from Edinburgh and Stirling and the M90 between Edinburgh and Perth .
In his letter , BEAR chief Taylor stated : " The recent random tests produced a failure for illegal substances of over 25 per cent which , I have to say , I find alarming . "
He went on to confirm that " on this occasion only " , no employee would be disciplined in their shocking first round of random testing .
Politicians were astounded when they heard about the percentage of workers who tested positive for illegal substances .
Shadow Scots justice secretary Richard Baker said : " The fact that this involves road safety makes it a particularly serious issue .
" I am astonished that so many workers , many of whom work with heavy machinery , failed drug tests and yet no disciplinary action appears to have been taken .
" Any employee working on a busy road , or with machinery , who is under the influence of drugs , puts themselves , their colleagues and the public at risk . "
BEAR Scotland said two more tests have been taken since their first set of random samples last March which produced the 25 per cent failure rate .
This time they insisted that the failure rate had dropped to 7.5 per cent - around one in 12 - and the workers involved had been disciplined .
A BEAR Scotland spokeswoman said : " In March 2008 , 32 employees were randomly tested for drugs .
Of those tested , eight indicated potential failure .
" Since then , two more sets of random tests have been carried out which have resulted in a failure rate of 7.5 per cent .
" All cases have been dealt with in line with our internal disciplinary procedures and Transport Scotland has been kept informed of these issues .
We are continuing to work strenuously to have this rate further reduced .
Hazardous
" Bear Scotland treat drug and alcohol misuse with the highest concern .
" In developing our policies , we take account of the hazardous environment in which we work and the safety of both our own staff and of road users . "
But politicians insisted that the number of workers still failing the tests was " unacceptable " .
Tory justice spokesman Bill Aitken said : " I am extremely concerned for the public safety as 25 per cent testing positive for drugs .
is quite astonishing and , as Mr Taylor said himself , ' alarming ' .
" While Mr Taylor can justifiably claim that the number has fallen significantly since the first test , a one - in - 12 failure rate is still unacceptable .
" The message sent out after the first random test is one of ludicrous leniency . "
Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman Alison McInnes said : " Illegal drugs and driving can be a lethal combination anyway but when heavy equipment and high speeds are included , then the risk of serious accidents becomes even greater .
" The Transport Minister needs to look into this .
We need to be reassured that those who operate heavy machinery and maintain our roads are not themselves a safety risk . "
An RAC spokeswoman said : " I would be very concerned for the safety of everyone who uses those trunk roads if 25 per cent of the workforce maintaining them were on drugs .
" I do n't see the point in taking the random tests if they are not going to take action against employees who take drugs .
I think there is a need for the Scottish government to investigate as a matter of urgency . "
Former director of Scotland Against Drugs , Alistair Ramsay - now chairman of consultancy firm Drugwise - said it was " very alarming " for every motorist .
He added : " These figures are much higher by any employment standards and are totally unacceptable and should be investigated . "
Transport Scotland , who awarded the contracts to BEAR , said the company were under no obligation to alert them to a drugs problem among staff .
A spokesman said : " While we expect employees of our operating companies to perform their duties in a safe and professional manner , o u r c o n t r a c t s w i t h t h e s e companies make no stipulation that employees be subject to random drug testing .
" Results of any random drug tests are a matter for BEAR Scotland . "
NEW YORK - Alicia Istanbul woke up one recent Wednesday to find herself locked out of the Facebook account she opened in 2007 , one Facebook suddenly deemed fake .
The stay - at - home mom was cut off not only from her 330 friends , including many she had no other way of contacting , but also from the pages she had set up for the jewelry design business she runs from her Atlanta - area home .
Although Istanbul understands why Facebook insists on having real people behind real names for every account , she wonders why the online hangout did n't simply ask before acting .
" They should at least give you a warning , or at least give you the benefit of the doubt , " she said .
" I was on it all day .
I had built my entire social network around it .
That 's what Facebook wants you to do . "
Facebook 's effort to purge its site of fake accounts , in the process knocking out some real people with unusual names , marks yet another challenge for the 5 - year - old social network .
Having grown from a closed network available only to college students to a global social hub used by multiple generations , Facebook has worked over the years to shape its guidelines and features to fit its changing audience .
But requiring people to sign up under their real name is part of what makes Facebook Facebook .
To make sure people can't set up accounts with fake names , the site has a long , constantly updated " blacklist " of names that people can't use .
Those could either be ones that sound fake , like Batman , or names tied to current events , like Susan Boyle .
While there are dozens of Susan Boyles on Facebook already , people who tried to sign up with that name after the 47 - year - old woman became an unlikely singing sensation had more difficulty doing so .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt acknowledged that Facebook does make mistakes on occasion , and he apologized for " any inconvenience . "
But he said situations like Istanbul 's are very rare , and most accounts that are disabled for being fake really are .
" The vast , vast , vast majority of people we disable we never hear from again , " he said .
Because the exceptions are so rare , he said , prior notification is " not something we are doing right now . "
Because Facebook has only about 850 employees worldwide , getting complaints answered can take a long time .
Istanbul , whose father is from Istanbul , Turkey , said it took three weeks to get her account reinstated .
Without being able to log in for that time , she said she felt " completely cut off " from her contacts .
Frustrated , she wrote e-mails , then mailed letters to 12 Facebook executives .
To keep in touch with her friends and monitor her business pages , Istanbul said she sort of " hijacked " her husband 's account .
" I think they just assume you can't have an interesting name , " she said of Facebook .
" I kept my maiden name because it 's such an interesting name , I did n't want to give it up .
And now I am having to defend my name . "
Istanbul 's sister , Lisa Istanbul Krikorian , also got locked out of her Facebook account , which she opened a year and a half ago .
So she opened another one that omits her maiden name .
Their mother and their cousin , who both joined the social network more recently , could n't sign up under their real names .

Today I thought I ’d share what I know about setting up a certificate of deposit ladder , or CD ladder .
In short , a CD ladder is a set of CDs that you might invest in , that are set to expire at successive dates , where the cash from the expiring CD is used to reinvest in another CD one period older than the oldest CD currently in the ladder .
Confused yet ?
Okay , let ’s take a step back and discuss how CDs work .
Then I ’ll jump into the CD laddering strategy .
What are Certificates of Deposit ?
Certificates of Deposits , or CDs , are a short - term investment product offered by most banking institutions .
They ’re sort of like a savings account , except they are not as liquid and they pay a nicer , fixed interest rate .
Liquid means how easily you can get your money out , or how “ available ” your money is .
CDs have a designated maturity date and do n’t become liquid until the period expires ( matures ) .
This is the reason they can pay a nicer interest rate than a typical savings account .
You ’re simply trading liquidity for higher interest .
Higher interest is of course what we all want .
But we each have different needs when it comes to liquidity .
Some need their money next month .
Others do n’t need it for a couple of years .
Those that do n’t need it for several years will reap the benefit of a higher interest rate .
But , as you ’ll see with laddering you can eventually have your high rates and your liquidity .
Good things come to those who wait . 🙂
Some of the best CD rates can be found at Ally Bank .
Visit their website to learn more about their different CD offerings .
There are many options when it comes to CDs .
CD maturity dates range from 1 month to 5 years .
Typical offerings come in the 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , and 5 - year variety .
Which CD is right for you can depend on many factors .
The greatest of which , mentioned above , is your need for liquidity .
But what happens if you withdraw your funds from a CD early ?
This is a no - no , unless absolutely necessary .
You will likely have to pay a penalty and / or lose some of the interest you earned if you cash in your CD too early .
This is where building a CD ladder really makes sense .
You get to enjoy the benefits of higher interest earned on your savings without the major decrease in liquidity .
The CD Laddering Strategy Explained
Okay , let ’s set up a CD ladder .
What you ’ll first need to do is determine what type of ladder you ’ll want .
Does this ladder have big rungs ( yearly ) or does it have many , smaller rungs ( monthly ) .
If the maximum you can bear to be without all of your funds in 1 year , then a monthly ladder is right for you .
If this money is just extra savings that you do n’t mind waiting 5 years on , you can do the yearly ladder .
This may be a good option for people who are ultra risk - averse and do n’t want to be in the turbulent stock market .
For our example , let ’s say you select yearly .
It ’s the quickest to setup anyway .
Do some research and find the highest paying 5 year , 4 year , 3 year , 2 year , and 1 year CDs .
Bankrate.com has a nice list .
Divide your savings into 5ths and purchase the 5 CDs with 1/5 of the money each .
Your CDs will look something like this ( let ’s say you invest $ 5,000 ) :
5 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 4 %
4 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 3.5 %
3 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 3.0 %
2 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 2.5 %
1 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 2.0 %
At this point you can just sit back and relax , knowing your money is earning you decent , inflation - busting interest and its guaranteed by the bank issuing the CDs .
After one year , your accounts will look like this if you continue the ladder strategy :
Newly purchased 5 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 4 %
5 Year CD ( now only 4 years to mature ) – $ 1,000 @ 4 %
4 Year CD ( now only 3 years to mature ) – $ 1,000 @ 3.5 %
3 Year CD ( now only 2 years to mature ) – $ 1,000 @ 3.0 %
2 Year CD ( now only 1 years to mature ) – $ 1,000 @ 2.5 %
Matured ( and cashed out ) 1 Year CD – $ 1,000 @ 2.0 % 0 Cash is used to purchase a new 5 year CD .
Thus , the rotation of the ladder begins .
You ’re expiring cash is used to purchase a new 5 year CD .
Therefore , at the end of five years , and five maturity and purchase combinations , you ’ll have nothing but 5 year CD rates in your ladder .
Safe , secure money , paying a nice , high rate of return , maturing in one - year intervals .
Woohoo !
Advantages of a CD Ladder
As you can see by how CDs work , and by the strategy , there are many reasons you ’d want to have a CD ladder :
CDs are FDIC insured up to $ 250,000 .
You ’re money is n’t going anywhere .
You just ca n’t touch it till the CD matures .
up to $ 250,000 .
You ’re money is n’t going anywhere .
You just ca n’t touch it till the CD matures .
CDs pays interest rates slightly above their online , high - yield savings account counterparts .
And , as mentioned above , the longer the maturity level , the higher the rate .
slightly above their online , high - yield savings account counterparts .
And , as mentioned above , the longer the maturity level , the higher the rate .
Eventually you ’ll hit the sweet spot ( when you ’re initial oldest CD becomes mature ) and you ’ll start seeing long - range CD rates maturing one after another .
I ’ve never done this , but it ’s got to feel great when you get to this point .
Always a high interest rate .
( when you ’re initial oldest CD becomes mature ) and you ’ll start seeing long - range CD rates maturing one after another .
I ’ve never done this , but it ’s got to feel great when you get to this point .
Always a high interest rate .
The CD ladder really shines when rates are dropping .
You ’re still earning high interest , while the current market is offering lower and lower rates .
Currently , rates are at historic lows .
So , setting this up now might not be the best idea .
Still , CD rates are largely better than high - yield savings accounts , so it might still make sense for you now .
Do you have a successful CD ladder ?
Should I start one now ?
We ’ve begun exploring the unknown systems of wormhole space in Eve Online .
I had my first encounter with the freaky Sleeper alien ships last night .
I then returned to normal space slightly richer , and slightly wiser .
The wormhole – an unstable , temporary gate to an uncharted region – was still open when I logged out of Eve , and so I let my corporation chums know it was there .
About an hour later one of them IM ’d me : “ We ’re trapped .
The wormhole closed behind us . ”
His account of the event is posted below .
A Brief Wormhole Adventure , by Roburky :
This was n’t meant to be much of an adventure , but it turned into one .
Jim told me that there was a wormhole in T22 , just one jump from our base , so I logged on to check it out .
One of our corp members who had already been in gave me the bookmark , and then I scouted him out of Syndicate so he could sell his billions of isk - worth of Sleeper loot in empire .
There did n’t seem to be a friendly alliance gang in the wormhole , and there were no other corporation members about , so I thought I ’d just send my alt - character through and practice some probing .
The wormhole said it had plenty of mass left , but was nearing the end of its natural life .
I spent a while considering whther I should go through , and if I did go through , whether I should go back and get a cheap frigate or something , in case I got trapped .
I decided to go for it , with the Arazu – an expensive recon ship .
I discovered there were a bajillion exploration sites in there to be found .
The first one I found was a mining site .
The second one I found was a mining site , but with five Sleeper frigates at it .
I thought about it .
Can I kill 5 frigates solo ?
What if there ’s another wave , though ?
I should play it safe .
I should get some backup .
I called Neil in over Steam from his Total War game .
I fitted out a drake , and he got his Sleipnir ( a combat - focused command ship ) .
We both fitted a salvager module , and went in .
The frigates died easily , and there was no extra waves .
We were scooping up the loot when Spiffeh , a corpmate , told me to read alliance chat .
Someone was asking if anyone had gone through the wormhole recently .
Because it had just collapsed .
We were trapped .
The only way out was gone .
We ’d have to trust the dev’s word that there would always be another wormhole somewhere in system .
And we ’d have to hope it would n’t take us to some far - off , dangerously hostile region , such as Period Basis or Branch , or worse : another wormhole system .
The best we could hope for was somewhere safe in empire .
Whatever happened , we knew it was going to take a long time to get home .
We spoke into the dark local chat channel – which is blank by default in wormhole space – and got two replies .
Another Huzzahian , and some random blue ( allied ) guy .
We got them into our fleet .
Random blue guy and my alt were the only ones with probes .
So we got to work looking for another wormhole , while the others amused themselves with shooting each other in one of the exploration asteroid belts .
Spiffeh offered moral support over Ventrilo .
Huzzahian soon had to leave .
We tried to figure out a way we could get the bookmark for the new wormhole location to him if we found one .
We eventually decided he would leave himself logged on , and if we found anything we would gang warp him to it .
Random friendly Guy with the other probe launcher logged off a while after .
Neil left for food after that .
I was left on my own .
I was feeling horribly guilty by this point .
I had dragged Neil in here in his expensive ship without even remembering myself that the wormhole timer was running out , let alone warning Neil .
I was feeling the weight of the responsibility of being the only prober that other people were relying on , and getting increasingly frustrated and depressed at my ineptitude at the task .
There were so many cosmic signature readings wherever I moved my probes .
If I scanned with several probes , I got a forest of little red dots .
Tracking any one signature seemed impossible .
I ’d think I was following one reading down to a smaller scale , then somewhere I ’d get misdirected back onto the trail of a site I ’d already found .
I spent hours on it , gradually improving my methods as I figured out how it all worked .
I started systematically working through the possible signatures , warping to them and bookmarking them .
Mining site after mining site .
But each one I found made the map of little red dots a little easier to navigate .
Neil came back after his tea , and I fleet warped him to some of the mining sites I ’d found with sleepers in them , so he could kill and loot them to keep busy .
When the entertainment was gone , he logged off to play some more Empire .
I carried on probing .
After three or four hours of this , something turned up on the scan results with a type that was n’t gravimetric .
It was n’t going to be a mining site .
It was ‘ unknown ’ .
“ Are wormholes ‘ unknown ’ ? ” I asked in corp chat .
Nobody knew .
I probed harder .
It was a wormhole .
A sweet , sweet , unstable wormhole .
Through it , I could see a system that was blue and black , with a cream coloured tube of cloud running through it .
It was familiar to me .
This was somewhere in Known Space , I was sure of it .
I felt a sense of accomplishment greater than any I ’ve felt in Eve to this date .
I called Neil back in to the game .
He went to fetch the AFK Huzzahian , and fleet warped his hawk over to the wormhole .
I logged on my main again .
We all gathered at the edge of the wormhole for a moment , and took some celebratory screenshots .
“ Who ’s going to go first ? ” I said .
I went in .
And I laughed .
It was only 5 jumps from home .
Nearly two dozen medical professionals in the UK took bold action this past week .
They joined together to speak out and confront the National Health Services and call for patients to be given the full facts about preventive health screening .
Public health recommendations and information women receive about breast cancer screening is not only unsupported and one - sided , they said , but denying women their right to give informed consent before submitting to a medical procedure that has been shown to harm ten times more women than it may help .
The bottom line , none of the information women receive about breast cancer screening “ comes close to telling the truth , ” they wrote in The Times .
As a result , they said , women are being manipulated to undergo mammography .
The National Health Services Screening Programme tells women that mammography saves lives and is responsible for dramatic declines in breast cancer mortality since it began twenty years ago .
That claim is disputable , they said , and equally explained to improvements in treatment .
Missing is balance .
Women do n’t hear about the risks .
Nor do they hear about the evidence showing that up to half of all breast cancers , and their precursor lesions , found by screening would not likely to have ever done any harm to women in their lifespans if they ’d been left alone , they reported .
Yet , if found at screening , they potentially label the woman as a cancer patient : she may then be subjected to the unnecessary traumas of surgery , radiotherapy and perhaps chemotherapy , as well as suffer the potential for serious social and psychological problems .
The stigma may continue to the next generation as her daughters can face higher health - insurance premiums when their mother ’s overdiagnosis is misinterpreted as high risk .
We believe that women should be clearly informed of these harms in order to make their own choice about whether to attend for screening .
Times Health Editor interviewed a few of the medical professionals who signed the letter .
Michael Baum , Emeritus Professor of Surgery at University College London , said there is no evidence that breast cancer screening was bringing significant benefits .
Even with screening and early detection , the numbers of invasive breast cancers being detected has n’t been dropping , he pointed out .
The claims that screening prevents invasive breast cancer simply do n’t add up .
It is “ outrageous that the full facts are not being set out so women could make informed decisions , ” he said , and that women are being inappropriately pushed into aggressive treatments .
“ It is time we had a complete rethink , but anyone who dares challenge the sacred cow of screening has a terrible time , ” Dr. Baum said .
Margaret McCartney , a GP in Glasgow and another signatory , told The Times that the pros and cons of screening were not being relayed to her patients .
Women come to her for surgery after a screening recall , she said , with great anxiety and no idea of the fallibilities of the system through which they were being processed .
The doctors ’ letter has been widely reported in the UK , but mainstream media here in the United States has taken little notice .
Breast Screening analysis
The study behind their letter , published in the current issue of the British Medical Journal , has also received virtually no media attention here , but every woman deserves to have this information .
This study examined the data of nearly 2 million breast cancer screenings and found that of 2,000 women screened regularly for ten years , one will benefit and avoid dying from breast cancer , but ten healthy women will have needlessly undergone mastectomies , radiation and sometimes chemotherapy , and another 200 will have endured a false alarm and follow - up tests and biopsies .
This examination of breast cancer screening was led by Dr. Peter C. Gøtzsche , director of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Three years ago , they ’d published a review of information on mammography breast cancer screening that women were receiving in six countries with publicly funded screening programs .
They found that none of the literature had even mentioned the major harm of screening : overdiagnosis and subsequent unnecessary treatment of healthy women .
About a third of the literature even told women that screening leads to less invasive surgery or simpler surgery , when “ it actually results in 30 % more surgery , 20 % more mastectomies and more use of radiotherapy , ” they wrote .
The evidence — well - recognized among medical professionals and in the medical literature — is so startlingly different from what American women have been hearing , it ’s almost hard to believe .
In an in - depth article during Breast Cancer Awareness month , JFS examined breast cancer screening , including the evidence in the medical literature , the actual U.S. statistics , Cochrane Collaborative ’s Systemic Review of mammograms and the conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force .
[ This story is here , if you missed it . ]
The breast cancer screening information that American women receive from health insurance plans and hear from the media is exactly as Dr. Gøtzsche and colleagues described .
The information is universally one - sided — women never hear the evidence or balancing information about the downsides .
And they ’re never told that not having a mammogram can even be a reasoned option .
Blue Cross Blue Shields , for example , tells women that deaths from breast cancer have declined in recent years , due in large part to more women getting regular mammograms , raised awareness and improved treatment options .
Mammograms are the best way to detect breast cancer early , it says .
Women are told “ There is no good excuse ! ” for them not to get mammograms .
It recommends annual mammograms beginning at age 40 and monthly self exams beginning at age 19 .
CIGNA HealthCare claims that mammograms have reduced death rates by 25 to 55 % among women aged 50 and older .
Women who do n’t get mammograms get a “ house call ” from the health plan reminding them they need to get a mammogram , as part of its Breast Cancer Awareness Month Pink Ribbon Campaign .
“ Mammograms are the best screening tool we have to detect breast cancer in its earliest stages , when it is the most treatable , ” said CIGNA HealthCare national quality medical director .
“ Early detection is not only a lifesaver , but it may also allow women to have more control over their treatment options , ” he said .
Kaiser Permanente similarly calls women beginning on their 40th birthday , notifying them that it ’s time for their mammogram .
Kaiser Permanente President for the Hawaiian region , claims that more than 90 % of women found to have early stage breast cancer will be “ cured ” and that detecting and treating lumps in early stages greatly improves the odds of survival and eliminates the need for more costly and invasive treatments .
She called for policy leaders to increase insurance coverage for preventive care and patient education to promote annual screenings .
The information women are given in the UK ’s authoritative booklet , Breast Screening : the Facts , said Dr. Gøtzsche and colleagues , “ is inadequate as a basis for informed consent ” and fails to provide women with the information they “ need to make a rational decision . ”
The doctors used this government publication as it was representative of the information women around the world are being given — and not given — and to point out the medically unethical practices behind this preventive screening education :
No mention is made of the major harm of screening — that is , unnecessary treatment of harmless lesions that would not have been identified without screening .
This harm is well known and acknowledged , even among screening enthusiasts .
It is in violation of guidelines and laws for informed consent not to mention this common harm , especially when screening is aimed at healthy people .
Medical ethical guidelines hold that patients should be told if an investigation or treatment could result in serious harm , even if the likelihood is very small .
But “ the likelihood of being overdiagnosed after mammography is not very small , ” they said , “ it is ten times larger than the likelihood of avoiding death from breast cancer . ”
Another harm is false positive diagnoses .
The leaflet downplays the serious numbers of women who will be told they have cancer , when they do n’t .
The doctors point out that patient literature tells women that about one in every 20 women screened will be recalled for more tests , but does n’t explain that this rate applies to only one round of screening .
“ The rate of false positive diagnosis after ten screenings was 50 % in the United States and 20 % in Norway . ”
About half of all American women who get annual mammograms for ten years will be wrongly told they have cancer .
Half .
This is not harmless , nor insignificant .
“ We now know that the psychosocial strain of a false alarm can be severe and may continue after women are declared free from cancer , ” the Nordic Cochrane Centre authors explained .
A third harm is caused by radiotherapy of overdiagnosed women .
The NHS literature states that a mammogram “ involves a tiny dose of radiation , so the risk to your health is very small . ”
But , as the doctors pointed out , the rate of overdiagnosis was 30 % in randomised trials of screening and 50 % in observational studies .
They concluded that it was misleading to reassure women they would only be exposed to tiny doses of radiation when significant numbers of healthy women will be put at risk with much larger doses in radiotherapy .
“ The summary implies that screening leads to fewer mastectomies , ” they wrote .
“ This is incorrect . ”
Most women would be stunned to learn that the evidence shows that “ screening led to 20 % more mastectomies in randomised trials ” and that observational studies have confirmed that the number of mastectomies increases when screening is introduced .
“ These initial increases are not compensated for by reduced rates among older women who are no longer screened , ” the doctors found .
The literature makes no mention of carcinoma in situ , their research found , even though it “ constitutes about 20 % of the diagnoses made at screening in the UK . ”
Fewer than half of the cases progress to invasive cancer , they said , yet 30 % are treated with mastectomy .
Women are also told in screening literature that breast cancer risk increases with age .
However , screening in these women has not been shown to reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer , the doctors said .
Yet , there are no reservations in the literature about screening older women .
In fact , among older women , the problem of overdiagnosis becomes more significant and “ their likelihood of gaining any benefit smaller , due to competing risks of death . ”
Most stunning , their study found :
Finally , it has not been proved that screening saves lives .
There is an inevitable bias in assessment of cause of death that can be particularly difficult when women have more than one cancer .
Trials show that breast screening does not decrease total cancer mortality .
The relative risk was 1.02 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.95 to 1.10 ) in the two most reliable trials and 0.99 in the others , and there is no reliable evidence that screening decreases total mortality , although half a million women participated in the screening trials .
This indicates that the benefit of screening is likely to be smaller than generally perceived .
The evidence and the balance of harm is so notable , the authors said , that “ had policy makers had the knowledge we now have when they decided to introduce screening about 20 years ago … we probably would not have had mammography . ”
The authors said this “ one - sided propaganda about breast screening is a global phenomenon ” that has resulted in women coming away with gross misconceptions about the benefits of breast cancer screening and their risks for breast cancer .
A survey of American and European women found that 68 % believed screening reduced their risk of contracting breast cancer , 62 % that screening at least halved mortality , and 75 % that 10 years of screening saved 10 of 1000 participants ( an overestimate of 20 times ) .
Another study showed that only 8 % were aware that participation can harm healthy women and that 15 % believed their lifetime risk of contracting the disease was more than 50 % ( an overestimate of five times ) .
The purpose of health education is to provide information to enable women to make informed choices about what is best for them , they said , “ not to recruit ” them .
In order to help women around the world have more balanced , objective information , the authors tested various versions of breast cancer screening information to find one that did n’t steer women to make a particular decision , but presented the facts to best help them decide for themselves .
You can down load a copy of the breast cancer screening booklet that resulted from these efforts , here .
The vast majority of women around the world have never heard what the medical evidence supports .
In fact , it ’s so opposite to what we continually hear , that it can even sound incredible .
Yet , this is just one cancer screening test .
Think of the far greater interests advocating other preventive health interventions , such as surrounding obesity , heart disease , cancer , health indices and “ healthy ” eating .
This study serves as a valuable example and reminder that , all too often , health information is more marketing and disease mongering than we may realize .
Right - wing pundits fall out : Limbaugh eviscerates Goldberg Muriel Kane
Published : Monday April 13 , 2009

The infighting among conservatives has been notched up another degree , with Rush Limbaugh attempting to blast Jonah Goldberg out of the water for daring to suggest that President Obama deserves congratulations for the successful rescue of an American captain from Somali pirates .
Goldberg wrote on his blog at the National Review on Sunday evening , " Good For President Obama .
He approved the rescue .
It was the right thing to do , with no small amount of risk .
And God bless the SEALs . "
By Monday morning , however , Goldberg was beginning to realize he might have put his foot in it .
" My morning in - box is full of snark and bile from some folks who think I should n't have congratulated President Obama for the rescue last night , " he admitted ruefully .
" But you know what ?
Congratulations anyway .
... I think my credentials as a critic of Obama are pretty solid .
But I find the idea that I have to be critical no matter what Obama does to be exhaustingly unappealing . "
But that was before the really big guns came out .
By midday , it was clear even to Goldberg that Limbaugh had been letting him have it with both barrels .
Limbaugh began his Monday show by saying -- every word dripping with extreme sarcasm -- " I want to single out today , Jonah Goldberg at National Review Online for being the first that I saw to have the proper reaction to the rescue of Captain Phillips from the merchant marine organizers , and that was to congratulate President Obama for a job well done .
And I think we all must agree , folks , that when Obama does something right , we gotta go out there and we 've got to acknowledge it . "
Limbaugh 's assault might be considered ill - natured , given that Goldberg had defended him just last month -- when Limbaugh came under fire for saying he wanted to see Obama fail -- and had condemned the attacks on Limbaugh as " a tired rehash . "
However , Limbaugh apparently felt no need on Monday to reciprocate for Goldberg 's earlier support .
After going on for a while about how the rescue should be made into a movie starring Will Smith as Barack Obama and himself , Sarah Palin , Eric Cantor , and Bobby Jindal as the pirates , Limbaugh returned to invoking Goldberg 's name over and over , each time twisting the knife just a bit deeper .
" We just ca n't be constant critics , " Limbaugh purred .
" As Jonah Goldberg has pointed out in National Review today , we must , when we see brilliance in action , decisiveness -- the SEALs ? ... SEALs could n't have done diddly - squat were it not for the decisive , cool under pressure , first test passed President Obama .
...
And he deserves praise .
Jonah Goldberg at National Review was first to point out , he does the right thing , we gotta say so . "
Even when a caller suggested , " I think that you 're just rattled because it worked out .
...
If it did n't work you would just be peeing yourself with joy , " Limbaugh insisted , " I 'm not upset about it .
... I was second out of the box telling people when he does the right thing we gotta -- just like Jonah Goldberg said . "
" And you are out of your mind , " the caller retorted .
" And I only check back ... just to make sure that you are still as crazy as I think you are .
...
And you are , and you prove it every time I listen to you . "
Goldberg , meanwhile , has posted again , but merely to say , " I 'm not listening " and to insist , " The idea that I am sitting by computer waiting for an opportunity to congratulate president Obama is , frankly , absurd . "
The betting window is still open for wagers on how long it will take before Goldberg is forced to issue an active apology .

Alex Ovechkin has his first playoff hat trick of his career .
For the un-enlightened , that is three goals in one game by the same player .
The Washington faithful celebrated the feat in grand style , littering the ice with their hats .
So much so that it delayed the game for over three minutes .
Ovechkin scored on three long shots that made Marc Andre - Fleury look a bit silly honestly .
Ovechkin was given a bit more space than he has enjoyed so far in these playoffs , and he took full advantage .
Sidney Crosby also scored a hat trick in the game , with his third coming with the goalie cleared on a power play with 30 seconds left in the game .
However he only received one hat from the crowd , and was overshadowed by the best player in hockey , the MVP , Alexander Ovechkin .
This was the first time in 13 years that opposing players both scored a hat trick in the same playoff game .
With the 4 - 3 victory , the Capitals take a 2 - 0 lead in the series into Pittsburgh for Wednesday night ’s game .
Alexander Semin left the game late in the third period with an apparent injury .
Video of all 6 goals follows after the jump
** UPDATE **
Apparently it came out in post - game interviews that Sidney Crosby asked officials to announce to the Washington Fans to stop throwing hats onto the ice after Ovechkin ’s Hat Trick .
WOW , and people wonder where he gets his reputation for whining ?
Crosby ’s 1st Goal ( Caps 0 , Pens 1 )
Ovechkin’s 1st Goal ( Caps 1 , Pens 1 )
Crosby ’s 2nd Goal ( Caps 1 , Pens 2 )
Ovechkin ’s 2nd Goal ( Caps 2 , Pens 2 )
Ovechkin’s 3rd Goal ( Caps 4 , Pens 2 )
Crosby ’s 3rd Goal ( Caps 4 , Pens 3 )
I ’ve been trying to be understanding about this shit .
I ’ve been trying so very hard to be open - minded .
Because I loves my people .
Honest .
I do .
Because overall we are an amazing people , and history bears this out .
But sometimes , man…sometimes …
OK , I ’ve been getting these emails forwarded to me from a buddy of mine who works at the Atlanta Journal Constitution .
What these emails contain are basically the names of ‘ folk ’ who got themselves arrested in the Atlanta area .
These arrests are real , but what ’s way scarier than whatever crimes these folk of ours may have committed are the names they ’ve been saddled with .
Nobody should have to answer to names like this ( if you can pronounce them ) , and being pregnant while on crack ai n’t no excuse for thinking yo’ newborn baby looks like a little Quintarius .
Yes , that is a real name of a full grown crook , as you will see in just a moment .
You know , one of the reasons I ’ve been going back and forth about posting these names ( along with some pretty hilarious commentary ) is that I know some folks who have some pretty outlandish names but who have n’t gotten so much as a parking ticket in their entire life .
And their parents actually seemed sane , although I could never get up the courage to ask any of them why in God ’s name they would name a child after a brand of liquor .
But saying all that to say I know having a crazy name does n’t necessarily make you crazy , and it definitely is not a guaranteed prison sentence .
Hell , some of the biggest crooks in history had some of the most ordinary names .
Richard Nixon for instance .
Or George Bush .
Or Dick Cheney .
And if you ’re German ( actually Austrian ) , I ’m guessing Adolph Hitler is n’t all that unusual .
Well , it may be a little unusual today , but before that sick twisted bastard started roasting Jews I doubt the mention of his name would have caused anyone to do a double take .
But I digress .
And so , with no further ado , I bring to you names to kill for .
Or at least commit armed robbery .
And no , I ai n’t got to be lyin’ .
These names – and the people attached to them – are as real as the first thing you saw when you woke up this morning .

Loose oversight and bureaucratic inertia have allowed fraud to fester in a rapidly expanding multibillion - dollar state program that provides personal caregivers to the impoverished elderly and disabled .
Hundreds of reports of scams and swindles are going without investigation .
Prosecutors and program administrators across the state say they are alarmed by the ease with which people are taking advantage of the program , In Home Supportive Services .
The program is one of the fastest - growing in state government .
This year it is budgeted at $ 5.42 billion to provide care for some 440,000 Californians .
The aim is to allow low - income and elderly incapacitated people to remain in their homes , saving the state the expense of costly nursing homes .
Experts generally consider it a success .
But government funds are flowing in so quickly , with such limited oversight , that prosecutors say it is common for the state to send paychecks to scam artists claiming to be caring for someone who is dead .
Or claiming to be caring for a relative or friend faking a disability .
Or claiming to be providing care during the same hours they are working elsewhere .

“ This program is very easy to abuse , ” said Michael Ramsey , the district attorney in Butte County in Northern California , which disbanded its
In Home Supportive Services fraud unit in 2007 because of budget cuts .
“ It invites chicanery and fraud . ”
Some critics of the program say politics has blocked efforts to combat fraud .
The program has become a steady source of revenue for the Service Employees International Union , among the most powerful interest groups in the Capitol , as well as a second union , the United Domestic Workers of America .
Under the program , people receiving care are entitled to hire whom they wish at government expense .
Most hire their relatives , because family members are often the most appropriate to provide the needed round - the - clock feeding , changing , bathing and other care .
Wages range from $ 8 to $ 14.68 an hour , depending on the county .
Those workers are required to pay monthly union dues that total millions of dollars .
The SEIU , for example , collects nearly $ 5 million a month from its 223,000 In Home system members .
The unions donate heavily to the campaigns of Democrats who control the Legislature and organize get - out - the - vote efforts on their behalf .

“ There is a huge amount of money flowing to unions from this vast pool of workers they have been able to organize , ” said Sen. Dave Cogdill ( R - Modesto ) .
“ Anything they see as a threat to that income stream they are going to challenge and use the political muscle they have to do it . ”
Union officials deny they have been a barrier to enforcement .
Scott Mann , spokesman for SEIU Local 6434 in Los Angeles , said the organization has zero tolerance for abuse of the program .
The organization backs a plan to root out swindlers by launching a study on the problem that would not be completed for nearly three years .
In the meantime , the state has two full - time investigators looking into thousands of cases of suspicious behavior .
County officials who manage the program are prohibited by state law from using any of their billions of dollars in state and federal program funds to hire their own investigators , so many have thrown up their hands .
With no investigators , Los Angeles County had a backlog of 800 fraud cases earlier this year .

The state put some investigators from other departments on loan for two months to work the cases , but as soon as it did , those investigators were flooded with about 200 additional fraud allegations .
Philip Browning , director of the county Department of Public Social Services , said the new cases came from social workers who had not been reporting suspicious activity because the state had shown so little interest .
In one case , a social worker , her brother and her grandson in Los Angeles County are accused of bilking the In Home system out of $ 77,000 over three years , billing for care that was not provided .
The social worker was simultaneously collecting pay for her full - time state employment .
The case is awaiting trial .
In Fresno County , officials used $ 650,000 in county funds to create the state ’s only active In Home Supportive Services fraud investigations unit .
Prosecutors say they routinely find cheating on time cards , prisoners reporting they are providing care while locked up and recipients of the service concocting disabilities to get relatives on the state payroll .

John Savrnoch , an assistant district attorney there , said the small fraud unit has a backlog of 1,700 tips of suspicious activity .
One of the bigger busts in Fresno so far involved a husband and wife who got their children to bill the state $ 150,000 to care for them .
The husband claimed he was completely disabled and could not get out of bed .
A few days of surveillance revealed that he was spending eight to 10 hours a day working on his ice cream truck .
He was caught on camera stocking the truck -- as well as dragging a washing machine across his driveway .
His wife claimed to be completely paralyzed on one side .
She was caught using the arm that she said was paralyzed to wave to her husband , pull down a heavy wood garage door and unload groceries from her car .
Advertisement
The couple were convicted of fraud and are now paying $ 147,000 in restitution in monthly increments of $ 400 .
The government will not recoup its money for 30 years , if ever .
Backers of the program say the amount of fraud that has been found is small relative to the program ’s benefits .
Sen. Mark Leno ( D - San Francisco ) , a member of a committee charged with looking into the program ’s spiraling costs , said at a recent hearing that the money the state has recovered in fraud prosecutions amounts to “ one one - thousandth ” of overall program spending .
“ Seeing as we seemed to have misplaced $ 50 billion in the rebuilding of Iraq , it ’s an amazingly low figure , ” Leno said .

Prosecutors say the state is n’t uncovering more fraud because state officials are not looking for it .
A Sacramento County Grand Jury report in March characterized abuse of the program as “ rampant and out of control . ”
The report said “ the small number of cases accepted for prosecution is not an indication of the magnitude of fraud . ”
Cindy Besemer , chief deputy district attorney in Sacramento County , cites the state ’s follow - up on a recent crash of a bus on its way to a Colusa County casino as indicative of its enforcement apathy .
Several of the passengers killed were in - home services patients from Sacramento .
“ The whole point of IHSS is to allow people to remain in their homes instead of going to nursing homes , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ If you are able to get on a bus and go gamble , then maybe the medical documentation you submitted to qualify for the program was n’t accurate .
. . .
These cases were never even referred to fraud investigators to check out and at least determine where there might be holes in the system , ” she said .
An L.A. County Grand Jury report last year found that some county employees who reported fraud were “ met with responses ranging from apathetic to hostile . ”
Assemblywoman Bonnie Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) recently introduced a bill , AB 682 , to begin a three - year study of fraud in the program .
The computer system the state uses to detect fraud , meanwhile , is barely functional , according to a legislative report .
There are no red flags immediately raised when care is billed for a dead person .
Eva Lopez , a deputy director at the state Department of Social Services , says a new computer system is in the works , but it will not be in operation statewide until 2011 .

She is awaiting action from the Legislature on a request for more fraud investigators .
Improving enforcement , she said , “ is an evolving process . ”

WASHINGTON  President Obama has lately begun pointing to optimistic signs for the economy , but the continuing crisis still bedevils his budget projections and his domestic agenda .
The administration , in final budget and tax details released Monday , disclosed a double wallop of bad news from government number - crunchers .
First , its Office of Management and Budget reported that the economy had added  both for this year and next  $ 90 billion to the historically high deficit estimates the administration issued just two months ago .
And the Treasury released revised figures showing that Mr. Obama ’s proposal for financing fully half of his health care initiative over the next decade  a 28 percent limit on deductions for Americans in the top two income tax brackets  would raise $ 267 billion , or roughly $ 50 billion less than he initially projected .
That further complicates the president ’s struggles , together with Democrats in Congress , to pay for overhauling health care .
To fill the revenue gap , the Treasury outlined several new ideas for raising nearly $ 60 billion over 10 years , mainly from tightening rules for inheritance taxes but also from changes in taxing some types of life insurance and other products .
John Michell , a self - styled Merlin of the 1960s English counterculture who inspired disciples like the Rolling Stones with a deluge of writings about U.F.O. ’s , prehistoric architecture and fairies  when he was not describing fascinating eccentrics or the perils of the metric system  died on April 24 in Poole , England .
He was 76 .
The cause was cancer , Jason Goodwin , his son , said .
Mr. Michell ’s intellectual idiosyncrasies were paralleled by his deep and decidedly nonjudgmental fascination with the quirks of others .
His 1984 book , “ Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions , ” told of one man who devoted his life to proving the world was flat , and another to proving it was concave .
He told of a couple who drilled holes in their own heads to feel better , then fought to have the government pay for the operation .
In other books he wrote about living frogs found inside lumps of coal and a talking ghost that insisted it was the spirit of a dead mongoose .
Over the past ( too many ) days I 've been preparing my presentation for the ACCU 2009 conference .
At one point I wanted to show how loop tiling increases locality of reference and therefore cache hits .
Surprisingly , I could not find a demo on the web , so I built one from scratch .
Here are two applets demonstrating memory accesses during a matrix raise to the power of two operation .
Normal Loop
const int N = 12 ; double a [ N ] [ N ] , r [ N ] [ N ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) for ( int j = 0 ; j < N ; j ++ ) { r [ i ] [ j ] = 0 ; for ( int k = 0 ; k < N ; k ++ ) r [ i ] [ j ] += a [ i ] [ k ] * a [ k ] [ j ] ; }

I elected to write the code in Processing ; you can download it from this link .
Adopting Processing proved to be a good choice ; getting the application up and running was easy , although converting the multiplication loops to work inside Processing 's frame loop was a bit tricky .
Even better , by adding a few more lines of code I converted the result into a movie .
Here are the magic incantations .
import processing.video.MovieMaker ; // [...]
MovieMaker mm = new MovieMaker ( this , width , height , " tiledemo.mov " , 30 , MovieMaker .
ANIMATION , MovieMaker .
LOSSLESS ) ; // [...] mm . add Frame ( ) ; // [...] mm . finish ( ) ;
Converting the movie into a format I could embed into Powerpoint proved to be more difficult .
After ( again , too ) many experiments I found that converting the movie using the VLC Media Player " Convert / Save " function with ASF encapsulation and the WMV2 codec at 2048 bps gave me perfect results .

Since I put up these pictures here at the beginning of February 2007 , the story of the Portugese barn full of classic and not - so - classic cars seems to have taken on a life of its own .
The interwebs have been abuzz with theories and somebody has even gone to the trouble of making up a story about it .
Classic car lovers , treasure hunters and auction houses have all somehow contacted intuh .
net in an effort to find out more .
In order to stem the flow of e-mails and even telephone calls : here 's all I know .
The story behind this saga of the mysterious old car collection is long , twisted and still uncertain .
Some time ago someone anonymously posted pictures of dozens or more classic cars covered in dust and apparently hidden away in a barn .
As the story made its rounds of the internet speculation grew .
The most credible - seeming story comes from someone who claims to have tracked down the owner - a retired businessman who kept the best cars from his car - sale days for himself .
While it would be nice to imagine that someone simply found this amazing stash of cars it is clear that such a thing does not simply assemble itself - so this story appears to make the most sense .
But , to this day , no one really knows for sure .
Wow guys ...
Thanks everyone for all of your excellent critiques and comments .
I remember working on this mix at my little kitchen table / haphazard computer / sound mixing set up in my Dad 's old small apartment ...
AND with my old ass HP computer that probably could n't handle most of the stuff I work on now ...
Since then I 've evolved as a musician and composer in WaveTheory and with my solo work .
When I first submitted this mix - it was " From Wood Sword To Katana " - I liked the title , but I think I had to re-submit it for some reason , to fix some things - I 'm not exactly sure why .
Anyway , I think I needed to change the title because I posted it on VGmix first , then here , because it had to go through DJP .
I guess I might have thought that the first title was a little cheese ...
There are so many comments , I do n't know where to start - but I 'll end this by saying that I 'm planning on submitting more remixes - and they will be CT for the most part .
I 'm looking to re-interpret some of my favorites .
As far as all the " just another CT remix - whoopie " jumbo - I can understand if people are tired of them , but I love the game , love the music even more - and I would n't have it any other way .
If you do n't want to hear " another CT remix " then do n't listen to them Besides , there 's a reason so many people keep doing them ...
Comparing me to AE and Digimatic is totally fine , because they 're my brothers and bandmates as many of you know .
You 'll find I have branched off with my own style though , so look out .
I 'm interested in doing remixes for other games , especially now that my mixing , and arranging skills are tons better .
Maybe even with some vocals .
J:/ Drive wo n't be known for the " one remix " for much longer ...
Maybe I 'll be to CT remixes as AE is to MegaMan ?
lol ... probably not .
I did submit the 600 A.D. mix , but DJP rejected that one .
I think Alex ( AE ) even voted to not accept it !
lol ... I think it had mixing issues .
At the time I did n't think sound quality was as important as the content of the composition .
Oh well ...
I could n't remember my password for my old account , so I made this one .
Glad to be back .

PHP is a scripting language most often used to create Web applications .
It 's easy to learn and produces visible results quickly .
However , because PHP is interpreted , PHP code is parsed and translated to opcodes every time it executes .
An opcode cache eliminates that rework , making PHP applications faster .

Expression used to legitimize another expression of dubious existence .
Used in the ironic sense in that it defends the questionable use of an illigitimate or slang word with another made - up expression .
The intent of the phrase is generally used in conjunction with insults to high talkers , english majors and otherwise insufferable people who feel the need to correct others .
Often accompanied by a punch to the stomach .
Even were the public still in the mood for fiery invective about family values , the G.O.P. has long since lost any authority to lead the charge .
The current Democratic president and his family are exemplars of precisely the Eisenhower - era squareness  albeit refurbished by feminism  that the Republicans often preached but rarely practiced .
Obama actually walks the walk .
As the former Bush speechwriter David Frum recently wrote , the new president is an “ apparently devoted husband and father ” whose worst vice is “ an occasional cigarette . ”
Frum was contrasting Obama to his own party ’s star attraction , Rush Limbaugh , whose “ history of drug dependency ” and “ tangled marital history ” make him “ a walking stereotype of self - indulgence . ”
Indeed , the two top candidates for leader of the post - Bush G.O.P , Rush and Newt , have six marriages between them .
The party that once declared war on unmarried welfare moms , homosexual “ recruiters ” and Bill Clinton ’s private life has been rebranded by Mark Foley , Larry Craig , David Vitter and the irrepressible Palins .
Even before the economy tanked , Americans had more faith in medical researchers using discarded embryos to battle Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s than in Washington politicians making ad hoc medical decisions for Terri Schiavo .

What ’s been revealing about watching conservatives debate their fate since their Election Day Waterloo is how , the occasional Frum excepted , so many of them do n’t want to confront the obsolescence of culture wars as a political crutch .
They ’d rather , like Cantor , just change the subject  much as they avoid talking about Bush and avoid reckoning with the doomed demographics of the G.O.P. ’s old white male base .
To recognize all these failings would be to confront why a once- national party can now be tucked into the Bible Belt .
The religious right is even more in denial than the Republicans .
When Obama nominated Kathleen Sebelius , the Roman Catholic Kansas governor who supports abortion rights , as his secretary of health and human services , Tony Perkins , the leader of the Family Research Council , became nearly as apoplectic as the other Tony Perkins playing Norman Bates .
“ If Republicans wo n’t take a stand now , when will they ? ” the godly Perkins thundered online .
But Congressional Republicans ignored him , sending out ( at most ) tepid press releases of complaint , much as they did in response to Obama ’s stem - cell order .
The two antiabortion Kansas Republicans in the Senate , Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts , both endorsed Sebelius .
Perkins is now praying that economic failure will be a stimulus for his family - values business .
“ As the economy goes downward , ” he has theorized , “ I think people are going to be driven to religion . ”
Wrong again .
The latest American Religious Identification Survey , published last week , found that most faiths have lost ground since 1990 and that the fastest - growing religious choice is “ None , ” up from 8 percent to 15 percent ( which makes it larger than all denominations except Roman Catholics and Baptists ) .
Another highly regarded poll , the General Social Survey , had an even more startling finding in its preliminary 2008 data released this month :
Twice as many Americans have a “ great deal ” of confidence in the scientific community as do in organized religion .
How the almighty has fallen : organized religion is in a dead heat with banks and financial institutions on the confidence scale .
This , too , is a replay of the Great Depression .
“ One might have expected that in such a crisis great numbers of these people would have turned to the consolations of and inspirations of religion , ” wrote Frederick Lewis Allen in “ Since Yesterday , ” his history of the 1930s published in 1940 .
But that did not happen :
“ The long slow retreat of the churches into less and less significance in the life of the country , and even in the lives of the majority of their members , continued almost unabated . ”
EXCLUSIVE :
The top CIA lawyer in charge of overseeing the agency ’s interrogation program after Sept. 11 says his stance on certain harsh techniques was misrepresented in a Senate hearing and that he actually told Guantanamo Bay officials to be careful , warning that some tactics could violate international protocols .
In a Nov. 18 letter to senators on the Armed Services Committee , a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times , Jonathan Fredman said he was trying to tell top Guantanamo officials that legal uncertainties surrounding the word “ torture ” meant that interrogators needed clear and specific guidance rather than having to figure it out themselves in individual cases .
The primary focus of the letter is a record of an October 2002 meeting of defense officials at the Guantanamo Bay prison in which Mr. Fredman was claimed to have said that the definition of torture is “ subject to perception , ” and that if “ the detainee dies , you ’re doing it wrong . ”
Mr. Fredman , who was chief legal counsel at the CIA ’s Counterterrorist Center through April 2004 , disputes the accuracy of that memo , which became the basis for a harsh rebuke from Sen.
Carl Levin , Michigan Democrat and Armed Services Committee chairman , at a June hearing on interrogation policies .
Mr. Levin said of Mr. Fredman , who did not testify at the hearing , “ How on earth did we get to the point where a senior U.S. government lawyer would say whether or not an interrogation technique is torture is , quote , ‘ subject to perception , ’ and that if , quote , ‘ the detainee dies , you ’re doing it wrong ’ ? ”
Several weeks after Mr. Fredman sent his letter , the panel put out a report that repeated the claims from the 2002 meeting record , which a CIA spokesman said “ hardly seems fair . ”
In his six - page November letter , Mr. Fredman says the writer of the 2002 memo misconstrued enough of his points that the memo is unreliable .
The document sheds light on U.S. efforts to ensure that its interrogation policies were legally justified and describes Mr. Fredman ’s grappling with unprecedented legal questions “ to protect the lives of our people ” in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Mr. Fredman said that he warned officials that the penalties for violating the U.S. anti-torture statute were severe and included the death penalty .
He also emphasized that techniques in the Army Field Manual - which is currently in use - still may violate a nonbinding U.N. document on torture .
“ I noted that the Istanbul Protocol of 1999 provides that even ‘ exposure to ambiguous situations or contradictory messages , ’ the use of ‘ solitary confinement , ’ and the use of coercion to induce an individual ‘ to betray someone placing them at risk of harm ’ all constitute torture .
Under the Istanbul Protocol , therefore , it is not clear that the techniques described in the U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogation would be permitted , ” he wrote in his 2008 memo .
But the person taking notes at the 2002 meeting at Guantanamo Bay recorded Mr. Fredman ’s comment at the time as : “ An example of a different perspective on torture is Turkey .
In Turkey , they say that interrogation at all , or anything you do to [ sic ] that results in the subject betraying his comrades is torture . ”
Mr. Fredman also challenged the meeting record ’s conclusion that he was saying that torture is in the eyes of the beholder .
Rather , he said , the opposite was the case .
“ I also emphasized that the requirements of the statute are not , and cannot be , a matter for individual perception , ” Mr. Fredman said in his letter to the panel , referring to the CIA ’s request for legal guidance from Justice .
“ We did so specifically to avoid having the anti-torture statute misinterpreted as in any way subject to an individual ’s particular perception . ”
The Office of Legal Counsel ’s response to interrogators , declassified last month by President Obama , set off a political firestorm in the debate over enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , which Mr. Obama has deemed torture .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said that Mr. Fredman “ made it clear to the committee that the so - called meeting minutes from Guantanamo do not reflect his views .
He did not , to my knowledge , have a chance to review them and - in any case - he takes strong exception to the picture they paint .
Despite that , the committee ’s report links him to statements that he denies and rejects .
That hardly seems fair .
Mr. Fredman believes his opinions on interrogation have been grossly distorted . ”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Levin could not be reached for comment Sunday about Mr. Fredman ’s account .
Describing himself as a career employee “ not beholden to any political party or particular administration , ” he emphasized to senators the unprecedented nature of the legal questions that were before him .
“ In light of the thousands murdered in the attacks , and the prospects of thousands additional Americans killed if we were to refrain from lawful activities that could avert the subsequent attacks , CIA would have to accept chalk marks on its shoes if necessary , while still remaining in bounds , to protect the lives of our people , ” he wrote .
“ The determination of necessity was one for the leadership to make , of course , and not for the attorneys .
However , the serious nature of the issues and the consequences of error made it essential for the lawyers to determine just where the legal chalk lines lay . ”
Mr. Fredman said he “ found no pleasure in those tasks ” and offered his resignation on two occasions .
The Armed Services Committee used the disputed record of the 2002 meeting as part of the basis for its report tracking the developments of interrogations conducted by the military .
In the executive summary to the committee report , released in December , the committee wrote : “ Minutes of that meeting indicate that it was dominated by a discussion of aggressive interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation , death threats , and waterboarding , which was discussed in relation to its use in SERE training . ”
The executive summary continued : “ Mr. Fredman said that ‘ the language of the statutes is written vaguely .
…
Severe physical pain described as anything causing permanent damage to major organs or body parts .
Mental torture [ is ] described as anything leading to permanent , profound damage to the senses or personality . ’
Mr. Fredman said simply ‘ It is basically subject to perception .
If the detainee dies you ’re doing it wrong . ’ ”

IT in a Bad Economy is like Playing the Game Jenga
Have you ever played Jenga , a game marketed by Hasbro ?
In the game you have 54 wood blocks and you start by stacking them in rows of three at alternating right angles to build an 18 - level tower ( for more details and illustrations , click here ) .
Then you take turns removing a block from a lower level and adding it to the top to make the tower taller .
Eventually the unstable and weakened lower levels wo n’t support the height of the tower , and the whole structure falls over .
The loser of the game is the person who made the tower fall .
The winner is the person who played just before the loser .
I see a lot of parallels between this game and our current situation in IT .
In a bad economy we have to survive with a lower budget , yet the demand for IT projects hardly slows down at all .
The only way we can extend our IT capabilities is by cutting back somewhere else in our budgets .
So we cut back on maintenance or on infrastructure or maybe on support , and we hope that we are n’t weakening our IT organization too much .
Just as in Jenga , we take something from a supporting area and then try to extend our IT capabilities by building on that increasingly weak area .
The tower grows taller , but since the number of blocks has n’t changed , the tower structure gets weaker and weaker .
So what ’s the equivalent in IT of our tower falling over ?
Sometimes it ’s catastrophic : our systems fail at a critical time , we have a major security breach , or a critical person leaves the company and we do n’t have a backup .
That ’s when we see how thin and frail our capabilities really are .
That ’s when we see the error of playing Jenga with critical parts of the business .
Just as in Jenga , the loser is the person who was in charge when the tower fell over .
But the winner is n’t his or her predecessor .
No , in the business version of Jenga there are no winners .
Everyone loses – the business , the IT organization , and your customers .
You would n’t play Jenga with a real skyscraper .
You would n’t deliberately sacrifice strength in the lower levels of the structure in order to make the building taller .
So why would you sacrifice strength in an IT organization in an attempt to “ satisfy ” the business needs of your company ?
You ’ve got to recognize that there is a limit to how much you can safely cut back on mission - critical areas of your organization .
Your CEO wo n’t know what that limit is – you ’ll have to determine the limit yourself .
But a CEO can definitely understand that there is a limit , just as there ’s a limit in other parts of your company .
A key aspect of your job as a CIO is to assess those limits , and to make sure that you do n’t weaken your organization or your infrastructure too much .
4 Things IT Should Do in Bad Economic Times
Here ’s my advice for bad economic times :
1. Deal with the situation as best you can .
If you ’re asked to cut your budget , then do so ( see tips in my August , 2008 newsletter article , “ 9 Ways to Reduce Business IT Expense ” ) .
But do n’t go too far ( see the Jenga discussion above ) , and watch out for things that will cut IT costs but raise costs in other parts of the business .
A smart corporate cost - reduction plan will look at the big picture and not just impose a standard percentage cut on every department .
If you ’re forced to make an arbitrary budget cut , make it clear what services and projects you ’re cutting back as a result .
Be transparent – do n’t take a cut without passing some of the pain back to your business users .
2 . If resources allow , then build for the future .
Business is down for a lot of companies , so it ’s a buyer ’s market .
If you ’ve got the funding to do it , this is an ideal time to invest in your company ’s future .
Vendors are eager to negotiate lower prices , and consultants are widely available to help .
If you ’re sure you are going to need new systems and capabilities for the future , then spend the time and money to build or buy them now .
3. Emphasize flexibility .
Flexibility is critical right now .
Ideally you want systems that will scale up to handle much larger volumes , but also scale down to support lower volumes with a reduction in infrastructure cost .
An automation project often replaces a variable labor cost with a fixed infrastructure and maintenance cost .
That might make sense if the fixed cost is much lower than your labor cost under most conditions .
But if the project justification requires a high volume to break even , then the project wo n’t be a good investment if your volume drops .
Avoid projects like this , and focus on projects which increase the flexibility of your work force instead .
4 . Be optimistic .
A recession is a downward spiral in the economy caused by negative expectations .
Things are bad , so people cut back on their spending .
Then these spending cutbacks make things bad for other companies .
The resulting downward spiral is only reversed when people begin to see improvements in the economy and in their business .
In effect , a recession is a state of mind .
Make sure you make your own contribution to halting the recession .
Be optimistic , encourage others to look forward to better things that will happen in the future .
Be realistic , but do n’t panic , and do n’t make cuts that will cripple your business when the spiral reverses .
Conclusion
There are a lot of people playing Jenga in their companies right now .
It gives the illusion of growth at no cost .
But the hidden cost of playing Jenga is the loss of structural integrity of your systems , your infrastructure and your support team .
There ’s a huge risk in playing this game , and there are no winners .
To deal with a bad economy , focus on the four things I ’ve listed above .
Then when the economy turns around , you ’ll be positioned for growth without having to rely on a weak foundation .
Icon of the Theotokos the Life - Giving Font. 17th c .
This article is about the feast day of the Life - Giving Spring .
For the historic monastery see Church of the Life - Giving Font of the Theotokos ( Istanbul ) .
The Life - Giving Spring or Life - Giving Font of the Mother of God ( Greek : Ζωοδόχο ς Πηγή ; Russian : Живоносный Источник ) is a feast day in the Orthodox Church that is associated with a historic church just west of Constantinople in Valoukli , as well as an icon of the Theotokos .
The feast day of the Life - Giving Spring is commemorated on Bright Friday of each year ( the Friday following Pascha ) , being the only feast day which may be celebrated during Bright Week , while the commemoration of the Life - Giving Spring Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos is observed on April 4 .
Revelation of the Life - Giving Spring
The Holy well ( Hagiasma ) of the Church of the Life Giving Font ( Istanbul ) .
There are two accounts extant concerning the revelation of the Life - Giving Font just outside the City of Constantinople .
It is likely that in either case , before the 5th - 6th century monastery was erected , a shrine was already in existence with a spring of water , near a grove of trees , and was dedicated to the Theotokos from early times .
Over time , the grove had become overgrown and the spring became fetid . [ 1 ]
Nicephorus Callistus
The traditional account is recorded by Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos , the last of the Greek ecclesiastical historians , who flourished around 1320 .
This tradition begins with a miracle that occurred involving a soldier named Leo Marcellus , who would later become the Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian ( 457-474 ) .
While Leo was on his way to Constantinople he encountered a blind man near the Golden Gate who was thirsty .
Though he agreed to search for water , he was unable to find any .
A female voice was then heard who told the future Emperor that there was water nearby .
Looking about , he could see no one , and neither could he see any water .
Then he heard the voice again :
" Emperor Leo , go into the deepest part of the woods , and you will find water there .
Take some of the cloudy water in your hands and give it to the blind man to drink .
Then take the clay and put it on his eyes .
Then you shall know who I am . " [ 2 ]
The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and prophesied that he would one day receive the crown to the empire .
Leo followed her order and at once the blind man recovered his eyesight .
After his accession to the throne , the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place , and the water continued to work miraculous cures .
Therefore , it was called " The Life - Giving Spring . "
Procopius
A second account is given by the prominent Byzantine scholar Procopius of Caesarea ( flourishing ca.500-565 ) . [ note 1 ]
In this version , the Emperor Justinian was out hunting when he came upon a small chapel in a beautiful wooded area , surrounded by a large crowd of people and a priest in front of a spring .
Inquiring about this site , he was told that this was the “ source of miracles ” .
He at once ordered that a magnificent church be built there , utilizing materials that had remained after the erection of the Hagia Sophia . [ 3 ]
The church was erected in the last years of his reign , ca.559-560 , near the holy spring . [ note 2 ]
After the erection of the sanctuary , the Gate that was situated outside the walls of Theodosius II was named by the Byzantines Gate of the Spring ( Greek : Πύλη τῆ ς Πηγῆ ς ) . [ 4 ]
The Icon
Greek icon of the Theotokos the Life - giving Spring ( " Panagia Argokiliotissa " , Naxos ) .
The icon representing the Virgin of the Spring shows the Virgin blessing and embracing the Child .
She is surrounded by two angels , and is sitting on the more elevated of two basins , presumably representing the " living water " which is Christ . [ note 3 ]
The living water from the more elevated basin flows into a larger marble basin below , which is in the shape of a cross . [ note 4 ]
In one version of the icon that was found on Naxos island , Greece , [ note 5 ] some differences are shown with respect to the ancient type .
Around the cross - shaped basin stands the Emperor with his guard , while on the right is the Patriarch with his bishops .
In the background , is represented Leo I with the blind man , and the walls of the City .
Under the basin a paralytic and a madman are healed with the spring ’s water .
Hymn
In Orthodox hymnography , the Theotokos is frequently compared with a Holy Fountain .
The hymns and prayers of the feast are combined with the Paschal hymns , and there is often a Lesser Blessing of Waters performed after the Divine Liturgy on Bright Friday .
In old Russia , continuing Greek traditions , there was a custom to sanctify springs that were located near churches , dedicate them to the Holy Mother , and paint icons of her under the title The Life Giving Spring . [ 5 ]
Apolytikion ( Tone 3 ) [ 6 ]
As a life - giving fount , thou didst conceive the Dew that is transcendent in essence , O Virgin Maid , and thou hast welled forth for our sakes the nectar of joy eternal , which doth pour forth from thy fount with the water that springeth up unto everlasting life in unending and mighty streams ; wherein , taking delight , we all cry out : Rejoice , O thou Spring of life for all men .
Kontakion ( Plagal of Tone 4 ) [ 6 ]
O Lady graced by God , you reward me by letting gush forth , beyond reason , the ever - flowing waters of your grace from your perpetual Spring .
I entreat you , who bore the Logos , in a manner beyond comprehension , to refresh me in your grace that I may cry out , “ Hail redemptive waters . ”

Notes
↑ The 11th century Byzantine historian George Cedrenus also mentions this version . ↑
In this context , " Holy Spring / Holy Font / Holy Source " becomes synonymous with the Greek : ἁγίασμα , hagiasma ; Lit. : ' sanctuary ' . ↑
This living water is contained in the Cross which must be born by all those who follow Him , just as He did . ↑
In the early Church , the baptismal font was actually in the form of a cross , just like the cross depicted in this icon .
Christians would enter from the base of the cross and come out at the top , and then re-enter from the left of the cross and come out on the right of the cross ; then the priest , who would be standing in the middle of the cross / baptismal font , would commune them .

I ’m so proud of myself .
My raised bed vegetable garden has got to be the most fertile and seed ready vegetable garden in the hood .
I went to Lowe ’s and picked up 4 2x6x10 planks , Burpee Seed packages for my chosen veggies , and uh 38 bags of top soil and hummus .
I loaded them up into my Volkswagen Golf and tied down the hatchback like a true professional .
Putting the box together was super easy and only required a little bit of ingenuity as there were some gaping holes at the base where my chosen spot had a little dip in the yard .
I dammed them up with some landscaping rocks and I will just pray that the rain ca n’t wash away my hard work .
The tough part was unloading and spreading the soil .
I layed down newspaper and spread the composted mulch along the bottom .
Next came some lime to tone down the acidity of the pine bark , and then bag after bag of soil and hummus mix made its way in .
Its so pretty y’all .
Â
Tonight I will get a few of my little seedlings started indoors and I ’m looking forward to the next weekend that I can get out there and sow everyone in .
So , even the Obama ’s are gardening .
If you are into it , meet my new friend : The Home Garden Blog
I read through several posts this evening and learned more about my green endeavors from this blog .
I ’m super excited about his advice for planting tomatoes and I felt completely affirmed after reading his posts about composting and building his raised bed garden boxes .
I learned about The Home Garden Blog from the blog ThisYoungHouse.com ( who we love to death ) , they are both participating in the 48 hour challenge .
Check it out !
Thanks for playing ,
And now a quick word from our sponsors !
SHOP OUR VIBES :
The teen " child " pornography madness , which has been a subject of great mainstream media coverage over a number of months , has been getting out of hand .
I 'm not referring to child pornography itself ( a practice which is very despicable ) , but to the allegations of " child pornography " that have been popping up in the courtrooms and the mainstream media within the last number of months .
I 'm specifically referring to today 's Generation Y a .k.a. adolescents ( teenagers ) , who used to be called " the youth , " and are being prosecuted left and right simply for doffing their clothes and taking nude pics of themselves with their camera phones or just posting them on their social networking accounts like Myspace .
Let 's not forget that there have been cases of teenage males having been prosecuted for filming their girlfriends in the nude ( or while they 're having sex with one another ) and taking naked pics of them .
Just this week a 14 - year - old teenage girl from New Jersey was arrested for posting 30 nude pics of herself on her Myspace account .
Why did she do this , you might be asking ?
Because she wanted her boyfriend to see them .
According to media accounts , if the poor girl is convicted , under Megan 's Law , she would have to register as a sex offender and serve 17 years in prison .
Currently , she 's been remanded to her mother 's custody for the time being .
A court date has n't been set as well .
What started this brouhaha was that someone tipped off the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , which then contacted the police .
The authorities began a month - long investigation into the matter , sex stinging the girl until they came to the conclusion that she did this for her boyfriend .
An even more interesting fact is that many parents and pundits have lambasted the local law enforcement officials and the district attorney 's office , including Maureen Kanka ( the mother of the late Megan Kanka whose murder led to her mom lobbying for the passage of Megan 's Law ) who publicly condemned the arrest , saying that the police should " be ashamed of themselves " for charging the youth .
University of Pennsylvania constitutional law professor Seth Kreimer even believes the arrest was insane as well :
To deploy the nuclear weapon of child pornography charges shows almost as bad judgment as posting the nude photos themselves .
Another case involving another 14 - year - old teen girl from Pennsylvania provides a disturbing picture of the out - of - control government 's obsession with prosecuting and persecuting adolescent women and men for taking sexually - explicit pictures and filming themselves engaging in explicit sexual activity .
It also shows that the state is infantilizing ( more correctly , " childifying " ) our youth and treating them like children , while imposing government - mandated " sex education " in the public " government " schools ( which is encouraging kids to have sex ) .
Let 's also not forget that most parents do not educate their children about sex , because of their uncomfortability with the subject and their irrational fear that , if they did so , their kids would pursue that kind of activity .
Yet it is common knowledge that , once the young children enter their adolescent years , they will learn about sex from either their peers or watch porn ( and get the wrong ideas about sex and love ) or both .
And , because of that , it drives them to have sex , especially when they are not emotionally , mentally , and financially ready for that responsibility .
After all , teen pregnancy , while having declined somewhat over the years , is still at an all - time high and sexually - transmitted diseases ( STDs ) is very prevalent as well .
Moreover , the state does n't get that , as long as it continues to raise teens as little children , Generation Y'ers will act out as children and not as young adults .
Once they are childified , it 's almost impossible for them to snap out of it and it sticks with them for the rest of their lives .
As long as the state proceeds to prevent teens from learning responsibility and behaving like adults , they will be immature , irresponsible , and insecure .
This is what the state is doing to the adolescent population : it 's shielding teens from growing up and learning from the consequences of their actions .
If teens were allowed to marry , sign contracts , have children , take control of their education , vote , join the military , drink , emancipate themselves from their abusive parents and families , etc. , they would be more likely to wait until they were ready to handle those responsibilities .
While the state deserves the lion 's share of the blame here , the parents deserve it just as much .
Moreover , the sex registry system creates a new criminal class , which sticks with the convicted sex offenders for life .
It 's almost impossible for them to lose that label .
Since there are no victims and the teens who are infantilized by their parents and the state are said to be victims of " statutory rape " ( used to be called " jail bait " ) , the state will accuse the offenders of engaging in these " rapes , " considering teen women voluntarily choose to be sexually active with their male lovers ( who are usually older than them ) and do not cry out rape .
Not only that , the offenders are required to re-register with the state whenever they move and find it difficult to land jobs , considering employers tend to be leery about hiring them to begin with .
It 's time for the state to get out of this business of protecting teens .
It 's also time for parents to assume the role of protecting and raising their kids and teaching them about sex , so they can wait until they are ready to deal with all and any adult responsibilities .

TAIPEI — Labor rights groups are stepping up their campaign against a Taiwanese supplier for Apple Computer .
They have accused the company , flat - panel maker Wintek , of exploiting workers at its factories in Taiwan and its subsidiary 's factory in China .
The groups organized a protest outside Apple 's Taipei office on Thursday morning , targeting the U.S. computer giant for the first time .
They say Wintek has not fully addressed their demands after months of negotiations , so they 're taking their campaign to one of its high - profile customers .
" We want to go through Apple to put pressure on Wintek , " said Chu Wei-li , 30 , secretary - general of the Taipei - based National Federation of Independent Trade Unions , a key organizer of the protest .
The labor groups allege that Wintek fired more than 600 workers without warning in December , slashed salaries and made employees work unpaid overtime to fill rush orders .
The rights groups further allege that a Wintek subsidiary in Dongguan , China , cut workers ' salaries without negotiation , has unacceptable working conditions and illegally fired 19 workers after a strike in mid-April .
( See detailed allegations here . )
Wintek denies any wrongdoing .
In an e-mail , spokesperson Susie Lee said Wintek posted record net losses in 2008 due to the global downturn , and was forced to institute " cost - saving measures . "
It says it gave laid - off workers compensation packages , and that all of its policies are in line with local laws and regulations , as well as its supplier " code of conduct " agreements .
" We hope ... certain persons or groups do not [ make ] unfounded allegations to harm Wintek 's reputation and affect the normal business activities of a law - abiding company , " Lee wrote .
" Wintek shall take relevant necessary steps including legal action in order to protect company and stakeholders interests . "
Apple 's Asia spokesperson Jill Tan said in an e-mail , " Apple is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility wherever our products are [ made ] , " and pointed me to the firm 's corporate responsibility information .
Apple conducts regular audits of suppliers to make sure they comply with Apple 's code of conduct , Tan said , and " we require corrective actions when we find violations . "
It 's not the first time Apple has come under scrutiny for labor conditions at its Asian suppliers .
In 2006 , Apple did an inspection of one supplier — a subsidiary of a different Taiwanese firm — after a media report alleging poor working conditions at one of its factories in China .
Apple found " excessive " work hours by laborers making its popular iPod player at the plant , according to the BBC .
It said the supplier corrected the violations and would from then on enforce a " normal " 60 - hour work week .
The current labor action is unusual in that it 's being taken on behalf of both Taiwanese and Chinese workers .
It 's supported by labor groups in Hong Kong , mainland China , Japan and South Korea , according to a press release about Thursday 's protest .
On Thursday morning , about 30 protesters from local labor rights groups and trade unions held signs and chanted slogans , including " black - heart business " ( heixin qiye ) , in front of Apple 's Taipei office .
One protester held up an Apple laptop with the Chinese characters for " responsibility " on the screen .
Behind , some 25 police officers stood by .
Some 15 laid - off Wintek workers joined the protesters later .
Many wore surgical masks to prevent being identified , because they still hope to be re-hired at the firm 's central Taiwan factory .
" If the company finds out you came here to protest at Apple , they will put you on a blacklist , " explained Liu Wan-ling , of the Taiwan Labor Information and Education Association .
One 37 - year - old laid - off worker came to the protest with his 3 - year - old son in tow .
He said he was fired last December without warning or explanation , after working for the firm for nine years .
When he showed up for work , his boss told him , " You do n't need to come here , you 're laid off — take all your things away . "
" I'm here to ask for justice , " the worker said .
" My family needs income , so we can eat . "
The protesters and former Wintek employees want Apple enforce its own supplier " code of conduct " and force Wintek to improve working conditions at its factories and rehire laid - off workers .
Chu says if their demands are n't met , they plan to continue protests at Wintek 's next shareholders ' meeting in June .
The workers and labor groups say Wintek should rehire now that its sales have recovered .
Apple 's net profits for its fiscal quarter ending March 28 rose 15 percent over the same period a year ago .
Wintek 's sales plummeted in the last quarter of 2008 , according to information on its website .
But since January its sales have steadily recovered , with month - on - month increases of 26 percent , 15 percent and 13 percent in February , March and April .
Wintek was also at the center of rumors in March that Apple might make a netbook or similar product , with touch - screen panels supplied by the Taiwan contractor .
Wintek did not respond to a request for details on what it currently produces for Apple , and Apple said it does not comment on " supplier relationships . "

The Himalaya region of the world is undergoing rapid change from global warming .
Â
For example , glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau are melting at a â€œworrisome speed , â€ according to Xinhua news agency .
Â Â Over the past 40 years , Tibetan glaciers have receded 196 square KM , or 1/ 4 the size of New York City .
Â
Despite such loss of glaciers that feed important rivers in Asia ; India , Pakistan , Nepal and Bhutan plan to build hundreds of mega-dams to power South Asia .
In the next 20 years , over 150,000 megawatts ( MW ) of new hydropower projects are planned in four South Asia countries .
Â
Three of these dams are the most expensive and largest dams in the world !
Â
According to International Rivers , this is the “ wrong choice for a warming world ” .
A dam - building boom in the Himalayas in times of global warming is like investing billions of dollars in high - risk , non-performing assets .
In the Himalayas , “ melting glacier water will replenish rivers in the short run , but as the resource diminishes , drought will dominate the river reaches in the long term , ” says Xin Yuanhong , a senior engineer with a Chinese team that is studying the glaciers of the Tibetan plateau .
Not only is the long term feasibility of such dams under question , but short term increasing flows from melting glaciers puts the safety of these projects in question .
Â
The mega -dams have been designed based on historical river flow data .
Climate change is causing increasing flows from melting ice causing some engineers to question the safety of the original dam designs .
Not only will climate change affect the proposed dams from melting glaciers , but increased storms could result in more flooding as well .
Â
Another concern is glacial lake outburst floods ( GLOFs ) .
Â International Rivers explains :
The sudden bursting of glacial lakes is another major concern for the safety of planned dams , and ultimately the rivers and peoples of the Himalayas …
As glaciers in high - altitude regions such as the Himalayas melt , they can form large lakes behind temporary dams of ice and rock .
When these moraine dams collapse , millions of cubic meters of water are released , resulting in massive flash floods .
The Dig Tsho GLOF in Nepal in 1985 was one of the most devastating glacial lake bursts in recent history .
The bursting of this glacial lake near Mount Everest caused a huge flood wave that travelled down the valley , killing five people and destroying one hydropower station , many acres of cultivated land and 14 bridges .
In January 2009 , the government of Bhutan identified more than 2,600 glacial lakes in the country , of which 25 are considered to be at high risk of bursting , according to Yeshi Dorji of Bhutanâ€™s Department of Geology and Mines .
While Bhutan is aware of the risk of GLOFs and is improving its early warning system , the country , together with India , is still currently constructing one of the largest hydropower dams in the region , the 90 - meter - high Tala project on the Wangchu River .
Over one billion people rely on the waters of the Himalaya for survival , and massive dam building will negatively affect this important source of water .
Â
South Asia should look at other sources of renewable energy , as dams have been proven to be detrimental to ecosystems in America .
Â
Damming Asia will not solve the world water crisis while meeting the energy needs of this growing region .
Load jQuery Dynamically Thursday , May 7 , 2009
Sometimes you have to load jQuery , but you do n’t know if it has already been referenced somewhere else in the website .
This tends to happen if you have a custom web control , delivered in an assembly , that relies on jQuery .
This code has been ripped out of my application , and may have a typo or three , but it gives you the general idea .

Vienna is best city to live and work , says survey
Mainland European cities are the most desirable places to work despite having some of the highest levels of tax in the world , according to a quality of living survey published today .
Thirteen of the top 20 cities in which to live and work are in Europe , including Munich , Copenhagen , Vienna , Brussels , Frankfurt , Stockholm and Berlin , according to research by consultancy firm Mercer .
The survey studied factors including health services , political stability , traffic congestion , crime , media censorship , pollution , mail services , and even the variety and quality of restaurants and theatre .
It does not factor in the cost of living .
London , which is ranked 38th , scores well for public services , recreation and telecommunications , but is let down by security concerns and pollution .
Glasgow and Birmingham are the next most desirable British cities , jointly ranked 56th .
The Mercer findings , designed to help governments and companies put a financial value on moving workers from one country to another , come amid criticism from UK business leaders of the government 's plans to introduce a 50 p tax rate for the country 's highest earners .
Among the super - rich quick to criticise the new tax band have been Sir Richard Branson , former trade minister Lord Jones , bookstore entrepreneur Tim Waterstone , Peter Hargreaves , founder of Hargreaves Lansdown , hedge fund veteran Stanley Fink and entrepreneur Hugh Osmond .
Osmond , whose business interests have ranged from PizzaExpress to Pearl insurance group , said : " A lot of people will be off .
I think it 's highly unlikely that I will continue to have the UK as my country of residence . "
But Slagin Parakatil , who compiled the research for Mercer , said tax changes in the UK were unlikely to alter the strategies of multinational companies in deciding where to deploy staff .
" I do n't think tax would be an issue .
If you need to send someone , you will definitely send someone , no matter whether the tax regime is high or not . "
Beyond Europe , tops draws were Vancouver , Ottawa and Toronto , Auckland , Wellington , Sydney and Melbourne , where tax rates have been broadly comparable with Britain 's in recent years .
The most desirable US cities are Honolulu , San Francisco and Boston , ranked 29th , 30th and 35th respectively .
Top of the quality of life rankings is Vienna , which pushed last year 's lead city , Zurich , into second spot .
At the other end of the 215 - city league table , 16 of the bottom 20 are to be found in Africa .
Among them are Brazzaville , Khartoum and Kinshasa .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 28 April 2009 .
We referred to Sana 'a as an African city .
It is the capital of Yemen in Southwest Asia .

MySQL 's slow query log is a very handy tool to detect which SQL queries are running slowly in a production app .
So what about rails applications ?
Often , test data only contains a small amount of data .
Over time more users use the site and generate more data .
A page that usually renders in 100 ms could be taking 3 - 5 seconds , or more !
I present , SlowActions .
The goal was to analyze a standard log file to detect actions that render slowly .
It had to be easy to use and also not require modification of rails ' logging mechanism .
Observe :
$ > slow - actions -- actions development.log Cost Average Max - UsersController : game_history ( 22 entries , 0 % Error ) Total : 11275.447 3642.437 12728.0 Render : 7.20300 2.32700 17.2450 DB : 10.5020 3.39200 10.0000 - QuestionsController : refresh_index_table ( 89 entries , 0 % Error ) Total : 908.494 202.348 307.000 Render : 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 DB : 32.5880 7.25800 10.0000
More info after the break ....
So , what are we looking at ?
These are the top two ( because I cut off the rest ) results for looking at all the log entries times sorted by their Cost .
The first line is the Controller followed by the Action .
In parenthesis is the number of entries in the log file and the percent of those entries that had an error .
The second line is the total time from request to the data being sent to the user .
There is a column for Cost , Avg , and Max .
Max is the maximum time this action ever took .
Avg is the average amount of time the action took ( not counting errors ) .
Cost = Avg * Math. Log (# entries ) .
The Cost can be thought of as that action 's share of the slowness of the site .
An action that is only run once a month and takes 5 seconds is not as bad as an action run 200 times per day that takes 1 second .
The Log helps smooth things out a bit .
There are a bunch of filters that you can put on the command :
$ > slow - actions ( -- actions | -- controllers | -- sessions ) log_file [ log_file ...]
You may also specify : --min-cost=FLOAT
--min-avg=FLOAT
--min-max=FLOAT
--start-date=YYYY-MM-DD
--end-date=YYYY-MM-DD
You can choose to output the actions and / or controllers ( in a tree format ) and / or the session ids ( to see which users have it the worst , this is great to find out what is causing a slow action ) .
You can also specify multiple log files , in case you rotate your logs .
You can choose a cutoff cost / avg / max , which means that you could make nice short little emails to yourself every night from your app .
You can also specify a date range , because after you fix a bug , you want to see what kind of effect it had .
I took care to put in some basic RDoc to help people use slow - actions in their own tests or tasks .
For example , you could run this in irb :
require ' rubygems ' require ' slow_actions ' @sa = SlowActions.new @sa.parse_file('/ path/to/my/log') puts @sa.print_actions
Have I convinced you ?
Then get SlowActions off GitHub and download it and run it on your app , you 'll be surprised !

Shocked dad Wayne Scott stopped his stepson Luke polishing off a Tesco sandwich when he noticed a WORM lurking in the tuna filling .
But he was even more surprised when the supermarket giant told him not to worry ... as the worm was perfectly safe to eat .
" I could n't believe my eyes when I read the letter Tesco sent me after I 'd complained , " said Wayne , 32 .
" Perhaps it 's going to be a new sandwich filling , tuna and worm .
" They really should amend their packaging to say this sandwich may contain bones and worms .
Either that , or they should give you a sickbag when you buy the sandwich . "
Wayne , a financial controller from Stotfold , Herts , bought four - year - old Luke the sandwich when the stopped at a Tesco in nearby Hatfield for a bite to eat .
" When Luke eats a sandwich he always takes off the top layer of bread , " said Wayne .
" As he did , I noticed the worm straight away and grabbed it back just in time as he was about to take another bite . "
Yet Wayne says no one in the store took his complaint seriously so he demanded the sandwich back and took it to be analysed at the environmental health lab at Welwyn Hatfield Council .
Lab tests confirmed the sandwich contained a parasitic worm and Wayne sent the report and pictures of the worm to Tesco .
The supermarket has now written to Wayne to apologise , pointing out it was a cod worm which can be hard to spot .
" Despite its name , these can actually be found in many species of fish , " the Tesco letter added .
" They burrow deep in the flesh , which makes them difficult to see during filleting .
They are harmless if eaten . "
But Tesco pledged to investigate how they can stop it happening again .
However , Wayne , who was sent a £ 5 gift voucher as compensation , said he was still disappointed with Tesco 's response .
" You should n't have to carry out your own tests when you find something wrong , " he said .
" Complaints should be taken more seriously .
" And I completely disagree that cod worms are hard to spot .
I was able to spot it as soon as I took the sandwich off my stepson .
" There are no excuses for serving up a tuna and worm sandwich .
It 's disgusting . "
In his new book , A Tragic Legacy : How a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency , Glen Greenwald argues that a belief in Good and Evil leads to monstrous behavior , because once we identify ourselves as warriors for Good , fighting Evil , there is no behavior which can not be justified .
His argument certainly seems to hold true with regards to the Bush administration , but it also has deep roots in human history and in western religious thought in general .
I 'm particularly interested because the question of good and evil is quite possibly the most fundamental issue in the Christian worldview — more basic than the ideas of salvation , Heaven , or Hell .
Without the concept of evil , there would be no need of Hell , Heaven would be a given , salvation would be unnecessary .
Most of the Christian worldview is wrapped around the ideas of good and evil .
This is peculiar , because the traditional starting - place for this struggle is the story of the fall — of Adam and Eve , in the garden of Eden — a story that is persistently misinterpreted in religious circles .
I 'll tell you two versions .
The first is the traditional tale , the second will be the one found in the Bible .
The traditional version goes something like this ( with minor variations ) :
God originally put Adam and Eve in a beautiful garden , where they could have anything they wanted — the fruit from all the trees — as much as they liked .
There was only one catch .
In order to give them free will , God had to provide a choice for them .
So he commanded them not to eat from just one of the trees .
The point of this was to see if they would obey this simple command .
They disobeyed , and brought evil into the world , by committing the first sin—disobedience .
Their punishment was to be kicked out of the garden , to have painful childbirth , to be forced to till the soil , for women to be subject to the authority of men , etc .
Ever since then , humans have been totally depraved , thus requiring salvation in order to escape the punishment of Hell , which we so richly deserve .
There are , of course , many modifications of this story in different branches of Christianity , but this is the gist .
How does this measure up to the tale told in the Bible ?
First of all , the tale in the bible is a folk tale : a kind of parable .
It is not meant to be taken literally , and it signals this fact in several ways .
I 'll just point out the obvious ones .
First , there 's a talking snake — Br'er Snake , if you will .
This is certainly a signal as to the kind of story we are being told .
If that is n't enough to clue us in , the main characters names should do it .
" Adam " , literally , means " Human " .
And " Eve " means " Life " , which the narrator tells us is due to the fact that she is the " mother of all living " ( that is , " Woman " ) .
So we 're not being told a literal story , about an historical event , but a symbolic story , about humanity in general .
And the point of that story ?
The text has already given us the key to the interpretation : it 's in the names .
The first tree mentioned is the " Tree of Life " .
To eat the fruit of this tree is to have life .
Pretty simple , yes ?
The humans are allowed to eat of this tree as much as they like — that is , they are allowed to partake of life , as much as they like .
The second tree , the one that causes all the trouble , is not called " the tree of death " .
Rather , it is called " The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil " .
At this point , some of my readers are going to experience interference patterns , based on the traditional interpretations , so I 'm going to resort to a chart , in order to make things crystal clear :
Element Name Meaning Fruit To Eat Fruit The Man Adam Mankind ( Humanity ) n/a n/a His Wife Eve Womankind n/a n/a First Tree The Tree of Life The Source of Life Life To Have Life Second Tree The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil The Source of the Knowledge of Good and Evil The Knowledge of Good and Evil To Know ( or Learn About ) Good and Evil
That 's what the story says .
( Yes , by the way , it is sexist .
But I do n't have to endorse the sexism , since I 'm not a fundamentalist . )
And what is God 's attitude toward the second tree in the story ?
He tells them that it is lethal , and that they should not eat its fruit .
In addition , both God and Br'er Snake agree that knowing about Good and Evil is the province of the gods .
The basic message , at this point , could n't be clearer : Good and Evil are not the business of human beings .
Such knowledge is reserved for the gods .
Leave it alone .
Of course , in the story they do n't .
They eat of the tree , immediately start making silly moral judgments ( they become embarrassed of their bodies , which God had created ) and begin playing judgment games : blaming each other , Br'er Snake , and , finally , God , for their guilt ( another new emotion ) — all direct results of buying into a worldview of Good and Evil , right and wrong .
The end of the story hints that this new worldview leads to hierarchy and slavery , especially if we try to fit the subject of the tale into human history .
Humans fell from the life of hunter - gatherers , into early civilization , with its hierarchy , slavery , agriculture - based economy , and deep sense of Good and Evil .
It may or may not be possible to take the interpretation that far , but it is certain that the story is against humans pretending to know Good and Evil .
Even though I 'm not a Bible - believing fundamentalist , or even a Christian anymore , I can still see deep wisdom in a traditional text .
Believers , of course , may have more trouble .
They have to stretch and twist the story until it fits their theology .
Until it comes out close to the first version I told you .
But I think the story itself is much wiser than the traditional misinterpretation .
And , I think that current events show us that such ancient wisdom may be sorely needed in our times .
Not because it 's holy , but because it 's human .
At least , that 's what I think today .
WASHINGTON , April 6 , 2009  --
A pilot who allegedly stole a Cessna plane from a Canadian flight school and was pursued for hours across the Midwest by fighter jets , was taken into custody after he landed on a Missouri highway late today and took off running , an FBI spokesman said .
The pilot landed the single engine Cessna 172 on U.S. Highway 60 in Ellsinore , Mo. , at approximately 9:50 p.m. ET , and was caught by Missouri State Highway Patrol officers , FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said .
The pilot was identified as Yavuz Berke , formerly known as Adam Leon , a 31 - year - old naturalized Canadian citizen who was born in Turkey , Kolko said .
The plane had been escorted by two F - 16 fighter jets since shortly after it crossed into U.S. airspace from Canada , and the pilot did not respond to multiple requests that he establish communications with ground controllers .
Burke was apparently treated for depression last Friday and left his girlfriend a good - bye note , Canadian officials told the U.S. government .
Berke 's vehicle was left at the airport in Canada with the keys still in it .
A Customs and Border Protection aircraft also closely monitoring the Cessna .
The plane entered American airspace over Michigan 's Upper Peninsula at 4:23 p.m. ET today and was trailed by the military aircraft since 4:43 p.m. as it flew over Minnesota , south through Wisconsin , Illinois and Missouri .
At one point , the Wisconsin state capitol building in Madison was evacuated as a precaution as the plane flew over the city .
Confederation College in Thunder Bay , Ontario , confirmed to ABC News that one of its aircraft was stolen today and flown out of Thunder Bay International Airport at 2:55 p.m .
A college official told a local newspaper that it was believed the pilot was not a student at the school .
" Apparently , somebody jumped over the fence and just jumped into an aircraft , " Judi Maundrell , the college 's vice president of academics and student services , told the Thunder Bay News Source .
" It was sitting as usual parked on the ramp .
They keys are in all the aircrafts because students are using them . "
NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek said the F - 16 pilots had made visual contact with the pilot and knew that the person flying the Cessna was aware that the F - 16s were there .
He was " unresponsive to their non-verbal directions and ... not in contact with the FAA controllers , " Kucharek said .
FAA officials also said the Cessna 's pilot did not respond to repeated efforts to hail him on all radio frequencies .
It was thought the fighter jets might have to shoot down the aircraft if it showed hostile intent , Kucharek told ABC News .
" NORAD pilots , once authorized by higher authority , are authorized to use everything within their power to protect U.S. citizens , up to and including lethal force , " he said .
Kucharek said it costs roughly $ 50,000 per hour / per jet to scramble F - 16s .
From the time the plane was initially intercepted over Lake Superior near the Michigan upper peninsula until it landed on the Missouri highway , it was followed by two F - 16s for more than five hours -- a likely tab of $ 500,000 .
According to the Federal Aviation Administration , the plane was flying for a while at 14,500 feet .
Over 10,000 feet the air is quite thin and commercial planes would be pressurized , but the Cessna 172 is not .
As a result , the pilot might have suffered from hypoxia , or lack of oxygen , which could have lead to confusion .
The plane later dropped its altitude to 3,700 feet , where there is more oxygen .
Another government official said the plane did not seem to be showing any hostile intent .
" It had opportunities to go into heavily populated areas , " the official said , adding that It appeared to veer around , " not going to urban air space . "
ABC News ' Lisa Stark contributed to this report .
The world 's best - selling motorcycle is returning to the United States after a 26 - year hiatus .
Sort of .
Sym , a former Honda subsidiary based in Taiwan , is bringing what it calls a new and improved version of the venerable Honda Cub to the U.S.
The 100 - mpg Symba sports the Cub 's timeless step - through design but updates the bike with a smoother transmission , improved suspension and other features .
Three hundred dealers have placed orders for the Symba , and U.S. distributor Carter Bros. says the motorcycle could roll into showrooms as early as next month .
" One thousand pre-ordered Symbas are currently in a cargo ship on the Pacific Ocean and bound for U.S. shores .
They should be arriving in Long Beach in a couple of days , " Pete McIntosh , director of marketing and sales told Wired.com .
" And that 's just the beginning .
You can bet more are soon to come .
We anticipate a large demand . "
With the economy in the dumps and auto sales languishing , Sym is confident there 's a market for a cheap motorcycle .
U.S. scooter sales hit an all - time high in 2008 , according to the Motorcycle Industry Council .
" If you look around the world you 'll find that there are scooters everywhere , " McIntosh said .
" It 's a reliable low cost form of transportation that 's recession - proof . "
The Cub is everything you need in basic transportation .
It 's cheap , it 's efficient and it 's damn near indestructible .
Honda has sold more than 60 million of them in the past half - century .
Sym knows better than to mess with success , so it 's pretty much sticking to the formula Soichiro Honda created in 1958 .
" Due to the following of the Cub , we intend not to replace but to advance its style to a new generation , " McIntosh said .
" This is why we 're going with the ad slogan ' You can make new friends but keep the old ones on a Symba . ' "
The slogan refers to the " You meet the nicest people on a Honda " advertising campaign the Japanese company used to launch the Cub in America .
The Cub , and the campaign behind it , brought motorcycles to suburbia .
Honda quit selling the Cub in the United States in the 1980s , when it was called the Passport .
But they 're still sold elsewhere in the world .
The Symba advances Honda 's design by improving the front fork , adding an adjustable shock out back .
The 101 - cc engine produces 6.7 horsepower .
The motorcycle also gets a semi-automatic four - speed transmission and will carry a $ 2,598 price tag .
That 's about $ 1,000 more than a Cub .
Longtime Cub enthusiast Nathaniel Dahl , who writes the independent blog TeamSymba.com , says the Symba is worth the added cash because it 's such a sweet little bike .
" Times have changed , " he told Wired.com .
" The fastest - growing segment of the motorcycle market in America is scooters .
This sets the stage for the Symba to bring that classic look back to a market that is on the move and ready for something new and exciting . "
We wonder how long it will be before actor , moto - geek and Ewan McGregor wingman Charley Boorman abuses a Symba like he abused a Cub in this classic vid :

I love photographing flowers .
They ’re gorgeous , amazing works of natural art .
They shine , rich with the colors of love and soul , and even as they age , wither and slowly drop their petals , they hold a certain beauty , a certain eternal grace that follows them out of spring and into the months of the year less hospitable to their delicate artifice .
To me , they are the culmination of nature ’s own artistic ingenuity , a testament to the glorious beauty of the world in which we are all so fortunate to live .
By capturing that beauty with the lense of a camera , I work to preserve the visual impact of these incredible blossoms , to bring to digital life and a kind of cyberspace immortality the arcs and clusters they form , to share and keep for the world something that , while brief and passing in it ’s beauty , is ultimately timeless .
A note about these photos :
These pictures were taken by Earl S. Wynn on the grounds of Morningsun Herb Farm in Vacaville , California , though one or two were also taken of flowers he grows on the rural ranch where he lives .
I 'd like to be able to offer them as stock , but I 've had some trouble with people copying my materials outright and claiming it as theirs before proceeding to out - market me so that I no longer get the page view compensation I deserve .
If you like what you see here , feel free to link back to this article ( or the slideshow ) , or contact me directly if you 're interested in using these photos for anything you want .
I 'm really friendly and easy to work with .

( CNN ) -- Jenson Button 's opening two wins of the Formula One season will stand after motorsport chiefs ruled on Wednesday that the aerodynamic diffuser fitted to the rear of his Brawn GP car is legal .
Jenson Button 's victories in the opening two races of the F1 season were on the line .
The FIA Court of Appeal said that the rear diffusers used by the Brawn , Williams and Toyota teams " comply with the applicable regulations . "
The FIA panel sat for eight hours in Paris on Tuesday to hear evidence and their decision backs up the stewards at the season - opening Australian Grand Prix that the controversial aerodynamic devices were within the rules .
Four rival teams , led by Ferrari , had lodged an official appeal against that decision and if had been successful the results in Australia and Malaysia would have been altered to their advantage .
Brawn GP chief Ross Brawn had mounted a robust defense of his position .
" We did n't consider this to be a radical new design .
It was an innovative approach of an existing idea , and Formula One is all about innovative design .
It 's a cornerstone and objective of the sport , " he told Press Association .
In a statement released after the decision , Brawn added :
" The FIA technical department , the stewards at the Australian and Malaysian Grands Prix and now five judges at the International Court of Appeal have confirmed our belief that our cars have always strictly complied with the 2009 technical regulations .
" The decision of the International Court of Appeal brings this matter to a conclusion and we look forward to continuing on the track the challenge of what has been a very exciting start to the 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship . "
The third round of the F1 season takes place in Shanghai this weekend with other teams now having to play catch - up on the all - conquering Brawn .
After a 1 - 2 in Australia with Button and Rubens Barrichello they lead the constuctors ' championship ahead of Toyota .
In the title race , Button has 15 points , five more than Barrichello .
Toyota pair Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock are next
The Brawn GP team was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by Brawn and Nick Fry after Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 2008 due to the economic downturn .
Button 's victory in Melbourne capped a remarkable reversal of fortunes for the team , but the legal wrangling threatened to dampen their celebrations before Wednesday 's conclusive ruling .
Ferrari reacted coolly to the decision with team principal Stefano Domenicali sayng they would have to re-design their car .
" Unfortunately this decision forces us to intervene on fundamental areas of the car 's design in order to be able to compete on an equal footing with some of the teams , " he told the Press Association .
" We will now double our efforts to get the team back to the highest level of competitiveness . "

Sharpless 308

Explanation : Blown by fast winds from a hot , massive star , this cosmic bubble is huge .
Cataloged as Sharpless 308 it lies some 5,200 light - years away in the constellation Canis Major and covers over 2/3 degree on the sky ( compared with 1/2 degree for the Full Moon ) .
That corresponds to a diameter of 60 light - years at its estimated distance .
The massive star itself , a Wolf - Rayet star , is the bright blue one near the center of the nebula .
Wolf - Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief , pre-supernova phase of massive star evolution .
Fast winds from this Wolf - Rayet star create the bubble - shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution .
The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000 years .
Relatively faint emission captured in the expansive image is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms mapped to bluish hues .
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen addresses the media during his news conference after the NATO summit in Strasbourg , April 4 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan ’s Taliban insurgents say the incoming NATO chief is the “ major enemy ” of Muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad when prime minister of Denmark .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen , Danish premier until earlier this month , is due in August to become secretary general of NATO , which leads a 56,000 - strong international force fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan .
The publication of the cartoons in a Danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the Muslim world , including bloody protests in Afghanistan in which several people were killed .
Rasmussen had defended the publication of the cartoons on the grounds of free speech and refused to apologize to Muslim countries .
In an article posted on the Taliban 's website ( alemarah1.org/english / ) , the insurgent group said Rasmussen 's appointment would " further strengthen the faith of the Muslims " to fight against NATO and would lead to " intensification of war " in Afghanistan .
“ The major enemy of Islam ’s Prophet ... has become the secretary general of NATO , ” said the undated article .
Turkey , NATO ’s only mainly Muslim member , dropped its veto to Rasmussen ’s appointment this month after U.S. President Barack Obama offered promises that one of Rasmussen ’s deputies would be a Turk and Turkish commanders would be present at NATO command .
Turkey had said Rasmussen ’s appointment would exacerbate hostility toward the West in Muslim countries , including Afghanistan , where NATO ’s military operation is the biggest in its history .
The Taliban have made a comeback in recent years after being driven out of Kabul by U.S. - backed Afghan forces in 2001 .
The al Qaeda - backed group has vowed to drive the foreign troops out of Afghanistan .
Last week , a new candidate entered Miami 's mayoral race on a platform of health - care reform and mosquito control .
Riptide is n't sure if running on those issues alone will win a mayoral race , but they 're pretty standard political fair .
The lady behind the ideas , though , is n't your standard politician .
Coconut Grove resident Sinthyia R. Darkness is a paranormal activity expert , founder of the Miami Center for Paranormal Research , horror author , and now 2009 mayoral candidate , according to an announcement on her official website .
Considering talk show host Enrique Santos won 26 percent of the vote in the last mayoral race in the city , and frequent school board meeting audience member Helen Williams won 35 percent of the vote in the past race for county mayor , we 're not sure if we should totally write her off just yet .

Wollongong 's Wesley Church of the Mall has weathered many storms , but the latest affront is attacking its very foundation .
Police have been called in to safeguard the 127 - year - old sandstone building that is being eroded by people both urinating and fornicating against the walls .
The problem , which has also led to a discolouration and stench along the base of the church , was reported to police by Reverend Gordon Bradbery about six months ago .
" This has been going on for years but has become more prominent in recent times , " he said .
" It 's indicative of the behaviour of people in the mall , particularly those who come through inebriated .
" That sandstone is part of the original structure that was put up in 1882 so it 's over 125 years old .
It 's just a complete lack of respect .
" Wollongong Police Inspector Brian
Wyver said samples taken from the building had shown a variety of human waste , including urine and semen .
" There is evidence people have also been fornicating against the church wall , '' he said .
Insp
Wyver said since the church reported its concerns , regular police patrols had been conducted in the area .
" We have been issuing quite a few tickets .
People should also be aware there is video surveillance in this area , '' he said .
" This is n't just an act of offensive behaviour , it 's a separate crime that covers attacks on religious buildings .
" Rev Bradbery said a recent escalation in the crime appeared related to an absence of public toilets in the CBD , combined with the church 's location on a busy thoroughfare that linked a number of licensed premises .
" I would say probably this was because there were no public toilets around Wollongong , " he said .
" There used to be some public toilets down at the Town Hall but they 're now closed so there 's just no facilities in Wollongong at all for people after hours .
"
The disturbance to church services by hooligans had also resulted in police establishing a command post outside the building on Christmas Eve .

Mad Max may be roaring back onto the silver screen nearly 25 years after the third in the iconic series was released .
But Mel Gibson probably will not be taking part , according to a News Limited report .
Shooting for new film is tipped to begin later this year and scouting for locations has already started , the report said .
The first Mad Max movie - set in an apocalyptic future in Australia and directed by George Miller - shot a 21 - year - old Mel Gibson to international stardom .
It was followed by Mad Max 2 in 1981 , then Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome , co-starring Tina Turner , in 1985 .

The media campaign found sympathetic ears in the English press , accustomed to plurality and a degree of independence uncommon by Italian standards .
The Times ran several articles as well as an editorial calling Berlusconi to account for both the Noemi affair and the motivations for the guilty verdict in the Mills ' case .
The Guardian followed suit yesterday in an editorial .
Today The Observer also called Mr. Berlusconi to account , concluding however that la Repubblica may have to wait a long time for answers .
Today la Repubblica claims to have answered five of the questions on their own merit .
La Repubblica published today a lengthy investigation into Berlusconi's affair with Noemi Letizia .
In previous articles La Repubblica had investigated Berlusconi 's numerous assertions concerning his presence at Noemi 's 18th birthday party , concluding that they were largely false or misleading .
La Repubblica pressed the point with a multimedia campaign that summarized the obscure points of the affair in ten questions .
Rather than affront his responsibilities towards the public and the institutions , Berlusconi has resorted to distractive space - grabbing , character assassination , insults , false allegations .
Yesterday , Saturday , he gave twelve interviews in which he continued his attacks against parliament , calling for a popular petition which would cull " millions " of signatures .
Berlusconi has in the past gathered " millions " of signatures in record breaking time , sometimes a matter of hours - hardly any verifiable beyond a few thousand followers .
Berlusconi further asserted that the opposition was not necessary to make " reforms " and that those who vote for the left do so out of envy .
Berlusconi has yet to inform the public what constitutes envy of his person or circumstances .
His well - known tactics ( a modern improvement on Joe McCarthy 's adroit manipulation of the press ) serve to distract attention from the core issues :
If Mills has been condemned for taking bribes from Berlusconi , what is Berlusconi 's legal and ethical position ?
Veronica Lario has asked for divorce on the grounds that her husband frequents minors ( plural ) .
She added that she has sought to help him but considers that he is sick .
In today 's scoop Giuseppe D'Avanzo and Conchita Sannino reveal Noemi 's past relation with a young Neapolitan , Gino Flaminio , and their breakup due to Noemi 's personality change once she began to hang out with Berlusconi .
In the interview ( both in print edition and in video ) Gino Flaminio tells how Berlusconi discovered Noemi through the good offices of Emilio Fede and eventually began to invite her to visit him , culminating in a near - ten day bash over the recent New Year 's holidays , Noemi with another thirty to forty young women .
Following Noemi's stay in Berlusconi's Sardinia villa Gino Flaminio broke up with Noemi .
He described his relation at that point as being like Britney Spears fiancée to a neighbourhood butcher .
Gino , 22 anni , operaio , una passione per la kickboxing , è stato per sedici mesi ( dal 28 agosto del 2007 al 10 gennaio del 2009 ) l'" amore " di Noemi Letizia , la minorenne di cui il premier ha voluto festeggiare il diciottesimo anno in un ristorante di Casoria , il 26 aprile .
Gino e Noemi si sono divisi , per quel breve , intenso , felice periodo le ore , i sogni , il fiato , le promesse .
" Quando non dormivo da lei a Portici - è capitato una ventina di volte - o quando lei non dormiva qui da me , il sabato che non lavoravo mi tiravo su alle sei del mattino per portarle la colazione a letto ; poi l'accompagnavo a scuola e ci tornavo poi per riportarla indietro con la mia Yamaha .
Lei qualche volta veniva a prendermi in fabbrica , la sera , quando poteva " .
Gino , 22 years old , worker , a passion for kickboxing , was Noemi Letizia 's " love " for sixteen months ( from August 28 , 2007 , to January 10,2009 ) .
Noemi is the minor whose 18th birthday last April 26th was celebrated by Berlusconi in a restaurant in Casoria .
Gino and Noemi shared for a brief , intense , happy period their time , dreams , breath and promises .
" When I did n't sleep at her house at Portici - about twenty times - or when she slept here at my place , Saturdays when I was off work I would get up at six in the morning to make her breakfast in bed .
Then I 'd take her to school and bring her back on my Yamaha .
Sometimes she would come to pick me up at the factory when she could . "
Gino Flaminio è in grado di dire quando e come Silvio Berlusconi è entrato nella vita di Noemi .
Come quel " miracolo " ( così Gino definisce l'inatteso irrompere del premier ) ha cambiato - di Noemi - la vita , i desideri , le ambizioni e più tangibilmente anche il corpo , il volto , le labbra , gli zigomi ; in una parola , dice Gino , " i valori " .
Il ragazzo può raccontare come quell ' ospite inaspettato dal nome così importante che faceva paura anche soltanto a pronunciarlo nel piccolo mondo di gente che duramente si fatica la giornata e un piatto caldo , ha deviato anche la sua di vita .
Quieto come chi si è ormai pacificato con quanto è avvenuto , Gino ricorda : " Mi è stato quasi subito chiaro che tra me e la mia memi non poteva andare avanti .
Era come pretendere che Britney Spears stesse con il macellaio giù all ' angolo ... " .
Gino Flaminio can tell us when and how Silvio Berlusconi entered Noemi 's life .
How that " miracle " ( this is how Gino defines the sudden the premier 's advent ) changed , in Noemi , her life , desires , ambitions and more tangibly also her body , face , lips , cheeks ; in a word , Gino says , " values . "
The young man can tell how this unexpected guest - with a name so important to instil fear only to pronounce it in this small world of folks who work hard every day for a hot plate - changed the course of his life .
Calm as someone who had long since come to terms with past events , Gino remembers , " It was almost immediately clear to me that the story between me and " Memi " would n't last .
It 's like pretending that Britney Spears stays with the local butcher ... "
Berlusconi has repeatedly asserted that he knew Noemi through his friendship with her father .
Beyond the complicity of Benedetto Elio Letizia , her father , no proof has emerged that Berlusconi ever knew the family .
To the contrary every single assertion has been debunked in the press .
Gino decidedly contradicts Berlusconi's repeatedly corrected versions .
" I genitori di Noemi non c'entrano niente .
Il legame era proprio con lei .
È nato tra Berlusconi e Noemi .
Mai Noemi mi ha detto che lui , papi Silvio parlava di politica con suo padre , Elio .
Non mi risulta proprio .
Mai , assolutamente .
Vi dico come è cominciata questa storia e dovete sapere che almeno per l'inizio - perché poi quattro , cinque volte ho ascoltato anch 'io le telefonate - vi dirò quel che mi ha raccontato Noemi .
Il rapporto tra Noemi e il presidente comincia più o meno intorno all ' ottobre 2008 .
Noemi mi ha raccontato di aver fatto alcune foto per un " book " di moda .
Lo aveva consegnato a un'agenzia romana , importante - no , il nome non me lo ricordo - di quelle che fanno lavorare le modelle , le ballerine , insomma le agenzie a cui si devono rivolgere le ragazze che vogliono fare spettacolo .
Noemi mi dice che , in quell ' agenzia di Roma , va Emilio Fede e si porta via questi " book " , mica soltanto quello di Noemi .
Non lo so , forse gli servono per i casting delle meteorine .
Il fatto è - ripeto , è quello che mi dice Noemi - che , proprio quel giorno , Emilio Fede è a pranzo o a cena - non me lo ricordo - da Berlusconi .
Finisce che Fede dimentica quelle foto sul tavolo del presidente .
È così che Berlusconi chiama Noemi .
Quattro , cinque mesi dopo che il " book " era nelle mani dell ' agenzia , dice Noemi .
È stato un miracolo , dico sempre .
Dunque , dice Noemi che Berlusconi la chiama al telefono .
Proprio lui , direttamente .
Nessuna segretaria .
Nessun centralino .
Lui , direttamente .
Era pomeriggio , le cinque o le sei del pomeriggio , Noemi stava studiando .
Berlusconi le dice che ha visto le foto ; le dice che è stato colpito dal suo " viso angelico " , dalla sua " purezza " ; le dice che deve conservarsi così com'è , " pura " .
Questa fu la prima telefonata , io non c'ero e vi sto dicendo quel che poi mi rifer ì
Noemi , ma le credo .
Le cose andarono così perché in altre occasioni io c'ero e Noemi , così per gioco o per convincermi che davvero parlava con Berlusconi , m'allungava il cellulare all ' orecchio e anch 'io sentii dalla sua voce quella cosa della " purezza " , della " faccia d'angelo " .
E poi , una volta , ha aggiunto un ' altra cosa del tipo : " Sei una ragazza divina " .
Berlusconi , all ' inizio , non ha detto a Noemi chi era .
In quella prima telefonata , le ha fatto tante domande : quanti anni hai , cosa ti piacerebbe fare , che cosa fanno tua madre e tuo padre ?
Studi ?
Che scuola fai ?
Una lunga telefonata .
Ma normale , tranquilla .
E poi , quando Noemi si è decisa a chiedergli : " Scusi , ma con tutte queste domande , lei chi è ? " , lui prima le ha risposto : " Se te lo dico , non ci credi " .
E poi : " Ma non si sente chi sono ? " .
" Noemi 's parents have nothing to do with it .
The relation was directly with her .
It started between Berlusconi and Noemi .
Noemi never told me that Papi Silvio discussed politics with her father , Elio .
I 've never heard about it .
Absolutely never .
I 'll tell you how it started and you 've got to understand that in the beginning - because later I listened in on their calls four or five times - I 'll tell you what Noemi said .
The relation between Noemi and the president began more or less around October 2008 .
Noemi told me she had done some pictures for a fashion book .
She had taken it to a Roman agency , an important one - I do n't remember the name - that gets work for models , ballerinas , in short , the sort of agency where girls go to get into show business .
Noemi told me that Emilio Fede goes to that Rome agency and takes the books away , not only Noemi's of course .
I do n't know , I guess for casting his " meteorinas . "
The fact is - I 'm repeating what Noemi told me - just on that day Emilio Fede had dinner or lunch - I do n't remember - with Berlusconi .
In the end Fede forgot her pictures on the president 's table .
And that 's how Berlusconi called up Noemi .
Four or five months after the book had been in the agency 's hands , Noemi said .
It was a miracle , I always say .
So , Berlusconi calls Noemi up .
Him , directly .
No secretary .
It was afternoon , five or six o'clock .
Noemi was studying .
Berlusconi says he 'd seen her pictures .
He says he was struck by her " angelic face , " by her " purity . "
He says that she must stay like this , " pure . "
That was the first telephone call .
I was n't there but Noemi told me and I believe her .
That 's how things went because on other occasions I was with her , and just to show for play and convince me that she really was talking to Berlusconi , she 'd let me listen and I heard his voice saying these things about " purity " and " angelic face . "
And then once he added something like , " You 're a divine girl . "
In the beginning Berlusconi would n't say who he was .
In the first call he asked a lot of questions : How old are you ?
What do you like to do ?
What do your mother and father do ?
Do you study ?
What school do you go to ?
A long call .
Normal , easy - going .
And then when Noemi decided to ask him who he was , " Excuse me , but who are you ? "
He answered first , " If I tell you , you wo n't believe it . "
And he added : " Ca n't you hear who I am ? " Quando Noemi me lo raccontò , vi dico la verità , io non ci credevo .
Poi , quando ho sentito le altre telefonate e ho potuto ascoltare la sua voce , proprio la sua , di Berlusconi , come potevo non crederci ?
Noemi mi diceva che era sempre il presidente a chiamarla .
Poi , non so se chiamava anche di suo , non me lo diceva e io non lo so .
Lei al telefono lo chiamava papi tranquillamente .
Anche davanti a me .
Magari stavamo insieme , Noemi rispondeva , diceva papi e io capivo che si trattava del presidente .
Quando ho assistito ad alcune telefonate tra Berlusconi e Noemi , ho pensato che fosse un rapporto come tra padre e figlia .
Una sera , Emilio Fede e Berlusconi - insieme - hanno chiamato Noemi .
Lo so perché ero accanto a lei , in auto .
Ora non saprei dire perché il presidente le ha passato Emilio Fede , non lo so .
Pensai che Fede dovesse preparare dei " provini " per le meteorine , quelle robe lì " .
( Ieri , a tarda sera , durante Studio Aperto , Fede ha affermato di aver conosciuto la nonna di Noemi .
Repubblica ha chiesto a Gino se , in qualche occasione , Noemi avesse fatto cenno a questa circostanza .
" Mai , assolutamente " , è stata la risposta del ragazzo ) .
When Noemi told me this , believe me , I did n't believe her .
But when I heard the other calls and I could hear his voice , his , Berlusconi's , how could n't I believe it ?
Noemi told me that it was he who always called .
I do n't know if she also called him .
She did n't tell me and I do n't know .
On the phone she always called him Papi .
Even in front of me .
Maybe we were together , Noemi answered , said " Papi " and I understood it was the president .
When I listened in on some of the calls between Berlusconi and Noemi I figured it was a father - daughter relation .
One evening , Emilio Fede and Berlusconi - together - called Noemi .
I know because we were together in the car .
Now I do n't know why Berlusconi passed her Emilio Fede , I do n't know .
I guess Fede had to prepare some auditions for his " meteorinas , " that sort of thing .
( Last night , very late , during Studio Aperto , Fede declared that he knew Noemi 's grandmother .
Repubblica asked Gino if , in any occasion , Noemi had referred to this circumstance .
" Never , absolutely , " was the young man 's reply . )
" Ho cominciato a distaccarmi da Noemi già a dicembre .
Però la cosa che proprio non ho mandato giù è stata la lunga vacanza di Capodanno in Sardegna , nella villa di lui .
Noemi me lo disse a dicembre che papi l'aveva invitata là .
Mi disse : " Posso portare un'amica , un'amica qualunque , non gli importa .
Ci saranno altre ragazze " .
E lei si è portata Roberta .
E poi è rimasta con Roberta per tutto il periodo .
Io le ho fatto capire che non mi faceva piacere , ma lei da quell ' orecchio non ci sentiva .
Così è partita verso il 26 - 27 dicembre ed è ritornata verso il 4 - 5 gennaio .
Quando è tornata mi ha raccontato tante cose .
Che Berlusconi l'aveva trattata bene , a lei e alle amiche .
Hanno scherzato , hanno riso ... C'erano tante ragazze .
Tra trenta e quaranta .
Le ragazze alloggiavano in questi bungalow che stavano nel parco .
E nel bungalow di Noemi erano in quattro : oltre a lei e a Roberta , c'erano le " gemelline " , ma voi sapete chi sono queste " gemelline " ?
Penso anche che lei mi abbia detto tante bugie .
Lei dice che Berlusconi era stato con loro solo la notte di Capodanno .
Vi dico la verità , io non ci credo .
Sono successe cose troppo strane .
Io chiamavo Noemi sul cellulare e non mi rispondeva mai .
Provavo e riprovavo , poi alla fine mi arrendevo e chiamavo Roberta , la sua amica , e diventavo pazzo quando Roberta mi diceva : no , non te la posso passare , è di là - di là dove ?
- o sta mangiando : e allora ? , dicevo io , ma non c'era risposta .
Per quella vacanza di fine anno , i genitori accompagnarono Noemi a Roma .
Noemi e Roberta si fermarono prima in una villa lì , come mi dissero poi , e fecero in tempo a vedere davanti a quella villa tanta gente - giornalisti , fotografi ? - , poi le misero sull ' aereo privato del presidente insieme alle altre ragazze , per quello che mi ha detto Noemi ...
I started distancing myself from Noemi in December .
What I could n't take was the long New Year vacation in Sardinia in his villa .
Noemi told me in December that Papi had invited her there .
She said : " I can bring a friend , any friend , it does n't matter .
There will be other girls . "
So she took Roberta .
And she stayed with Roberta the whole time .
I let on that I did n't like it , but she could n't hear out of that ear .
So she left around December 26 - 27 and came back on January 4 - 5 .
When she came back she told me a lot of things .
That Berlusconi had treated them very nicely , her and friends .
They had joked and laughed ...
" There were so many girls .
Between thirty and forty .
The girls stayed in a bungalow in the park .
In Noemi 's bungalow there were four : besides her and Roberta , there were " the twins , " but who know who these " twins " were ?
I think she told me a bunch of lies .
She said Berlusconi had been with them on New Year 's Eve .
I 'll tell you , I do n't believe it .
Too many strange things .
I would call Noemi on her cell phone and she never answered .
I tried and tried again .
Then I gave up and called Roberta , her friend , and I went crazy when Roberta told me , - No , I can't talk to her , she 's not there .
- Where ?
- She 's eating .
- So what ?
I said , but there was no answer .
For that vacation her parents took her to Rome .
Noemi and Roberta stayed in a villa there , as they later said .
They made it in time to see a lot of people in the villa - reporters , photographers ?- then they took a flight on the president 's private jet together with other girls , according to what Noemi told me ...
Al ritorno , Noemi non è stata più la mia Noemi , la mia alicella ( acciuga , ndr ) , la ragazza semplice che amavo , la ragazza che non si vergognava di venirmi a prendere alla sera al capannone .
A gennaio ci siamo lasciati .
Eravamo andati insieme , prima di Natale , a prenotare per la sua festa di compleanno il ristorante " Villa Santa Chiara " a Casoria , la " sala Miami " - lo avevo suggerito io - e già ci si aspettava una " sorpresa " di Berlusconi , ma nessuno credeva che la sorpresa fosse proprio lui , Berlusconi in carne e ossa .
Ci siamo lasciati a gennaio e alla festa non ci sono andato .
L'ho incontrata qualche altra volta , per riprendermi un oggetto di poco prezzo ma , per me , di gran valore che era rimasto nelle sue mani .
Abbiamo avuto il tempo , un' altra volta , di avere un colloquio un po ' brusco .
Le ho restituito quasi tutte le lettere e le foto .
Le ho restituito tutto - ho conservato poche cose , questa lettera che mi scrisse prima di Natale , qualche foto - perché non volevo che lei e la sua famiglia pensassero che , diventata Noemi Sophia Loren , io potessi sputtanarla .
Oggi ho la mia vita , la mia Manuela , il mio lavoro , mille euro al mese e va bene così ché non mi manca niente .
Certo , leggo di questo nuovo fidanzato di Noemi , come si chiama ? , che non s'era mai visto da nessuna parte anche se dice di conoscerla da due anni e penso che Noemi stia dicendo un sacco di bugie .
Quante bugie mi avrà detto sui viaggi .
A me diceva che andava a Roma sempre con la madre .
Per dire , per quella cena del 19 novembre 2008 a Villa Madama mi raccontò : " Siamo stati a cena con il presidente , io , papà e mamma allo stesso tavolo " .
Non c'erano i genitori seduti a quel tavolo ?
Allora mi ha detto un 'altra balla .
Quella sera le sono stati regalati una collana e un bracciale , ma non di grosso valore .
E il presidente ha fatto un regalo anche a sua madre .
Sento tante bugie , sì , e comunque sono fatti di Noemi , dei suoi genitori , di Berlusconi , io che c'entro ? "
When she came back , Noemi was n't my Noemi anymore , my alicella ( little anchovy ) , the simple girl I loved , the girl who was n't ashamed to pick me up after work .
We broke up in January .
Before Christmas we had gone to make reservations for her 18th birthday party at the restaurant " Villa Santa Chiara " in Casoria , the Miami Room .
I had suggested it - and already a surprise by Berlusconi was expected , but nobody believed that the surprise would have been him , Berlusconi in flesh and bone .
We broke in January and I did n't go to the party .
I met her a few times to pick up a thing of no value but of great importance to me that she still had .
We had enough time to have a rather terse conversation .
I gave her back almost all of her pictures and letters .
I gave her back everything - I only kept a few things like the letter she wrote me before Christmas , some pictures - because I did n't want her and her family to think that , once Noemi Sophia Loren , I could expose her .
Now I have a new life , my Manuela , my job , a thousand Euros a month and that 's fine for me , I do n't need more .
O course , when I read about this new fiancé of Noemi's - what 's his name ? - that had never been seen by anyone anywhere even if it 's said they 've known each other for two years , I think Noemi 's telling a bunch of lies .
How many lies did she tell me about her trips .
She always said she went to Rome with her mother .
Like that dinner on November 19 , 2008 , at Villa Madama , she told me , " We dined with the president , me , mom and dad at the same table . "
The parents were n't sitting at that table ?
So she was telling me another lie .
That evening she was given a necklace and a bracelet , nothing of value .
And the president gave her mother a gift .
I hear a lot of lies , yes , and anyway they 're made by Noemi , her parents and Berlusconi .
What do I have to do with it ? "
While Gino Flaminio's story may have answered five of la Repubblica 's questions , it poses new questions on Berlusconi 's alleged conduct towards young women .
At the founding convention of his brand new personal political entity , the so - called People of Liberty Party , he insisted that the two front rows be filled exclusively with attractive women , and for the concluding event he invited only women on stage to accompany him in singing the closing party jingle .
Beyond his public persona he apparently enjoys vacation harems of 30 to 40 young women as if to engage in a game of one - upmanship with Hugh Hefner .
Perhaps this explains why his wife used the plural when talking about minors .
On this latter issue Professor Gianfranco Salvioli of the University of Modena advanced the hypothesis that obsessive behaviour towards sex in the elderly could be " a psychopathological degeneration of narcissist personality traits . "
In the 1940's the great Italian writer Carlo Emilio Gadda described in detail this personality trait of tyrants , a priapic obsession with youth and sex as a template of governance .
One need not be elderly , though .
Berlusconi has always been a sympathetic charmeur , a narcissist with psychotic traits , an incurable compulsive liar .
Further , the Berlusconi gossip press has published endless spreads on Noemi , depicting her as a wholesome young creature - no one denies it - with a long - time boyfriend , a Mediaset chorus boy who released prudish interviews on their relation .
How far will Mr. Berlusconi's press continue in constructing this false reality ?
Apparently , Italy is so rich that it can afford to entertain the world with a novel and highly counter - productive model of power , the sort of power that seeks only to maintain its death hold on society and government at all costs .
( Benedetto Elio Letizia announced today his intention to sue la Repubblica , Gino Flaminio , and whoever publishes , in whole or part , this " incredible narration . " )
Here is a carefully planned reference book which will help to answer the many questions that lively children ask .
Interesting and accurate information about the Police is given within the limits of a relatively simple vocabulary .
Even children whose reading experience is limited will be encouraged by the carefully prepared text and magnificent illustrations to find out for themselves , and at the same time gain extra reading practice .
I am the only person on earth who is still watching ABC ’s Lost .
During tonight ’s show I ’m pretty sure New York Governor David Patterson walked through a shot .
I used to know people who would hold parties to watch the show .
Now I ’m confused why I wasted space on Tivo for it .
This show reminds me of a college romance ; it starts out with wild sex in the library and ends with you moving to Guatemala for the Peace Corps and her moving to Chicago to work for an pharmaceutical company , maybe you check up on each other on Facebook once every six months and then nine years later you bump into each other at a Chili ’s and you ’re pushing a baby stroller and she ’s holding hands with a guy who is a foot shorter than you and has an earring ; all you can think is , “ What were we thinking ? ”
Then you remember the first date and how flexible you used to be .
Honestly , I get the feeling the writers of Lost go online before busting out a script and pick up ideas from the fan sites .
That ’s not a joke .
The creators of this series once denied the plot would have anything to do with time travel and now that ’s all anyone does .
Flash of white light .
The character of Ben , played by Michael Emerson was supposed to have a small part in the show .
In 2007 he gets nominated for an Emmy .
The producers claim they know how the series is going to end , but I get the feeling they do n’t know how it started .
Not to mention ABC is dumping money into reviving the show like this is Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Hello , it ’s a recession .
Lost is very expensive to make according to my sources …
Wikipedia … so I understand why ABC is frightened , but it has been rudderless for years now .
You just ca n’t go back to your first French kiss at a bowling alley and you ca n’t go back to the island .

Today Washington governor Christine Gregoire signed “ The Everything but Marriage ” domestic partnership bill that grants new rights related to unemployment , disability , insurance , adoption and child custody .
Said Governor Gregoire on QFox13.com :
“ Today we are strengthening Washington by strengthening families .
From the first bill I signed in 2007 to today ’s bills , we have proudly made immeasurable strides on behalf of LGBT individuals and families .
This represents the culmination of incredible work to treat all Washingtonians equally . ”
…
“ Many brave families have come forward to share their lives , their struggles and their moments of joy hard - working men and women who are in committed relationships , raising children , attending their places of worship , and volunteering in their communities .
After meeting these families , people have come to know that lesbian and gay families are no different than their own .
And what has naturally followed is the unsettling notion that despite the sameness of straight couples and gay and lesbian couples , there are , in fact , legal barriers that prevent the same treatment . ”
Unsurprisingly , opponents have already filed a referendum to overturn the law .

While not typically known for their pointing peripherals , Verbatim recently released a line of small , portable notebook mice that should make your mobile computing more productive .
Called the Color Nano Wireless Notebook Mouse , it features a tiny USB dongle / receiver that is designed to be left in your USB port without risk of snapping off , making setting up easier when working on - the - go .
Like the Lingo Wireless Mouse we ’ve seen previously , Verbatim ’s Color Nano Wireless Notebook Mouse also includes a small storage space in the mouse itself for the USB dongle ( in case you run out of ports and ca n’t leave it plugged in ) .
This optical Color Nano uses the 2.4GHz wireless spectrum for reliable and responsive performance , comes in your choice of 7 colors ( hence the name ) and plays equally well with both PC or Mac .
The dimensions of the mouse itself have been omitted , but the focus here is on the diminutive size of the transmitter and usability .
It is certainly not a Z - Nano competitor .
Verbatim ’s Color Nano Wireless Notebook
Mouse is available now in pink , blue , red , green , purple , yellow or graphite – priced between $ 20 and $ 30 from Amazon.com .

A brilliant new trailer for Valve ’s old multiplayer title , Team Fortress 2 , has been released .
If you enjoyed the previous character trailers , this one will definitely have you cracking up .
This video highlights the Spy , a murderous womanizer who lets nothing get in his way .
By the way , Valve should probably forgo videogame development and just make CG films from now on .
Enjoy !

When Rupert Isaacson decided to take his autistic son , Rowan , on a trip to Mongolia to ride horses and seek the help of shamans two years ago , he had a gut instinct that the adventure would have a healing effect on the boy .
Mr. Isaacson ’s instinct was rewarded after the trip , when some of Rowan ’s worst behavioral issues , including wild temper tantrums , all but disappeared .
Now the publisher of Mr. Isaacson ’s book about the journey , “ The Horse Boy , ” has a similar instinct about the market potential of his story , and is hoping for its own happy ending .
Little , Brown & Company , which released “ The Horse Boy ” on Tuesday , has a lot riding on its success : the publisher paid more than $ 1 million in an advance to Mr. Isaacson before he and his family had even taken their Mongolian trip .
Michael Pietsch , publisher of Little , Brown , said booksellers had already placed orders high enough to justify a first printing of 150,000 copies .
I needed to install a perl extension from a third - party .
It ’s an interface to a shared library , a . so file , that they also supply .
Normally I ’d add the directory containing the shared library to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable .
Then when the extension is loaded the system dynamic loader can find it .
For various reasons I did n’t want to do that in this case .
An alternative approach is to pre-load the shared library with a flag to make it ’s symbols globally available for later linking .
( The flag is called RTLD_GLOBAL on Linux , Solaris and other systems that use dlopen ( ) .
This hack may not work on other systems . )
But how to pre-load the shared library , only when needed , and without changing any existing perl code ?
This is where the pesky little .bs files that get installed with perl extensions come in handy .
They ’re known as ‘ bootstrap ’ files .
If the .bs file for an extension not empty then DynaLoader ( and XSLoader ) will execute the contents just before loading the shared object for the extension .
So I put code like this into the .bs file for the extension :
use DynaLoader ; DynaLoader::dl_load_file ( " $ENV {...}/...so " , 1 ) or die DynaLoader : : dl_error ( ) ;
Not a recommended approach , but neat and handy for me in this case .
If you lost yourself in this post , I advise you to start in catamorphisms , then anamorphisms and then hylomorphisms .
Like I said before ( in those posts ) when you write an hylomorphism over a particular data type , that means just that the intermediate structure is that data type .
In fact that data will never be stored into that intermediate type or .
Because we glue the ana and cata together into a single recursive pattern .
and could be some data type your function need .
With this post I will try to show you more hylomorphisms over some different data types to show you the power of this field .
Leaf Tree’s
The data type that we going to discuss here is the .
In Haskell we can represent as :
data LTree a = Leaf a | Fork ( LTree a , LTree a )
Is just like a binary tree , but the information is just in the leaf’s .
Even more : a leaf tree is a tree that only have leaf ’s , no information on the nodes .
This is an example of a leaf tree :
To represent all the hylomorphisms over we draw the following diagram :
The example I ’m going to give is making the fibonacci function using a hylomorphism over this data type .
If you remember the method I used before , I ’m going to start by the anamorphism .
Before that I ’m going to specify the strategy to define factorial .
I ’m going to use the diagram ’s again , remember that type is equivalent to Haskell :
As you can see I ’m going to use as my intermediate structure , and I ’ve already define the names of my gen functions to the catamorphism and to the anamorphism .
The strategy I prefer , is do all the hard work in the anamorphism , so here the gen for the anamorphism is :
fibd n | n < 2 = i1 ( ) | otherwise = i2 ( n - 1, n -2 )
This function combined with the anamorphism , going to generate leaf tree ’s with leaf ’s , being the result of that fib .
Then we just have to write the gen for the catamorphism .
This function ( combined with the catamorphism ) counts the number of leafs that a leaf tree have .
add = either ( const 1 ) plus where plus = uncurry (+)
The final function , the fibonacci function is the hylomorphism of those two defined before :
fib = hyloLTree add fibd
Here is all the auxiliary functions you need to run this example :
inLTree = either Leaf Fork outLTree :: LTree a ->
Either a ( LTree a , LTree a ) outLTree ( Leaf a ) = i1 a outLTree ( Fork ( t1,t2 ) ) = i2 ( t1,t2 ) cataLTree a = a .
( recLTree ( cataLTree a ) ) .
outLTree anaLTree f = inLTree .
( recLTree ( anaLTree f ) ) .
f hyloLTree a c = cataLTree a .
anaLTree c baseLTree g f = g -|- ( f >< f ) recLTree f = baseLTree id f
Lists
The lists that I ’m going to talk here , are the Haskell lists , wired into the compiler , but is a definition exist , it will be :
data [ a ] = [ ] | a : [ a ]
So , our diagram to represent the hylomorphism over this data type is :
The function I ’m going to define as a hylomorphism is the factorial function .
So , we know that our domain and co-domain is , so now we can make a more specific diagram to represent our solution :
As you can see I ’m going to use to represent my intermediate data , and I ’ve already define the names of my gen functions to the catamorphism and to the anamorphism .
Another time , that I do all the work with the anamorphism , letting the catamorphism with little things to do ( just multiply ) .
I ’m start to show you the catamorphism first :
mul = either ( const 1 ) mul ' where mul ' = uncurry (*)
As you can see the only thing it does is multiply all the elements of a list , and multiply by 1 when reach the empty list .
In the other side , the anamorphism is generating a list of all the elements , starting in ( the element we want to calculate the factorial ) until 1 .
nats = ( id - |- ( split succ id ) ) .
outNat
And finally we combine this together with our hylo , that defines the factorial function :
fac = hylo mul nats
Here is all the code you need to run this example :
inl = either ( const [ ] ) ( uncurry ( : ) ) out [ ] = i1 ( ) out ( a : x ) = i2 ( a , x ) cata g = g . rec ( cata g ) .
out ana h = inl .
( rec ( ana h ) ) . h hylo g h = cata g .
ana h rec f = id - |- id >< f
Binary Tree’s
Here , I ’m going to show you the hanoi problem solved with one hylomorphism , first let ’s take a look at the structure :
data BTree a = Empty | Node( a , ( BTree a , BTree a ) )
So , our generic diagram representing one hylomorphism over is :
There is a well - known inductive solution to the problem given by the pseudocode below .
In this solution we make use of the fact that the given problem is symmetrical with respect to all three poles .
Thus it is undesirable to name the individual poles .
Instead we visualize the poles as being arranged in a circle ; the problem is to move the tower of disks from one pole to the next pole in a speciﬁed direction around the circle .
The code deﬁnes to be a sequence of pairs where n is the number of disks , is a disk number and are directions .
Disks are numbered from onwards , disk being the smallest .
Directions are boolean values , representing a clockwise movement and an anti-clockwise movement .
The pair means move the disk numbered from its current position in the direction .
excerpt from R. Backhouse , M. Fokkinga / Information Processing Letters 77 ( 2001 ) 71–76
So , here , I will have a diagram like that , type stands for and type for :
I ’m going to show all the solution here , because the description of the problem is in this quote , and in the paper :
hanoi = hyloBTree f h f = either ( const [ ] ) join where join ( x , ( l, r ) ) =l ++[ x ] ++r h( d,0 ) = Left ( ) h( d , n+1 ) = Right ( ( n , d ) , ( ( not d , n ) , ( not d , n ) ) )
And here it is , all the code you need to run this example :
inBTree :: Either ( ) ( b , ( BTree b , BTree b ) ) ->
BTree b inBTree = either ( const Empty ) Node out BTree :: BTree a -> Either ( ) ( a , ( BTree a , BTree a ) ) out BTree Empty = Left ( ) out BTree ( Node ( a , ( t1,t2 ) ) ) = Right ( a , ( t1,t2 ) ) baseBTree f g = id - |- ( f >< g ) ) cataBTree g = g .
( recBTree ( cataBTree g ) ) . out BTree anaBTree g = inBTree .
( recBTree ( anaBTree g ) ) . g hyloBTree h g = cataBTree h .
anaBTree g recBTree f = baseBTree id f
Outroduction
Maybe in the future I will talk more about that subject .
The only reason we know anything about all those claims for light bulbs and moat cleaning is that campaigning journalist Heather Brooke has spent the last five years fighting tooth and nail for MPs to come clean about their expenses ...
I 've always been in love with old - style investigative journalism .
You know those movies in the 1930s and 40s about the press in Chicago featuring hard - bitten hacks with hearts of gold , like Hildy Johnson in His Girl Friday ?
I always wanted to be that kind of reporter .
I 'm not sure if an onslaught of details about bath plugs and porn movies was how I envisioned the great investigation of my career , but then there are high principles at stake behind this week 's scandal about the petty enrichment of our members of parliament .
When I first telephoned the House of Commons about expenses , back in 2004 , I was working on a book called Your Right to Know , a citizen 's guide to using the Freedom of Information Act ( just as the law was coming into force ) .
It was my attempt to get back into serious reporting after taking a break to study literature and write for kids ' magazines .
When I made that call , I did n't intend to bring a plague on all politicians ' houses .
But I was interested in our opaque parliamentary expenses system , having learned about the highly transparent system of political expenses in Washington state ; when I was there in 1992 as a student reporter I 'd been able to access my local politicians ' receipts in a matter of days .
Little did I realise that this simple request to the Commons would end up becoming a five - year investigation , and take me to the high court and back .
That first day , it took some time to navigate the parliamentary switchboard and find someone who knew what I was talking about when I asked about freedom of information .
( Surprising , when you consider the law had actually been passed in 2000 and the five - year preparation time was the longest for any country - ever . )
Eventually , I found someone who dealt with FOI but when I explained that I was after a breakdown of MPs ' expenses I was met with baffled silence .
A while later I was told that the expenses would be published in October 2004 .
Well , the expenses duly came out .
But they were bulk figures in various categories : travel , staff , second homes etc .
I wanted the detail .
That 's where you find the truth .
But the Commons would not consider letting the public see this .
In fact , they would not even discuss how the system of expenses operated .
I thought this was strange and it made me suspicious .
After all , if the system worked well , why would n't they feel confident about explaining it to me ?
So I began filing my first freedom of information requests .
These are simply letters or emails written to the FOI officer of the Commons laying out what you want to know .
You can make these requests to all public bodies and they have 20 working days to respond - though many exceed the deadline and are not punished for it .
If they refuse , you can appeal internally and then to the outside regulator , the information commissioner .
I did one request for travel information ( refused ) , then for the names and salaries of MPs ' staff ( this was blocked personally by Speaker Michael Martin ) and then finally one for information on second homes .
Initially I asked for the details for all MPs , but this was refused , so then I narrowed it down to 10 - the leaders of the parties and a few ministers .
This was in 2006 .
My request for details on second homes was rejected , but in July that year I took it to the information commissioner , Richard Thomas .
He is independent , but appointed and paid for by the government - so exactly how independent is up for debate .
My request sat in his in - tray for a year .
This is not uncommon and , indeed , two other cases seeking similar details on two other MPs had been languishing even longer ( requests brought by Ben Leapman from the Sunday Telegraph and Jonathan Ungoed - Thomas from the Sunday Times ) .
Eventually , our three cases were combined and in June 2007 the commissioner finally made his decision .
It pleased no one : he refused to agree to the publication of receipts but thought the allowance could be broken down into more specific categories .
The problem was that that would have created even more work for the Commons than publishing the raw data .
The Commons appealed , as did I and the other two reporters .
Fortunately , as a campaigner as well as a journalist , I meet a lot of lawyers .
One of them was the barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC .
He was intrigued by my case and offered to represent me , pro bono , at the information tribunal at which you can appeal against the commissioner 's decisions .
When I went into the hearing in February 2008 , I was immensely grateful to have him with me , as rallied against me were a posse of lawyers and government officials , including the head of the House of Commons Fees Office Andrew Walker ( more on him later ) , FOI officer Bob Castle , the treasury solicitor and assistant and an outside barrister .
All paid for with taxpayers ' money .
The small tribunal room in Bedford Square , London , was almost full when I arrived .
The Commons people seemed to have taken over the place and it looked as though I might have to sit in the back for my own hearing .
I saw an empty chair with papers on the desk and decided to forcefully occupy it .
" You 've moved my papers . "
It was a nasal , supercilious voice ; the man bore a strong resemblance to Eric Morecambe .
This was , I soon discovered , Andrew Walker himself .
On the stand , Walker described the expense system he oversaw and why the public had no right to see what was going on in his little fiefdom .
He gave some excellent quotes as he was questioned by the lawyers :
" MPs should be allowed to carry on their duties free from interference ... "
" Public confidence is not the overriding concern per se ... "
" Transparency will damage democracy . "
" What you are doing is preparing a peephole into the private lives of a member , which will either distract them or lead them into additional questions which they feel they have to defend themselves . "
Tomlinson questioned Walker , in forensic detail , about the operation of the fees office and what documentation was required for claims as well as what was being done to verify their probity .
Here we began to uncover the extent to which MPs were writing their own cheques .
" There is checking where there are receipts .
Where there are no receipts there is no checking , " Walker said , adding that , " If it 's below £ 250 then the assumption is that it 's going to be reasonable . "
At that time , MPs could claim up to £ 250 without receipts .
Tomlinson continued to press for details .
There was the " food rule " that allowed MPs up to £ 400 a month with no receipt .
This rule was not written down anywhere and Tomlinson asked how was it , then , that MPs knew about it ?
Walker replied : " My understanding is that members are well aware .
I am unable to tell you how they are well aware of it . "
Under heavy questioning he let slip the existence of a " John Lewis list " , which was used in his office as the final arbiter of what was a reasonable price for white goods and other furnishings .
" May we see this list ? " Tomlinson asked .
We could not .
However , an FOI request was quickly filed and the list was released a short time later .
Asked if MPs could claim a large plasma TV on expenses , as had been revealed in a Times story , Walker said : " I am glad to say that story was misconceived .
It is unlikely we would allow a plasma ; we have a price cut - off .
A fish tank may be claimable but , interestingly , a claim was brought to my attention , which I rejected , and iPods we reject .
iPods are personal items and not something needed to live away from home . "
It was good to see they had some standards .
The tribunal members were less than impressed with all this and in ordering full disclosure they described the second - homes expense system as " redolent of a culture very different from that which exists in the commercial sphere or in most other public sector organisations today " and said that , coupled with the very limited nature of the checks , the system " constituted a recipe for confusion , inconsistency and the risk of misuse " .
I thought that was the end of it .
In a Guardian interview at that time I stated that it would be a bad idea for the Commons to appeal to the high court : " Either way they look foolish , incompetent and so wedded to secrecy they throw money away or there is some incredible scandal they are trying to hide . "
It seems I was right on both counts .
The speaker turned out to be a stubborn man .
His own legal team advised him against going to the high court , so he ditched them and went lawyer - shopping at taxpayers ' expense .
Not surprisingly , he found a lawyer willing to oblige .
So now I was headed to the high court .
This was serious .
Costs are generally awarded and can run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds .
Was Speaker Martin hoping the threat of bankruptcy would intimidate me ?
It was easy for him not to worry as he sat in his cloistered chamber ( renovated at taxpayer expense ) with a publicly subsidised legal team at his disposal .
Fortunately , my case was so strong , and my lawyers so good , that I had confidence I would be all right .
But in any case , the solicitor Louis Charalambous found a way for me to take out legal insurance so I would not personally be at financial risk .
It 's a unique experience being a party in a high - court case .
The barristers all come equipped with grey - flecked cardboard boxes wrapped with their own branded tape .
" KBW " for the King 's Bench Walk lawyers - now that 's classy !
It 's not just the one barrister either .
At the high court , one is not enough .
You must have two : a senior and a junior barrister , along with the solicitor , of course .
I only had one barrister and solicitor but they were more than enough to outgun the four lawyers from the Commons and the information commissioner ( all funded by the taxpayer , remember ) .
The Commons presented its two favourite arguments : privacy and security .
We heard the lawyer twist himself in knots trying to argue how it was an unseemly invasion of MPs ' privacy for the public to know how MPs spent public money in the course of their public duties .
We heard how MPs would likely be shot in their beds if their second - home addresses were made public .
No evidence was put forward to indicate that any of these threats were anything more than the self - important delusions of a paranoid conspiracy theorist .
" You have n't put forward any evidence as to the reason .
That 's the difficulty , " the judge had to repeat to the Commons lawyer on more than one occasion .
The hearing ended and on 16 May the judges ruled in my favour stating that the House of Commons expense system had a " shortfall - both in terms of transparency and accountability " and " we have no doubt that the public interest is at stake .
We are not here dealing with idle gossip , or public curiosity about what in truth are trivialities .
The expenditure of public money through the payment of MPs ' salaries and allowances is a matter of direct and reasonable interest to taxpayers . "
The Commons announced they would publish all MPs receipts in October 2008 , going back several years .
Vindication at last !
Well , not quite .
October came and went and no expenses , not even the usual aggregate totals , appeared .
It was as though the public were being punished for daring to question the great and the good .
I queried the Commons and was told that December was the new publication date .
That date , too , came and went .
MPs had their extended Christmas vacation .
When they came back they had the amazing gall to attempt , for a second time , to pass a law exempting themselves from the freedom of information law .
The Conservatives withdrew support and the measure failed .
However , Conservative MP Julian Lewis did succeed in pushing through a law that would exclude MPs ' addresses from publication .
He used the discredited " security " argument .
The Commons now claimed it was technically too difficult to publish the data any time before July 2009 .
But the receipts were scanned back in October - so why did MPs only get their copies for correction six weeks ago ?
I filmed a Dispatches programme for Channel 4 in April this year in which we painstakingly trawled through the public records .
This is the kind of journalism I like doing .
But it 's almost impossible in this country .
There is so little public information made public .
Of course , there is another type of journalism more common in Britain and , it would seem , more effective .
After all my hard work , the story of MPs ' expenses did , of course , go to the Daily Telegraph .
Extensive effort poring over documents ?
No .
It was offered the disc containing the raw data , some say for money .
Last Friday the stories began to pour forth .
As a campaigner I was thrilled to see the details finally put into the public domain .
This is important information that the public have a right to see .
But as a journalist , I was livid .
I asked myself - what is the point of doing all that work , going to court , setting a legal precedent , dealing in facts , when every part of the government conspires to reward the hacks who do none of these things ?
But I do n't begrudge the paper .
It is getting the story out in the most cost - effective way possible .
What 's unforgiveable is that the House of Commons repeatedly obstructed legitimate requests and then delayed the expense publication date and that MPs went so far as to try to exempt themselves from their own law .
I wonder , too , how much we would have actually seen if we 'd waited for the Commons to publish , given that MPs were given a free hand to black out anything that was " personal " or a danger to their " security " .
These terms have been so overused by MPs that I 've no doubt that items such as cleaning the moat would have been removed for " security " reasons , as would the house - flipping scandal , as an invasion of MPs ' privacy .
And now MPs are feeling morose .
Tough !
They 've had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing by parliament and by the people .
At every juncture they behaved in the worst possible way .
They refused legitimate requests , they wasted public money going to the high court , they delayed publication , they tried to exempt themselves from their own law , they succeeded in passing a law to keep secret their addresses from their constituents so as to hide the house flipping scandal ...
I think in order to begin the clean - up , it is necessary to get rid of those who created the mess in the first place .
Only then can we have a parliament of which we are proud .

Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek were having lunch at the Italian cafe Il Piccolino in West Hollywood in the fall of 2006 when they were served up an irresistible dish that was n’t on the menu .
The two men were presented with the chance to buy one of the best - known franchises in American cinema , the “ Terminator ” series , even though their entire producing experience consisted of one low - budget comedy that never made it into theaters .
The Hollywood neophytes were informed of the prospect by dining partner Peter Graves , a veteran movie marketer .
“ It was shocking , ” Anderson recalled .
“ We were in disbelief . ”
Soon after , Anderson and Kubicek swooped in and quietly seized the rights , going on to produce one of this summer ’s most anticipated event films , “ Terminator Salvation , ” which opened over the weekend to a relatively weak $ 53.8 million .
The movie , starring Christian Bale of the “ Batman ” films , has revived the series and catapulted Anderson and Kubicek into the Hollywood mainstream .
But they ’ve also encountered controversy along the way .
The pair have been enmeshed in several lawsuits -- since settled -- and other disputes involving investors , business associates and a major studio .

“ Terminator ” now stands alongside George Lucas ’ “ Star Wars ” as one of the few major movie brands to be independently owned and produced outside the studio system .
This comes in an age when media conglomerates build their businesses around huge properties that they turn into films , toys , video games and more .
“ It ’s remarkable that nobody in the business realized that the rights to one of the most iconic brands of all time were available , ” said Erwin Stoff , a principal of the management / production firm 3 Arts Entertainment .
Though distributors Warner Bros.
Pictures and Sony Pictures put up most of the film ’s $ 200 - million production budget , Anderson and Kubicek , who risked little of their own money , stand to rake in half of any profits that might come from box - office , DVD and television sales as well as all the proceeds from a new video game and other consumer products .
In addition , the two control the sequel rights .
“ It was a huge coup for them , ” observed Sony Pictures Vice Chairwoman Amy Pascal .
“ I wish we owned the rights and controlled every franchise -- that ’s the business we ’re in . ”

Leapfrogging from nowhere into the Hollywood stratosphere took savvy , the right connections and , more than anything , luck .
“ At the end of the day , it ’s a pretty significant thing , ” Anderson said .
“ I feel like we ’ve been so blessed . ”
Questioned about the legal issues that trail them , both men declined to address specifics , but Anderson said , “ In all our business dealings , we always try to honor our word in any agreement we have .
I have to look at myself in the mirror every day . ”
Before venturing into Hollywood , Anderson , 41 , originally from Ohio , had been running his own brand - marketing firm , and Kubicek , 28 , a native of Miami Beach , was an aspiring writer .
The pair first discussed working together after meeting at an Oscar party in 2005 .
“ We talked about the possibility of going into the business as outsiders who would do it a little differently , ” Kubicek recalled .

By early 2006 they hatched a business plan for their venture , Halcyon Co. , positioning it as “ a 21st century entertainment company with a unique approach to creating in - demand high - quality entertainment . ”
The plan , sent to a potential investor and reviewed by The Times , aimed to raise $ 2.5 million .
In it , the partners listed Stoff as a member of Halcyon ’s advisory board and Graves , who was consulting for the pair , as vice president of marketing and distribution .
Both men told The Times that they had never held those positions .
Anderson and Kubicek , who ultimately never raised the funds , said the plan was one of many drafts simply meant for “ planning purposes ” and that the names in it were ones they “ thought would be attainable . ”
Although the proposal listed six potential film projects , the only one made so far is “ Cook - Off , ” a “ mockumentary ” about a baking competition .
The pair said they helped raise money and put in some of their own to fund the film ’s nearly $ 1 - million cost , but all did n’t end happily .
The novice producers had a falling - out with some of the cast and crew , including co-writer and actress Cathryn Michon , during editing .
And though the film premiered at the Aspen Comedy Festival in 2007 , it never was released .

That same year , one of the investors in “ Cook - Off , ” Rainer Filthaut , and two of his partners sued Anderson and Kubicek , alleging breach of contract over $ 250,000 they invested to option a screenplay for a film called “ Conspirator , ” which was never made .
The 2007 suit , later settled , alleged that the producers instead used the money for “ their own purposes . ”
In an interview , Filthaut said though he was eventually paid back , he still considered the two “ dishonest people . ”
Seth Renov , another investor in “ Conspirator , ” said that once the option fell through , Anderson and Kubicek “ promptly ” returned the funds to investors .
He called the duo “ honest , ethical and successful . ”
Anderson said that “ the money went back to the investors to repay all of them 100 % in full , which means that logically there was nothing left to use for any other purpose . ”

By this time , however , Anderson and Kubicek were making their play for “ Terminator . ”
The pair were tipped off by Graves at their fateful lunch because they believed they had access to millions of dollars of financing from Dubai .
In the 25 years since the original film was released , “ Terminator ” rights had passed through numerous hands until finally resting with independent producers Andrew Vajna and Mario Kassar , who made “ Terminator 2 " and “ 3 . ”
Graves had learned from his longtime friend Moritz Borman , another producer on “ Terminator 3 , ” that the rights were available because Vajna and Kassar were dissolving their business relationship .
“ As the little guys , this was a big play , ” recalled Kubicek , who said he and Anderson had to ask themselves some hard questions about the practicalities of rebooting the franchise without Arnold Schwarzenegger , who starred in the first three films .
“ Is there still a story to tell ?
What ’s it worth ?
Would there be interest ? ”

Anderson said he and Kubicek were wary of being used as stalking - horses in a bidding war they could n’t win .
The pair put a 24 - hour take - it - or - leave - it $ 25 - million offer on the table without disclosing their names .
“ Within six hours we received a binding term sheet , ” Kubicek recalled .
But the deal was far from closed .
After several aborted trips to the United Arab Emirates , it became clear that the Dubai funds were n’t going to materialize .
Anderson and Kubicek started searching for other backers and , in another lucky break -- this one on Super Bowl Sunday in February 2007 -- got a commitment from Santa Barbara hedge fund Pacificor .
Andrew Mitchell , now chief executive of Pacificor , said the deal was uniquely valuable “ and worth more than we were paying for it , ” even though his firm had never before , and has n’t since , invested in entertainment .

Once the deal closed in May , Borman , a seasoned producer , led talks with the studios to secure funding and distribution for “ Terminator Salvation . ”
After failing to reach a deal with Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer -- which led to another lawsuit , now settled -- Borman signed Warner Bros. to distribute the film in North America and Sony to release it in all but two foreign markets .
Warner paid $ 60 million and Sony just over $ 100 million for the rights and eventually kicked in extra money for additional footage , said several people familiar with the deals .
Halcyon used that money , along with pre-sales from South Korea and the Middle East , to fund the production .
With a version of the script in hand , Warner ’s blessing and a summer ’09 release targeted , Anderson and Kubicek quickly settled on McG to direct and Bale to star .
People close to the matter said the director received $ 6 million and Bale $ 8 million and both are guaranteed a percentage of gross ticket sales .
They added that Halcyon also made a $ 10 - million deal with McG to direct another sequel , and that Bale is on board for two more films , for which he ’ll make about $ 15 million and $ 20 million , respectively .
Advertisement
“ They included us in all decisions and treated us like partners , ” said Jeff Robinov , president of Warner Bros .
Pictures .
McG called the pair “ delightful to work with . ”
In March of this year , as the film was being edited , Anderson and Kubicek were hit with another suit , this time from their producer .
Borman , in the suit , accused them of “ egregious fraud ” for not paying him half of his $ 5 - million producing fee and alleged they had “ hijacked the production ” by cutting him out of all decision making .
The suit was settled a month later .
According to people close to the situation , Borman received the money and will be attached as a producer to future sequels but forfeited creative and financial control .
Anderson and Kubicek said they could not discuss the allegations because they were bound by the confidentiality of the settlement agreement .
Advertisement
Borman was n’t the only one to claim he was owed money after production wrapped .
On Wednesday , Graves -- who had originally led the two to “ Terminator ” -- filed a breach - of - contract claim for arbitration , saying Halcyon owed him $ 750,000 under his $ 1 - million consulting and executive - producer agreement on “ Terminator Salvation . ”
Graves declined to discuss the claim , which was reviewed by The Times .
Anderson and Kubicek deferred to Graves for comment .
Despite the drama , Anderson and Kubicek appeared cool on the evening of May 14 , walking the carpet at the premiere of “ Terminator Salvation ” at Grauman ’s Chinese Theatre .
The rookie producers made a beeline for Bale when he arrived and posed for pictures with studio executives and director McG , all while being trailed by their own photographer .
“ It ’s very exciting and very humbling , ” Anderson said as he entered the theater , where his and Kubicek ’s names flashed on the screen in huge letters above the title .

Losing my religion ...
You do n't need a medical certificate to be mad ... just be yourself !
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , announced last week that she wants to register guns .
Her next move will be to try to confiscate them .
The speaker picked a television show with a viewership of 4.6 million to float the Democrats ' coming gun-control push .
Questioned on ABC's “ Good Morning America ” about the prospect of new gun-control laws now that “ it 's a Democratic president , a Democratic House , ” she responded , “ We do n't want to take their guns away .
We want them registered . ”
Politicians and bureaucrats routinely claim that registration helps solve crimes .
If a registered gun is used in a crime and left at the crime scene , registration supposedly lets the police trace the gun back to the criminal .
Though this turn of events might work on fictional TV crime shows , it virtually never occurs in real life .
Criminals ' guns are rarely left at crime scenes .
When guns are left behind , it usually is because a crook has been seriously injured or killed and the police are poised to catch him anyway .
The few guns left at crime scenes rarely - if ever - are registered to the perpetrator .
If they are registered at all , it is to someone else , whose piece was stolen .
Despite what Mrs. Pelosi might think , those who use guns to commit major crimes such as robbing and killing are unlikely to respect her request to file paperwork so the government can catalog the tools of their trade .
Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda .
Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years .
After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners , police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs .
Given Hawaii's remote island geography , this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled .
If registration is going to work anywhere , it should work there .
Unfortunately , criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world .
Other jurisdictions with a history of strict handgun bans , such as the District of Columbia and Chicago , have even required registration of hunting rifles and shotguns for more than 20 years .
Neither the District nor Chicago can point to any crimes that have been solved using registration records .
The same rules apply across the border .
Canada , which has imposed registration of handguns since the 1930s , does not have much to show for it .
In 2006 , when the Liberal Party under Prime Minister Paul Martin controlled the government , it was admitted in parliamentary debate that just three crimes in 70 years had been solved as a result of registration .
A couple of those cases were debatable because other independent evidence helped solve the crimes .
According to the Canadian Ministry of Public Safety , just 4 percent of Canadian handgun murders in 2005 and 2006 were committed with registered handguns , and none of those were registered to the people who committed the crimes .
As for long - gun registration , at least as of 2006 , not a single violent crime had been solved through registration .
Because registration does n't help solve crime , it is important to ask why government wants to register the people 's firearms .
History provides the answer .
In countries from Australia to England , registration has been used to create lists of guns that later were confiscated by their governments .
Despite Mrs. Pelosi's assurances to the contrary , Americans ' fear that registration will lead to confiscation is well - founded .
Indeed , Mrs. Pelosi's own state of California already has used existing registration lists to confiscate so - called assault weapons just a half - dozen years ago .
The speaker claims registration wo n't lead to gun confiscation because of the Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller , which struck down the District 's handgun ban last June .
She knows full well that this judgment was based on a narrow 5 - 4 decision that could be reversed when President Obama gets his opportunity to appoint an additional liberal justice to the court .
A Gallup poll released Wednesday shows that support for gun control is “ at an all - time low ” since the issue started being surveyed nearly 50 years ago .
According to Gallup , just 29 percent favor handgun bans .
Now that Democrats are in control of the legislative and executive branches of government , even the will of the people wo n't keep them from going after the guns of law - abiding Americans .

Via email , this meltdown just keeps getting better and better :
Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. ’s appearance at a Michigan county Republican Party event was scrapped this week after the county chairwoman said that hosting the moderate Utah governor would mean abandoning the party ’s conservative principles .
Kent County Republican Party Chairwoman Joanne Voorhees abruptly canceled the party fundraiser scheduled for Saturday .
“ The voters want and expect us to stand on principle and return to our roots .
Unfortunately , by holding an event with Governor Huntsman , we would be doing the exact opposite , ” Voorhees wrote in an e-mail quoted in The Grand Rapids Press .
Voorhees did not specify which issues she felt were contrary to the party ’s principles and did not return messages left at the party headquarters and on her cell phone .
The group Campaign for Michigan Families praised the cancellation , attributing it to Huntsman ’s support of civil unions , and urged the Oakland and Kalamazoo county parties , where Huntsman is also scheduled to speak this weekend , to do the same .
Jon Huntsman , you all will recall , is the Governor of Utah , and he has an 82 % 84 % approval rating as Governor and is a very viable way forward for the current GOP .
Say it again .
He supports civil unions and has an 80 + % approval rating .
In Utah .
He is conservative on almost every issue , but because he supports civil unions , he is n’t pure enough for the current GOP .
A telegenic , authentic outsider who is n’t batshit insane .
You would think the Republicans would be running to him .
This is the big problem for Republicans .
Almost the entire party apparatus at the state level has been taken over by a bunch of lunatics , and few people outside of Georgia and Texas can win a state primary and then go on to win a statewide election .
The reason Specter switched yesterday was because the dwindling band of sociopaths who still call themselves Republican in Pennsylvania are so detached from reality , so far removed from the mainstream , and so convinced of the utter infallibility of their own bizarre brand of “ conservatism , ” that someone like Jon Huntsman or Arlen Specter , who deviated slightly on a few issues here and there , just is n’t pure enough for them .
This is the essence of wingnut , the kind of guy Larison was talking about yesterday :
That said , we should not simply dismiss Huston out of hand .
He and those like him are the political equivalent of Darwin ’s discoveries on the Galapagos : strange , unusual creatures cut off from the rest of the world that deserve to be studied and understood as the weird evolutionary offshoots that they are .
It is rare to find people who seem genuinely unaware that Cheney is deeply unpopular and also implicated in atrocious crimes , and rarer still to find people who know this and still think it wise to have him making the rounds on television serving as a leading Republican spokesman .
Some might say that Huston is simply a pitiable product of the conservative cocoon , but I say that he can offer us evidence for the strange mutant varieties of conservatism that have developed in isolation from reality .
The only people left in the Republican party are crazier than an outhouse rat and have teabags hanging from their hunting cap .
They are the people who feverishly emailed each other stories about Obama ’s birth certificate , and who are convinced that joking about Obama ’s teleprompter and making impassioned speeches about earmark reform are the only route to electoral recovery .
They think Michelle Bachman is on to something and the Colbert Report is truth .
This is only going to get worse .
Question :
" Why do you use cantilever brakes when everyone else is using V - brakes or disc brakes ? "
As your mom used to say " if everyone else was riding off a cliff would you ? " ( choose the wrong brake and you might be )
The short answer : V - brakes and disc brakes were designed for mountain bikes , and then adapted for use on road and tandem bikes .
We recommend disc brakes for mountain bikes , and we ride disc brakes on our mountain bikes .
Cantilevers have more advantages for road and tandem bikes because they were designed for use on road and tandem bikes .
Other manufacturers follow the trend because high - quality cantilever brakes have become hard to find .
Now , for those of you who want to read about the advantages here 's the long answer :
( The long answer is based on years of working in busy bike repair shops and designing bikes .
It 's the same answer , but if you 're like me , you 'll want more info to convince you that what you read in the catalogs and magazines is n't true . )
Since the ( short lived ) days of the U - brake I have always said " the problem with cantilevers is that they are lighter , easier to adjust , less expensive , and work better than the other types of brakes . "
Most tandem manufacturers use V - brakes or disc brakes , and will tell you that they are better .
What they do n't know ( because they do n't have a service shop that deals directly with the public ) is that every year , we change out several ' other ' brand tandems to cantilevers .
The truth is , it would sure be a lot easier ( and less expensive for us ) in the retail department to use V - brakes or disc brakes and just avoid this question all together .... just pretend that V - brakes or disc brakes are the best .
But , because we are a full service shop , our customers will be relying on us to make them work well .
We know from experience , that educating you is much less expensive then replacing , at no charge , 48 pairs of brakes for unhappy customers ( 1997 V - brake fiasco ) .
So , here it goes , the method to our madness :
Cantilever brakes
Cantilever brakes were used on touring bikes and tandems for decades before mountain bikes were even invented .
The cantilever evolved into an extremely powerful and reliable braking system .
Loaded touring bikes and tandems put more severe weight loads on the brakes than did bikes with just one person on them .
Cantilever brakes provided the power and durability that it took to stop a 400 pound tandem team on a 45 pound tandem , barreling down a 7 mile descent at an 8 % grade at over 60 mph .
Read about our brand new Trillium Big Squeeze cantilever brakes here
There was another advantage to them though .
They would accommodate wide tires .
When the mountain bike was invented , cantilever brakes were used in order to accommodate the balloon width tires .
For years , all went well ( except for a short love affair with something called the U - brake in the late 1980's ) .
But then , in the mid-1990's , bike manufactures developed a new brake system for the mountain bike .
What they came up with was the V - brake .
V - Brakes :
V - brakes were specifically designed for off - road use on a mountain bike .
The needs of loaded touring bikes or tandems were not taken into account by mountain bike designers .
Thus , the resulting design was n't even compatible with a standard road bike brake lever .
Adapters , or special levers had to be used by manufacturers who put them onto road bikes or tandems .
None the less , the road bike and tandem industries embraced the new standard , using the following logic : ' if the V - brake is powerful enough to stop a mountain bike , of course it will be great on a tandem or a touring bike ' .
One question they forgot to ask themselves was " what does a 400 pound tandem team , or 250 pound loaded touring bike , barreling down a pavement highway at speeds of over 60 mph have in common with a 179 pound guy going 20 mph down a dirt road ? "
The answer is " very little , if anything . "
Well , after we had a summer full of really bad experiences with the new V - brakes ( including on my own tandem ) , we went back to the old fashioned cantilever .
This was n't easy , and we ended up having to import them ourselves .
This is the reason that most manufacturers do n't offer them , it 's hard to bring them into the country yourself , but we think it 's worth it to have our bikes perform better than other touring bikes and tandems .
Now , do n't get me wrong , if you want V - brakes , they use the same braze - on as cantilevers and we 'll put them on at no extra charge .
We 've had a few customers choose V - brakes over cantilevers ( they loved the brakes on their mountain bike ) , but they both had us change their bike to cantilevers before a year was up .
Note : Because of the similar look , many people confuse V - brakes for Cantilever brakes .
It is a mistake to associate a bad experience with V - brakes with cantilever brakes .
They are a completely different design .
The disadvantages when using V - brakes on touring bikes and tandems are many , the first of which is probably the most annoying .
Pad wear :
On a mountain bike , you do n't put on lots of miles .
I mean , you do n't ride 50 miles + in a day very often .
On a touring bike or a tandem , these distances are common .
In an off - road situation the weight of the rider and his bike might be 175 pounds or so , whereas a loaded touring bike and its rider will be more like 250 pounds ( and well over 400 pounds on a loaded tandem ) .
In an off - road situation a high speed might be 25 miles per hour , and the terrain is loose dirt or mud .
If you pull the brakes , the tire skids , and your brake pad is n't getting worn much , versus 40 to 60 mph on a pavement surface ... no skidding and much faster pad wear .
A V - brake pad is very thin .
As a matter of fact , they only have 2 mm or so of brake pad to wear off before the pad is worn out .
Then you 're running metal on metal .
In contrast , even the thinnest of cantilever brake pads have 5 mm of wear ( some almost twice that much ) .
I was only getting 250 to 300 miles on my V - brake pads when I had them on my tandem , but I can get thousands of miles on a set of cantilever pads .
Convenience :
The mountain bike V - brake requires an adapter to make it compatible with a road bike brake lever .
In our service shop we see hundreds of bikes per year with centering problems when people have to use these adapters .
On my own tandem , I had to center the brakes a couple times a day when I was using them a lot .
The V - brake has long arms that extend higher than the rack bosses on most bikes .
This makes it very difficult to install a rear rack ( something that every touring bike should have ) .
The Road V - brake :
Some manufacturers have come up with what they call the ' road ' V - brake .
This is a V - brake with shorter arms , and addresses the ' adapter ' and the ' rack mounting ' problem .
Unfortunately , it creates another problem .
The arms are so short , that you can't put fenders on most of the bikes that use them .
The pads still wear out just as fast , and the other problems of V - brakes still exist ( read on ) .
Annoyance :
Nothing is more annoying than brakes that squeal louder than a jet engine .
Since V - brakes were n't designed to be used at the speeds and weight loads of tandems and loaded touring bikes , they tend to squeal ( really loud ) when being used in this fashion .
They do n't always have this problem , but more so than cantilevers .
When a bike has this problem , it is very hard to correct .
Positives :
Most road and tandem bikes with V - brakes can be easily re-fitted with cantilevers .
As a matter of fact , we do several a year right here in the repair shop for customers who have reached the end of the rope with their state - of - the - art V - brakes .
Disc brakes :
Here 's a picture of what happens to a regular Touring fork when disc brakes are installed without beefing up the blades first .
This was brought in by a customer who had these disc tabs installed by another builder .
This can obviously result in catastrophic failure .
It is also very important to build the frame and wheels heavier as well .
Disc brakes have come a long way in the last 10 years .
They have really evolved into a brake that will stop a tandem almost as well as a cantilever .
The cost of them has dropped substantially as well , and I far prefer them to a V - brake now .
A few years ago , I would 've rather had a V - brake , but now I think the disc is less troublesome .
Most tandem companies now use disc as they are superior to the V - brake , and because the conventional wisdom says " why fight what everyone is asking for ? "
If we simply manufactured our bikes and sent them to dealers , then the dealer would have to deal with any problems .
In our company though , we are the only dealer , so we are the ones who will be taking care of your new bike .
I want to make it clear that if you want disc brakes on your road or tandem bike , we 're happy to do that for you and we build several road bikes a year equipped that way .
But realize that just because you like them on your mountain bike , that does n't necessarily mean that you 'll like them on your road or tandem bike .
You 've all heard the ravings of how great they are , but I wanted to let you know that there are a few disadvantages that you should consider .
These are the things that most companies wo n't be bragging about .
Increased weight :
Frame / fork weight :
A disc brake stops the wheel at the hub .
This causes a lot more stress on the spokes , rim and frame at the points where the wheel attaches .
When a frame / fork is built for disc brakes , it 's built with heavier fork blades , chain stays and seat stays .
Sometimes an extra brace is installed between the chain and seat stays .
We 've found that the bikes that do n't have this extra weight have a tendency to fail at the brake braze - ons .
The bike winds up heavier , but only slightly .
Wheel weight :
For a bike using disc brakes , we build the wheel with a little heavier rim and more spokes .
At Rodriguez , we offer a 3 year warranty against broken spokes and rims , so we build wheels to hold up .
We 've found that if we build the wheel at the same weight as we build for cantilever bikes , the spokes break at a much faster rate , or the rim sill start to crack around the nipple area .
Component weight :
The disc and the caliper together weigh more than a set of cantilevers .
Increased weight is not usually something that we look for , unless there is a dramatic performance improvement .
A good rule of thumb is about 1.5 ~ 2 pounds of increased bike weight to build the same bike for disc brakes that you could get with cantilevers .
Noise :
As I said earlier in this article , a tandem or loaded touring bike puts a lot more stress on the brakes than a mountain bike .
Most of our road / tandem disc brake customers find that the discs heat up and then warp ( even just slightly ) .
Then the brakes make a rhythmic scraping noise as the wheels roll ( not just while braking ) .
When I 'm bouncing down a hill , off road , I do n't even hear that noise .
On the road though , it drones on relentlessly .... scrape...scrape...scrape...scrape...until finally I have to slow down just to have the noise in rhythm with the song that 's in my head .
Some people do n't mind noise , but again , unless there are dramatic performance enhancements , I see no reason to put up with noise .

Difficulty of portability :
Most tandems and touring bikes that we sell these days are designed for easy packing for travel with use of the S&S coupling system .
Disc brakes hinder easy packing as the rotors get in the way ( and I do n't mean sort of ) , and often have be removed or else they will get bent .
This adds time and frustration that 's not necessary .
Difficulty of mounting racks :
The calipers are constantly in the way for mounting a rear rack .
This is more of a nuisance than a problem I guess , but it still is trouble that 's completely avoidable .
The Good News
None of these disadvantages effect the mountain biker , and I highly recommend disc brakes on mountain bikes .
Wrap up
Cantilevers work better tandems and touring bikes because they were designed for use on road and tandem bikes .
V - brakes and disc brakes were designed for mountain bikes , and then adapted for use on road and tandem bikes .
Not convinced ?
Do n't worry about it , we 'll put on anything you want , as long as you understand ' there is a method to our madness . '

B.C.'s Solicitor General may soon become a stronger advocate for public transit after it was announced his driver 's licence was suspended because of speeding tickets .
John van Dongen , the Minister of Public Safety and BC Liberal candidate for Abbotsford South , said Friday the Office of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles ( OSMV ) sent him a letter confirming his driving privileges had been put on hold because of tickets received in the past year and a half .
" As soon as I received the letter , I acted immediately and accepted the temporary prohibition , " he wrote .
" I will not be appealing the decision and have mailed my driver 's license to the OSMV .
I fully understand and accept responsibility for my driving behaviour and believe it is my duty to fully and completely comply with the decision . "
Van Dongen told CTV
News he has a " long history " of speeding .
Although the minister said he did n't know how many tickets he had received -- or how fast he was going at the time -- he admitted it was excessive .
" I do n't know what the actual speed was .
I 'm taking a defensive driving course to improve my driving ability . "
Van Dongen says the voters will decide whether Friday 's news would hurt him or his party .
" I do n't know .
I 've worked hard for the people of B.C. I 'm not going to defend my driving record . "
Van Dongen , who oversees the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia ( ICBC ) , has asked Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell to re-assign the responsibility for the corporation to another minister .
" While I am not currently involved in any active decisions as Minister with respect to these agencies , I feel it is important that both my actions and this latest decision do not have any detrimental impact on public confidence in either ICBC or OSMV , " he wrote .
Less than an hour after the news van Dongen lost his license , the BC Liberals reassigned responsibility for ICBC and the Office of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles .
The two areas will now be overseen by the Ministry of Labour and Citizens ' Services from the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor - General .
Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell said the suspension was probably embarrassing for van Dongen , and said he was surprised about the news .
" I do n't know about everyone 's driving record .
If we said to people ' if you have any driving infractions you 're not eligible to run for office , ' we'd have a pretty small legislature , " Campbell told media .
He commended van Dongen for being up front and protecting the integrity of his ministry .
" It 's not like he has n't paid his tickets .
He 's done that , " Campbell said .
Drivers get a warning letter if they rack up nine to 14 driving demerit points , said Mark Jan Vrem , manager of media relations for the Insurance Bureau of British Columbia .
After that , it 's an escalating series of driving bans .
" Fifteen to 19 points will trigger a prohibition that runs from three to 12 months , 20 to 24 points the prohibition is from four to 18 months and 25 to 49 points is five to 24 months , " he said .
" Also , if you get two convictions for excessive speeding ( 40 kilometres over the limit ) , that 'll also trigger a driving prohibition that can range from three to 18 months . "
Vrem said speeding drivers also must pay more to renew their licences and have a driver 's risk premium added to their auto insurance .
Van Dongen is seeking his fifth election victory in the May 12 vote .

Police 's latest brainwave : Report people who wear too much ' bling ' to Crimestoppers
Police are encouraging the public to report people wearing too much ' bling ' during the recession
Watching a tight T - shirt - wearing , cocksure man wearing a gaudy gold chain round his neck strutting down the street is often worth a phone - call to the fashion police .
But one force is taking the idea a step further and encouraging people to shop Mr T - wannabes to Crimestoppers in a novel - some might say barmy - plan to bring down the crime rate .
In the latest example of innovative policing in Britain , the Gloucestershire force is encouraging members of the public to report people wearing too much ' bling ' during the recession .
They are also urging people to shop anyone who drives flash cars or buys expensive items without the apparent means to afford them during the credit crunch .
The campaign , run with Crimestoppers , was launched by the force today under the title ' Too Much Bling ?
Give Us a Ring ' with the aim of cracking down on those who live a lavish lifestyle on the profits of crime
Gloucestershire 's Chief constable Dr Timothy Brain said : ' In the current time of financial uncertainty , those who live a lavish lifestyle with no discernable , legitimate income become even more apparent .
Do n't even think about getting your fashion inspiration from this man - Mr T as B.A. Baracus from the popular Eighties show The A - Team
' By flaunting their ill - gotten gains criminals signal contempt for everyone who works hard , and act as very poor role models for the younger members of society .
' There are certain members of the criminal fraternity for whom a prison sentence or some other form of court punishment is not a sufficient deterrent .
' Many criminals , including drug dealers and burglars , prize the trappings they have gained far more than their own liberty , and , having no need to get a legitimate job , are unconcerned by the impact a criminal record will have on their career prospects . '
Gloucestershire 's Chief Crown Prosecutor Adrian Foster , Chief Constable Timothy Brain and Crimestoppers Board Member John Cripps holding the new ' bling ' posters
But Tory MP and former Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe expressed disbelief at the move .
She said : ' Is this a joke ?
If the police spent half as much time tackling crime and getting out on the beat as they do coming out with this ridiculous stuff , we 'd all be better off .
' How are you meant to judge if someone buying a piece of jewellery can afford it ?
I expect even Posh Spice , like most people , can look a bit down and out some days . '
Under the Proceeds of Crime Act , last year Gloucestershire Constabulary , the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts confiscated nearly £ 1.8 million from convicted criminals and removed £ 1.4 million in ill - gotten gains .
Adrian Foster , from Gloucestershire Crown Prosecution Service , said : ' We have had incredible success over the last year in taking the profit out of crime and this campaign marks a call for all members of the public to assist in ensuring that crime really does not pay in Gloucestershire . '

Plus , ~ 20 m live in the NYC and surrounding communities .
That 's 1/15 of the coutry 's population .
Odds are very favorable that more then one or two people posting here are in the metro area and would want to have those speeds .
It 's no different then people in smaller cities wondering when they will be getting such access , just that there are more people in NYC so their inquiries would naturally be more numerous .
NYC by far has the highest population density of any US city .
If an ISP is looking for the most bang for the buck , deploying there is going to access the most number of subscribers with the least amount of physical plant costs .
One of the biggest expenses of deploying new technology such as fiber is the labor and material costs to get the fiber to the home .
If you can hit more homes in a smaller area , it means lower deployment costs .

If you upgrade a core router , your not going to fill it with 100 mbit line cards for connections to your Tier 1s .
Your going to fill it with 10 gbit cards .
It matters where its shared .
Upgrading a peering link is many times cheaper than upgrading the last mile , and therefore its much more likely to be done .
Also backbone links in general are installed to be almost the fastest available .
Nobody would install a 100 mbit peering link today , everyone uses 10 gigabit , but they charge on 95th percentile , which means you subscribe to a 100 or 1000 mbit speed tier , but you can definitely burst to 10gbit .

The network oversubscription is incremental from the last mile , to the metro , to the core , to the peering edge , etc , etc .
Each have a cost and FTTH or " dedicated " is basically marketing FUD .
The network is really shared from your PC ( or even eariler ) .
The difference with DSL or FTTH and HFC is not if it is dedicated , it is how long your " dedicated " cable is .
The Internet is shared , pure and simple .
Anyone that believes in " dedicated " has no idea how the Internet works .
What you stated above is common belief , but not really accurate .
The upgrade cost of " the last mile " is similar whether it is HFC , DSLAM or ONT .
The concentrators have to be upgraded and node - splits are not that expensive .
The costs of metro and backbone are just as expensive as it is not just the " peering interface " The network oversubscription is incremental from the last mile , to the metro , to the core , to the peering edge , etc , etc .

And you somehow expect to get 100 mbit unlimited in a residential or consumer setting for less the 1/4 the wholesale cost ?
Any residential customer who buys a 100 mbit unlimited line , surely knows how to extract every cent of their purchase ( multiple RAID 5 systems doing P2P ) .
There is n't much contention you can rely on .
$ 100 - $ 200 per month is fine for a residential 100/100 link .
The usually the fastest backbone links you can buy are 10 gigabits anyway .
If you go with an old school ILEC backbone , they will give you a 40 gigabit if you have the $ .
And before you start talking about Japan , the bandwidth off the island is limited to 20 mbitps .
The 1 gigabit speeds you hear of are only to customers of that ISP , or only to other computers in Japan .
So its basically your on a LAN with everyone else on your ISP / your ASN , it does n't mean you get to the internet at 1 gigabit .
Try buying an unmetered 100 mbit link from a Tier 1 or 2 .
Cogent , which is the 99 cent store of Tier 1s , will charge you $ 4000 per month for a 1 gigabit link , thats $ 400 per month for 100 M bitps unmetered .

And before you start talking about Japan , the bandwidth off the island is limited to 20 mbitps .
The 1 gigabit speeds you hear of are only to customers of that ISP , or only to other computers in Japan .
So its basically your on a LAN with everyone else on your ISP / your ASN , it does n't mean you get to the internet at 1 gigabit .
Sounds like bredbandsbolaget .

does utopia have a cap ?
they should n't have any cause most other isp do not such as charter 60 mb / 5 mb , comcast 50/10mbps
147.00 is too much
I would go for 50 mbps at 75.00 instead if their are it would probably not cost much more like 69.99 not 147.00 but surewest charges 191.99 for 50 mbps insane prices ! does utopia have a cap ?

Plano , TX longstreet Member Well , mostly true Nothing wrong with this IMO .
The problem is that Comcast and Qwest have been legally * &^ ) blocking UTOPIA .
They just do n't have that much coverage in Utah .
It 's a few , select cities and that 's it .
You should see how much money Comcrap and Qworst have thrown into keeping UTOPIA subdued .

Gordon Brown and several members of his Cabinet were deeply embarrassed last night when the full details of their expense claims as MPs were revealed .
It emerged that the Prime Minister claimed £ 6,500 after paying his brother Andrew for a cleaner 's bill for his Westminster flat , while the Justice Secretary Jack Straw overclaimed for council tax and mortgage payments and the Communities Secretary Hazel Blears claimed for three different properties in one year .
Some 700,000 pages of expense claims by all MPs over five years were due to be published in July after the Commons lost a Freedom of Information battle .
But the details have been obtained by the Daily Telegraph newspaper , which plans to disclose them over several days .
The newspaper declined to say whether it paid for the information , following reports that a disc containing it had been offered for sale at £ 300,000 and that two other papers had turned it down .
Today 's first instalment , covering 13 Cabinet ministers , lays bare the MPs ' discredited £ 24,000 - a- year " second homes " allowance .
It suggests that rules were lax , mistakes were made by senior politicians and MPs were subject to little scrutiny by Commons officials who approved their claims .
It will raise questions over whether some of the errors would ever have come to light without the fight by freedom of information campaigners .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
According to the Daily Telegraph :
* Ms Blears spent almost £ 5,000 of taxpayers ' money on furniture in three months .
* The Business Secretary Lord Mandelson claimed thousands of pounds to improve his constituency home in Hartlepool after he had announced his resignation as an MP .
* Foreign Secretary David Miliband spending hundreds of pounds on gardening at his constituency home
* Chancellor Alistair Darling changed his official " second home " designation four times in four years
* Transport Secretary Geoff
Hoon switched his second home in a way which allowed him to improve his family home in Derbyshire at taxpayers ' expense before buying a London townhouse .
* Culture Secretary Andy Burnham , Europe Minister Caroline Flint and Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy bought flats – or the freehold on properties they already owned – and claimed back stamp duty and other moving costs .
Mr Murphy is said to have claimed for a new boiler because his water was too hot .
Last night the ministers insisted they had not broken the rules .
Although the premature publication of the expense claims is bound to embroil MPs from all parties in controversy , it comes at a bad time for Mr Brown .
His authority has been weakened by a Labour plan to smear senior Tories , a Commons defeat over residence rights for Gurkha veterans and his rushed attempt to reform the expenses system .
While most of his proposed changes were approved last week , his plan to replace the " second homes " allowance with a daily payment for turning up in parliament was scuppered by an all - party revolt .
Receipts submitted by the Prime Minister between 2004 and 2006 disclosed that he paid his brother Andrew , a senior executive at EDF Energy , £ 6,577 for cleaning services .

A spokesman for Mr Brown said he and his brother had shared a cleaner at their two flats .
Andrew Brown paid the cleaner and the Prime Minister reimbursed his share of the cost .
" Her contract made clear the allocation of hours of work and payment , " said the spokesman .
" Inland Revenue and National Insurance receipts show the payments made , but it was easier for her in terms of National Insurance arrangements to be paid by one person .
There is no question of Andrew Brown doing the cleaning or receiving any financial benefit . "
The spokesman confirmed that Mr Brown received a £ 153 payment for a plumbing bill twice in two successive quarters in 2006 after a mistake in one of his claims , but had repaid £ 150 .
" That was an inadvertent error and as soon as it was brought to Gordon 's attention , he contacted the parliamentary Fees Office and repaid the money , " he said .
The Telegraph said it told Downing Street about the mistake .
Mr Straw reportedly claimed the full cost of council tax even though he received a 50 per cent discount from his local authority .
He repaid the money last summer , shortly after a High Court ruling requiring the receipts to be published .
Mr Straw also repaid money he was overpaid for his mortgage .
His spokesman insisted all his claims had been in accordance with the rules .
" An error arose because the amount of interest declined rapidly towards the end of the mortgage .
This error was identified by the Commons authorities on information provided by Mr Straw and then repaid , " he said .
" It was also Mr Straw himself who spotted errors in the claims for council tax and alerted the authorities .
He repaid the difference . "
A controversy erupted over how the information leaked out .
Sir Stuart Bell , a member of the House of Commons Commission , said : " If this was received by unauthorised means , it is disgraceful that a national newspaper should stoop so low as to buy information which will be in the public domain in July .
It undermines the very basis of our democracy . "
Benedict Brogan , assistant editor of the Daily Telegraph , said : " What matters is that we 've established that this information is reliable and it is certainly in the public interest that we publish it . "
The Commons Leader Harriet Harman insisted that no minister would have to resign : " The old system was the system that those claims were made under .
We 've recognised that though they might have been claims made in good faith , that 's not acceptable for the future and we are changing the system . "
The bill : Cabinet claims
* Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed £ 6,577 in bills for a cleaner , which he shared with his brother .
Also claimed for a £ 150 plumbing bill twice , that was subsequently paid back .
* Jack Straw claimed the full cost of council tax back , despite receiving a 50 % discount from his local authority .
He repaid the money last summer , shortly after a High Court ruling requiring the receipts to be published .
Mr Straw also repaid money he was overpaid for his mortgage .
* Business Secretary Lord Mandelson 's claimed for thousands of pounds to improve his constituency home in Hartlepool after announcing his resignation as an MP .
* Communities Secretary Hazel Blears claimed for three different properties in a single year , spending nearly £ 5,000 of taxpayers ' money on furniture in three months .
* Foreign Secretary David Miliband spent hundreds of pounds on gardening at his constituency home .
* Chancellor Alistair Darling changed his official " second home " designation four times in four years .
* Transport Secretary Geoff

* Culture Secretary Andy Burnham , Europe minister Caroline Flint and Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy bought flats – or freehold on properties they already owned – and claiming back stamp duty and other moving costs .
Utilities Study 700 MW
Wind Farm Off Long Island Coast
March 26th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
The U.S. may lag behind Europe when it comes to generating power from offshore wind farms , but a proposed wind farm off the Long Island Coast would be a big step forward in catching up .
Consolidated Edison and the Long Island Power Authority say they want to build a 700 megawatt in the Atlantic Ocean , about 13 miles off the Rockaway Pennisula .
The project would be built in two stages of 350 MW each .
A draft assessment of the project released by Con Ed and LIPA this week said it would cost about $ 415 million to expand electricity transmission capabilities to handle the first 350 MW phase when built .
The report said a 350 MW farm operating at 30 percent capacity could power 250,000 homes a year .
It would displace 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually , the equivalent of taking 68,000 cars off the road .
Gov. David Patterson , who has proposed that New York generate 45 percent of its electricity from efficiency improvements and renewable means by 2015 , issued a statement commending Con Ed and LIPA for their work .
But , it will be a while before anything gets built .
LIPA and Con Ed ’s next move will be to study the environmental impact and economic feasibility of the farm and to seek interest from developers who would want to build the facility .
As Bloomberg News pointed out this week , it ’s not the first time officials have considered offshore wind for Long Island .
The authority killed an $ 811 million , 140 - megawatt offshore project in 2007 because cost estimates skyrocketed .
And offshore wind power in the U.S. is , to be charitable , just getting off the ground .
New Jersey has accepted a 350 MW offshore project .
The much publicized and debated Cape Wind project off Nantucket may finally be headed for construction as well .
Developers are turning their eyes toward the Great Lakes as a source of offshore wind power .
Projects in Denmark , Portugal and grand plans elsewhere put Europe well ahead here .
But it looks like finally , offshore projects are gaining a foothold in the U.S. wind industry .
The project also represents another step forward for Con Ed , which recently announced plans for a solar pilot program in New York City .

■ Bluetoothフィッシングに注意 特にシャープ製ソフトバンクモバイル端末
シャープ製ソフトバンクモバイル端末でテスト
携帯電話で図1の画面が現れたとき、どうするだろうか？
「 無料ゲー ム パスキ ー は5555 」 と出ている 。
これは、他の機器か らBluetoothでこの携帯電話に接続しようと試みたときの画面なのだが、接続元のデバイス名（コンピュータ名）を「無料ゲーム
パスキーは5555」と設定しているため、このように表示されている。
ここでわけもわからず「はい」を押した場合にどうなるか。図2の画面が現れる。
「接続先」と書かれているが何のことかわからないまま、「パスキー？」「5555とか言ってたな」などと、思わず「5555」と入力してボタンを押してしまうと、次のようになる。
この時点で 、接続元の機器（ここで はMacintosh）の画面は図4のようになっており、携帯電話内のファイルを自由に閲覧したりコピーできる状態になっている。
ここでたとえ ば 「 Pictures」のフォルダを開くと、下の図のようになり、携帯電話に保存されている写真を一覧したりコピーできてしまう。
さすがに、この画面で何かおかしいと気付いて、「キャンセル」ボタンを押して止めることになるだろうとは思うが、このような危険性が存在しているので、注意が必要だ。
このような画面が出たら 「 いいえ 」 「キャンセル」を押すこと。また、そもそもこのような接続をされないためにも、Bluetoothの「デバイスの公開」をオフに設定したほうがよい（3月1日の日記参照）。
以上は、シャープ社製ソフトバンクモバイル携帯電話の「816SH」での場合である。
では、同様のことを、コンピュータに対して（ここではMac OS X 10.5の場合）試みた場合にはどうなるだろうか。接続が試みられた時点で図6の画面が現れる。
これに騙されて引っかかる人はいるだろうか。「登録要求元」という太字の部分で違和感を感じることができれば、「拒否」を選ぶだろう。
仮にこれにひっかかってペアリングしてしまったとしても、普通は、ファイルを閲覧されてしまうことはない。なぜなら、Mac OS X 10.5 では、「 Bluetooth共有」機能がデフォルトではオフになっているからだ。
しかも、環境設定の 「共有 」 で「 Bluetooth共有」をオンに設定したとしても、図7のように、デフォルト設定では、閲覧されるのは「パブリック」フォルダだけとなっている。
Windows Vistaでも同様に注意深く設計されており、デフォルト設定でファイルを閲覧されることはないようだ。
これらに比べる と「 816SH」の設計はあまりにも不用心だ。初期設定のまま、ただBluetoothをオンにしただけで、この危険にさらされる。
図1や図2の画面をよくみると、「 Bluetooth 」 「ペアリング」というタイトルが出ているので、「そこで気付け」という言い分があるかもしれない。たしかに、一度でもBluetoothで機器登録設定をやったことのある人なら、これらが何を意味するのか察知できるかもしれない。
だがどうだろう？ 昨日の日記に書いたように、シャープ製他のソフトバンクモバイル端末を使っている人の多くが、Bluetoothを使っていないのに、Bluetoothが何かさえわからないまま、Bluetoothをオンにしてしまっている。ペアリングの経験もない人々だろう。そういう人々にこれを察知せよというのはあまりに酷ではないか。
コンピュータの画面に比べて携帯電話の画面は狭いので、詳しく説明を表示することができず、図1や図2のような説明不足な画面にならざるを得ないというのは理解できるが、それならば、何らかの工夫でこういう危険をなくす設計をするべきだろう。
実地検証
実際にこれによる被害が出るものなのかを確かめるために、このような接続（接続元のコンピュータ名を「無料ゲーム
パスキーは5555」とした）を、山手線列車内で何度か試してみた。
試すにあたっては、こちら側にパスキー入力画面が出た時点で中止する（こちら側でパスキー入力はしない）ものとし、ペアリング成功までは試さないようにした（重要）。
何日かにわたって、いくつもの相手に対し、何度か接続を試みたが、こちら側にパスキー入力画面が出るところまで至ったケースは、一度もなかった。
その原因として次のことが考えられる。(1)先方がその携帯電話で何らの操作をしているとき（メールを読み書きしているときや、Webを閲覧しているとき）には、先方に図1の画面が出ず、こちら側はエラーとなる。(2)先方が携帯電話を操作してないときは、この画面が出ても気付かず、時間切れで中止となる。
つまり、たまたま、待ち受け画面をぼんやりと見ていたときに図1の画面が出たときだけ、危険が生ずる。そう簡単には被害が出そうにないことを確認した。
しかし、この危険性の存在は知っておくべきであるし、端末の開発者らは、このような危険が生じないように工夫するべきであるので、ここに書いておく。
違法性に関する検 討
ところで、このような罠のペアリングによって他人の携帯電話のファイルを閲覧する行為は、日本の法律で処罰の対象とすることはできるのだろうか。
この行為に関係し得るのは、不正アクセス禁止法しかない。疑問を挟む余地は以下の点にある。
Bluetooth端末同士で直接通信して接続しようとする行為が、はたして「電気通信回線を通じて行うもの」と言えるか。
Bluetoothのペアリングのために入力したパスキーが、はたして2条2項の「識別符号」に該当すると言えるか。
この手法による接続が、3条2項2号の「利用の制限を免れることができる情報又は指令を入力して当該特定電子計算機を作動させ」たに該当するか。
不正アクセス禁止法はどんな場合にも適用されるわけではない。まず、電気通信回線を通じて行うものに限られている。電気通信回線とは、解説書
によると、「物理的な電気通信回線設備（送信の場所と受信の場所との間を接続する伝送路設備及びこれを一体として設置される交換設備並びにこれらの付属設備をいう。電気通信事業法第六条第二項参照）の存在を前提に、論理的に設けられているものである。有線、無線を問わない。電気通信事業法第六条第四項、第二一条第三項等にも用例があるが、これらと同一の概念である。」（p.28）とある。また、「ネットワークがインターネットに接続しているなどオープンなものであるか閉じたLANやWANを形成しているなどクローズドなものであるかを問わない。」（p.74）とある。LANでも該当し、無線でも該当するというのだが、一対一の直接の無線通信が「ネットワーク」なのか？「回線」なのか？という疑問はある。これが該当するなら、アナログのトランシーバーでのやりとりでも該当しそうだが、そういう法律なのだろうか？ よくわからない。
次に、攻撃者側で決めたパスキーを被害者側に入力させたときに、そのパスキーが「識別符号」なのかという点。「識別符号」とは、「当該アクセス管理者によってその内容をみだりに第三者に知らせてはならないものとされている符号」と定義されている（2条2項1号）。この場合、被害者側の本人がアクセス管理者である（携帯電話の通信キャリアは無関係）として、表示された通りの番号「5555」をその場で設定したものが、「みだりに第三者に知らせてはならないものとされている符号」と言えるのだろうか？
よくわからない。また、解説書には、「留守番電話に記録されたメッセージを暗号番号を入力して自宅外からこれを聞くような場合の留守番電話」等について、「他人の利用を予定しておらず、そのために利用権者等の識別のための識別符号を付与することもしていないから」という理由で、「アクセス制御機能を有していることにはならない」との記述がある
。 Bluetoothの利用制限も自分での利用しか予定していないもので、ユーザIDによる識別は存在しない（また、解説書p.41冒頭の例にも該当しない
）のであるから、その例と同様に、この法の対象外であるようにも思える。が、よくわからない。
いずれにせよ、他人の携帯電話の中身を無断で覗き見ることは、少なくとも不適切な行為であるから、してはいけない。

One of my favorite things about living in New England is all the maple syrup we produce here .
Sugaring season runs from late winter to early spring .
And one of my favorite things to do with local maple syrup is to turn it into fudge .
This fudge is a smooth , creamy cousin to pure maple sugar candy .
Made with maple syrup infused with heavy cream , it ’s a fabulous way to enjoy maple syrup .
Here at The Mouse House , we love dark amber syrup , but use any kind you like .
If you like penuche , a fudge -y treat made with brown sugar and cream , chances are that you ’ll love this .
Tips for making candy
In general , clear , cool days are best for making candy .
Humidity and heat can mess with your sugar -y mojo and keep your candy from setting up properly .
If you know me , you know that I ’m usually fairly anti-thermometer , but for some things , they can make your life a lot easier .
Candymaking is one of them .
Get yourself a good candy or deep - frying thermometer .
They ’re inexpensive and take the guesswork out of boiling sugar .
Maple Cream Fudge
2 cups maple syrup
1 Tbls. light corn syrup
3/4 cups heavy cream
butter , for pan
optional : 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
Makes about 1 lb. of fudge .
Maple Cream Fudge : Combine the syrups and cream
Clip your candy thermometer on the inside of 3 - quart , heavy - bottomed pot .
Be sure that it ’s not touching the bottom of the pot .
( If it touches the bottom of the pot , it can give you a false reading . )
Add the maple syrup and corn syrup .
Pour in the cream .
Whisk well to combine .
Your mixture should be a uniform , caramel color , like this :
Set the pot on the stove over medium heat .
Whisk it constantly until it comes to a boil .
Maple Cream Fudge : Boil the mixture until it hits soft - ball stage
When it starts to boil , stop whisking .
You wo n’t stir it again until the mixture has cooked completely and then cooled .
That ’s just fine .
When it first starts to boil , it will bubble up dramatically , then subside .
Boil like this , without stirring , until the mixture reaches soft - ball stage on your thermometer .
( This is called “ soft - ball stage ” because , at this temperature , a small amount of syrup will form a ball when dropped into cold water �but will flatten when picked up . )
Mine looked about like this at this point :
Maple Cream Fudge : Cool to lukewarm without stirring
When the mixture reaches soft - ball stage , take it off the heat .
Set it aside to cool in the pot .
Cool it to lukewarm ( about 120 degrees or so ) without stirring .
This took me roughly 40 minutes .
While you ’re waiting for the mixture to cool , butter a standard one - pound loaf pan .
Set it aside .
As the mixture cools , it may get a slight skin .
That ’s just fine .
Maple Cream Fudge : Beat the mixture when cool
When the mixture cools to about 120 degrees , transfer it to the bowl of your stand mixer ( or a large mixing bowl , if you ’re using a hand - held mixer . )
Beat for 7 - 10 minutes on medium speed .
As you beat it , it will lose its gloss , thicken , and become opaque .
After about 10 minutes , my fudge looked like this :
It should be considerably stiffer and more solid .
If you ’re adding them , toss in the vanilla and nuts .
Beat to incorporate .
With a wooden spoon , scrape the fudge out of the bowl .
It will be stuck to the sides of the bowl .
That ’s just fine .
Transfer the fudge to your buttered loaf pan .
It should be moist but not overly sticky .
Using the back of a wooden spoon ( or your hands ) , press the fudge flat .
You want it to look about like this :
Cool it completely before cutting .
This will help it firm up a little more .
Maple Cream Fudge : Cool completely and enjoy !
When your fudge is completely cool , cut into squares .
Store your fudge well wrapped in a cool place .
Enjoy !
Iowa reports 18 COVID - 19 deaths , 1,048 confirmed coronavirus cases
Iowa reported its first three COVID - 19 cases on March 8 .
The state 's first death was reported March 24 .
President Obama plans to convene his Cabinet for the first time today , and he will order its members to identify a combined $ 100 million in budget cuts over the next 90 days , according to a senior administration official .... Earlier this month , both chambers of Congress passed Obama 's $ 3.5 trillion budget outline for 2010 , which includes unprecedented new investments in health care , education and energy .
But the huge budget , which contemplates a $ 1.2 trillion deficit , has drawn the ire of small - government conservatives , who say that such high deficits jeopardize the nation 's economic future .
Once upon a time , it was easy enough to find your favorite clips and shows on YouTube .
After all , the site owed its early fame in part to Lazy Sunday from Saturday Night Live .
When media companies wised up , many folks moved to France 's DailyMotion .
Copyright enforcers duly followed ; but on the Internet , that rabbit hole is proving to be bottomless .
Of course , it continues to be easy enough to download television and movies through torrents indexed at places like Mininova .
But the multistep process of finding a torrent and downloading its data is discouraging for most casual consumers .
They want streaming on demand -- and many of them are n't content to wait 24 hours or more after a broadcast , as they might on network Web sites , Hulu , Amazon , or iTunes .
Enter a new generation of sites that offer better quality and timelier programming than YouTube ever did .
Be warned , however , that when you wander the back alleys of online content distribution , you might get mugged by malware , logged by authorities , or disappointed by a junk heap of broken links and salacious come - ons -- sort of like shopping for pirated DVDs on LA 's Santee Alley or Manhattan 's Canal Street .
Sidereel
Sidereel does n't offer any streamed television show episodes itself , but it does offer a very convenient way to find them online .
Look up a show , and you 'll find recaps , commentary , and listings of where to find episodes online .
The site plays nice by highlighting official sources , such as downloads from the iTunes Store and copies on Hulu .
But click ' See more results ' , and you 'll probably end up at one of the following locations .
Youku
Our first stop is in China , where YouTube imitator Youku hosts all sorts of American entertainment for free .
The quality is n't great , the streaming is prone to hanging , and the video is marked up with all sorts of watermarks and Chinese subtitles , but as an option of last resort for catching House M.D. before your coworker spoils the budding romance between House and Cutty for you , Youku is usually a pretty reliable resource .
MegaVideo
Part of a cluster of sites that includes free porn destination Megarotic and paid online storage service MegaUpload , MegaVideo is a treasure trove of shows available as instant - access , easy - to - use Flash video streams .
Do n't bother visiting the homepage or trying to search the site for clandestine content ; you 'll find only an innocuous collection of home movies and other safe - as - milk options .
Instead , you have to search Sidereel or Yidio to find sequestered pages of intentionally hard - to - find copies of episodes .
Alternatively , you can try submitting an instruction to Google along the lines of " show title + megavideo " to find pages with links to shows that might be embedded in the site .
After you 've watched 72 minutes of video , the service will lock you out for an hour -- unless you register or sign up for a premium account .
But of course , there are hacks .
SupernovaTube
Another site that offers higher - quality Flash video streams is SupernovaTube .
Again , the search feature on the site itself is essentially disabled .
In addition , the site requires you to click a simple ' I am human ' button before accessing a video ; this is used to filter out bots ( and honest barnyard animals ) looking to rip large swaths of content or to issue automated takedown requests .
So look for clips linked on Sidereel and on other list pages that turn up in a regular Web search .
NinjaVideo.net
A clearinghouse for popular content , NinjaVideo.net plays back video in high - quality DivX format .
In addition , NinjaVideo serves as an index for finding MegaVideo versions of shows .
One frustrating feature of this site is that you have to open a Java applet called the NinjaVideo Helper and extend broad permissions to it before you can play back the DivX video .
The site 's administrators have publicly assured folks that there 's no malware to worry about .
Full - page ads do pop up , though , which can necessitate multiple clicks to get the actual video started .
Contributing members post NinjaVideo rips , and the newer videos usually work fine .
The older videos , however , often fail to start .
Also noteworthy : NinjaVideo has no search function to search for older content in the first place .
The site has more of a community focus than most of the others mentioned here , with message boards , a podcast , and a focus that extends beyond episodes of Lost ( which generally pushes the site 's servers to the limit on Wednesday nights ) to documentaries and other long - form news programming .
SwarmPlayer and EZTV
An effort from television - show torrent site EZTV may represent the next generation in sites combining streaming ease with download quality .
Using the experimental SwarmPlayer , Windows and Linux users can stream the torrent files that they would normally have to wait to download .
It 's all very experimental , so your mileage may vary .
But this technology is not just for pirates :
The BBC is part of a consortium that is sponsoring the developers in an effort to find more - efficient methods of online video distribution .
The software , and other , similar efforts promise to deliver ( eventually ) all of the benefits of peer - to - peer distribution without the disadvantage of making you wait for Ugly Betty to finish downloading before you can view it .
Sites such as Hulu , Amazon Video on Demand , and the Apple iTunes Store have simplified the task of finding and watching your favorite shows , increasing their appeal in the ongoing competition with unlicensed sources .
But many of those legitimate sites are n't available outside the United States or may not work with your hardware or software , owing to a tangled web of partnerships , scheduling issues , and geographical restrictions .
And when you 're desperate to watch Lost before someone spoils the episode for you the next day , it 's nice to know that you have viewing options -- legal ambiguity be damned .

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed William Gallas will miss the rest of the season with a medial knee ligament injury .
Injuries mount up for Gunners
Big blow
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed William Gallas will miss the rest of the season with a medial knee ligament injury .
Gallas was forced off with the problem in the first half of Arsenal 's 1 - 1 draw with Villarreal in their UEFA Champions League quarter - final on Tuesday .
The Frenchman picked up the knock after colliding with Villarreal striker Giuseppe Rossi .
Wenger feared after the match that Gallas had sustained a serious injury and his worst worries have been confirmed , with the centre - back facing several weeks on the sidelines .
Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia also faces a spell out of action after suffering an ankle injury in midweek .
The Spaniard was forced off after he was also , coincidentally , caught by Rossi in the first half .
It means Polish keeper Lukasz Fabianski will have an extended run in the side , starting with this weekend 's clash with Wigan .
Full - back Gael Clichy has also been ruled out of the trip to Wigan and the second leg against Villarreal after picking up a back problem in Spain .
" We have not the best news for Gallas because he looks to have a medial knee ligament that takes him out , " said Wenger .
" He is quick to recover , but we think he will be short to come back before the end of the season .
" It 's a big , big blow but that 's where the squad comes in .
" I believe as well we have lost Manuel Almunia for three weeks and we lost Clichy for two weeks with a back problem .
" We lost three players on Tuesday night so we have to once again rely on the depth in the squad - that is quite strong but as well we have to rely on our mental strength because until now we have dealt well with all our injury problems . "
Wenger also revealed Robin van Persie and Eduardo , who both missed Tuesday 's match , are struggling to be fit for Saturday and will undergo fitness tests before the game .
" Robin van Persie and Eduardo will have tests on Friday morning .
They could be available , " added Wenger .
Wenger admitted injury - plagued star Tomas Rosicky had suffered a setback in his bid to return to action .
Rosicky has not played since last January and Wenger concedes the midfielder is no closer to making his long awaited comeback .
Wenger said : " Tomas Rosicky , at the moment , is not close to coming back .
We have to be very patient there as well .
But of course we have ( Andrey ) Arshavin available for Saturday again . "

Computational complexity is the study of what resources , such as time and memory , are needed to carry out given computational tasks , with a particular focus on lower bounds for the amount needed of these resources .
Proving any result of this kind is notoriously difficult , and includes the famous problem of whether P = N P .
This course will be focused on two major results in the area .
The first is a lower bound , due to Razborov , for the number of steps needed to determine whether a graph contains a large clique , if only “ monotone ” computations are allowed .
This is perhaps the strongest result in the direction of showing that P and N P are distinct ( though there is unfortunately a very precise sense in which the proof cannot be developed to a proof of the whole conjecture ) .
The second is Peter Shor ’s remarkable result that a quantum computer can factorize large integers in
polynomial time .
In order to present these two results , it will be necessary to spend some time discussing some of the basic concepts of computational complexity , such as the relationship between Turing machines and the more obviously mathematical notion of circuit complexity , and an introduction to what a quantum computation actually is .
For the latter , no knowledge of quantum mechanics will be expected , and scarcely any will be imparted during the course : it is possible to understand quantum computation in a very “ pure mathematics ” way .
The reason this is a graduate course rather than a Part III course is that I intend to give several lectures in an informal style that would be hard to examine .
It is not because the material will be more advanced : indeed , my aim will be to make allowances for the fact that people will not be working on it with an exam in mind , and to make the course as easy to follow as I can .
Having said that , the main results will be proved in full : the informal discussion will be with a view to making these proofs more comprehensible .
The collection will have 12 graduate level lectures which are currently being given during the Easter term 2009 .
Many thanks to Adrian Callum - Hinshaw for his help with these video lectures .
A 66 - year - old pregnant British woman has defended her right to have a baby at her age .

" I do n't have to defend what I have done .
It 's between me and my baby and no one else , " she told the newspaper .

Trading on the Sensex had been suspended once already
Indian stocks have surged after the Congress party won a surprisingly decisive victory in national elections .
The benchmark Sensex index jumped 17 % , or 1,306 points , to 14,272 , forcing the Bombay Stock Exchange to shut down for the day .
Trading had already been halted earlier , after investors pushed stocks above their daily maximum limit .
The Congress victory gives the party a strong mandate to continue reforms that have spurred Indian economic growth .
' Big bang '
The broader Nifty index , traded on the National Stock Exchange , also rose 17 % , over 500 points , to 4,308 .
Trading was also halted earlier and the stock exchange was closed down .
Meanwhile , the Indian rupee jumped over 2 % to 48.32 a dollar , its biggest gain since 1998 .
" This was the big bang event that investors were looking for , " said Hitesh Agrawal , head of research with Angel Broking .
" We expect the government to have greater flexibility to boost economic reform and growth from here on . "
The Congress - led alliance is projected to win 260 seats , with rivals the BJP on 157 .
This confounded projections of a close election .
The communist parties , who had blocked reforms in insurance , pension funds and the selling off of state - owned companies , lost more than half their parliamentary seats .
Shares in some of India 's largest companies also climbed .
Reliance gained 37 % and ICICI Bank jumped 25.3 % , while carmaker Tata gained 40 % and IT firm Infosys rose 9.8 % .
The Sensex had climbed 26 % already this year before the Congress Party victory was declared over the weekend .
In October , NASA discovered the universe was sliding inexplicably toward , well , something massive .
They called the phenomenon " dark flow , " and it 's but one example of the creepy , unexplained awesomeness that awaits humanity in space .

Dark Flow .
Or , The Universe 's Great Cosmic Tease
Like some kind of massive cosmic toilet bowl , the multitude of galaxies that populate the known Universe are swirling inexplicably toward a tiny 20 - degree plane of deep space .
At least , that 's what astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky discovered in an incredibly controversial paper published in October 2008 .
Put simply for we laypeople , the paper suggests that way out in the cosmos — beyond Tatooine and idiotic Ewoks and Caprica Six 's curves — lay a chunk of matter so beyond our understanding that it is actually pulling the observable universe toward it at 600 km /s .

But in that term " observable universe " lies the rub .
We can't ( and never will ) " see " what this mass of theorized matter looks like .
Which is too bad , because the dark flow theory hints that this mass , or super structure , could be anything from another universe to a realm of whimsical fancy whose physics , forces and warped space - time are completely beyond any of us .
Unicorns , flying cars , cats and dogs living in harmony , you name it and it could be true , as we 'll never , ever make it there to find out first hand .
And even though this whole " observable universe " buzz kill means one of the greatest discoveries ever will never be observed by humanity 's naked eye , it does n't mean scientists are deterred from theorizing the hell out of what lies just beyond the cosmic horizon .
Indeed , Kashlinsky intends to continue to research the phenomenon using data from the five - year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) project .
Launched in June 2001 , WMAP has been a " stunningly successful " program , responsible for producing a new Standard Model of Cosmology , says NASA .
( Ed. Note : WMAP 's top ten discoveries are on display over at NASA – j.l. )

The WOW !
Signal .
Or , Holy Crap , Alien Avon Calling !
Before Jodie Foster implored humanity to send poets to document the denizens of Vega , there was a real - life signal from the heavens that has , to date , remained one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that we are not alone .
Advertisement
Called the WOW !
signal , this 72 - second beacon was detected by Dr. Jerry R. Ehman on August 15 , 1977 .
Because the unknown signal fit the parameters of what an artificial space signal might sound like so exactly , the awestruck Ehman jotted down " Wow ! " when he first heard it .
I 'd also like to think he cartoonishly fell back in his chair and spit coffee out all over the terminal when it happened too , but that 's just me .
One of the biggest pieces of evidence supporting the theory that Wow ! was extraterrestrial in origin — and not some random signal from Earth that bounced off a satellite — was the 72 - second duration .
As was the case in Contact , with its 18 hours of recorded static , more can be read in the length of the transmission than within the signal itself .
In fact , in a paper published on the 20th anniversary of WOW ! , Ehman explored additional theories and speculation regarding signal length :
There is still another factor to consider .
The signal could actually have been present for years ( or millennia , for that matter ) prior to its detection for the following reason .
Just before the data acquisition and analysis ( i.e. , the " run " ) began , the declination of the telescope was changed .
In the days ( and years ) previous to August 15 , 1977 the radio telescope was not pointed at the declination where Wow ! was seen ; thus , we could n't have detected that signal .
I should note that during the Ohio Sky Survey many years earlier , we did survey the same declination we did when the Wow ! signal was discovered .
However , we were using a wideband receiver ( 8 MHz bandwidth ) .
A narrowband signal averaged over a wide bandwidth would be reduced in intensity so much that it would have been buried in the noise .
Thus , even if Wow !
were present then , we would n't have seen it . "

So , was it aliens ?
If we get off this rock and jet off into the stars , will we one day find the source of this mysterious signal ?
Who knows , as subsequent attempts made over the past 20 years to locate the Wow !
signal , or another one like it , have failed .
Even when more powerful systems were implemented , like the Hollywood - friendly Very Large Array in New Mexico , the results were all the same : Utter silence .
If you 'll yourself a bit of wishful thinking , however , the idea that this was some kind of powerful last - ditch burst of radiation from a dying alien race is not implausible .
As detailed by author and astronomer David Darling , the Wow ! signal could have been generated by an alien civilization with access to a transmitting dish like our Arecibo radio telescope .
They 'd also need a 2.2 - gigawatt transmitter — extremely powerful , but plausible for humans ( and definitely plausible if your race is , say , facing extinction ) .

NASA 's Mystery BOOM !
Or Something In Space Is Screaming
Contrary to what the original Alien movie poster might have lead you to believe , somewhere in the universe , something is screaming — and we can " hear " it .
Advertisement
In the words of Alan Kogut from the Goddard Space Center , " The universe really threw us a curve .
Instead of the faint signal we hoped to find , here was this booming ' noise ' six times louder than anyone had predicted . "
Advertisement
Of course , there is no sound in space .
What NASA 's ARCADE system received was actually deafening cosmic radio background , and the source is completely unknown at this time .
Normally radio telescopes pick up electromagnetic chatter in the 10 MHz and 100 GHz , coming from what are known as " radio galaxies . "
But according to our existing models and theories , the signal should n't exist , as there are " not enough radio galaxies to account for the signal . "
As detailed by Jesus when this story initially broke earlier this year , NASA said that to create this signal , " you 'd have to pack [ radio galaxies ] into the universe like sardines .
There would n't be any space left between one galaxy and the next . "
That 's obviously not the case .

The discovery , while amazing , also carries with it a substantial negative .
Remember all that cool stuff about dark flow and the edge of the universe from earlier ?
Well , the BOOM complicates our efforts to detect it more accurately .

Hubble Spies UFO .
Or ... Yeah , This One Really Was a Legitimate UFO
Stories like these confirm to me that we need to keep Hubble and similar programs going as long as humanly possible .
On February 21 , 2006 ( the paper was only published recently ) , the venerable space telescope spied a UFO in an area of space where there should have been nothing at all .

Stranger still , the object disappeared almost as mysteriously as it arrived , about 100 days after the initial observation .
It got very bright over time , to the 21st magnitude , then faded just as fast .
Kind of like an explosion ...
Not much else is known about the celestial phenomenon , and it has n't reappeared since 2006 .

The one other certainty ?
It was n't dust , so there go all your jokes .
The Sloan Great Wall : There Is Nothing Bigger
Advertisement
Until we figure out what that huge thing tugging on the pant leg of the universe is , the freakishly huge Sloan Great Wall is the largest structure known to mankind .
It is a behemoth wall of galaxies , otherwise known as a galactic filament , that stretches 1.37 billion light years from end to end .
The filament was discovered only recently , on October 20 , 2003 , by the Princeton University duo J. Richard Gott III and Mario Jurić .
Its immense , unimaginable bulk lies an equally unimaginable one billion light years from Earth .
Advertisement
It 's kind of hard to wrap your mind around such distance , so we 'll take things down an exponential notch or two and compare the Great Sloan Wall to something we might eventually ( fingers crossed ) map out in a few thousand years : The Milky Way .
Our galaxy is actually considered large in the scheme of things .
Various estimates say it's about 100,000 light - years from end - to - end , and about 1,000 light - years thick in the center ( where there lay a massive black hole ) .
So , 1.37 billion versus 100,000 .
I 'd say it 's like David and Goliath , but that 'd be woefully inaccurate .
This Goliath would be incapable of even knowing about our insignificant little existence .
Our " large " galaxy is more like a cell in the human body in this case — dutifully performing its mundane , insignificant work while the host moves obliviously on through eternity .

To Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before .

Now , admittedly , these interstellar objects and phenomena are a bit beyond both our reach and our comprehension , and I highly doubt we 'll ever encounter any of them firsthand on our wild journey Off This Rock anytime soon .
But you 'll never hear me say " never " when it comes to space travel , even if you just did .

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame and his girlfriend , musician Mariqueen Maandig of the band West Indian Girl , are officially engaged , the couple confirms .
They announced the happy news this weekend on her band 's website .
" In case [ you ] have n't heard , Mariqueen got engaged , " the post reads .
" Everyone in the West Indian Girl camp is excited and happy for her .
Q's an awesome person , friend and bandmate , and she could n't be marrying a cooler guy . "
Congrats to Trent Reznor and his fiancee Mariqueen Maandig !
What happened to yesterday ’s post ?
It was an elegant elucidation of the manner in which the point of view , language , and tone of tabloid reportage supports rape culture .
My glittering example of the sanitizing powers of the English language was an article in the Daily Mail reporting on the trial of 39 - year - old flight instructor Paul Nicholls , who is accused of “ sexual activity ” with teenage female students ; one of the girls , 13 - year - old Cherrell Evans , hung herself last year after Nicholls tried to talk her into a three - way with her 15 - year - old friend .
Nice .
Unfortunately , as will befall the sluggish Internet Feminist who takes too many coffee breaks , between my having written my essay and publishing it , the tabloid article in question disappeared into the aether .
In its place materialized a different article on the same subject , completely rewritten such that my post did n’t make any sense anymore .
So I had to junk it .
A pity .
It was a real beaut .
Fortunately , my argument remains unassailable , so you are stuck with the awkward re-write .
You ’ll just have to take my word for the erstwhile existence of the non-existent version .
The first article was pretty much an advertisement for the remarkable idea that pedophilia can be consensual .
The gist of my original post was the startling paucity of the word “ rape ” in an article purporting to report on a middle - aged predator exploiting the power differential in his “ father - figure ” relationship with a 13 - year - old student .
“ Rape ” was used only twice and in such a manner as to suggest that the kid was just making it up .
In its place were a string of euphemisms , incidences of which broke down thusly :
Encounter 1
Affair 1
Secret affair 1
Wanted them sexually 1
Have sex 2
Slept with 2
Sexual activity 2
Sexual relationship 6
The new improved article is a bit harder on Nicholls , depicting him as a predator and a “ horrible person , ” but the second piece retains the original lurid headline and opener :
Schoolgirl air cadet killed herself after being ‘ raped ’ by instructor
And :
A schoolgirl who killed herself after having sex with her 39 - year - old flying instructor saw the encounter as rape , a court heard .
It was n’t a rape , it was a ‘ rape ’ .
No wait , it was an “ encounter , ” editorially downgraded to “ having sex , ” because one must n’t discount the likelihood that the kid made up the rape part just before offing herself because she was a tarty bitch and all sexy little girls are lying suicidal sluts .
With your keen eye you will perceive that the sentence in the second quotation is structured to ascribe the agency to young Cherrell ; the 39 - year - old rapist is just her sex partner , a passive bystander .
Both versions of the article undeniably use the trial as an excuse to pander to reader prurience with a lurid teen sex scandal and its sensationally tragic consequences .
It ’s not just the Daily Mail , either .
WalesOnline is happy to accommodate Dude Nation by consulting Cherrell ’s 18 - year - old ex-boyfriend ( one begins to grasp that this poor kid never had a chance ) , who also romanticizes the rape as an “ an affair . ”
The boyfriend ( who was n’t there , but he ’s a dude , so he ’s completely authorized to make this call ) also refers to it “ sexual intercourse ” and “ a fling . ”
Tell me .
How the hell can a 13 - year - old kid have an affair ?
If there exists a more disenfranchised group of human beings than teenage girls I ’d like to know about it .
The absurd and dangerous conflation of rape and sex and children and affairs reflected by these news stories would all be completely unnecessary if female persons enjoyed anything remotely resembling the agency men wield all day long .
Fortunately I have the solution .
As longtime readers know , the Twist - Solution proposes the unthinkable : the legalization of women ’s humanity , otherwise known as my Wacky Consent Scheme .
Because I love this scheme , I ’ll haul it out of mothballs and give it an airing :
The Problem with consent
Although this condition does not obtain with regard to any other crime you can think of , when it comes to rape , women are currently considered to exist in a state of perpetual “ yes ! ” .
This is because “ yes ! ” is consistent with global accords governing fair use of women .
Victims of robbery or attempted murder do n’t have to prove that they said no to being robbed or murdered ; the presumption is that not even women would consent to being killed .
But because penetration by males is what women are for , if we are raped we have to prove not just that we did n’t say yes , which is impossible to prove , but that we specifically and emphatically said no , which is also impossible to prove .
There are rules about what sort of woman can even attempt to make the “ I said no ” argument in court .
Women who typically are not eligible to opt out of consent include : women who drink in bars , women who walk alone , women who walk at night , women who use drugs , women belonging to certain castes , women who dress a certain way , women who do n’t dress a certain way , women who are married to men , women who have had multiple sex partners , women who may have said yes last month , women who may have said yes at the beginning but who , three minutes in , found it disagreeable and changed to “ no , ” women who did n’t fight back hard enough , women who did n’t tell anyone or report it right away , women whose physical similarity to pornulated women aroused the defendant , women whose behavior at the party aroused the defendant , teens with a “ reputation , ” and prostituted women .
Prostituted women are indistinguishable from sex itself .
This is true to varying degrees of all women , but prostituted women particularly are imagined to manifest so cavalier an attitude toward being used at any and all times by any and all comers that it is considered impossible to rape them .
Prostituted women can never say no to sex because they are sex .
The Twist - Solution
My wacky consent scheme flips it around .
According to my scheme , women would abide in a persistent legal condition of not having given consent to sex .
Conversely , men , who after all are constantly declaiming that their lack of impulse control is a product of evolution and there ’s not a thing they can do about it , would abide in a persistent legal state of pre-rape .
Women can still have all the sex they want ; if they adjudge that their dude has n’t raped them , all they have to do is not call the cops .
But if , at any time during the course of the proceedings , up to and including the storied infinitesimal microsecond preceding the sacred spilling of dudely seed , the woman elects to biff off to the nearest taco stand ; and if her egress from the sweaty tableau is in any way impeded by the pronger ( such an impediment would include everything from “ traditional ” brute force , to that insistently whispered declamation “ just a couple more minutes , I ’m almost there ” the dread seriousness of which the fervid oaf dramatizes by that ever - so - slight tightening of his grip on her wrist ) ; or if , in three hours or three days or , perhaps in the case of childhood abuse , in 13 years it begins to dawn on her that she has been badly used by an opportunistic predator , she has simply to make a call .
Presto !
The dude is already a rapist , because , legally , consent never existed .
The cessation of rape would be immediate .
Men would begin aligning their boinking protocols along non-barbaric lines in a hurry .
It would suddenly be in their best interest to make damn sure that nothing in their behavior , either prior or subsequent to hiding the salami , would cause their partner to believe she has been abused .
I have an idea for a great new product , too .
SmartCervix .
An undetectable microchip records pertinent information regarding any “ encounter ” — DNA typing , location via GPS , audio , video , date , time , etc — and sends it ( encrypted , of course ) to a remote third - party database where it can be retrieved by the client ( you ) whenever some dickwad goes all 2009 on your ass .
I revisit my wacky consent scheme annually whether it needs it or not .
昨日デブサミで朝一発表、前日の疲れがとれず、眠い目をこすりながら、どうにかふらふらと行って、適当なことをしゃべってきました。
お世話になったスタッフの方々に感謝です。
私のセッションは超マイナー路線だったんで、メディアとかで報道はされないだろうと思いますけど、 z-ohnamiさんが報告されているのを発見しました。 ちなみに、「RDBMSはデータ構造が剥き出しであり、低レベルである」は写し間違いで、書いていたのは「低レベル向きである」です。
日本語って難しいなあって思う瞬間ですが、
どうも日本語の「 低レベル 」 は「頭悪い」とか「しょぼい」の同義語として用いられることが多くて、誤解を招きやすいんですね。
私が主張していたのは英語で言うところの「low-level」です。
ネガティブな意味合いはこれっぽっちもなくて、
言い方を替えれば「バックエンド向き」とでも言うんですかね。 ただそれだとODBMSもバックエンドだろってことになるんで、
低レベルと表現したんですけど、あんまりうまくない言い方だったかも。
なお、使った資料は ここに置きました （PDF 、200KBぐらい）。
で、ここから本題です。 聴衆がわからないってのは 矢崎さんと同様 。 ITpro Challenge!のときにも感じたことですが、
日本で開発者向けイベントをやると、直接反応を寄越してくれない人が多くて、余計にわかりづらいんですね。
矢崎さんが書いているのとは違う意味なのかもしれませんけど。
今まで参加したことのない集まりに参加すると、事前に聴衆が何を望んでいるのか読めないのはどこでもそうなんです。
しかし、オープンソースでわいわい言いながら開発している人たちの集まり（カーネル読書会とか）は別にして、内気なのかなんなのか知らないですけど、こういうイベントは反応が乏しくて、終わった後にもわからないのはつらいですね。
デブサミの場合は、アンケート結果を見せてくれるそうですけど、
それはそれで見るのが怖い気もする（笑）。
例外だったのは、あらかじめ「声をかけてくれ」と明記しておいたESPerのときぐらいだったかもしれませんね。
発表というのは、教育と同じで、実は聞いている方より話している方が勉強になることが多かったりします。
だからどこは良くてどこは悪かったのか、どうすればもっと良くなれるかがわかると大変貴重なんです。
そのためにはフィードバックがないと判断がつきかねることになるんで、
どうかもっと普通にしゃべってきてくださいな。
ちなみに、終わった後は、 嘉平さんと長い時間だべらせてもらいました。 矢崎さんの発表もそうだったようですけど（聞けにいけなくてごめんなさい）、 出版業界の不況の話とか。 でも私の正直な気持ちをいうと、 全体から見れば少ないのかもしれませんけど、 こうやっていろんな出版社に問題意識をもって真剣に悩んでいる方々がいるんだったら、 きっとどうにかなりますよ。 楽観的なのかもしれませんけど、世の中、情熱のあるところには必ず何か生まれるものだと経験してます。
RMS だって、ソフトウェアがどんどんプロプライエタリ化されていって、 自由が衰退していく中、一生懸命どうにかしようと奮闘して、 今やマイクロソフトやアップルみたいな会社でさえフリーソフトウェアをやっている時代になったわけでしょう（もっとも彼らは決してフリーソフトウェアなんて言い方はしないでしょうけど）。 今ではそういうのがあって当たり前の世界になったから、 若い人にはぴんと来ないかもしれないですけど、 当時は希望の光なんてさっぱり見えてなかったはずです。
閑話休題。 しかーし、毎回感じることですけど、限られた時間の中で言いたいことをうまく伝えるって、とっても難しいですね。 言いたいことの半分も伝えられている気がしません。 誰でもそんなものなのかもしれませんが。 今回の発表は準備にまるで時間が使えなかったっていうのもあるんですが（正直なところ、資料の半分ぐらいはOSSAJフォーラムの最中に書いてました、すまん）、 こういう内容にしようと思った動機のところまではほとんど踏み込めず。 しょーがないので、こっちにちょっとだけ書いておきます。
自分の持っている問題意識は、正規のコンピュータ・サイエンスを受けたことのないエンジニアのことだったりします。
そういう系統の大学とかに入った人は、真面目にやったかどうかは別にして、基礎を確実に概観させられているわけです。
しかしエンジニアリング・スクール出身者とかそもそもどっちも受けたことがない私みたいなのとかは、そのままだと、基礎がとっても脆弱で、「知識は穴だらけ」な状態になります。
それでももちろんできる仕事はいろいろあると思いますよ。
でも、できないことも多くて、太刀打ちできそうにないことに尻込みして手が出せなかったり、わかってないといけない要素が含まれている仕事が出現したときに誰か他の人に任せざるを得なかったりで、
結局「面白い仕事」ができなかったり、「仕事を面白く」できなかったりするんじゃないかなあと。
日本は学歴と職場が一致しないケースがかなり多いので、とりわけ深刻な問題なんじゃないかと感じているんです。
じゃあ、どうすればいいのかというと、 足りないところを補う努力をする他ないわけです。
その中にも、「独習する」とか「誰かに訊く」とか、いくつか選択肢はあります。
後者の代表例で、昨今盛り上がっているのが「勉強会」という形態なんでしょうけど、学校とかと同じで、勉強会も所詮は火付け役以上のことはできません。
時間が少ないし、聞いているだけの状態が長いですからね。
そうすると、自分で勉強するという部分は、絶対に外せないってことになるんですね。
でもまあ、それでみんなが自分で勉強してくれているんだったら、
わざわざ発表するようなことじゃないんですが、 現実はそうでもないんで、 私も火付け役の片棒が担げればなあ、っていうのがモチベーションですね。
気がついたら、発表より長くなってきたので（笑）、この辺でやめます。
OSSAJフォーラムの方の話はまた後で書くかも、書かないかも。
A brief Python decorator primer
My last post looked at easing a common database idiom using a decorator .
Interestingly , the brief discussion on reddit regarding the post had a number of people remarking that the coverage of decorators was more interesting than the SQL - related bits .
Curious , that .
It seems I ’m not alone in being occasionally puzzled by the way decorators work .
It took me a little while to comprehend them .
I ’m still not a huge fan of how they work , but I can see their utility and do use them when appropriate .
Almost without fail I end up heading over to PEP - 318 and puzzling over the variations .
The PEP is n’t terribly helpful since it is dominated by historical discussion rather than examples or instructions .
So let ’s start with the basic no-argument decorator .
It does n’t take any declarative arguments when decorating a function ; you just type @some_deco without parenthesis when using it .
def some_deco ( f ) : def _inner ( * args , ** kwargs ) : print " Decorated ! " return f ( * args , ** kwargs ) return _inner @some_deco def some_func ( a , b ) : return a + b print some_func ( 1 , 2 )
This will print out :
Decorated ! 3
According to the PEP , if you wrap some_func with @some_deco , it is the equivalent of some_func = some_deco ( some_func ) .
What it fails to call out is that this happens at load time .
What we ’re returning from the decorator function is a new function or callable that will be bound to the name some_func when this module is loaded .
Subsequent run-time calls to some_func are actually calling the _inner function we defined on the fly when the decorator was called .
Thanks to Python ’s scoping rules and closures , we have access to the passed f parameter from the inner function , so we can call it .
Lovely .
Now you have the power to tack on any sort of things you want to around a given function .
Print a log message before or after , spawn a thread , add some exception handling .
Whatever you want .
Things get a little more hairy if we want our decorators themselves to take parameters .
According to the PEP , if was want parameters on the decorator to take parameters it ’s the equivalent of func = decomaker ( argA , argB , ... ) ( func ) .
Again , this happens at load time , so it ’s worth staring at for a moment .
In plain English , this is saying that decomaker will be called with some arguments , and then the result of that will be called with a function reference .
This is key !
There are actually two invocations happening .
The first will need to return a callable that accepts a function as it ’s argument .
That will then be called , and the result bound to the name func , so it better be callable as well .
Let ’s try it .
def log_wrap ( message ) : " " " Print `message` each time the decorated function is called . " " " def _second ( f ) : def _inner ( * args , ** kwargs ) : print message return f ( * args , ** kwargs ) #
This is called second , so return a callable that takes arguments # like the first example .
return _inner #
This is called first , so we want to pass back our inner function that accepts # a function as argument return _second @log_wrap ( " Called it ! " ) def func ( a , b ) : return a + b print func ( 1 , 2 )
This will output :
Called it !
3
Ok , ok , that ’s not terribly useful , but it illustrates the point ( and expands on the first example by being a parameterized version ) .
It requires that we construct two callable items inside our decorator , and that each will be called in turn during load time .
Let ’s quick dissect what happens at load time .
When python gets to the declaration of func with the decorator sitting on top of it , it calls the decorator function with its argument ( in this case , the string “ Called ! ” ) .
What is returned is a function reference to _second .
Next , that just - returned reference to _second is invoked with a single argument : a function pointer to func , which is what we ’re actually trying to decorate .
The return value of _second is a reference to _inner , which will be bound to the name func , ready for run -time invocation .
Yeah , I ’m a little dizzy , too .
But if you practice this a couple times , it ’ll start to make sense .
Again , the key to getting this second form working is to recognize that two calls are happening at load time and returning the appropriate callable references at the right time .
Once you have it down , use this new hammer when it serves you , remembering that not every problem is a nail .
A serendipitous observation of low body temperature in Huntington disease mice has led to findings that may point to a possible treatment for Huntington disease in humans .
Importantly , the possible treatment would involve drugs that have already been approved for use in humans for other conditions or that are in clinical trials .
Dr. Albert La Spada , director of the Center for Neurogenetics and Neurotherapeutics at the University of Washington Medical Center announced the findings in a plenary session at the 2008 American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting held November 11 - 15 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
“ My colleagues and I are very excited about the surprising results of our most recent research on Huntington disease because the findings could ultimately lead to a potential treatment for this currently fatal disease , ” Dr. La Spada said .
“ Furthermore , our findings suggest that there are drugs already available and being used in human patients that could be possible new treatments . ”
“ We are very proud to have funded Dr. La Spada and his work , " said Nancy Wexler , Ph.D. , Higgins Professor of Neuropsychology , Columbia University and President , Hereditary Disease Foundation ( HDF ) .
" Dr. La Spada 's work has been truly innovative and very promising .
The HDF has a forty - year track record of supporting the best and brightest who are changing the cutting - edge of science .
We often fund risky , creative research which then allows scientists like Dr. La Spada to get additional research support from agencies like the National Institutes of Health so that they can carry out their critical work . ”
Dr. Wexler and the HDF played key roles in the work to locate and isolate the Huntington disease gene and to develop the genetic test for the disease .
Her mother died of Huntington disease and Dr. Wexler is the subject of the recent biography , “ Gene Hunter . ”
Dr. La Spada was the recipient of the 2007 Lieberman Award from the HDF .
The Lieberman Award is a special award given to select researchers to catalyze innovative proposals leading to the treatment and cure of Huntington 's disease .
Huntington disease ( HD ) is an inherited fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 35,000 individuals in the United States .
It generally has its onset in mid-adulthood and is relentlessly progressive with uncontrolled movements , cognitive decline , personality changes , and dementia .
Death typically results from complications of the disease within 15 - 20 years of the onset of frank symptoms .
There is presently no treatment for HD , although the first drug ( tetrabenazine ) to reduce the movement disorder symptoms of the disease was approved by the FDA in August .
A famous victim of HD was Woody Guthrie , the American folksinger .
Any child of an HD parent has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the disease .
HD is caused by mutations in a protein called huntingtin which is expressed in many different types of cells , including nerve cells .
The normal huntingtin protein contains a stretch of the same amino acid and the number of amino acids in the stretch is increased in the mutated huntingtin protein found in HD patients .
This causes the protein to take on an abnormal shape and form insoluble aggregates that are a characteristic pathological finding in the disease .
The function of the normal huntingtin protein is unknown .
The stretch of a repeated amino acid in the huntingtin protein is coded for by a repeating sequence in the DNA , C - A - G , and thus HD is called a “ triplet repeat ” disease .
Dr. La Spada was instrumental in identifying the first CAG triplet repeat disease ( spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ) in 1991 , while an MD / PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania .
HD was identified as the second CAG triplet repeat disease in 1993 .
Since that time , a dozen or so other diseases have been found to be caused by triplet repeats in different genes .
Dr. La Spada ’s work leading to the current discovery began five years ago at the University of Washington when he decided to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of cannabinoids ( drugs containing an active ingredient of marijuana ) in a mouse model of HD .
In setting up his experiments , Dr. La Spada wanted to establish various baseline values and these included body temperature .
Much to his surprise , he found that the HD mice ( created by “ transplanting ” or inserting the human gene for mutant huntingtin into the mouse genome ) developed significantly lower body temperatures than normal mice ( by 3.5 – 10 degrees Celsius ) as their disease became manifest .
This surprising finding led him to investigate if the normal pathway of body temperature control in mice might be disrupted in HD mice .
Interestingly , the decreased body temperature of HD mice had previously been overlooked despite their use in many studies .
In mice , body temperature is tightly controlled through metabolism carried out in a special form of fat called brown fat .
To generate heat to maintain body temperature , a so - called futile cycle is activated in the brown fat cells .
This cycle is called futile because two metabolic pathways run simultaneously in opposite directions and have no overall effect other than to dissipate energy in the form of heat — heat that , in this case , serves to maintain the body temperature of the mouse .
A particular protein ( PPAR - gamma - coactivator 1 - alpha , or more simply , PGC - 1 alpha ) is key to activating this futile cycle .
Dr. La Spada hypothesized that the PGC - 1 alpha protein might be somehow inactivated in the HD mice as well as in HD patients .
It was a particularly intriguing possibility because PGC - 1 alpha is also known to play a key role in turning on genes that lead to the production of more mitochondria , the energy powerhouses of the cell .
Many studies over the years have shown that mitochondrial activity and energy production are adversely affected in HD patients .
To determine if PGC - 1 alpha function is truly affected in humans with HD , Dr. La Spada performed analyses to study the expression of genes that are normally turned on by PGC - 1 alpha in normal individuals .
He found that , indeed , the expression of these genes is reduced in the brain cells of HD patients ( presymptomatic or early symptomatic patients ) who had died from other causes .
Dr. La Spada hypothesized that if you could increase PGC - 1 alpha function , it might be possible to ameliorate or eliminate the symptoms of HD .
To test his hypothesis in mice , Dr. La Spada generated HD mice that had extra copies of the gene for PGC - 1 alpha , with the idea that production of more PGC - 1 alpha might overcome the problem seen in HD mice .
Indeed this was the case .
The HD mice with the extra PGC - 1 alpha genes exhibited dramatic improvements in characteristic HD symptoms of motor function deterioration , and the characteristic HD protein aggregates in neurons were also eliminated .
These were “ very exciting ” findings , Dr. La Spada said .
Dr. La Spada next investigated the way in which PGC - 1 alpha activity might be reduced by mutant huntingtin protein .
Although PGC - 1 alpha is not known to interact with huntingtin , a protein that interacts with PGC - 1 alpha was shown by Dr. La Spada ’s group to bind to huntingtin .
That protein is PPAR - delta , which , working together with PGC - 1 alpha , also plays a role in turning on genes that lead to the production of more mitochondria and thereby enhancing energy production .
Dr. La Spada performed experiments to determine if PPAR - delta function is disrupted in the brains of HD mice , and found that it was .
This finding implicated PPAR - delta in the pathology of HD .
Dr. La Spada hypothesizes that mutant huntingtin protein might bind to PPAR - delta causing its inactivation .
This in turn would disrupt PGC - 1 alpha function because it works in a complex with PPAR - delta .
If this is the case , it would offer a ready avenue toward the testing of a possible treatment for HD , because drugs known to increase the activity of PPAR - delta already exist .
One is known as GW501516 , an experimental drug from Glaxo - Wellcome ( GlaxoSmithKline ) that was the subject of a phase II trial completed in 2004 .
This trial was for indications other than HD .
The existence of such drugs is a tremendous asset because it means that if further studies in mice support the initial findings implicating PPAR - delta ’s role in HD , then trials in humans could be greatly accelerated based on the results of clinical trial testing already done “ Essentially , we have something we could take off the shelf , if you will , and give it to people , if the science supports it , ” Dr. La Spada notes .
In addition to the possible energy defects that might be caused by inactivation of PGC - 1 alpha and PPAR - delta , an additional disease - related mechanism is possible , Dr. La Spada says .
It is now known that retinoic acid participates in a cycle that leads to the preservation of cells and that this cycle is also co-activated by PPAR - delta .
It is possible that the inactivation of PPAR - delta in HD may affect this cycle as well and thus favor cell death .
This negative effect could be in addition to possible energy defects associated with inactivation of PPAR - delta ’s function with PGC - 1 alpha .
Dr. La Spada is optimistic that the PGC - 1 alpha / PPAR - delta line of investigation will prove fruitful and lead to an effective intervention in the inexorable and deadly progress of HD .
“ It ’s one line of investigation , of a number that are going on , that are yielding some very promising leads for new treatments for HD .
It ’s not the only one , by any means , but it is certainly one of a number of advances that are being made .
People are working very hard to develop these leads and to move to test them through cell culture studies and in animal models to determine whether any of these leads might be useful as treatments for patients with this disease .
That ’s the ultimate goal .
The hope is that within the next few years , we ’ll have a number of promising candidate drugs for testing in patients with HD . ”
Dr. La Spada ’s findings provide new light and hope for those who have traveled so long in the darkness and despair of this dread disease .
“ I am very encouraged to hear Dr. La Spada ’s results , ” said Jonathan Monkemeyer , a 43 - year - old engineer who recently testified to the FDA on behalf of approval of tetrabenazine and whose 46 - year - old wife , Sheryl , suffers from HD .
“ I hope the science gets done quickly and saves a lot of lives . ”
Monkemeyer is presently creating a web site that he hopes will encourage more rapid communication among HD scientists and help “ bridge the gap ” between research and clinical benefits to patients .
Monkemeyer and his family were recently the subjects of a story in the USA Today .
More information on Huntington disease can be obtained from the Hereditary Disease Foundation and the Huntington ’s Disease Society of America .
Silicon Graphics Inc. ( SGI ) , the perma - struggling workstation - turned - server - maker , filed for bankruptcy protection today , and was immediately bought by Rackable Systems for $ 25 m cash .
Rackable has signed to take on of SGI liabilities .
The deal is expected to complete in 60 days .
The combined company will target the hyper - competitive market for x86 boxes for cluster and high performance computing , internet and cloud services .
" This combination gives us the potential for significant operational synergies , a strong balance sheet , and positions the combined company for long - term growth and profitability , " said Rackable CEO Mark Barrenechea .
SGI recently laid off more than 15 per cent of its workforce , leaving it with about 1,155 staff .
The move was n't sufficient to save it as a standalone firm however .
Today 's Chapter 11 filing is SGI 's second in three years .
It last went titsup in May 2006 with debts of $ 664 m .
The subsequent reorganisation did n't help matters much ; SGI 's most recent quarterly results revealed an operating loss of $ 38.2 m and rising .
It 's expected that SGI will continue business operations while the deal goes through .
Its international operations would be part of the sale , but are not part of the US bankruptcy . ®

But Wait , There 's More… 2.1 . Comprehensive New Disc Burning
Although previous versions of GNOME already had an easy way to burn CDs and DVDs , as of GNOME 2.26 this has been expanded to a whole application dedicated to disc creation : Brasero .
Brasero delivers new features that were not supported by the CD burner , such as audio CD burning with audio track preview , track splitting , and volume normalisation ; full multisession support ; integrity checks ; a cover editor ; and support for multiple burning backends .
Figure 2 Brasero
People who appreciated the way CD burning used to work will not have to relearn their habits ; the existing interfaces are also available .
Applications ▸ System Tools ▸ CD / DVD
Creator in the menu still brings up a folder you can drag into .
CD ( ISO ) image files can still be burnt directly from the file manager by right - clicking on them .
Brasero allows other GNOME applications to add disc burning capabilities .
For example , the Media Player now allows you to burn the home movie you 're watching to either ( S ) VCD or DVD .
2.2 . Simpler File Sharing GNOME 2.26 now includes a plugin for its file manager to enable simple personal file sharing over WebDAV , HTTP and Bluetooth .
Figure 3 Sharing Files 2.3 . Evolution Evolves its Migration from Windows GNOME 's e-mail and groupware suite , Evolution , has gained two important features for helping users who are migrating to GNOME from Microsoft Windows environments .
First is the ability to import Microsoft Outlook Personal Folders ( PST files ) directly in Evolution .
E-mail , contacts , appointments , tasks and journal entries are supported .
Previously , the files had to be imported via a third - party utility , such as Thunderbird on Windows .
Second is support for Microsoft Exchange 's MAPI protocol .
This is the protocol that Microsoft Outlook uses to communicate with Exchange .
Previously , Evolution only supported Exchange 's SOAP protocol , which is not available on all Exchange servers .
This support significantly improves Evolution 's integration with Exchange servers .
2.4 . Media Player Improvements GNOME 's Media Player continues to be improved with several new features .
Many media player appliances now offer the option to share the stored content via either the UPnP or DLNA protocols .
With the new Coherence DLNA / UPnP client , it is possible to browse and play this content from within the GNOME Media Player .
While GNOME 's Media Player already has the ability to display subtitles for a movie , this still required you to have the subtitle data available .
As of GNOME 2.26 , this restriction is gone .
Using the new subtitle downloader plugin , the Media Player will automatically find subtitles for you .
2.5 . Volume Control Integrated with PulseAudio PulseAudio is the new audio input / output routeing and mixing framework that is being adopted by many free software platforms .
It has support for features like per-application volume and dynamic plug - and - play and rerouteing of sound devices ( e.g. USB soundcards ) .
GNOME 2.26 can take advantage of these features with its new volume control and new Sound Preferences tool .
Figure 4 Volume Control Input Settings
The Sound Preferences tool integrates the choice of sound devices , application volumes , alert volume and alert theme in one place .
For those without PulseAudio , the old ( GStreamer ) mixer will still be available and has even been augmented with a sound theme tab to match the new interface .
2.6 . Support for multiple monitors and projectors
The Display Settings tool now has a better view of which monitors or projectors you have plugged in , and makes it easier than before to set up your monitors in various configurations .
Figure 5 Display Settings
The Display Settings tool is also more reliable even with unrobust graphics drivers , as it now presents a confirmation dialogue after making changes to your monitor 's settings .
Your settings will be restored to a known - good configuration even if your machine crashes while changing the monitor 's settings .
2.7 . Almost Telepathic Communication
The Empathy instant messaging application , which uses the Telepathy communications framework , has taken another step forward with features including file transfer where supported by Telepathy ( currently Jabber and link - local XMPP ) , chat room invite support , sound themes and notifications , and an improved VoIP experience .
Figure 6 Video Calling in Empathy VoIP using the free Theora and Speex codecs is now possible over Jingle to clients that support them .
Support for sound themes and notification bubbles has also been added .
2.8 . Location Epiphany GNOME 's web browser , Epiphany , gains an exciting new feature of an improved location bar , similar to the Awesome Bar popularised by Firefox 3.0 .
Figure 7 New Location Bar 2.9 .
Fingerprint Reader Integration GNOME 2.26 now integrates with the fprintd fingerprint service to allow users to enroll fingerprints for use in authentication .
If a system is configurated for allowing fingerprint authentication , users can enroll their fingerprints via Desktop ▸ Preferences ▸ About Me from the panel menu .
2.10 .
But Wait , There 's More …
As well as big changes , there are also various small additions and tweaks that happen in every GNOME release .
PackageKit
The file manager can now to askto install support for a file you wish to open .
A keyboard modifier ( usually Alt ) is now required to drag panels around on the screen ( the same keyboard modifier used for dragging windows around by their middles ) .
Password entry widgets will now warn if you have your Caps Lock key enabled .
Changing the Input Method type using the context menu on a text entry widget is now per-widget , rather than per-application .
( This is separate from setting your default input manager or keyboard layout . )
Input methods now work in password entry widgets .
The Deskbar now supports OpenSearch plugins .
New visual effects , such as the panels sliding in and out at login and logout , and crossfading desktop backgrounds .
3 . What 's New in Accessibility GNOME has a passion for making software available to everyone , including users and developers with impairments that can make it harder to use their computer .
To help , GNOME created the GNOME Accessibility Project and an accessibility framework that is now a standard on libre desktops .
GNOME 2.26 continues to build on its prior accessibility credentials with several improvements .
3.1 . Orca Screenreader 3.1 . Orca Screenreader
The Orca screenreader has had significant work done to reduce program bugs and improve performance , with over 160 bugs fixed for GNOME 2.26 .
Some of the improvements include : improved support for ARIA in Firefox ;
new understanding of how to pronounce WikiWords and mnemonics ;
the ability to configure speech pitch , rate and volume on the fly from the preferences pane ; and
improved performance and reliability .
4 . What 's New for Developers
The following changes are important for developers using the GNOME 2.26 developer platform .
If you 're not interested in changes for developers , you can skip forward to Section 5 ― Internationalisation .
As well as the GNOME Desktop , GNOME 2.26 is the latest release of the GNOME Developer Platform , a set of API and ABI stable libraries available under the GNU LGPL that can be used for the development of cross-platform applications .
Fixing Usage of Deprecated Libraries Starting with GNOME 3.0 , various deprecated parts of GNOME will be removed .
These deprecated components include GNOME - specific libraries such as libgnome , libgnomeui , libgnomeprint , libgnomeprintui , libglade and libgnomevfs .
For applications that ship as part of the GNOME Desktop , a number of cleanup tasks have been carried out to ensure no deprecated code is used .
This will ensure the smooth transition to GNOME 3.0 .
Developers are strongly urged to follow this example in their own applications too .
Furthermore , for any developers ( or potential developers ) who wish to help us out , the GNOME goals wiki page lists the various tasks that are yet to be completed .
4.1 . GTK + 2.16
GTK + 2.16 4.2 . Access to Disc Burning APIs
Access to Disc Burning APIs 4.3 .
Access to Evince APIs
Access to Evince APIs 4.4 . Anjuta 4.1 . GTK + 2.16 GTK + 2.16 is the latest release of the GTK + toolkit , which is at the heart of GNOME .
GTK + 2.16 includes a couple of new features for developers , as well as extensive bug fixing and housecleaning for the upcoming GTK +
3.0 . GtkEntry widgets can now display icons at the front or back of the entry widget ( depending on your locale 's text direction ) .
These icons are optionally prelightable and clickable .
Figure 8 Icons in GtkEntry GtkEntry widgets can now also be used to display a progress bar .
Figure 9 GtkEntry with a progress bar A new interface , GtkActivatable , has been added for widgets that can be connected to a GtkAction .
4.2 . Access to Disc Burning APIs libbrasero - media provides an API for accessing the disc burning infrastructure in GNOME .
An example of its use can be found in GNOME 's Media Player , which includes a plugin to burn DVDs and VCDs from a video .
4.3 . Access to Evince APIs
A new library , libevview , has been created to provide the EvView widget used in Evince .
This allows other applications to embed Evince 's document viewing component .
libevdocument is a library that makes it possible to develop third - party document backends for use with Evince without having to add them to the Evince source tree .
Both libraries already have available Python bindings included in gnome - python - desktop .
4.4 . Anjuta The Anjuta integrated development environment has gained some great improvements in GNOME 2.26 .
Most important is a completely rewritten symbol management engine that , together with the new bookmark system , allows for much faster code navigation .
Auto - detection of any libraries using pkg-config for code completion and calltips is now possible .
In addition , the integration of version control systems and the Glade interface designer have taken a major step forward .
The file tree now shows status icons for all files in projects using the Subversion or Git version control systems .
It is possible to automatically generate callbacks from Glade , and GtkBuilder files are now supported .
For better support of the GNOME Mobile platform , remote debugging using gdbserver and support for Scratchbox ( version 2 ) have also been added .

You can boot your computer directly from the LiveCD without installing anything .
The LiveCD can be downloaded from the GNOME BitTorrent site .
To install or upgrade your machine to GNOME 2.26 , we recommend you install official packages from your vendor or distribution .
Popular distributions will make GNOME 2.26 available very soon , and some already have development versions with GNOME 2.26 available .
You can get a list of distributions that ship GNOME and discover the latest versions they ship on our Get Footware page .
If you are brave and patient , and would like to build GNOME from source , we recommend you use one of the build tools .
GARNOME builds GNOME from release tarballs .
You will need GARNOME 2.26.x to build GNOME 2.26 .x .
There is also JHBuild , which is designed to build the latest GNOME from SVN .
You can use JHBuild to build GNOME 2.26.x by using the gnome - 2.26 moduleset .
While it is possible to build GNOME directly from the release tarballs , we strongly recommend the use of one of the build tools above .
7. Looking Forward to GNOME 2.28 Development does n't stop with GNOME 2.26 .
Work has already begun on GNOME 2.28 , due to be released exactly six months after 2.26 .
GNOME 's roadmap details the developers ' plans for the next release cycle , and the GNOME 2.28 release schedule will appear soon .
8. Become a Friend of GNOME !
During the 2.26 development cycle the GNOME Foundation also launched a new Friends of GNOME program .
Now supporters can sign up to help the GNOME Foundation with recurring $ 10 per month donations .
Friends of GNOME is a way for individuals to support the GNOME project 's mission of providing a free and open source desktop for everyone regardless of ability .
With no advertising or outreach , the foundation raised anywhere from $ 6,000 to $ 20,000 a year from generous individuals .
That money has contributed to the funds for hackfests , local events and programs which in turn have enabled the GNOME project to create internationalised , accessible and easy - to - use desktop software for both traditional desktops and for mobile devices .
Head over to the Friends of GNOME website .
Tessa Polak a " la rage " .
Interpellée le 28 avril par la police antiterroriste ( SDAT ) , placée en garde à vue 72 heures puis relâchée sans aucune charge , cette femme de 36 ans , photographe de profession , dénonce aujourd ' hui une " manœuvre d'intimidation " .
Membre active d'un comité de soutien aux neuf personnes mises en examen dans l'affaire des sabotages de voies SNCF , elle en connaît quelques - unes , en a croisé d'autres à Tarnac , en Corrèze , où elle s'est déjà rendue .
Mais elle ne s'attendait pas , six mois après l'arrestation des neuf le 11 novembre 2008 , a être , à son tour , interpellée de la sorte dans la rue .
Depuis lors , elle collecte les témoignages .
Ce 28 avril , en début d'après - midi , Tessa Polak circule en voiture dans le 20e arrondissement à Paris avec Benjamin Rosoux , l'un des mis en examen de Tarnac , à ses côtés .
" A l'angle de la rue des Pyrénées et de la rue du Jourdain , alors que je ralentissais , une nuée de types a surgi , dit -elle .
Ma vitre était ouverte , je me suis retrouvée avec un pistolet sur la tempe tandis que deux autres me braquaient de face .
J'ai cru à un car - jacking . "
Il s'agit en fait de policiers en civil .
Eberluée , elle ne se souvient que de ces mots : " Terroriste ! Terroriste ! "
Menottée , elle est embarquée dans une autre voiture , tandis que Benjamin Rosoux est planté sur le trottoir , et emmenée à son propre domicile où a lieu une perquisition .
Sur place , la police saisit ses ordinateurs et deux piles de L'insurrection qui vient .
Ce livre collectif et anonyme , en vente libre , est perçu par la police , qui l'attribue à Julien Coupat , comme la doctrine du groupe .
Il a été versé , dans son intégralité , au dossier d'instruction et vaudra d'ailleurs à son éditeur , Eric Hazan , d'être entendu le 9 avril par la police antiterroriste .
Dans le coffre de la voiture de Tessa Polak , la SDAT en découvre 400 autres exemplaires .
" Ils ont fait ' Bingo !' , comme s'ils avaient découvert une cache d'armes , ironise - t - elle .
Sauf que quand ils m'ont demandé d'où ça venait , je leur ai dit que j'étais passée chez l'éditeur et que je comptais les distribuer dans le cadre du comité de soutien , ce qu'ils savaient déjà . "
Tout au long de sa garde à vue , et des " 8 à 10 interrogatoires " , la jeune femme comprend qu'elle a fait l'objet d'une surveillance .
Aux policiers qui lui demandent pourquoi elle a prêté son véhicule , en novembre 2008 , à trois des mis en examen , dont Benjamin Rosoux , elle répond : " Ma voiture je l'ai prêtée comme ma maison est ouverte , mon frigo est ouvert … "
" Ce qui m'a étonnée , poursuit Tessa Polak , c'est que leurs investigations portaient beaucoup sur le livre .
Le type de questions qu'ils m'ont posé , la manière avec laquelle ils le faisaient , c'était pour valider leurs fantasmes .
Le mot ' cellule ' revenait sans cesse … "
Après 48 heures , elle est brièvement présentée au juge d'instruction Thierry Fragnoli pour une prolongation de sa garde à vue .
Tessa Polak jure alors l'avoir entendu dire :
" Ce n'est pas ma faute mais vous allez payer pour les autres . "
" J'étais sonnée " , dit -elle .
Avec le recul , la jeune femme analyse son interpellation comme une " manœuvre d'intimidation , une façon de briser les solidarités actives , d'envoyer des signaux , et de banaliser les garde à vue " .
" Sinon , ajoute - t - elle , pourquoi m'ont - ils convoquée de cette façon ?
Quand je leur ai demandé , ils ne m'ont pas répondu . "
Après cette interpellation , et celle de plusieurs étudiants , soupçonnés d'avoir participé à une manifestation non autorisée en faveur , notamment , de Julien Coupat , dernier des mis en examen à être toujours incarcéré , les comités de soutien – il en existerait une cinquantaine en France – , se sentent sous pression .
" Il y a une demande très pressante de “ guides ” de garde à vue " , ironise Frédéric Combarieu , membre du comité parisien .
Alors que le juge des libertés et de la détention doit une nouvelle fois statuer sur la demande de remise en liberté de Julien Coupat , ce dernier lassé des fouilles et de cette " farce " , a demandé à ne pas être extrait de sa cellule pour l'occasion .
Pour les mêmes raisons , le comité de soutien ne se rassemblera pas non plus ce jour - là .
Mais plusieurs initiatives en mai , des concerts notamment , sont à l'ordre du jour

Classic golf movies : “ Caddyshack , ” “ Tin Cup , ” “ Happy Gilmore . ” O.K. , that ’s a short list and you may quibble about “ Happy Gilmore , ” but have you ever wondered whether Happy ’s ice hockey - inspired swing technique would work ?
Admit it , you ’ve tried it once or twice with your buddies .
But face it , your swing is no way to judge if it can be done .
Now , what if Happy ’s running start golf swing method , which is not against golf ’s rules , was tried by one of the world ’s best players ?
The folks on FSN’s “ Sport Science ” show , which airs Sunday nights , recently got Padraig Harrington to give it a try .
Harrington has attempted the Happy Gilmore swing before , using it as a way to break the monotony on the practice tee .
So for “ Sport Science , ” Harrington had no qualms about taking some hearty whacks at the ball .
It was funny , impressive and informative at the same time .
It turned out that Harrington generated about 7 miles per hour more club head speed with his driver doing it Happy ’s way , and he increased his usual drive of 296 yards by about 30 yards .
So it does work .
Although it took some clearly superior swing dynamics and athleticism by Harrington to run a few steps and still get his arms and torso into the same coiled and balanced backswing position as his normal swing .
And he said his experience playing hurling in his native Ireland , a sport that requires hitting a ball with a stick on the run , helped him .
In the end , Harrington said he would not be remaking his swing .
He also did n’t think it would be worth it for the accuracy he might lose .
Last January 30 , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz disclosed a secret Israeli government database on settlements in the occupied West Bank , and posted the Hebrew text ( pdf ) of the database on their website .
Last month , the ODNI Open Source Center completed an English translation of the 200 - page document .
Secrecy News obtained a copy of the translation ( pdf ) which we are publishing today .
The database provides a concise description of each of the dozens of settlements , including their location , legal status , population , and even the origins of their names , which are often Biblically - inspired .
Crucially , the database makes clear that unauthorized and illegal construction activity has taken place in most of the settlements .
“ An analysis of the data reveals that , in the vast majority of the settlements – about 75 percent – construction , sometimes on a large scale , has been carried out without the appropriate permits or contrary to the permits that were issued , ” according to the Haaretz account .
“ The database also shows that , in more than 30 settlements , extensive construction of buildings and infrastructure ( roads , schools , synagogues , yeshivas and even police stations ) has been carried out on private lands belonging to Palestinian West Bank residents . ”
A copy of the database had been requested by Israeli citizens groups under that country ’s freedom of information law , but release was denied by the Defense Ministry .
Haaretz obtained a copy independently and , notwithstanding Israel ’s military censorship apparatus , proceeded to publish it .
See “ Secret Israeli Database Reveals Full Extent of Illegal Settlement ” by Uri Blau , Haaretz , February 1 , 2009 .
The English translation of the settlement database prepared by the ODNI Open Source Center is now available here .
A copy of the Hebrew original is here .
The leaders of the Labour Party have reached a fascinating stage , where they hate each other but do n't know why , and are n't allowed to criticise each other , and if they do they have to assure everyone that : " When I said he 's arsed everything up like the steaming Scottish cowpat he is , this was in no sense meant as a criticism , but as a contribution to the wider debate of how we move Britain forward with the forwardness the British people look forward to . "
And this is while they look so hopeless you can imagine a researcher running to Gordon Brown and saying " There 's excellent news on the public reaction to our health message .
We 're now only 3 per cent behind swine flu in the polls . "
If a Labour leader 's marriage is falling apart , he must say to his wife : " I continue to have every confidence in you as the right person to lead us through the challenges ahead .
Furthermore , the Philippino hooker you caught me with in the shower has no ambitions to replace you , and is delighted to remain in her current post for the foreseeable future . "

They 're almost heartbreakingly clueless as to why they 're in trouble .
Hazel Blears described the problem as the need for politicians to " re-engage " with voters , as if they just have to find new ways of getting their message across .
But that 's the thinking that led to the genius of Brown on You - Tube .
You can imagine cabinet meetings where Ed Balls calls out : " I know , let 's get Harriet Harman to go on Britain 's Got Talent , and perform the figures on reduced NHS waiting lists expressed as a piece of hip - hop dance . "
Labour 's problem is that people ARE engaged with them , and they 've decided they do n't like them , because their message HAS come across .
The cabinet can't honestly think : " People WOULD vote for us , if only they were aware that we sent the country into war on a pack of lies , insisted there was no more boom or bust , fiddled second homes and let bankers rob the place . "
Part of their difficulty can be found in the nature of their arguments .
They can't describe clearly the reasons they disagree , because they do n't actually believe in anything .
In the lamented Old Labour Party , leaders disagreed about nuclear weapons or nationalisation , but New Labour arguments are about petty personal squabbles as if they 're teenage girls .
These articles in Sunday newspapers should go : " Asked for his opinion of the current cabinet , one senior minister said ' Alistair Darling !
Like , get real .
Fiscal this , fiscal that , dur dur .
I 'm like SO going to get his job off his sorry grey ass ' . "
Inspired by Blair , they think everything revolves around presentation while the reality does n't matter .
It 's as if a builder had a discussion with you that went : " I have to accept that the bond between us has been fractured in these difficult times , which is why I 'd like this opportunity to reflect on the many positive aspects of our work . "
" You blew up my house . "
" Yes , and this was an unpopular policy , and I recognise it as such .
But I 'm sure that when the time comes , you 'll decide that I am the builder best qualified to lead you out of the rubble . "
Even on the fiasco of trying to stop Gurkhas having the right to settle here , the criticism from Hazel Blears was that it came over badly , and the cabinet will probably conclude it 's worth two points in the polls to always do the same as Joanna Lumley .
Now , for a laugh , Joanna Lumley should make an announcement every week such as " I think there should be more yellow insects " , and within half an hour the Home Office would have workmen in every borough spraying ant - hills with custard .
But not one of these Labour leaders has made the obvious point by saying : " What the hell were we doing denying soldiers who'd fought for Britain the right to live here , to the extent that we 've managed to make ourselves open to attack as too heartless on immigration by the bloody Tories – aaaaaaaaaaagh !!!!! "
If the current cabinet was asked for its criticisms of the Third Reich , they 'd say : " The invasion of Russia should have been presented as part of a wider package of reforms , and the dislocation this mishandled opportunity created between the Government and its core support reversed the popularity it had gained in middle - class Europe following its strategy of firm but necessary labour laws . "
So there 's no point in a leadership election at all .
As all the candidates could sum up their position as : " Under me , the party will be taken in a new direction , in which we do exactly the same shit but excuse it with more plausible lies . "
What follows below is a letter I sent to AG Eric Holder last week , on behalf of VelvetRevolution .us ( of which The BRAD BLOG is a co-founder ) , calling for his immediate investigation of all political prosecutions at the DoJ during the Bush era , including those of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman and Mississippi attorney / Democratic fundraiser Paul Minor .
On the heels of the DoJ 's dismissal of charges against Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens , the DoJ needs to similarly vacate charges against anyone who was specifically targeted , for political reasons , by the Bush Admin 's perversion of justice at the DoJ .
There are now well over 700 organizations and individuals , such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Ray McGovern and Scott Horton currently signed on to the letter , and you are invited to do so yourself via the campaign 's main page at RestoreJusticeAtJustice.com .
More details are over there .
We hope you 'll both sign on , and help spread the word .
Here is the letter to Holder , sent last week just before Minor 's wife passed away , and prior to the release of the Bush regime 's appalling torture memos which we will , no doubt , be dealing with in a future campaign ...
Attorney General Eric HolderDepartment of JusticeWashington , DC 20530
April 13 , 2009
Dear Attorney General Holder :
Thank you for taking the necessary steps to vacate the conviction of Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by federal prosecutors .
We now ask that you quickly do the same for all Bush - era politically motivated cases , starting with Don Siegelman and Paul Minor .
Such action is necessary to restore public confidence in the rule of law and the Department of Justice ( “ DOJ ” ) , and to rectify a vast and manifest injustice .
You must act soon , because the victims of such prosecutions are now suffering — some of them cruelly .
It is unacceptable that any one of them should have to endure imprisonment , financial ruin , and even loss of family while courts ponder whether trial error occurred .
It is well established that the previous DOJ was controlled by partisans who misused their authority by targeting Democrats and others with viewpoints different from their own .
As a result , people have been variously wronged , either by ( 1 ) rejection for employment at DOJ , ( 2 ) dismissal from positions there , or ( 3 ) trumped - up and / or partisan - targeted criminal prosecution .
Under your leadership , the DOJ has moved toward ending such abuse .
With your investigations of the hiring practices at DOJ and the US Attorney firings , you have begun to take concrete steps to deal with Points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
As to Point ( 3 ) , however , not enough has been done .
Other than early , still - cursory DOJ investigations of problems with the prosecution of Don Siegelman and Paul Minor , your office has announced no action or intention to redress well - documented instances of selective criminal prosecutions carried out by the Bush administration .
A preponderance of evidence makes clear that zealous partisans in both the Bush White House and DOJ used their positions to protect and / or empower pro-Bush Republicans , while targeting those who disagreed — primarily Democrats — as enemies .
Certain politicians , such as Gov. Siegelman , were targeted for threatening hoped - for GOP electoral gains , while certain jurists and attorneys , such as Oliver Diaz and Paul Minor , were punished for obstructing the intentions of the party 's allies in big business .
As Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Brendan DeMelle recently reported in an article urging the release of Paul Minor , a study by University of Missouri Professors Donald Shields and John Cragan shows that " eighty percent of the Bush DOJ 's political investigations targeted Democrats --- 5.6 Democrats for every Republican investigated by U.S. Attorneys for political misconduct .
Shields noted in Congressional testimony that ‘ such selective investigation and prosecution rates ’ represent a clear bias in the severely disproportionate ‘ political profiling ’ of Democrats under Bush . ”
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld most charges against Gov. Siegelman , with everyone involved deliberately ignoring the huge elephant in that courtroom — i.e. , that post - trial revelations , deemed inadmissible by the appellate judges , pointed to profound political corruption as well as prosecutorial abuse .
The governor should not have to wait months or years for a court to address these issues when you have the authority to do so at once .
And then there is Paul Minor , an attorney now in federal prison for a “ crime ” related to the funding of Democratic candidates and causes .
Minor ’s wife is dying of cancer in a hospital in Baton Rouge .
Last month , he was given a three - hour pass to spend a moment with her ( under supervision ) , but she had no chance to talk to him because she had been given her pain medication and lay fast asleep throughout his visit .
Why should this man have to spend another hour away from his wife ’s bedside , awaiting the decision of a court , when the flagrant partisan intent behind his prosecution should move the DOJ to withdraw charges , just as you did in Sen. Stevens ' case ? **
Selective prosecution for political advantage is a prosecutorial abuse at least as troubling as the wrongs in Sen. Stevens ' case and , arguably , far more dangerous .
We therefore ask that you immediately order the dismissal of charges against Don Siegelman and Paul Minor , and move quickly to investigate and identify other cases mounted by the Bush Administration for political advantage and , where appropriate , vacate them immediately .
Only through such righteous action , which is wholly in your power , can we be sure that justice will , at last , be done , and that America 's courts may once again deserve the public 's confidence .
Sincerely ,
Brad Friedman
Co-Founder , VelvetRevolution.us

Russians to be deliberately infected with swine flu
The Flu Research Institute in St. Petersburg began to recruit volunteers to be artificially infected with the swine flu virus which is currently raging in Mexico and the USA .
Russians to be deliberately infected with swine flu
Doctors will select six test groups of 20 people .
Each volunteer will receive a benefit of 5,000 rubles ( $ 150 ) .
“ The same practice was applied while developing the bird flu vaccine , ” scientists from the Institute say .
Several days ago , Russian microbiologists joined their efforts in the fight against the contagion .
The H1N1 strains were transported to Russian laboratories from Mexico on a special flight .
Now experts must develop the vaccine against the deadly disease as soon as possible and test it on humans .
Now the Institute has already begun the strictest selection of volunteers ready to test a new medicine based on the cells of the swine flu virus itself .
“ The remedy will be made on the basis of a ‘ natural vaccine ’ , namely the cells of the virus H1N1 itself , - Anna Saminina says .
–
They will be weakened to the degree when they can’t cause overall pathogenic reactions in a human body .
But they will help the organism develop matching antibodies .
We employed this practice fighting against bird flu .
At that time , we selected a group of volunteers as well that tested the vaccine on themselves .
Everything went off well .
We hope now it will be good too ” .
Despite the fact that doctors have taken a special sanitary control of all charter flights from the USA and Mexico in all Russian airports , scientists doubt that Russia can avoid swine flu .
The first outbreak of the epidemic will hit not only Moscow , but also large regional traffic centers .
“ The World Health Organization announced that up to seven million of people may die of this contagion , - a sanitary official in Novosibirsk Andrey Fedyanin says .
–
All passengers arriving from Mexico are examined for flu symptoms .
Unfortunately , it cannot stop the virus .
An infected individual may have no fever during the first week ” .
Research into epigenetics has shown that environmental factors affect characteristics of organisms .
These changes are sometimes passed on to the offspring .
ETH professor Renato Paro does not believe that this opposes Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
A certain laboratory strain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has white eyes .
If the surrounding temperature of the embryos , which are normally nurtured at 25 degrees Celsius , is briefly raised to 37 degrees Celsius , the flies later hatch with red eyes .
If these flies are again crossed , the following generations are partly red-eyed – without further temperature treatment – even though only white - eyed flies are expected according to the rules of genetics .
Environment affects inheritance
Researchers in a group led by Renato Paro , professor for Biosystems at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering ( D - BSSE ) , crossed the flies for six generations .
In this experiment , they were able to prove that the temperature treatment changes the eye colour of this specific strain of fly , and that the treated individual flies pass on the change to their offspring over several generations .
However , the DNA sequence for the gene responsible for eye colour was proven to remain the same for white - eyed parents and red-eyed offspring .
The concept of epigenetics offers an explanation for this result .
Epigenetics examines the inheritance of characteristics that are not set out in the DNA sequence .
For Paro , epigenetic mechanisms form an additional , paramount level of information to the genetic information of DNA .
Such phenomena could only be examined in a descriptive manner in the past .
Today , it has been scientifically proven , which molecular structures are involved : important factors are the histones , a kind of packaging material for the DNA , in order to store DNA in an ordered and space - saving way .
It is now clear that these proteins have additional roles to play .
Depending on the chemical group they carry , if they are acetylated or methylated , they permanently activate or deactivate genes .
New methods now allow researchers to sometimes directly show which genes have been activated or deactivated by the histones .

Cells have a memory
Epigenetic marks , such as the modifications of the histones , are also important for the specialisation of the body ’s cells .
They are preserved during cell division and are passed on to the daughter cells .
If skin cells divide , more skin cells are created ; liver cells form liver cells .
In both cell types , all genes are deactivated except the ones needed by a skin or liver cell to be a skin or liver cell , and to function appropriately .
The genetic information of the DNA is passed on along with the relevant epigenetic information for the respective cell type .
Paro ’s group is researching this cell memory .
It is still unclear how the epigenetic markers are passed on to the daughter cells .
During cell division , the DNA is doubled , which requires the histones – as the current picture suggests – to break apart .
The question is therefore how cellular memory encoded by epigenetic mechanisms survives cell division .
Emerging area of research
A similar question remains for the inheritance of the epigenetic characteristics from parents to offspring .
They now know that when the gametes are formed , certain epigenetic markers remain and are passed on to the offspring .
The questions , which are currently being researched , are how much and which part of the epigenetic information is preserved and subsequently inherited .
The research is also looking at the influence of various substances from the environment on the epigenetic constitution of organisms , including humans .
Diet and epigenetics appear to be closely linked .
The most well known example is that of the Agouti mice : they are yellow , fat and are prone to diabetes and cancer .
If Agouti females are fed with a cocktail of vitamin B12 , folic acid and cholin , directly prior to and during pregnancy , they give birth to mainly brown , slim and healthy offspring .
They in turn mainly have offspring similar to themselves .
Contradiction to Darwin ?
Environmental factors , which change the characteristics of an individual and are then passed on to its offspring , do not really fit into Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
According to his theory , evolution is the result of the population and not the single individual .
“ Passing on the gained characteristics fits more to Lamarck ’s theory of evolution ” , says Paro .
However , he still does not believe Darwin ’s theory of evolution is put into question by the evidence of epigenetics research .
“ Darwin was 100 percent right ” , Paro emphasises .
For him , epigenetics complement Darwin ’s theory .
In his view , new characteristics are generated and passed on via epigenetics , subject to the same mechanisms of evolution as those with a purely genetic origin .
A four - month old female joey , one of Nature ’s most bizarre - looking creatures , is being kept alive at the Assiniboine Park Zoo these days .
The baby Red Kangaroo , which was named Rooby , weighs only 560 grams and was found lying helpless on the floor of the enclosure after being ejected from the pouch of one of the adult females .
It ’s very rare for baby kangaroos to survive out of the pouch at this early age , since they are dependent on their mother ’s milk inside the pouch for up to a year .
The Zoo says feeding the baby milk formula every three hours improves the chances of survival .
Like most baby animals , she spends a lot of the time sleeping soundly .
The first weeks are very critical for her survival , but if the youngster makes it through , she will need zookeeper care for another eight months .
Once this female Red Kangaroo grows up , it can expect to be about 30 kg .
Males are generally bigger , standing up to 2.1 metres ( 7 feet ) high and reaching 95 kg ( 210 lbs ) — a 135,715 - fold increase in body weight from birth .
The life expectancy of the species may be up to 25 years and makes a fascinating zoo exhibit due to its unusual appearance and bounding gait on its powerful hind legs .
Surprisingly , the species is blind at birth .
Due to its delicate health , the baby kangaroo is not available for public viewing .

Media companies have had a hard time getting consumers to pay for content online , but Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. is attempting to leverage its worldwide news - gathering operation to get them to do just that .
In one of the most ambitious online undertakings by a media outfit , News Corp. has assembled a team of executives to devise a system to charge for content on the Web .
Fanned out across New York , London and Sydney , the global team includes Murdoch himself , his son , James , longtime News Corp. executive and Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton and Jonathan Miller , the former AOL boss who now oversees all of News Corp . ’s digital operations .
The team is said to be looking at creating a user - friendly device akin to Amazon ’s Kindle to deliver content from such News Corp. newspapers as The Wall Street Journal , The Times of London and The New York Post , as well as content from the company ’s television and movie units .
The move comes against the backdrop of a newspaper climate ravaged by reader and advertiser flight to the Web .
In the last year , newspapers in Seattle and Denver have either shut down or moved entirely to the Web , while the owners of papers in Boston and San Francisco have threatened to cease publishing .
Others , like the Star Tribune in Minneapolis and the Tribune Co. , owners of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune , have been forced to file for bankruptcy .
For Murdoch , the move is also a clear break from the notion that content , particularly news content , can be offered online for free and monetized solely through advertising .
Upon acquiring the Journal two years ago , Murdoch contemplated making that paper ’s Web site free .
He reversed his position after realizing that once he eliminated the revenue stream generated by online subscriptions to the Journal , he ’d never be able to get it back .

The ailing economy continues to pull more Americans into bankruptcy court , where the number of troubled consumers filing for protection soared in March to its highest level since October 2005 , when a new law made it more arduous and expensive to file .
And as job losses continue to climb , they may well drag bankruptcy filings along with them .
An average of 5,945 bankruptcy petitions were filed each day in March , up 9 percent from February and up 38 percent compared with a year earlier , according to Mike Bickford , president of Automated Access to Court Electronic Records , a bankruptcy data and management company .
In all , 130,793 people filed for bankruptcy in March .
The weak economy and its repercussions — rising unemployment , lower pay , fewer people with health insurance , and the mortgage and foreclosure crises — are all playing a role in the big increase in bankruptcies .
And some of the most common factors that tend to lead to bankruptcy filings — divorce and disruptive health problems — have not gone away .
But the biggest factor in the current spate of filings may be the tightening of credit .
“ We have a lot of people out of work , but that alone is not driving the spike in bankruptcy filings , ” said Robert M. Lawless , a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law .
“ Along with job loss is the tightening of consumer credit .
Compared to 18 months ago , the American consumer does not have the same ability to borrow in an attempt to stave off the day of reckoning .
With no income and no credit , it is not surprising that the middle class is looking to the bankruptcy courts for relief . ”
Does postpartum depression serve some evolutionary purpose ?
— Clint Johnson , Ridgecrest , Calif .
Anthropologist Edward H. Hagen of Washington State University replies :
Postpartum depression ( PPD ) , which af­flicts 10 to 15 percent of new mothers , may have evolved as a strategic response to a lack of social support because it helped in passing on genes successfully .
Many doc­tors believe PPD is triggered by the changes in a mother ’s hormones after giving birth , yet studies have failed to find much evi­dence for a link between extreme hormone fluctuations and PPD .
The fact that fathers , who do not experi­ence such changes , also suffer from PPD is strong evidence that it is not “ just hormones . ”
The finding that PPD often plagues people who have marital problems or little outside support led biologists Randy Thornhill and F. Bryant Furlow of the University of New Mexico and me independently to propose that PPD has an evolved function .
Many animals improve their chances of passing on their genes if they desert their young when food or parenting help is scarce and invest instead in future offspring that are more likely to survive and reproduce .
This “ parental investment theory ” should apply especially well to humans .
Human children are “ expensive ” to raise , requiring years of parenting before they can survive on their own .
When a mother lacks support from the father or other family members , she may unconsciously conclude she cannot successfully raise her infant .
The ensuing emotional pain from PPD operates somewhat like physical pain : stop what you ’re doing — it ’s harming your reproductive fitness !
Studies confirm that mothers with PPD do significantly reduce parenting efforts and often have thoughts of harming their baby .
This “ psychic pain hypothesis ” cannot explain the whole story , however , because few parents suffering from PPD abandon their newborn .
I propose an additional function of PPD that is like a labor strike , in which a mother ’s reduced interest in her baby may serve to elicit help from others .
Studies do suggest that higher levels of PPD symptoms in mothers motivate more child care by fathers , and increased social support is one of the best predictors for the remission of PPD .
These hypothesized functions for PPD are far from proved .
If you or a loved one is suffering from PPD , contact a doctor immediately — treatments , including antidepressants and talk therapy , are available and effective .

Britain has just two words for controversial California radio talk - show host Michael Savage :
Keep out .
The San Francisco - based Savage , known for his fiery right - wing views , is one of 22 people who have been banned from entering Britain since October , when the government here concluded that they were agents of extremism and intolerance .
Officials Tuesday publicly identified most of the people on the blacklist , in keeping with the national penchant for “ naming and shaming ” anyone guilty of a crime , a gross injustice or an outbreak of really bad manners .

Among those for whom Britain has pulled up the welcome mat are radical Islamist preachers , a Jewish extremist , a pair of Russian gangsters and at least five Americans : Savage , who has attacked the Koran as a “ book of hate ” ; two white supremacist leaders ; and a father - daughter team that travels up and down the U.S. vilifying gay people , sometimes with placards using an epithet for gays and proclaiming that God hates homosexuals .
Jacqui Smith , Britain ’s home secretary , said she made the decision to publish 16 of the names because potential visitors ought to be aware of what British society considers acceptable behavior .
Six of the barred individuals were kept anonymous , probably for intelligence reasons .
“ It ’s important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here , the fact that it ’s a privilege to come and the sort of things that mean you wo n’t be welcome in this country , ” Smith told a television interviewer .

Savage told the Internet site WorldNetDaily that he was considering legal action against Britain .
“ Darn !
And I was just planning a trip to England for their superior dental work and cuisine , ” he joked to the website .
“ Then it sank in , and I said , ‘ She said this is the kind of behavior we wo n’t tolerate ?
She ’s linking me with mass murderers who are in prison for killing Jewish children on buses ?
For my speech ?
The country where the Magna Carta was created ? ’ ”
The government ’s descriptions of the 22 barred “ hate promoters ” provide almost no details of their religious or ideological backgrounds , or of the targets of their hatred .
The published blacklist merely alleges , in bureaucratese , that one man glorified terrorist activity “ in furtherance of particular beliefs ” or , in Savage ’s case , engaged in “ unacceptable behavior ” that could “ lead to inter- community violence . ”
Among those named were Yunis al - Astal , a radical anti-Western Islamic cleric and Hamas member in the Gaza Strip ; Mike Guzovsky , an Israeli Jewish extremist said to be involved in militant training camps ; and Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky , Russian skinheads who , as teenagers , boasted two years ago of killing about 20 members of ethnic minorities .

Besides Savage , the list identified Americans Stephen Donald Black and Eric Gliebe , both of whom openly espouse white supremacist views , and Baptist preacher Fred Phelps of Topeka , Kan. , and his daughter , Shirley Phelps - Roper , who call for divine wrath to be visited on gays and lesbians .

Upon her return to Australia , Cr Ban , then a 23 - year - old lawyer , gained international notoriety when she authored a book titled God Made Me Small , Surgery Made Me Tall under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen .
She outed herself as the real author this morning .
Cr Ban , who claims to be a barrister but is not listed with the Bar Association of Queensland , dismissed criticism her decision to undergo the surgery sent a bad message about body image .
" This is purely a personal matter .
I do n't know what all the fuss is about .
I just want this ( media attention ) to go away , " Cr Ban told brisbanetimes.com .au this morning .
" I work so hard for my community .
Why is n't that noticed ?
" Media are camping outside my mother 's house so I 'm just in hiding at the moment .
" Most people do n't discuss their personal medical issues , and I would n't either but for the fact that it was discovered that I was ( Sara Vornamen ) .
" I do n't pay attention too much to what people say about me on a personal level at all .
I 've been elected to represent the community , so I am prepared to accept criticism about what I do in my role as a councillor .
But when it comes to personal matters like this , just as much as I do n't cast judgement on people , I do n't like people to do that as well . "
However , she admitted she would have not considered surgery if she had been in public office at the time .
" A politician 's job is to represent the community to which they have been elected .
I have a very clear line of what my role is and what is of a public nature and what is of a private nature .
" I had this operation prior to getting into local government .
I had no inkling at the time that I would get into council . "
Born in Israel , Cr Ban has been a councillor since 2004 , first with Beaudesert and now Logan .
She lost a bid for the federal seat of Forde for the Nationals in the 2007 election .
" The way I was eight years ago , is very different to the way I am now .
With age , I have become more comfortable in my own skin , " Ms Ban said .
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh attracted similar attention after she admitted to having botox injections , although Cr Ban said that , too , was no one else 's business .
" Just because we 're in the public eye , it does n't mean that we 're less entitled to a private life , " she said .
" I am comfortable in my skin .
I 'm far more happy with who I am today than I was 10 years ago , because there is so much pressure , particularly on young girls , to be a certain way and feel a certain way .
I think with age you mellow and become comfortable . "

Palm 's upcoming
Pre handset is again making headlines this week after it was discovered that early production units contain native support for syncing with Apple 's iTunes software as if they were built by the iPhone maker itself .
Fortune notes that this is n't an entirely new revelation , given that it was mentioned back in January during the Consumer Electronics
Show , but only recently has the tech media really clamped down on the matter .
" Plug a Pre into a Mac and it syncs , seamlessly , with Appleâs iTunes , " the financial publication reports .
" In fact , the iTunes Store treats the Pre just as it would an iPod or an iPhone with one exception : it canât handle old copy - protected songs . "
While there have been a handful of third party hacks that allow iTunes to recognize some of Palm 's existing handsets , the Pre is believed to have such code built natively into its firmware .
At issue is how Palm may be achieving this particular result and whether Apple will condone encroachment on its tightly controlled ecosystem by one of its rivals .
The development of the Pre , due to launch just days before the iPhone maker is expected to take the wraps off its latest line of handsets , has been spearheaded by a number of former Apple employees who are privy to the underpinnings of the company 's technology .
Among them is Palm president Jon Rubinstein , who spent years overseeing the development of iPods over in Cupertino .
Many industry watchers believe the Pre represents the greatest threat to the iPhone yet .
It features similar touch - screen technology and an attractive new webOS that appears to take several design cues from Apple 's iPhone software with some added bells and whistles to boot .
During a recent conference call , acting Apple chief executive Tim Cook vowed to vigorously defend against any competitor who treads on his company 's intellectual property , but stopped short of calling out Palm by name .
The Netbook computer has made quite a splash in a computer world driven by smaller , lighter , stronger , faster , and easier .
Netbooks are the latest version of the portable computer .
Similar to laptop computers in many ways except that Netbook computers are smaller , lighter , less expensive and less powerful .
They are great for portability but less functional for computing intensive tasks .
This Netbook Computer Primer examines just what a Netbook computer is and explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of this new breed of portable computer .
What is a Netbook Computer ?
Let ’s start at the beginning .
Based on current technology a Netbook computer is an ultraportable computer :
typically weighing 2.5 pounds having a screen size between 7 ” and 10 ” including a wireless networking adapter ( g/n ) having no internal optical ( CD or DVD ) drive typically running Windows XP
Home utilizing a lower powered CPU such as the Intel Atom CPU .
Netbook computers are designed for less computing intensive tasks such as receiving and sending email and accessing the Internet .
Netbooks are basic computing devices that are suited for basic computing tasks .
Leading manufacturers include Acer , Asus , Dell , HP , Lenovo , MSI and Toshiba .
The Net book computer has captured many people ’s interest for two main reasons – size and price .
Based on size and weight a Netbook fits somewhere in between the smartphone and the laptop computer .
Key factors that differentiate a Netbook computer from other portable computers are :
Size —
Most Netbook computers have a screen size between 7 ” and 10 ” measured diagonally .
They are larger than a smartphone , which have screens not much bigger than 3 ” diagonally , and smaller than a laptop computer which range between 12 ” and 17 ” .
Price – Netbook computer prices range from $ 250 to $ 800 with an average price in the $ 350 range .
This price can increase if you add an external CD / DVD drive or a larger , extended life battery .
Most Netbooks come with 1GB of RAM .
Upgrading to 2GB if needed will also add to the cost .
Weight –
The other aspect of a Netbook computer being “ smaller ” is weight .
Most Netbooks weigh in at around 2.5 pounds .
A smaller screen means a lighter screen and a smaller and lighter battery to power the smaller screen .
The weight of most Netbooks falls in the 2 – 3 pounds range however adding a larger , extended life battery can add as much as half a pound to the overall weight .
CPU or Computing Power – Most Net book computers use a CPU from the Intel Atom CPU line .
These “ brains ” are less powerful than the Intel P4 , Core , or Core 2 CPUs or the AMD CPUs that are in most laptop computers .
While these CPUs provide less computing power they also require much less electrical power resulting in smaller , lighter weight batteries and cooler running Netbooks .
UPDATE : Intel released its latest versions of the Atom CPU in early 2010 .
Be sure to check out the post on “ New Intel Processor for Netbook Computers ”
Optical Storage ( CD / DVD ) – Internal CD or DVD drives are not included in a netbook computer .
External drives can be connected through USB ports for loading software or transferring data to another computer .
External optical drives are not included in the base cost of most Netbook computers .
Mass Storage ( hard disk drive ) – Netbooks offer either a traditional hard disk drive ( HDD ) that have a capacity between 60 GB and 160 GB , or lower capacity solid state drives ( SSD ) with capacities ranging from 16 GB to 64 GB of flash memory .
Potential Drawbacks with A Netbook Computer
Size , weight and price provide some real benefits with Netbook computers .
There are also a number of trade - offs with the reduced size and weight .
Keyboard size —
A Netbook computer ’s keyboard is usually about 85 to 95 percent of a full - size QWERTY keyboard .
The layout and arrangement of the keys can also vary .
Netbooks that have 10 - inch screens tend to offer the larger keyboards .
Well worth a test drive to determine if the smaller keyboard is a good fit for you .
Computing power –
As explained earlier a Netbook computer is not designed for computing intensive tasks such as editing videos or large photos or playing modern video games .
Loading programs and saving documents may also be a bit slower than a laptop .
Expandability and Ports – Some netbook computer models may have only two USB ports and may lack a PC - Card slot .
Limited hard disk storage – Some models offer only a 16GB or 32 GB solid state drive .
After the space required for Windows and your program files these smaller capacity drives may not leave sufficient space for all your other files in the long term .
Especially if you are considering copying your 30 GB music and photo library onto the computer .
No internal optical drive – as noted above Netbook computers do not have internal CD or DVD drives by definition .
It is relatively easy to connect an external drive via USB but it will cost extra .
Battery life –
These rating can vary significantly , ranging from 2.5 hours to over 8 hours depending on the model .
Many netbook computer manufacturers also offer an extended life battery as an extra cost option .
RAM – Most Netbooks come with 1GB of RAM and can accept a maximum of 2GB .
The higher amount will provide better performance but is an added cost .
Mouse buttons and touchpad –
The smaller amount of keyboard real estate can also impact the mouse buttons and the touchpad .
As with laptops the configuration of these important elements can vary .
Another area where a test drive will be beneficial .
Netbook computers provide some very interesting options .
As the technology continues to evolve in this hot product area the capabilities are only going to get better and some of the trade offs , such as performance , may decrease significantly .
The popularity of Netbooks is also putting additional pressure the price and performance of conventional , fully sized ultralight laptops .
The distinctions between these two categories will probably continue to blur .
Be sure to check out “ Laptops – Netbooks – 8 Key Differences ” for more insights on how these two types of portable computers compare .
For students and parents looking for a portable computer for school be sure to see the post on 7 Reasons Netbook Computers are Great for Students
For many people the main decision point between a Netbook computer and a laptop will be size and weight .
If you are looking for a very small footprint , very lightweight basic computing device you should seriously consider one these .
If you will need more computing power ( bigger applications or having many applications open at once ) , an internal CD / DVD drive , a big , fast hard disk drive , or lots of ports , the laptop will probably be the better option .
Hard to Beat the Price of a Net book Computer
Netbook computers are a relatively new market and in a significant state of flux .
In an era of high performance quad - core CPUs and terabyte hard disk drives many people have been surprised by the popularity of these relatively low horsepower devices .
A key factor that makes a Netbook computer so interesting is their low price .
At $ 350 they almost become a throw away device – keep it for 18 to 24 months and dispose of it .
At a time where you can spend $ 500 on a Smartphone not including the significant costs of the monthly service contract , a Netbook computer looks like quite a bargain .

In a much - anticipated statement today , Barack Obama announced what is largely a public relations end - run by the health care industry , designed to trim a few scraps off of the nation ’s porcine health care budget , while preserving its basic system of medicine for profit .
In a letter to Obama that was released over the weekend , executives from the Advanced Medical Technology Association ( the medical device manufacturers lobbying group ) , the American Hospital Association , the American Medical Association , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , as well as the Service Employees International Union , pledged to “ do our part ” to reduce health care costs .
Their vague , pie - in - the sky promise amounts to just a 1.5 percent reduction in the growth rate of health care spending .
Such is the explosion in health care costs that even this miniscule reduction represents a potential $ 2 trillion saving over 10 years .
But there ’s no guarantee this figure will be achieved .
As the Washington Post points out :
The groups did not spell out yesterday how they plan to reach such a target , and …they offer only a broad pledge , not an outright commitment … .
In addition , White House officials said , there is no mechanism to ensure that the groups live up to their offer , only the implicit threat of public embarrassment .
“ Public embarrassment ” ?
From Big Pharma and the health insurance companies– - two of the most shameless industries in the history of corporate capitalism ?
In any case , even if the $ 2 trillion reduction is achieved , it clearly wo n’t come out of industry profits .
The Post reports :
Signers of the letter said that large amounts could be saved by aggressive efforts to prevent obesity , coordinate care , manage chronic illnesses and curtail unnecessary tests and procedures ; by standardizing insurance claim forms ; and by increasing the use of information technology , like electronic medical records .
So let ’s get this straight : Saving all this money depends on getting Americans to eat less ?
Good luck with that one .
And the other brilliant cost - saving measures involve getting doctors to create computer records of all the overpriced drugs they prescribe , and giving patients easier forms to fill out before they get turned down six times by their private insurance companies ?
Do you see a pattern here ?
None of these changes would make a dent in the industry ’s bottom line–and what ’s more , they could even enhance profits , by encouraging government - funded programs to help private companies streamline their bloated bureaucracy ( much of which would instantly become superfluous under a public , single - payer system ) .
The letter to Obama suggested this when it said : “ We are committed to taking action in private - public partnership to create a more stable and sustainable health care system . ”
We all know by now that “ private - public partnership ” usually means public investment for private profit .
It all adds up to a brilliant move , when you think about it .
It makes the private health care companies look cooperative and proactive , rather than like the greedy obstructionists they really are .
It gets these companies on the inside track with the administration , and creates common cause with the unions .
In particular , it establishes a solid place at the table for the health insurance industry , the blood - sucking middlemen who ought to be kicked out of the health care system altogether .
And what might the industry get in return for this generous “ cooperation ” ?
The Kaiser Daily Health Policy report today rounded up the possibilities :
The [ Wall Street ] Journal reports that although the groups did not ask for anything in return for the pledge , many of the factions are looking to prevent regulations that could “ pose new burdens ” or affect their profitability .
For example , the health insurance industry is seeking to offset any reductions to their payments by obtaining new rules that would require all U.S. residents to have health coverage , according to the Journal .
The Journal reports that health insurers have made several concessions intended to prevent a public option — which they fear could affect their profitability — as part of reform legislation ( Wall Street Journal , 5/11 ) .
According to the AP / Philadelphia Inquirer , drugmakers are hoping to avoid a requirement that new drugs pass a cost - benefit test before receiving regulatory approval .
In addition , hospitals and physicians are looking to avoid a system in which the government would dictate their payments for all patients , not just those under Medicare or Medicaid ( Alonso - Zaldivar , AP / Philadelphia Inquirer , 5/11 ) .
In other words , the underlying purpose of this PR stunt is to slow or block any meaningful health care reforms , which could actually improve care while reducing the price tag by a lot more than 1.5 percent .
These include regulating the cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices , curtailing or eliminating the role of the insurance companies , or introducing single - payer , which allows other developed countries to deliver superior health care for 20 to 40 percent less–all of which make $ 2 trillion in weight - loss programs and paperwork reduction measures look pretty pitiful by comparison .
All we can hope for is the possibility , remote as it may be , that Obama himself is also playing a PR game –making nice with the industry shills while planning some kind of genuine reform that will hit them in the only place that counts , and the only place where truly meaningful savings reside : their profit margins .
A few scanning tips www.scantips.com
A 12 milliliter " cow syringe " is very good to use for milk drop photography .
It is shown below , and is about 50 cents from a feed store - for doctoring animals , but no needle used here .
Buy two or three , they eventually become sticky .
The syringe is used to release the drop , from a fixed mounting point , to always fall in the same place .
The drop falls through a LED interrupter gate which interrupts the circuit , starting the timer , which eventually triggers the flash .
The Nikon SB - 800 flash unit at 1/128 power works great for this ( manual mode from a few inches ) , as should any other speedlight at low power .
A timer gives repeatable and consistent timing , which is very good for milk drop splash photos , because the splashes give very different ( but repeatable ) patterns at different points in the duration of the splash .
The entire splash is over in only a very few milliseconds , but it first produces the crown ( best falling on a thin film of milk ) , followed by a central rebound column ( best falling on a deeper pool of milk ) , and each stage has phases , start , middle , end .
No two splashes are exactly the same , but the timer can easily and repeatedly capture the same moment .
You just set the timer to produce which ever point in the splash that you want to photograph .
It is a bit touchy to adjust just right , but not hard .
This will do anything you could want for one water drop .
The timer board used for these photos is shown hanging with the syringe just for this photo , but it is not normally put up there .
You can see a round drop of water falling in the black gate , which triggered the flash for this photo , with zero delay setting .
A longer delay let the milk drop fall 24 inches for the photos before ( two pages back here ) .
The blue variable resistor in lower left adjusts timer delay time to fire the flash , which you adjust to give the delay result desired , judged in a photo in the camera LCD .
Then it is very repeatable , every shot is timed right .
However , two water drops , for example the collision of the rebound and the next falling drop , is really difficult ( at least for me with only this timer ) .
It is done , some can do it with a single timer , but you need a way to release multiple drops ( a dripping spigot valve ) , and some luck .
A fancy timer that can also time a solenoid valve releasing two drops makes it very easy .
You use manual focus and manual flash and manual exposure of course , so a DSLR seems necessary ( and a macro lens ) .
I focus on the spot where the milk drop will be later by temporarily putting something there where it is hit , so I can focus on that spot - like a screwdriver blade or a bent piece of heavy wire that extends to the same spot where the drop lands .
I found it convenient to make the mounting shown above , to hold the interrupter ( the gate for water drops ) , and to locate the syringe so the splash falls in the same place every time for the camera .
It is simply just a piece of PVC pipe sawed length - wise to locate the round syringe , glued to a clear plastic plate with hot glue , screwed to a 3/8 " aluminum rod ( slightly flattened with a file ) , held by an umbrella bracket on a light stand .
Or clamping to a labratory stand should work fine too .
You probably want the splash from a milk drop that has fallen 12 to 18 inches .
The room is dim , but not dark .
I leave one table lamp on " low " across the room , and still get a black frame without the flash ( at f/16 ) .
I do turn on extra light to focus .
In manual focus mode , the Nikon D70S viewfinder green LED still indicates correct focus , if you hold the shutter half down .
I use a Nikon 60 mm macro lens near its minimum focus distance , with a clear UV or Skylight filter to protect the lens from splashes .
It will get wet , a longer macro lens would be better .
I often place an 8x10 inch picture frame glass standing up in front of the lens , to shield it .
I cannot tell that it has any bad effect , but it must be cleaned often , which is of course the point of it .
The flash is triggered directly by the timer PC cable .
Neither one connects to the camera .
I use a shutter release cable or remote , but the flash is still very fast without it .
The camera shutter is opened manually in Bulb setting , then the drop is released ( two hands ) .
After the drop triggers the flash , then the shutter is closed manually .
The fast flash duration stops the motion , and the dim ambient room light does not register at the f/16 aperture , even when the shutter is open a couple of seconds ( verify this result is black once , without the flash ) .
Adjust exposure with the distance of the flash , so that the milk exposure does not overflow your histogram on the right ... a bit darker usually gives better looking milk drops .
The Nikon SB - 800 at 1/128 power ( 24 mm wide zoom setting ) placed from 7 to 10 inches is about right for f/16 and ISO 200 .
1/64 or 1/32 power will work too , but a minimum flash power is both necessary and sufficient .
Adjust timer delay for the splash result you want to capture .
This adjustment becomes easy after the first few minutes of experience , you will know about where it should be .
The timer is the SPG2 - DU - BB kit ( Schmitt trigger photogate - delay unit combination with breadboard ) , from HiViz .
Price is $ 18 USD plus shipping .
It is a kit , so you must do the wiring , but easy and detailed instructions are available online there ( and come with it ) .
It is a real bargain , and it works very well for high speed milk drop photography .
Also see the Guidebook for High Speed Flash Photography there .
Very interesting site .
For reference , here are the board wiring instructions and the gate wiring instructions , and the schematic .
The schematic may be a mystery for some , but you will be able to do the wiring .
Click on the photos in the left column of the instructions - especially the last one to see it .
You just poke those little thingies into the holes it describes .
Do it like it says and it will work .
The timer provides adjustable flash delay up to about 1 / 2 second , and extra resistors are furnished for longer times too .
The flash sync cable is not included .
The flash has a PC cord connection ( there are inexpensive foot adapters to add a PC connection if it does n't ) , so I bought a longer cheap " PC male to PC male " sync cord , which when cut in half provides two such cables , for two kits ( they also offer a similar timer triggered by sound too ) .
The half should reach from timer to the flash .
Or it may be easier to find a short " PC Female to PC Male " cable ( which is an extension cable ) , and then just cut off the wrong male end ( wrong to serve as an extension cable ) , so that this short soldered female end can accept your existing regular flash cable ( which is male itself ) .
The timer also needs a regular 9V battery , which will last many days of use if you disconnect it when not in use .
As to the lighting setup , do n't mix fast and slow lights when the goal is speed .
I discovered an interesting problem when I tried that . :)
Roughly Drafted predicts Windows 7 's failure even if it 's technically perfect because OEM's are tired of paying the Windows Tax for the pleasure of competing in a fierce low margin commodity market .
The real problem with Vista is that nobody wants to pay Microsofts Windows Tax .
Not even a hypothetical , brilliantly flawless new version of Windows can solve that problem .
... PC makers are desperately jealous of Apple , which not only doesnt pay Microsoft the Windows Tax , but also is so strongly differentiated by its unique software that it can charge sustainable prices for its products in a market that has PC rivals diving into a shallow margin of water with no hope of floating .
... big PC makers from HP to Dell to Acer to Sony are all investigating Linux or their own software that can be used in place of Windows .
Once Microsoft loses their business , it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to ever get it back .
The author gleefully points out the massive failure of Vista and reminds the readers of their correct prediction that failure .
The article mentions how " downgrade to XP " has been used to pull more money than ever out of customers for seven year old software that sucks a little less than Vista , and how OEMs realize that XP is the only way to sell their computers .
The previous article predicted Vista failure from a lack of demand for what Vista had to offer , overpricing , a more competitive Apple and everyone else in the world ( " IBM to Oracle " ) having invested in GNU / Linux .
No one could have imagined the Vista compatible dissaster , spill over of internal email calling the product shit or even just how shit Vista 's insane DRM and spyware anti-features would make the OS .
Some of that technical failure is pointed out in the previous article because M$ has yet to deliver on it's early 1990 's feature promisses .
Speerspitze aus Holz – Um 40'000 Jahre alt Eine in der Nähe der slowenischen Hauptstadt Ljubljana gefundene Speerspitze aus Holz ist nach Angaben von Archäologen 38'000 bis 45'000 Jahre alt .
Der Fund wurde in einem Fluss gehoben .
Er ist laut Experten für die Altsteinzeit äusserst ungewöhnlich .
( sda /afp ) Eine hölzerne Speerspitze aus dieser alten Epoche sei etwas vollkommen Neues , sagte die Leiterin des slowenischen Instituts zum Schutz des Kulturerbes , Barbara Nadbath .
Die einzigen bisher in Zentraleuropa bekannten Speerspitzen aus dieser Zeit seien aus Stein .
Die Speerspitze wurde laut den Angaben im September vergangenen Jahres von Archäologen bei Tauchgängen im Fluss Vrhnika nahe der Ortschaft Sinja Gorica entdeckt .
Wissenschafter in Oxford und Miami datierten den Fund .
The ideological split should be on vivid display as early as Wednesday if House leaders follow through on their plan to have an unusual two - part vote on the credit card / gun bill .
Under the current plan , the House would vote separately on the gun provision and the credit card elements of the bill , allowing lawmakers who favor the credit card provision but not the gun measure to split their votes and allow those who want both to have it all .
The two aspects of the bill would be joined again before the legislation was sent to the White House .
The Senate approved the credit card bill on Tuesday on an overwhelming vote of 90 to 5 , showing that Democrats who oppose the gun provision were not going to let it interfere with their backing of the broader legislation .
Image  It is a shame .
But you have to come to a realization around here that at this point in time , the N.R.A. gets the votes . 
- Barbara Boxer , Democrat of California Credit ... Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press
Mr. Coburn and his allies in both parties say the provision is less about guns than it is states ’ rights .
Under the proposal , people who are otherwise authorized under state law to have firearms would be entitled to have them in national parks and wildlife refuges unless a state law prohibited it .
Currently , firearms must be unloaded and secured on those national lands , creating what backers of the bill say is a situation where someone passing through a park with a firearm can be charged with a violation .
“ I do n’t like guns necessarily , ” Mr. Coburn said .
“ What I want is those constitutional rights to be protected . ”
Mr. Coburn has been trying for the past two years to get the measure through Congress .
The Bush administration , in its final months , had pushed through a rule change that would have allowed the guns , but in March a federal judge blocked the change .
The Obama administration chose not to appeal the decision while a review of potential impacts was made .
Hey , i actually invited you and your friends here .
Or have you forgotten that conversation ?
Pleas come !
It would be so awesome !

BAGHDAD , April 8 ( UPI ) --
The slayings of as many as 25 gay men and boys in Iraq in recent weeks show the country is still a religious , conservative and violent place , observers say .
The killings have happened in the slums of Baghdad 's Sadr City , where new freedoms have encouraged more self - expression .
But being openly gay in a land where homosexuality is legally prohibited is a dangerous undertaking , The New York Times reported Wednesday .

Sadr City 's Muslim clerics have reportedly urged the faithful to destroy homosexuality Iraqi society and police have undertaken an effort to arrest and jail gay men .
" Homosexuality is against the law , " police Lt. Muthana Shaad told the Times .
" And it 's disgusting , " he said , adding that for the past four months his officers have been cracking down on gays in a " campaign to clean up the streets and get the beggars and homosexuals off them . "
April 2nd is World Autism Awareness Day , a time to educate , and realize the importance of early diagnosis and intervention .
WAAD is also a time to celebrate and honor the unique talents and skills that people with autism bring to communities around the world .
Autism is a variation in neurological functioning of the human brain .
People representing the autistic spectrum have a different way of social interaction , learning , communication , and emotional perception as opposed to the neurotypical majority in society .
About 6 in 1,000 people is autistic , and they are a testament to the neurodiversity within our society .
Autistic people often have many challenges , and many require assistance in their daily lives , but they have a unique and unknown culture to the rest of society .
In keeping with blog tradition , here is WAAD with a queer - centric twist to honor and help educate about the LGBTQ minority within the autistic population .
There are also reports and scientific research to support the notion that a significant number of people with Autism / Asperger 's are non heterosexual ie : gay , asexual , transgender , and / or intersex .

This article is the fifth in our Whole Life Parenting series , which offers practical tips to meet the needs of both parents and children .
Not too long ago , I went to the party of some friends .
Small children buzzed , hooted , rolled , walked , cried and ran around throughout the whole party .
The host said ,
It ’s amazing how the parties have changed over the years as this group of friends has had children .
We ’ve just opened up into a kid- friendly space .
This , I think , is the key to having a great time at party when you have kids around — think of it as a kid- friendly space where you also get to have some grownup time — more mindful grownup time , perhaps than before you had kids , but grownup time nonetheless .
Here are eight ideas for creating parties that meet both young people ’s needs and adult needs :
1. Cluster ages , mix genders .
Try to invite clusters of kids close to the same age , and a mix of boys and girls .
An odd child out can wind up getting left out of the social activity , or not treated as warmly as the others .
Kids close to the same age will organize themselves into self - directed play .
Mixed ages can also work well when older kids help supervise the younger kids , and younger kids get to look up to the older kids as role models .
2 . A little bit of kid-friendly goes a long way .
If you plan an activity or two just for the kids , one or two adults can supervise while the others get to interact with each other .
For example , last Chanukah , I had the kids cut out cookies .
After I baked them , I put the cookies and decorating supplies in a big tray , and the kids occupied themselves decorating the cookies while the grownups got to schmooze .
We always keep a kid - sized table with a box of art supplies and paper in the living room , plus a barrel of toys , so our young visitors can entertain themselves if the grownup talk gets too boring .
3. Rotate supervising grownups .
Depending on the ages of the kids , you might be able to get away with rotating the supervising grownup .
This often happens naturally , but it ca n’t hurt to ask ahead of time if folks would be willing to take a short shift supervising the kids so it does n’t all fall on one parent .
4 . Find an enclosed space , whether natural , or human - made .
An open space , such as a park in a valley , or a field surrounded by a fence or forest , can provide kids with an exciting play environment , as well adults with peace of mind that the kids wo n’t encounter traffic .
And sometimes it ’s just nice to get out of the house and commune with nature while you socialize .
5. Create a staggered party .
I have held and attended a number of these .
Basically , the set up is , create some specifically kid-friendly time for part of the time , followed by a transition time , followed by grownup time .
For example , you might have a weekend barbeque with 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. as designated child - friendly time , and set up your space according to some of the ideas above .
Let the focus be on the kids during this time , so they can get play hard , eat well and get ready to go home .
8:00 p.m. could begin the adults - only time , and the intervening period can serve as transition .
This way , guests can choose to come to either one or the other party segment , or get a taste of both by staying for the transition .
Some guests might even choose to take their child home and then return .
Others might put their child to bed in an extra bedroom and continue to party !
6 . Set up separate kid space .
Though this does n’t work equally well in every space , some families are fortunate enough to have a space big enough where kids can hang out separately from the adults .
I went to a party where a friend had converted her attic into a playroom , and her babysitter hung out with the kids while we parents had some adult time downstairs .
We all chipped in for the babysitter at the end .
Babysitting can also be a great way to get older kids involved , who might otherwise be bored or tempted toward something not good for them .
It ’s also a chance for them to earn a bit of money .
7 . Plan a party with activities both kids and adults can enjoy .
Costume parties with dancing , pumpkin carving , barbeques , henna or face - painting , music and food are all things people of walking and talking age can join in , at least on some level .
There are lots of ways to cut loose without a drop of alcohol , so adults can have fun while still keeping a clear head for the kids .
8. Revel in the freedom of kid-friendly space .
When we put kids at the center of our consciousness , tune into them , and follow their lead , we actually get a chance to drop some of the adult rules .
We get to be silly , get muddy , act nonsensical , run around and maybe even get more exercise than we would if we “ acted our age . ”
This kind of permission can renew our spirits in ways we might not even realize we missed if we do n’t take the opportunities .
As a parent , you do n’t have to give up having parties , and not all your parties need take children into consideration all the time .
Certainly , life with children will never be the same as before you had kids , but with a little planning , vision and intention , you can enjoy your children , and have social time with adults .
How have you been partying , if at all ?
Please let us know in the space below .
Party on ,

ABC Reports Psychics Contributing to Bad Economy
ABC News reports in this article that at least one pyschic business is up at least 7 % due to the economic crisis .
My question for ABC is ... why is this news ?
First off , it 's old news .
Second , why is it news at all ?
If anything , the story should read " Psychics Make a Bad Situation Worse . "
Why ?
Because they 're taking money from people who are having money problems , and giving them advice that they 're unqualified to give .
I 'd love to do this test , if it were possible .
Give two people $ 100 .
One them will use the $ 100 to get a reading about their financial future from a psychic , and the other will invest it in an index fund ; let 's say the Nasdaq .
If we compare the results in two years , who 's going to be ahead ?
Even if the market goes down , I 'm going to guess the investor will be ahead , because you can bet the psychic is going to encourage repeat visits , and that original $ 100 is never going to come back .
As if that 's not bad enough , check out this quote :
Laura Day , who prefers to be called an " intuitive " rather than a psychic , said high - end businesses are seeking her aid .
She said she advises up to five corporate clients at a time , and the service does n't come cheaply .
Day charges $ 10,000 monthly for her services and claimed her intuitiveness has served her well in her own financial life .
Her " intuitiveness " has another word : ruthlessness .
Of course it 's helping her ... she 's raping companies for $ 10,000 a month .
No wonder we 're in a financial crisis .
If my tone is coming across as angry , that 's accurate .
ABC
News is promoting psychic services with this piece , and their " other side of the story " bit does n't come close to balancing their message , which is " Hey , people and corporations are going to psychics during this troubled time , you should too ! "
One of the people they interviewed under the heading " Critics Cry Fowl " is actually Laura Day , who says : " Unless someone is tried and true , you should take what anyone says with a grain of salt . "
Psychics have been " tried " for centuries , and they 've never been " true . "
Juju Chang , Thea Trachtenberg , and Imaeyen Ibanga should be embarased by this article , and ABC News should be ashamed of publishing it , in my opinion .
The council hopes the move will improve thousands of families ' lives Workers at Scotland 's biggest local authority , Glasgow City Council , will be paid a new minimum wage of £ 7 an hour in a drive to tackle low pay .
Council leader Steven Purcell said the move would boost the wage packets of the lowest paid staff by more than £ 1,100 a year .
He issued a challenge to other employers to do the same .
The £ 7 Glasgow rate will come into force on 1 April - ten years since the national minimum wage was introduced .
In a speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee , Mr Purcell said it was vital for Labour to address low - paid work , which he said was not enough to lift the " plight of poverty " .
" There are up to 80,000 workers in Glasgow earning less than £ 7 an hour and this has the potential to improve the lives of thousands of families across our city , " he said of the council initiative .
' Women to benefit ' Mr Purcell said Glasgow City Council contractors would be strongly encouraged to implement the rate .
He went on : " Low pay discriminates against women more than men and I 'm pleased to confirm that the vast majority of staff who will benefit from this new rate of £ 7 an hour are , in fact , women . "
The minimum wage for employees over 21 increased by 3.8 % in October to £ 5.73 per hour .
It is £ 4.77 for workers aged between 18 - 21 and £ 3.53 for staff aged 16 - 17 .
Mr Purcell told the conference : " We in the Labour Party are rightly proud of the introduction of the national minimum wage , in the face of fierce opposition from the Tories . "

Your reader 's response to Megan got a lot closer to the core of the problem with healthcare costs .
I am a physician in an emergency room in New York City , and every day I see tons of cash needlessly flying out the door due to " the Burger King factor . "
American patients often come to the ER with very minor complaints - back pain for which they have not even tried tylenol , nasal congestion for two days , itchy mosquito bites , and so forth .
All of them expect something from you , quickly , for their trouble - and it must meet their preconceptions or they will accuse you of ripping them off .
Many of them become virtually incandescent with anger if they are n't given some kind of medical test that they ( or one of their friends ) thinks is a good idea , but they do n't really need .
They insult you , they threaten you , they loudly announce that they 're going to call their lawyer or the hospital administrator , etc .
Sometimes we stand up to them , and sometimes we 're too exhausted to fight .
Sometimes it 's just easier to get the x-ray on the patient with back pain rather than take the abuse and argue with them for 40 minutes and then have them send an angry letter to the review board .
Others are simply beyond the pale and can't put anyone else ahead of themselves .
Some are incensed that I have to see a critically ill patient before I see them , because " I got here first . "
People will literally interrupt cpr to scream that they want a sandwich or something to eat NOW .
People want a blood test , a cat scan , an EKG , anything in exchange for their time .
People will quote TV shows as medical authorities .
All of us have our favorite ' placebo ' methods to try and gratify these patients , from ultrasounding their skulls ( safe , dramatic , shows nothing but costs nothing ) to pointing an ultraviolet flashlight into their maalox before they drink it .
It 's our version of wearing a wooden mask and shaking a rattle - we hate it , and patients love it .
The amazing thing is that when needless tests come back negative , the patient is completely satisfied .
There is never a sense of regret , or how much money they just wasted , but rather one of accomplishment , even if they still have the same problem they walked in with .
Ultimately , the American sense of entitlement , so long appeased and encouraged by our commercial culture , is what is poisoning the healthcare system .
Doctors have played into it and are just as guilty for caving in when they know better , or billing for procedures a patient does n't really need .
We have played along and made medical glitz into the standard of care , feeding and feeding off of a narcissism that can not be satisfied .
It is a uniquely American problem , which is why the solutions that other nations have reached will not work as well for us .

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was on CNN ’s State of the Union today , where he revealed that he is afraid of Rush Limbaugh .
When asked about Limbaugh ’s attacks on Sotomayor , McConnell said he had better things to do than to tell his party to stop calling Sotomayor a racist .
Here is the video of McConnell courtesy of Think Progress :
When asked by host John King if Rush and Newt are making it harder on the GOP by calling Sotomayor a racist , McConnell answered , “ They ’re certainly entitled to their opinions .
…
Look , I ’ve got a big job to dealing with 40 senate Republicans and trying to advance a nation ’s agenda .
I ’ve got better things to do than to be the speech police over people who are going to have their views about a very important appointment . ”

McConnell has better things to do ?
Wow , what a lame excuse .
Why does n’t he say that , even he , as the Republican leader of the Senate is terrified of getting into a confrontation with Limbaugh ?
I do agree that Rush is entitled to his opinions , but the Senate GOP leader should have the courage to say that he disagrees with the opinion of a talk show host .
No one is asking McConnell to do anything other than express his opinion , of Sotomayor and is too frightened of Limbaugh to do even that .
I think McConnell ’s comments are symptomatic of the problems inside the Republican Party .
Every time someone claims that Rush is n’t running the GOP , one only has to point to this exchange as proof of his vast power .
Russia Dumps the U.S. Dollar for Euro as Reserve Currency
The US dollar is not Russia ’s basic reserve currency anymore .
The euro - based share of reserve assets of Russia ’s Central Bank increased to the level of 47.5 percent as of January 1 , 2009 and exceeded the investments in dollar assets , which made up 41.5 percent , The Vedomosti newspaper wrote .
The dollar has thus lost the status of the basic reserve currency for the Russian Central Bank , the annual report , which the bank provided to the State Duma , said .
In accordance with the report , about 47.5 percent of the currency assets of the Russian Central Bank were based on the euro , whereas the dollar - based assets made up 41.5 percent as of the beginning of the current year .
The situation was totally different at the beginning of the previous year : 47 percent of investments were made in US dollars , while the euro investments were evaluated at 42 percent .
The dollar share had increased to 49 percent and remained so as of October 1 .
The euro share made up 40 percent .
The rest of investments were based on the British pound , the Japanese yen and the Swiss frank .
The report also said that the reserve currency assets of the Russian Central Bank were cut by $ 56.6 billion .
The losses mostly occurred at the end of the year , when the Central Bank was forced to conduct massive interventions to curb the run of traders who rushed to buy up foreign currencies .
The currency assets of the Central Bank had grown to $ 537.6 billion by October 2008 .
Therefore , the index dropped by almost $ 133 billion within the recent three months .
The majority of Russian companies , banks and most of the Russian population started to purchase enormous amounts of foreign currencies at the end of 2008 .
The dollar gained 16 percent and the euro 13.5 percent over the fourth quarter .
The demand on the US dollar was extremely high , and the Central Bank was forced to spend a big part of its dollar assets , experts say .
The change of the structure of the currency portfolio of the Bank of Russia has not affected the official peg of the dual currency basket , which includes $ 0.55 and 0.45 EUR .
The investments of the Bank of Russia in state securities of foreign issuers have been considerably increased , the report said .
About a third of Russia ’s international reserves are based on US Treasury bonds .
Russia became one of the largest creditors of the US administration last year , the US Department of the Treasury said .
Russia increased its investments in the debt securities of the US Treasury from $ 32.7 billion as of December 2007 to $ 116.4 billion as of December 2008 .

The top House Democrat overseeing the Department of Homeland Security is demanding that officials there explain how and why they wrote and released a controversial report identifying veterans as potential terrorist threats .
Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , said in a letter to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano that he was “ dumbfounded ” such a report would be issued .
“ This report appears to raise significant issues involving the privacy and civil liberties of many Americans — including war veterans , ” Mr. Thompson said in the letter sent Tuesday .

“ As I am certain you agree , freedom of association and freedom of speech are guaranteed to all Americans — whether a person ’s beliefs , whatever their political orientation , are ‘ extremist ’ or not , ” Mr. Thompson said .
The report “ blurred the line , ” and Mr. Thompson said he is “ disappointed and surprised that the department would allow this report to be disseminated ” to law enforcement officials nationwide .

Also Wednesday , Ms. Napolitano issued a statement standing by the report , which she personally had reviewed before it was issued .
She insisted that DHS never would investigate based on political ideology and agreed to meet the head of the American Legion , who already had expressed anger over the report .
The Washington Times reported Tuesday that the department ’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis ( I&A ) released a report titled Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment on April 7 .
It identified as potential terrorist threats people who collect guns , veterans , supporters of border control , and pro-life advocates .
“ I am particularly struck by the report ’s conclusion which states that I &A ‘ will be working with its state and local partners over the next several months to ascertain with greater regional specificity the rise in rightwing extremist activity in the United States with a particular emphasis on the political , economic , and social factors that drive rightwing extremist radicalization , ’ ” Mr. Thompson said , demanding to know what types of activities DHS had planned for “ the next several months . ”

WASHINGTON — Justice David H. Souter plans to retire at the end of the term in June , giving President Obama his first appointment to the Supreme Court , four people informed about the decision said Thursday night .
Justice Souter , who was appointed in 1990 by a Republican president , the first George Bush , but became one of the most reliable members of the court ’s liberal wing , has grown increasingly sour on Washington and intends to return to his home state , New Hampshire , according to the people briefed on his plans .
One official said the decision might be announced as early as Friday .
The departure will open the first seat for a Democratic president to fill in 15 years and could prove a test of Mr. Obama ’s plans for reshaping the nation ’s judiciary .
Confirmation battles for the Supreme Court in recent years have proved to be intensely partisan and divisive moments in Washington , but Mr. Obama has more leeway than his predecessors because his party holds such a strong majority in the Senate .
Replacing Justice Souter with a liberal would not change the basic makeup of the court , where he and three other justices hold down the left wing against a conservative caucus of four justices .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , a moderate Republican appointee , often provides the swing vote that controls important decisions .

I read this quote from Ashton Kutcher and my jaw dropped :
Years from now , when historians reflect on the time we are currently
living in , the names Biz Stone and Evan Williams will be referenced
side by side with the likes of Samuel Morse , Alexander Graham Bell ,
Guglielmo Marconi , Philo Farnsworth , Bill Gates and Steve Jobs —
because the creation of Twitter by Stone , 35 ( right ) , Williams , 37 , and
Jack Dorsey , 32 ( not pictured ) , is as significant and paradigm - shifting
as the invention of Morse code , the telephone , radio , television or the

personal computer .
Again , this reinforces my long held belief that celebrities should stick to playing make believe and taking their shirts off .
Ashton Kutcher is probably a nice guy ( although he does seem rather smug and self satisfied ) , and he appears to be quite bright .
So why on earth he is writing this type of utter nonsense is completely beyond me .
While Twitter is quite fun , it is n't exactly revolutionary .
The Blog was certainly a huge event in the history of print , and Twitter is really only a condensed version of that .
Doing thing like posting pictures of his wife 's ass has gained Kutcher a cult following on Twitter , and I think he has become a little carried away with its potential power .

Senate Republicans threatened to investigate Clinton officials for use of rendition if Democrats insist on investigating Bush officials for authorizing torture .
Sen. Lamar Alexander and Sen. Richard Shelby both indicated that they would push for an investigation into rendition during a Senate hearing Thursday .
“ If we ’re going to ask lawyers who were asked to give legal opinions , we ’re going to investigate them , jeopardize their career , second guess them , look back — then where does that stop ?
I mean , do we not also have to look at the people who asked for those techniques , the people who approved those techniques , members of congress who knew about and encouraged techniques perhaps ?
Or , in your case , in the Clinton administration .
We do n’t know what the interrogations were then .
Perhaps you do and the question will be ‘ Did you approve them ? ' ”
Alexander warned Holder .

Home de Yann Arthus - Bertrand , l’Å “ uvre majeure du nouveau millénaire .
Gràce aux producteurs Denis carot ( Elzevir Films ) et Luc Besson ( Europacorp ) et au financement de FranÃ§ois - Henri Pinault du groupe PPR , le film de Yann Arthus - Bertrand , à but non lucratif , sortira officiellement le 5 juin à Mexico dans le cadre des célébrations officielles du Programme des Nations Unies pour l’Environnement ( PNUE ) .
Et sa diffusion , le même jour , ratisse large sur le surface de la Terre €¦
Une première dans l’histoire des médias et du 7ème art , « Home » de Yann Arthus - Bertrand qui sortira le 5 juin 2009 à l’occasion de la journée mondiale de l’environnement , le sera simultanément sous et sur tous les supports existants :
Internet , CD , télévision et salles , avec sa disponibilité dans 70 pays et dans 23 langues .
Loin d’être un simple projet économique commun , les bénéfices de cette réalisation cinématographique , comme le répète si bien le photographe réalisateur , sont le nombre de personnes qui le verront pour être sensibilisés aux idées de sauvegarde de la Terre , que les recettes qu’il fera .
En effet l’expérience qui l ’a précédé , d’avoir tenté de faire une salve sur tous les moyens de diffusion et en désobéissance à la chronologie d’exploitation , est le film « Buble » du cinéaste américain David Soderberg en 2006 .
Ce fut un échec , les rigides canons de l’économie n’ont pas fléchies …
La règle est toute intransigeante : le cinéma d’abord , puis la vidéo , ensuite Internet et enfin la télévision payante à laquelle suivra aussi la gratuite .
Cette noble cause , c’en est une parmi les grandes , pliera - t - elle enfin le roseau sans le briser ?
Comme jamais , à ce jour , dans l’histoire de l’humanité une telle prouesse n’a été tentée en matière d’arts audiovisuels .
Cette œuvre bouleverse l’ordre établi que cela agace les comptables et autres productivistes qui font de la matière culturelle un simple business .
Son entière gratuité remet en cause bien des considérations , même si on essai risque et provoque d’amoindrir son exemplarité .
A l’heure où en France le débat autour de la loi sur les téléchargements fait rage et mobilise tant la classe politique que les créateurs , elle survient comme une révolution .
Qui dit mieux ?
Il va sans dire que la réticence des exploitants de salles , attachés et soumis par l’ordre des choses à la rentabilité , n’a pas encore pleinement cédée .
A l’heure où nous mettons sous presse ce sujet , il n’y a que l’attente et les démarches pour qu’ils participent à une cause comme il n’y a point de plus noble et juste .
Mais l’initiateur ne perd pas espoir de les convaincre , du moins de persuader nombreux à la distribution de « Home » au moins pendant la journée du 5 juin .
L’idée se propage , finalement tanpis pour les crédules et les mornes , le peuple reconnaîtra les siens .
Et puisque le film le sera donné gracieusement , une réduction de 50 % sur le coût des places est souhaitable .
Quant au prix du CD , qui sera disponible dans les FNAC ainsi que d’autres réseaux , il ne dépassera pas 5 € .
Dans tous les genres , ce film consacré à la question de l’environnement que tout être conscient , comme l’humain , considère comme cruciale et commune aux êtres terriens , est une perle qui sert d’idéal à la réflexion sur , outre les messages de grandes valeurs humanistes , l’accès aux œuvres artistiques .
Tant d’abord et surtout parce que « Home » se rapporte à l’univers premier : la planète
Terre qui héberge nombreux et variés habitants .
Parmi lesquels l’homme s’apparente comme le plus , tirant profits , néfaste à son propre destin et aux autres espèces qui le côtoient .
« Le message porté par ce film est extrêmement important car il met en évidence la question de la survie .
Nous avons besoin de plateformes accessibles et puissantes comme YouTube et Google Maps pour toucher le plus grand nombre » , a déclaré Yann Arthus - Bertrand , réalisateur et producteur du film Home .
Bande annonce du film
Home © Non disponible
Quatre chaînes
YouTube en français , anglais , espagnol et allemand , permettent de découvrir le making - of du film .
Des clips , extraits du long - métrage de 90 minutes et des interviews approfondies , sont aussi dans la promotion et déjà visibles .
Google Maps s’associe au projet en lançant cinq cartes thématiques , pour permettre au public , entre autres , de soutenir le film et sa cause .
Les internautes accèdent ainsi plus facilement aux lieux de projection du film .
Du genre documentaire commenté par des voix off , le film a mobilisé bénévolement nombreuses tonalités et pour différentes langues .
Celle de Jacques Gamblin est pour la version cinéma , de Yann Arthus - Bertrand pour la télévision française ( car nombreuses dont la chaîne Al - Jazeera , entre autres , prennent part ) , de Glenn Glose en anglais et Salma Hayek en espagnol .
Déjà membre de l’académie française , Yann Arthus - Bertrand vient d’être nommé ambassadeur de bonne volonté du Programme des Nations - Unis pour l’Environnement .
Pour son « Home » , il a été financé de 10 millions d’€ par François - Henri Pinault et pour la coproduction il a été soutenu par Denis Carot Luc Besson .

Evildoers beware !
A team of self - styled crime - fighters called the “ Allegiance of Heroes ” has taken to patrolling the mean streets of Cincinnati , righting wrongs and defending the defenseless .
The superheroes — who carry handcuffs , pepperspray and stun guns , but no batarangs — are part of a global network of masked avengers who organize and team - up through the online World Superhero Registry .
This awesome video from Cincinatti’s WLWT focuses on 21 - year - old Shadow Hare , the leader of the Allegiance .
Shadow
Hare has joined with superheroes in other states to fight crime .
“ I ’ve even teamed up with Mr. Extreme in California — San Diego — and we were trying to track down a rapist , ” he told the station .
As io9 notes , what could possibly go wrong ?
If nothing else , the presence of real - life superheroes seems to be suppressing the emergence of super villains .
Of the 26 active heroes in the registry , only one , east coast - based Tothian , lists an official arch- enemy : Osama Bin Laden .
Hard to ignore a press release with this headline : " Brighton High School Senior Excluded From Prom Because Her Date ' Smelled Like Medical Marijuana . ' "
According to the release , the incident in question involved Brighton High senior Sarah Heideman , who was n't allowed to go to prom because her date , Jason Schweinsberg , allegedly had a whiff of weed about him .
Both he and Heideman deny having toked prior to the event , although Schweinsberg is a medical - marijuana patient with a state - issued card .
The expulsion made Heideman mad -- hire - a- lawyer mad .
Hence a press conference scheduled for 12:30 p.m. today , at which attorney Robert Corry will excoriate the authorities involved for turning " what should have been a treasured memory of Sarah 's youth " into " a nightmare because of the current insanity of the War on Drugs . "
Get the rest of the details after the jump .
Implementing ELA in a pixel shader
I 've been working on rewriting video algorithms in pixel shaders for 3D acceleration lately , and one of the sticking points I hit was Edge - Based Line Averaging ( ELA ) interpolation .
ELA is a common spatial interpolation algorithm for deinterlacing and works by trying several angles around the desired point and averaging between the points with the lowest absolute difference .
The angles are chosen to be regular steps in sample location , i.e. ( x+n , y - 1 ) and ( x - n , y+1 ) for n being small integers .
This produces reasonable output for cases where a temporal or motion - based estimation is not available .
The specific variant I 'm dealing with is part of the Yadif deinterlacing algorithm , which checks three horizontally adjacent pixels for each angle and only picks the farthest two if the intermediate angle is a better match as well .
In other words :
for dx = - 2 to 2
error [ dx ] = difference ( top [dx - 1 ] , bottom [ - dx - 1 ] ) + difference ( top [ dx ] , bottom [ - dx ] ) + difference ( top [dx + 1 ] , bottom [ - dx + 1 ] ) best_offset = 0 ;
for dx = - 1 to - 2 :
if error [ dx ] < error[ best_offset ] :
best_offset = dx
else :
break for dx = +1 to +2 :
if error [ dx ] < error[ best_offset ] :
best_offset = dx
else :
break result = average ( top [ dx ] , bottom [ dx ] )
This should be a relatively simple translation to a pixel shader -- convert each source pixel access to a texture sample .
Not .
It turns out that under the Direct3D ps_2_0 profile , which is what I need to target , there are n't enough temporary registers to run this algorithm .
In order to run the algorithm , at least 14 source pixel fetches need to be done , and there are only 12 temp registers in ps2.0 .
The HLSL compiler valiantly tries to squeeze everything in and fails .
Nuts .
There is an important caveat to this implementation tack , which is that I had source pixels mapped in AoS ( array of structures ) format , i.e. a single pixel held YCbCr components and an unused alpha channel .
The CPU implementation of this algorithm , at least the way I wrote it in VirtualDub 1.9.1+ , uses SoA ( structures of arrays ) orientation for speed .
SoA arranges the data as planes of identical components , so instead of mixing components together you fetch a bunch of Y values across multiple pixels , a bunch of Cb pixels , and a bunch of Cr pixels , etc .
I decided to try this in the pixel shader , since texture fetches were my main bottleneck .
It looked something like this :
float4 top0 = tex2D ( src , top_uv0 ) ; // top Y 0 - 3
float4 top1 = tex2D ( src , top_uv1 ) ; // top Y 4 -
7
float4 top2 = tex2D ( src , top_uv2 ) ; // top Y 8-11
float4 bot0 = tex2D ( src , bot_uv0 ) ; // bottom Y 0 - 3
float4 bot1 = tex2D ( src , bot_uv1 ) ; // bottom Y 4 - 7
float4 bot2 = tex2D ( src , bot_uv2 ) ; // bottom Y 8 - 11 float4 error_left2 = abs ( top0 - bot1 )
+ abs( float4( top0.yzw , top1.x ) , float4 ( bot1.yzw , bot2.x ) )
+ abs( float4( top0.zw , top1.xy ) , float4 ( bot1.zw , bot2.xy ) ) ;
Switching to SoA in a pixel shader nullifies some of the advantages of the GPU , since the GPU does n't use as long vectors as fixed - point hardware ( 4 x vs. SSE2's 16 x ) , and because some GPU hardware does n't directly support the swizzles you need to emulate a shift .
It also largely nullifies the advantage of having texture samplers since you can no longer address the source by individual samples .
Well , it turns out in this case that the extra swizzling made the situation even worse than in the AoS case , because the compiler did n't even get halfway down the shader before it gave up .
The main lesson here is that sampling textures can quickly become a bottleneck in the ps_2_0 profile .
Just because you have 32 texture sampling instructions available does n't mean you can use them .
I 've thought about switching to a higher pixel shader profile , like ps_2_a/b , but there are reasons I want to try to stay to ps_2_0 , the main ones being the wide platform availability , the hard resource limits , and the omission of flow control and gradient constructs .
In the end , I had to split the ELA shader into two passes , one which just wrote out offsets to a temporary buffer and another pass that did the interpolation .
It works , but the GPU version is only able to attain about 40 fps , whereas the CPU version can hit 60 fps with less than 100 % of one core .
I guess that mainly speaks to my lopsided computer spec more than anything else .
That having been said , it kind of calls into question the " GPUs are much faster " idea .
I have no doubt this would run tremendously faster on a GeForce 8800GTX , but it seems that there are plenty of GPUs out there where using the GPU is n't a guaranteed win over the CPU , even for algorithms that are fairly parallelizable .

Business reporter , BBC News India Business Report , Paradip port
Iron ore is now Orissa 's main export A thick haze clouds the horizon as rich red dust is poured down .
As more of the fine granules of iron ore arrive on loud , rumbling conveyor belts , the loading machine scoops up large quantities to drop into the open hatch of the waiting ship .
This is like gold in these parts .
This may look like any other busy sea dock in India .
But on India 's iron ore rich eastern coast , Paradip port is a vital link to global markets .
Every month , millions of tonnes of iron ore are exported from here - bringing in much - needed cash and turning the region into a vibrant commercial hub .
The question is whether in one of India 's poorest regions , some people are being left behind .
Chinese connection
The Paradip port is a gateway into India 's source of mineral wealth , spread across the three eastern states of Orissa , Jharkhand and Chattisgarh .
While Orissa has managed to tap into its location advantage and natural resources - it has n't included the people who need it most
Santosh K Mehrotra , government planning commission Nearly 80 - 90 % of India 's iron ore is exported to China , and this accounts for at least 80 million tonnes of cargo every year .
The bulk of this goes through Paradip .
So despite the global economic slowdown , the port has handled all - time record traffic this year .
The port 's chairman , K Raghuramaiah says this is mainly due to the location advantage the port enjoys .
Being so close to China and the rest of East Asia gives them access to some of the best global markets , he says .
" We are forecasting much more cargo coming our way , so the port 's capacity to handle cargo needs to increase , " he adds .
" The cargo traffic here has doubled in the past six years .
Dredging operations are already taking place to deepen the port and we also plan to add more berths to increase their capacity .
" Since the demand is going up , and we have the ideal infrastructure in place to cater to it - we hope to handle 100 million tonnes of cargo by 2016 .
We are getting ready for that . "
Heavy traffic
With nearly 95 % of India 's foreign trade being routed through the seas , ports like this one are increasing in importance .
As doing business in the state gets easier , more and more foreign investment is headed here .
The iron ore is exported from Paradip to China
So despite these measures to expand , the port is crushed under the heavy traffic .
Outside the dock you can see lines of trucks which often have to wait for days before they can unload the iron ore that they are carrying from far way mines .
There are now plans for expansion - for new roads and new railway lines .
And the private sector is taking the lead .
Workers in bright orange overalls are busy welding in the bright mid-day sun .
Simplex Infrastructures is building a new jetty to help handle more vessels in the dock .
Amitabh Mundra , the director of the company , says Orissa presents a huge potential for the private sector to tap into .
Lorries bring the iron ore down to the port " We have been lucky that this port project was completed in the fast track , " he says .
" We are also involved in a new dedicated rail corridor and other connectivity projects with the port .
" The mindset here is changing - as bigger multinational companies move into the state , the demand for basic infrastructure is growing . "
Industrial growth in the state has increased to more than 20 % .
The world 's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal , South Korea 's Posco , British mining firm Vedanta and many others are looking to setup here to cash in on huge reserves .
Displaced people
But even though businesses are happy with the progress , for a lot of people here the development is not welcome .
The big question is whether more people can benefit from the wealth
As companies mine the earth - it often means moving the tribal people who have lived here for centuries .
And while the companies get cheap land and electricity - many people feel ignored by the politicians and excluded from the region 's economic boom .
Santosh K Mehrotra of the Indian government 's planning commission says this is because the growth has not been inclusive .
" While Orissa has managed to tap into its location advantage and natural resources - it has n't included the people who need it most , " he says .
Nearly 40 % of the state 's population is made up of people belonging to lower castes and tribal groups .
These people constitute the majority of those below the poverty line .
And Orissa is among a handful of Indian states where the number of poor people is going up despite the state and the country doing well economically .
By starting to improve its infrastructure , Orissa has managed to put its economy on the fast track .
The state has high hopes for the future .
But the economic advancement is n't judged only by the number of new roads and ports - it also depends on the quality of life for all its citizens .
Unless that growth is inclusive , many fear that they will get left behind .

In 2007 , then Democrat member of the United States House of Representatives , Rahm Emanuel , told the gathered at the annual Stand Up For a Safe America event sponsored by the Brady Center that if your name is on the terrorist no fly list you will not be allowed to own a gun .
In 2007 , according to the Inspector General of the FBI - administered Terrorist Screening Center , there were well over 700,000 names on the no-fly database and the list was growing at an astronomical rate of 20,000 records per month .
That means the list now contains more than a million people .
Senator Ted Kennedy , Rep. John Lewis , and former Senator Ted Steven ’s wife , Catherine Stevens are on the list .
According to Rahm Emanuel , now Obama ’s Chief of Staff , every last one of them are terrorists who will have their Second Amendment right to own a firearm stripped .
Rahm Emanuel was n’t blowing smoke .
His proposal to rob more than a million Americans of their Second Amendment right to own firearms may soon become law if a notorious gun-grabber has her way .
On May 13 , Democrat Rep. Carolyn McCarthy introduced The No Fly , No Buy Act ( H.R. 2401 ) , a bill that will merge the TSA ’s no-fly list with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) , a point - of - sale system for determining eligibility to purchase a firearm in the United States , Guam , and Puerto Rico .
It was created in November of 1993 when the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 ( Brady Act ) , Public Law 103- 159 , was signed into law .
Permanent provisions of the Brady Act went into effect on November 30 , 1998 , and required the U.S. Attorney General to establish NICS .
“ For far too long , the ‘ terror gap ’ has left a wide open loophole in our nation ’s gun safety laws that could allow terrorist to acquire guns the same way any law abiding citizen can , ” McCarthy declared as she introduced her bill .
McCarthy and Congressman Steve Israel , flanked by law enforcement officials , stressed “ the importance of keeping guns out of the hands of people that are known or suspected terrorists , ” according to the Floral Park Dispatch .
“ For far too long , the ‘ terror gap ’ has left a wide open loophole in our nation ’s gun safety laws that could allow terrorists to acquire guns the same way any law abiding citizen can .
The No Fly , No Buy
Act uses existing TSA data to update the NICS system with the names of known or suspected terrorists to disqualify them from passing the Brady Background Check .
This is a common sense gun bill that will prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands , ” McCarthy said .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Department of Homeland Security now considers veterans , advocates of the Second Amendment , and states ’ rights activists as terrorists .
“ Since September 11 , 2001 , Congress has passed many laws to improve homeland security , ” the Floral Park Dispatch continues .
“ Yet , this loophole remains open .
If someone is denied the chance to board an airplane because of suspected ties to terrorists , then they should also be denied the opportunity to purchase a gun .
Individuals with ties to terrorists have bought guns in the past and used them to kill Americans . ”
The language of H.R. 2401 reads as follows : “ To increase public safety and reduce the threat to domestic security by including persons who may be prevented from boarding an aircraft in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System , and for other purposes , ” according to the Open Congress website .
Govtrack .us reports that the bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary .
It does not take a lot of imagination to speculate what “ other purposes ” will ultimately mean .

Caught on camera : Stealth bomber builds up steam as it approaches sound barrier
It looks like a fish out of water - but this airborne killing machine is right at home as it soars above the Californian desert .
This amazing picture is of a U.S. military Stealth Bomber quite literally building up steam as it approaches the sound barrier .
It was released to coincide with the announcement of upgraded military software for the fleet and shows the B - 2 reaching a high subsonic speed during a flight over Palmdale , near Los Angeles .
A B - 2 Spirit Bomber breaks the sound barrier during a flight over California .
The blur is a visible condensation cloud that often occurs around aircraft close to the speed of sound
The Stealth Bomber 's ultra-streamlined modern design ensures there is only a minimal shockwave as the pilot accelerates beyond the speed of sound .
The cloud effect is caused by a vapour cone also known as the ' Prandtl - Glauert singularity ' .
It appears when there is a sudden drop in air pressure around aircraft travelling just above or below the speed of sound .
These condensation clouds , also known as ' shock collars ' are frequently seen during space shuttle launches but their precise nature is still under debate .
The B - 2 , officially known as the Spirit Bomber , can travel as high as 50,000ft and weighs 153,700lb without a payload .
The aircraft is central to America 's air warfare capabilities and is the flagship of the nation 's long - range strike arsenal , with the ability to unleash conventional and nuclear weapons .
The U.S. possesses about 20 B - 2 heavy bombers , some of which have seen action in Afghanistan and Iraq .
U.S. defence contractor Northrop Grumman Corporation revealed today it would install upgraded software in the B - 2 bombers ' flight management system .
The B - 2 owes its stealth capabilities to its unusual design
A statement from technology group Semantic Designs , which designed the software , said the project ' will enhance and extend the lifetime of the B - 2 ' .
' Although the B - 2 is the Air Force 's newest bomber , its computers and processors require upgrade to keep up with integration efforts , ' the company said .
' Expanded and more reliable systems are necessary to maintain the B - 2's leading edge combat capabilities . '
Wind Energy Industry Brings Badly Needed Jobs to Detroit
April 10th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
Wind turbine manufacturer Global Wind Systems announced today that it will be hiring 250 new employees to work in the company ’s new wind turbine assembly plant in Novi , Michigan , thirty miles west of Detroit .
The news brings a ray of hope for a regional economy struggle under the weight of a sinking auto industry .
[ social_buttons ]
In December , Global Wind Systems received $ 7.3 million in tax credits from the Michigan Economic Growth Authority in December to create 256 direct jobs over six years .
Founder and CEO of Global Wind Systems , Chris Long told the Detroit News that he hopes to almost double that number of jobs in just two years .
The current economic slowdown being felt across the country may have hit Detroit before anywhere else in the United States — and it hit hard .
By February , Michigan ’s unemployment rate topped the 12 % mark , the highest in the country and the highest in Michigan since 1984 , and there were even reports that you could buy a Home in Detroit for $ 40 .
The problem in Michigan has been compounded ( or lead ) by the fact that the Big Three are simply not selling as many cars and trucks as they used to .
But as waves of massive layoffs and job cuts sweep through the auto industry , there is at least one other industry that just might be able to prosper in Detroit ’s economic environment — and that is the wind energy industry .
Fortunately for companies like Global Wind Systems , there is already a labor force in place and well - versed in manufacturing .
Of the thousands of applications already received for the Novi plant , CEO Long said ninety percent listed automotive experience .

Hacking While Drunk
The other day I was hanging out on IRC late at night and got chatting to a Shadowcat client about various things - we operate a channel per project and try to get the whole team from both sides into them so we have a complete greppable log of the project discussions .
It also affords the opportunity to kick back and relax as a team after a long day pushing towards a deadline , which makes for a better understanding of each other 's personalities and is bloody useful when you work remote for teams around the world ... but anyway , Shadowcat 's obsession with IRC is probably worth a post of itself , so I 'll move on .
So , the conversation bounced from topic to topic , and I was talking about the fact that I do n't drive because when I 'm way from the UK public transport system it 's usually to drink anyway , and then we were talking about hacking while traveling and I think maybe he got his wires crossed slightly because then he asked :
< amiri >
Hacking while drunk .
Best practices ?
... and it 's actually quite an interesting question .
Or at least , one of the possible answers is .
The first and most important answer is make a branch and remember it's a versioned repository - but that 's the first thing to remember for any hacking , of course .
The second answer is pick things to hack on where you 're stuck because you can't work out the perfect solution .
And that 's where it starts to get interesting .
Perfectionism and Creativity
People often claim that a couple of drinks ( or indeed a couple of joints ) make them more creative .
I 'm not sure I 've ever considered this to be true , but something I have observed a lot of times is that the biggest blocker to us getting stuff done is our own perfectionism .
The whole " must not ship until there are no bugs left " thing is bad enough - as the Microsoft guys are oft fond of repeating , SHIPPING IS A FEATURE and honestly , on a project of any real scale the difference between a bug you do n't have time to fix and an edge case you do n't have time to solve are pretty similar .
More importantly , the bugs that were really , really important to fix are the ones that you do n't find until x.0 ships because , well , nobody ever tests the dev releases .
So , anyway , back to the point .
We 're programmers .
We 're perfectionists .
We want to make the absolute perfect solution to the problem .
And sometimes that just is n't what the world needs .
Sometimes there 's a solution that 's almost as good , that you know will fail on a few edge cases , but would be so much fucking better than anything that currently exists that you should just write the damn thing anyway .
And sometimes , a couple of drinks is just what you need to loosen yourself up enough to realise that and just write it .
Here 's my confession :
Some of my best , my most insane , my most beautiful perl , has been written while not entirely sober .
Often on all nighters where I had a strong cup of coffee and a glass of vodka every hour to keep myself slightly un-sober and still awake and hacking .
And it 's often been on projects where I 'd been trying for weeks to work out what the hell to do about a particular feature , and after a couple beers got over myself and realised that the 98 % ( or even the 80 % ) solution was way better than what we already had and went and build it - and in several cases I still have n't hit the remaining however many percent in production and could 've saved myself those wasted weeks entirely .
Better still , knowing that you 're not at your best really encourages you to write as many tests as possible for the code so if it turns out you basically just vomited high ethanol carrot chunks into your codebase then you should have a pretty firm basis to refactor from before pushing the branch .
So next time you 're stuck on a hard problem , maybe it 's just that you 're being more perfectionist than the problem really needs - so pick up a beer , or $ narcotic_of_choice , or whatever , make yourself a branch , and remember it 's a versioned repository .
Happy hacking .
Comments
No , this blog does n't have a comments system .
Yes , lack of comments sucks .
Yes , we should publish the damn codebase this site runs on so people can add it for us or something .
No , I do n't have time to do that yet .
So , here 's the compromise - mail mst-comments at shadowcat .co.uk with your comment , including the URL of the post you 're commenting on in the subject , and your comment as either plain text , or as HTML inlined in the body of a plain text email ( because I use mutt and I delete anything HTML only that does n't come from a client :) , and I 'll add them to the bottom of the post by hand until it gets annoying enough to do something more sensible .
Six men have been jailed for charges relating to election fraud during a council vote in Berkshire .
The charges related to an election in the Slough Central ward in May 2007 where Labour councillor Lydia Simmons lost her seat to Tory Raja Khan .
Raja Khan , along with two others , had previously admitted the offences .
Three other men were convicted by a jury .
The men , all from Slough , were jailed for between four - and - a- half years and four months at Reading Crown Court .
The court heard they created hundreds of false names in the weeks running up to the local election and entered them on the voter register .
Raja Khan , 52 , of Oban Court , Montem Lane , was jailed for three and a half years after admitting conspiracy to defraud the returning officer and perjury .
The sentences handed down show the seriousness with which the police , courts and prosecuting authorities take electoral fraud
Peter Wardle , chief executive of the Electoral Commission He has since been expelled from the Conservative Party .
Gul Nawaz Khan , 58 , of Richmond Crescent , pleaded guilty to perjury and was jailed for eight months .
Mohammed Basharat Khan , 46 , of Mirador Crescent , admitted conspiracy to defraud the returning officer and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
He was jailed for three years and four months .
Arshad Raja , 53 , of Broadmark Road , was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the returning officer .
He was given an 18 - month prison sentence .
Mahboob Khan , 46 , of Quinbrookes , was convicted of conspiracy to defraud , conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury .
He was jailed for four years and six months .
Altaf Khan , 32 , of Knolton Way , was found guilty of impersonation but not guilty of conspiracy to defraud the returning officer .
He was jailed for four months .
' Relatively rare ' Peter Wardle , chief executive of the Electoral Commission , said : " The sentences handed down today show the seriousness with which the police , courts and prosecuting authorities take electoral fraud .
" Although it is important to stress that electoral fraud is relatively rare , we want every voter to be confident that their vote is secure .
" The Electoral Commission will continue to work with the police and others to prevent and deal with fraud . "
Yasar Mumtaz , 20 , of Wellesley Road , was cleared of conspiracy to defraud the returning officer .
Former deputy mayor Mohammed Aziz , 50 , of Wellesley Road , was found not guilty on the direction of the judge of conspiracy to defraud the returning officer after the jury had failed to reach a verdict .
The prosecution said it would not be seeking a retrial the the case of Mr Aziz .

Python ’s dictionary is possibly the most useful construct in the language .
And I argue that for some purposes , mapping it to a file ( in real - time ) can be even more useful .
*** Update ***
There ’s a newer and better version of FileDict , containing bugfixes and corrections , many of which are due to comments on this page .
You can read about it ( with explanations ) in https://erezsh.wordpress.com/2009/05/31/filedict-bug-fixes-and-updates/
Why ?
The dictionary resides in memory , and so has three main “ faults ” :
It only lasts as long as your program does .
It occupies memory that might be useful for other , more commonly accessed , data .
It is limited to how much memory your machine has .
The first can be solved by pickling and unpickling the dictionary , but will not survive an unexpected shutdown ( even putting the pickling in a try - finally block wo n’t protect it against all errors ) .
FileDict
FileDict is a dictionary interface I wrote , that saves and loads its data from a file using keys .
Current version uses Sqlite3 to provide consistency , and as a by - product , acidity .
The result is a dictionary which at all - times exists as a file , has virtually no size limit , and can be accessed by several processes concurrently .
It is meant as a quick - and - simple general - purpose solution .
It is rarely the best solution , but it is usually good enough .
Performance obviously cannot compare to the builtin dictionary , but it is reasonable and of low complexity ( refer to sqlite for more details on that ) .
Uses
FileDict can be used for many purposes , including :
Saving important data in a convinient manner
Managing large amounts of data in dictionary form , without the mess of implementing paging or other complex solutions
Communication between processes ( sqlite supports multiple connections and implements ACID )
Examples
$ python >>> import filedict >>> d=filedict.FileDict(filename= " example.dict " ) >>> d[ ' bla ' ] = 10 >>> d [ ( 2,1 ) ] = [ ' hello ' , ( 1,2 ) ] -- exit -- $ python >>> import filedict >>> d=filedict.FileDict(filename= " example.dict " ) >>> print d[' bla ' ] 10 >>> print d.items ( ) [ [ ' bla ' , 10 ] , [ ( 2 , 1 ) , [ ' hello ' , ( 1 , 2 ) ] ] ] >>> print dict (d ) {'bla ' : 10 , ( 2 , 1 ) : [ ' hello ' , ( 1 , 2 ) ] }
>>> d=filedict.FileDict(filename=" try.dict " ) >>> with d.batch : # using . batch suspend commits , making a batch of changes quicker >>> for i in range ( 100000 ) : >>> d[ i ] = i** 2 ( takes about 8 seconds on my comp ) >>> print len(d ) 100000 >>> del d[ 103 ] >>> print len(d ) 99999
Limitations
All data ( keys and values ) must be pickle - able
Keys must be hashable ( perhaps this should be removed by hashing the pickled key )
Keys and values are stored as a copy , so changing them after assignment will not update the dictionary .
Source Code
Is availible in here in here
Future
Additions in the future may include :
An LRU - cache for fetching entries
A storage strategy different than Sqlite

Just as no credible scientist questions whether the world is getting warmer , no credible automotive engineer questions whether electric vehicles ( EVs ) are more energy efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles or hybrids .
The automotive industry , which for years experimented with hydrogen fuel cells , biofuels and other alternatives , has reached a clear consensus : the future is electric .
Even in the worst - case scenario , where electricity is generated primarily from coal - fired power plants , the Tesla Roadster EV is about twice as energy efficient as a Toyota Prius and produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than any petrol - powered sports car .
In a best - case scenario , the Roadster consumes entirely renewable energy ; the owner can live " off the grid " with a car that does 0 - 60 mph in 3.9 seconds .
Supercar performance from renewable energy is not a pipe dream .
Many enthusiasts are already using energy stored in their homes ' solar panels to power their Roadsters .
They 're making a conscious choice to invest in a company that is relentlessly driving down the cost of EV technology .

Just last month , Tesla unveiled the Model S , a family sedan that seats five adults and two children and has a range of up to 300 miles per charge .
The base price , with a battery pack that gets 160 miles per charge , is roughly half that of the £ 94,000 Roadster .
If you account for the cost advantage over the life of the car compared with a four - door petrol car assuming a petrol price of £ 2.35 per gallon , the Model S is equivalent to a conventionally powered car with a sticker price of about £ 23,000 .
Tesla also sells powertrain components to other automakers .
Far from keeping a lock on the technology , Tesla is actively helping competitors develop more affordable EVs and get them to customers faster .
Tesla works closely with Germany 's Daimler ( Mercedes - Benz 's parent company ) and is developing a fleet of electric Smart microcars for zero-emission urban commuting .
As Tesla amortises research and development costs , we are simultaneously swimming in the slipstream of the decreasing cost curve of lithium - ion battery cells .
For more than a decade , Li-ion costs have decreased conservatively 8 - 10 % per year .
Such patterns are well known in Silicon Valley , where other technology companies helped transform cell phones , laptop computers and flat - screen televisions into mainstream commodities .
Tesla has already delivered more than 350 cars to customers , and about 1,000 more people are on the Roadster waiting list .
There 's clearly pent - up demand for a green car that outperforms Porsches and Ferraris .
And with more than 700 reservations for the Model S in the first two weeks after its launch , we 're learning that demand for more affordable EVs is even stronger than we expected .
Toyota introduced the Prius more than a decade ago .
Since then , rivals have launched competing products , yet Toyota retains by far the largest hybrid market share .
Automakers are now busy making EV and range - extended EV prototypes ; the industry is racing to democratise EVs .
We will get there , but only with help from affluent early adopters .

Mr Stevens first entered the US Senate in 1968
A judge has overturned Alaska Senator Ted Stevens 's conviction for corruption because of mistakes made by prosecutors during his trial .
The ruling follows a request by officials at the US justice department for the conviction to be reversed .
In October 2008 , a jury found Mr Stevens , a Republican , guilty of lying about gifts and free home renovations he received from an oil company .
Mr Stevens went on to lose his Senate re-election battle the following month .
He was the longest - serving Republican senator , having first entered the chamber in 1968 .
' Cloud removed '
US District Judge Emmet Sullivan said the prosecutors ' misconduct during the trial was the most serious he had ever seen .
" In nearly 25 years on the bench , I 've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I 've seen in this case , " he said .
Prosecutors made a number of errors during the trial , justice department officials said , the chief among which was the failure to make available notes of a crucial interview in which a witness made a statement that contradicted evidence he gave later under oath .
Justice Sullivan has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the justice department 's trial team for possible criminal contempt charges .
" I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed , " Mr Stevens said in a statement .
" That day has finally come .
It is unfortunate that an election was affected by proceedings now recognised as unfair . "
Smokers with high levels of a carcinogen byproduct ( NNAL ) are at higher risk of developing lung cancer .
Overview
Smoking is a lot like Russian roulette :
You never know who will end up developing lung cancer and who wo n't .
But Dr. Jian - Min Yuan , as well as other researchers from the University of Minnesota , say they are one step closer to determining a smoker 's risk for developing the disease .
In a study , they tracked the carcinogen and nicotine levels in nearly 500 smokers through a simple urine test and discovered a link between the level of a specific carcinogen and lung cancer .
Their findings were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference .
Questions & answers
Why did researchers track only the levels of one carcinogen ?
We all know that tobacco smoke is bad :
It 's loaded with 60 different carcinogens , which cause all sorts of health risks .
There is one carcinogen in particular that researchers suspected for years contributed to human lung cancer .
But there were never any scientific human studies showing this relationship .
This carcinogen is known as NNK .
It releases into your body when you inhale smoke , quickly passes through the liver , gets metabolized and releases NNAL , a byproduct of NNK , into the bloodstream .
University of Minnesota researchers were tracking the NNAL levels via urine samples .
Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings »
How much did a person have to smoke to develop high levels of NNAL ?
The exact amount is a little tricky to determine because a lot depends on how honest a person is about how many cigarettes he or she smoked per day .
Additionally , the type of cigarette and how deeply a person inhales could affect the amount of carcinogens in the body .
Researchers say a person with high levels of NNAL and high levels of nicotine ( equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day ) is 8.5 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with a smoker with lower levels .
While the researchers point out that not everyone who has a high level of NNAL is going to develop lung cancer , it does help assign a number to a risk that was hard to quantify before .
Is n't smoking bad for you regardless ?
What is the benefit of having this type of information ?
There is nothing healthy about smoking .
Even if this test pegs you at low risk of developing lung cancer , it does n't mean you wo n't develop a dozen other cancers commonly cause by smoking .
If you smoke , the No. 1 thing you should do is quit .
But that is easier said than done .
If it were easy , 23 percent of adults in the United States would not smoke regularly .
One benefit of knowing whether a smoker is at increased risk for lung cancer is for his or her doctor to screen the person regularly for abnormalities , in the hopes of catching the cancer early .
Lung cancer is but one consequence of smoking , so this type of testing is not going to fix everything .
But as far as lung cancer goes , it may give people a better idea of when and how often to get screened .
Background
We spoke to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld , deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society , to put this study in perspective for the everyday smoker .
Here is an excerpt of our interview :
How significant is this research ?
" This is a very well done scientific study , but still in the very early stages .
I think the big story here is that they were able to find a relationship between the more carcinogen a person has in their body and the more risk they have of developing lung cancer .
So the more you smoke , the higher your risk .
And although we 've known that for years , this is the first big scientific proof of that relationship .
" Right now , we do n't know why some smokers get lung cancer and some do n't .
This study says that we 've established that there is a relationship between this specific carcinogen and how your body metabolizes it .
It seems to be a pretty clear predictive value : the higher level , higher the lung cancer risk .
" The natural tendency is for people to read studies like this research and want to go to the office next year to be tested , but it 's nowhere near this yet .
Just use your common knowledge for now .
You do n't need to get a urine test to tell you that if you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day , you are at increased risk for lung cancer . "
What is your bottom line advice for smokers ?
" The reality is , no matter how many studies are conducted , we are never going to [ predict ] that certain people are immune to cancer .
We may find people who develop it when they 've had little exposure , and some people who get it after smoking for 20 years .
We often like to pigeonhole things but there are so many unknowns and variables .
I can tell you that I do n't know one doctor that would tell a patient to ' keep smoking because you have a low level of NNAL in your body . '
Even if your risk is low for lung cancer , it may be high for heart disease .
" So if you smoke , it is time to quit .

' Green initiative ' by Charles will cost £ 80,000 and leave 53 - ton carbon footprint as he flies in 12 - seat private jet
Prince Charles is being accused of hypocrisy after it was revealed that he is chartering a luxury private jet for a five - day tour of Europe to promote environmental issues .
The Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall , plus ten Clarence House staff , will fly from London to Rome this evening .
Then they will fly on to Venice and Berlin , before returning to Britain .
Clarence House aides stress that the trip is at the request of the Government to promote its climate change policies .
But instead of using scheduled flights , the Royal party has hired a private plane , thought to be an Airbus A319 .
Not so green : Charles and Camilla leave a private jet in Uganda in 2007
According to experts from the Carbon Managers company , which carries out environmental audits , the aircraft 's four European flights over 2,200 miles will leave a carbon footprint of 52.95 tons - nearly five times the average person 's 11 - ton footprint for an entire year .
Each member of Charles 's party will leave a carbon footprint of 4.41 tons - 13 times more than if they had used a scheduled flight on the same type of plane , which can carry up to 156 passengers .
The flights on the specially converted jet , which boasts a master suite with its own lavatory and shower , will cost an estimated £ 80,000 - five times more than business - class fares on scheduled airlines .
Scheduled flights would cost £ 1,525 per person , a total of £ 15,250 for the Royal party .
They could have included a British Airways flight from London to Rome ( £ 200 ) , Alitalia from Rome to Venice ( £ 528 economy , no business class available ) , Lufthansa from Venice to Berlin ( £ 597 ) , and BA from Berlin to London ( £ 200 ) .
Last night Clarence House refused to confirm which type of plane Prince Charles was using or how much it would cost .
He used an Airbus A319 on a controversial 16,000 - mile tour of South America in February as part of his crusade against global warming .
The latest row comes after Prince Andrew - dubbed Air Miles Andy and the Junket of York - was accused of suppressing a report over the cost of his taxpayer - funded trips as Britain 's business ambassador .
Liberal Democrat Transport Spokesman Norman Baker said : ' Prince Charles seems not to realise that he enormously weakens his case for tackling climate change by his own profligate and careless habits .
' It is deeply unattractive to have somebody lecturing you on climate change when they are one of the greatest emitters of carbon themselves .
' When you couple Prince Charles 's private jets with Prince Andrew 's helicopters , you cannot help but think that the Royal Family is part of the carbon problem rather than part of the carbon solution . '
Royal aides insisted last night that Charles and Camilla had planned to use a jet from No 32 ( The Royal ) Squadron , until the aircraft developed a technical fault on Friday .
Loopy : The Prince 's route
But sources at an Italian military airfield near Rome , where the Royal couple will land , said they had been told several days ago that a private charter would be used .
Charles and Camilla will be met in Rome tonight by Britain 's Ambassador to Italy , Edward Chaplin , and his wife Nicola .
A fleet of cars will take their party the 30 - minute drive into the city centre .
The Royal couple will stay in the ornate Imperial Bedroom of the Quirinale Palace , where the Queen slept on her last visit to Italy in 2000 .
Tomorrow , Charles will give a keynote speech on climate change to the Italian parliament .
From there , the Royal party will travel to the Vatican - again in a fleet of cars - where Charles will discuss the environment with Pope Benedict XVI .
This , Charles 's first meeting with the Pontiff , will have added interest .
Several years ago , the Prince expressed concern about the position of the Roman Catholic Church on population matters .
The Vatican is opposed to contraception .
After his meeting with the Pope , Charles will take part in a ' green initiative ' at Villa Wolkonsky , Ambassador Chaplin 's residence , before boarding the private jet to fly to Venice .
There Charles will focus on urban regeneration and the environment before visiting the newly restored La Fenice Opera House where , with Camilla , he will watch a performance of Gaetano Donizetti's tragic work , Mary Stuart .
A Clarence House spokesman said : ' The Prince and Duchess undertake overseas visits to promote British interests at the request of the Government . '
Fury over Royal tax break
Alistair Darling has been criticised for giving Prince Charles a tax break in the Budget .
The move means the taxpayer will now cover a significant proportion of the costs of official duties carried out by Prince William and Prince Harry .
At present , Charles employs a six - strong team of aides for his sons out of his £ 16 million - a - year income .
He will now be able to deduct their salaries from his annual tax return , saving him hundreds of thousands of pounds .
Labour MP Ian Davidson said : ' At a time of great economic difficulty , one of the richest men in the kingdom is being given a special deal .
I am surprised that the Chancellor chose to do it .'
Mysteriez ! -
Try to find all the numbers .
Take a good look everywhere and try to be faster then other players .
Have fun !

A hacker claims to have broken into Steve Jobs ’ private Amazon.com account .
The hacker is trying to sell details of Jobs ’ Amazon.com account to journalists , including Jobs ’ purchase history for several years and his credit card number .
According to the hacker , who identifies himself as “ orin0 co , ” Jobs is an avid online shopper .
Jobs has purchased 20,000 items from Amazon.com in the last 10 years , the hacker says .
That ’s 2,000 items a year , or more than 5 items a day , every day .
“ I got myself a hold of this information , ” the hacker wrote in an email sent from a secure Hushmail account .
“ No one else has it .
I did n’t misuse it , otherwise Mr. Jobs would long ago change his login detail , would n’t he ? ”

The hacker said the scam is an embarrassment for Apple , which claims Macs are less susceptible to “ viruses , crashes and headaches . ”
( See Apple ’s new “ Elimination ” ad ) .
“ Imagine how safe Mac is if you can trick the mighty Steve Jobs , ” orin0 co wrote .
If true , Jobs would be the latest victim of so - called “ whaling ” or “ spear phishing ” attacks : online scams carefully targeted to snare high - worth victims like well - known CEOs or celebrities .
Ryan Olson , director of the Rapid Response Team at iDefense , the security company that publicized whaling in June last year , said it was possible that Jobs had fallen victim to a targeted attack .
“ Yeah , I think it ’s plausible , ” he said .
“ It would not be hard to get a lot of his information because he ’s a celebrity . ”
Apple did n’t respond to requests confirming or denying the orin0 co ’s claims , or a request for comment .
Amazon.com said it had no knowledge whether Jobs ’ account had been compromised or not .
“ I had not heard any rumors about Steve Jobs ’ Amazon account being compromised as a result of a phish , ” said Patty Smith , director of Amazon.com ’s corporate communications , in an email .
“ We have a good deal of information on our web site designed to educate our customers about the various phishing scams , and ways that they can protect themselves . ”
( Here ’s the link ) .
The hacker claimed that neither Jobs nor Amazon knew about his break in because it had n’t been detected .
He sent a screenshot of what appears to be Jobs ’ account at Amazon.com .
The screenshot shows three purchases , although details have been blanked out : A Blu - Ray DVD , a HBO miniseries on DVD , and a copy of The Nuclear Express , a history of the nuclear bomb .
Here ’s the screenshot .
Hit the thumbnail for the fullsize version .
Whaling attacks reached a peak in the Spring last year , iDefense claims , when a pair of professional hacker gangs targeted senior executives at companies , legal firms and government agencies .
Instead of spamming millions with scattershot email scams , the gangs targeted high - worth corporate executives with cleverly - crafted emails full of personal details .
The executives received messages that appeared to come from the Better Business Bureau , Internal Revenue Service , or Federal Trade Commission , among others .
Following a link , or opening an attachment , the phony email installed a keylogger or even the full Apache server on the victim ’s machine .
The crooks would then monitor the computer for corporate and bank passwords .
The scam claimed more than 15,000 corporate victims in 15 months , iDefense said , and netted “ millions of dollars . ”
There were 10 million victims of identity fraud in the U.S. in 2008 , according to a report from Javelin Research ( PDF ) .
Amazon.com is a frequent target of phishing attacks .
However , there ’s a few things that make orin0 co ’s story fishy .
The biggest problem is there ’s no proof .
Apple is n’t talking .
It seems unlikely that Jobs would fall for such an elementary scam , and screenshots are easily faked .
Nor does it seem likely that Jobs is such an out - of - control online shopper ; 20,000 items beggars belief .
In addition , the screenshot , which purportedly shows Jobs ’ most recently purchased items , includes only three purchases over the busy holiday period , and the last visible purchase is dated October 2008 .
Nonetheless , here ’s the email exchange with orin0 co :

Hash : SHA1 Hi ,
The reason am writing to you is that your book is among first to
sell in amazon :
http://www.amazon.co.uk/steve-jobs-Books/s?ie=UTF8&keywords=Steve%20Jobs&rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3ASteve%20Jobs&page=1
I will try to be as short as possible : 2 years ago , I set a amazon.com fake page , and sent emails to different IT people around the globe .
Among some other unknown person , Steve Jobs got my mail , he did n’t notice the scam I set so he “ updated ” his amazon account with data ( name , address , credit card number , phone , amazon user and password ) which I received , sent to my mail .
Now , it was not my intention to misuse his account ( which is still untouched ! ) , the sole purpose was if the “ scam ” was so perfect that even IT Guru ’s will fall on it .
I saw you are the bestseller with a book on S.Jobs , I still have access on his amazon.com account , with all his purchase / interest details for 6 - 7 years .
Now I just checked again , and he did n’t use it since December 22 last year , for reasons known to us .
I intent to sell this information , that ’s why I picked you as first on the list .
If you are not interested , am sure other book authors on SJ life ( Jeffrey Young , William Simon , Alan Deutschman , Anthony Imbimbo , Daniel Lyons or any others ) will be very interested to know about this .
Hope to hear from you , Regards p.s. I can provide “ print screens ” logged in SJ amazon account .

This was initiated by the alarming situation in North Korea .
The US Army has over 35,000 troops stationed in South Korea , well within reach of North Korean convential weapons .
North Korea has the largest artillery force can be equipped with nuclear warheads in the world , which adds more to the already tense situation .

Casey : Army would have to ‘ shift gears ’ for N. Korea battle
By Jeff Schogol , Stars and Stripes
Pacific edition , Saturday , May 30 , 2009
WASHIGTON – It would take the Army time to “ shift gears ” if it needed to fight against North Korea , Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey said Thursday .
Right now , the Army is focused on the counterinsurgency efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan , but North Korea ’s recent saber rattling has raised the prospect that the Army might be called upon to fight a conventional war .
“ I have said publicly for some time that if we had to shift gears , it would probably take us about 90 days or so to shift our gears and to train the folks up that were preparing to go to Iraq and Afghanistan to go someplace else , ” Casey said after a speech at a Washington think tank .
That does n’t mean that it would take at least 90 days to send reinforcements to U.S. troops in South Korea , Casey said . [ … ] via Casey : Army would have to ‘ shift gears ’ for N. Korea battle | Stars and Stripes .

CREATING life in the primordial soup may have been easier than we thought .
Two essential elements of RNA have finally been made from scratch , under conditions similar to those that likely prevailed during the dawn of life .
The question of how a molecule capable of storing genetic information – even DNA ’s simpler cousin RNA – could ever have arisen spontaneously in the primordial cooking pot has perplexed scientists for decades .
RNA consists of a long chain composed of four different types of ribonucleotides , which each consist of a nitrogenous base , a sugar and a phosphate .
Most people assumed that these three components …
Are We Ready for a Solar Katrina ?
Solar storms could damage power grid with devastating consequences .
April 21 , 2009  --
More than a million people without power .
The distribution of drinkable water disrupted .
Transportation , communication and banking upset .
Trillions of dollars in damage .
Hurricanes , blizzards and other earthly tempests are n't the only natural forces with the potential to sow catastrophe .
Severe weather in the sun 's outer atmosphere could knock out much of the country 's power grid , incapacitate navigational systems and jeopardize spacecraft , scientists say .
While the odds of a solar disaster are relatively small , scientists warn that we need to ramp up our defenses against solar storms , especially given our increasing dependence on technology that is so susceptible to radiation from the sun .
" It 's one of those events that is of low probability but high consequence , " Dr. Roberta Balstad , a research scientist with Columbia University 's Center for Research on Environmental Decisions .
" The consequences could be extreme . "
And Balstad and her colleagues emphasize that we 've seen those extreme consequences before .
Solar Storms Cause Blackouts , Impair Communications
In 1859 , a solar storm , also known as the Carrington event ( after the astronomer Richard Carrington , who first recognized the cause ) fried the telegraph system .
Another powerful space weather event in 1989 caused a blackout in Quebec , Canada .
Other storms have led to diverted airplanes and impaired telecommunications satellites .
Earlier this year , a group of experts from around the country , including Balstad , issued a report to the National Academies of Sciences on the economic and social impacts of solar storms .
The point of the report was to raise awareness and encourage the government and private businesses to prepare for the long - term consequences of a major event .
" We tend to think that we 're in control of nature , but we 're not , " she said .
" What we need to pay attention to is our total dependence in all parts of lives on the electric grid , which is vulnerable .
...
If there is some kind of disruption , we need to be ready to deal with it . "
In the face of a " space weather " Katrina , she said we would n't be prepared .
The direct result of a space storm would be the breakdown of the electrical grid , the report warned .
John Kappenman , an analyst with Metatech Corporation , a company that studies the effect of electromagnetic interference on power systems , said in the report that damaged transformers take a long time to repair .
Restoring Power Grid Could Take More Than 12 Months
In well - documented cases involving heat failures in the transformers that undergird the power system , he said it has taken 12 months or more to replace the damaged units with new ones .
According to the NAS report , " Collateral effects of a longer - term outage would likely include , for example , disruption of the transportation , communication , banking , and finance systems , and government services ; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure ; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration . "
The loss of services , it said , would spill over from one region of the country to the entire nation and potentially lead to international implications .
The price tag of such a calamity ?
Several trillion dollars per year , the report said .
Worst - Case Scenario Is Unlikely
But scientists emphasize that this situation is improble .
Michael Kaiser , project scientist for NASA 's Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory ( STEREO ) mission , told ABCNews.com that he does n't think it 's likely that a doomsday situation will unfold .
Even though he acknowledged the devastation previous storms had caused , he said that were storms of equal magnitude to hit now , power grid operators could adjust the system to mitigate harm if they had enough notice .
" People who run the power grids on the ground could probably lower the amount of power they 're carrying , " he said .
He also said that given how quiet the sun has been recently , he does n't expect a powerful solar storm anytime soon .
The sun 's activity waxes and wanes in an 11 - year cycle .
Right now , he said , the sun is experiencing the deepest minimum in about a century .
But , he said , in the next few years , as the sun approaches the peak of its cycle , the possibility for interference increases , especially considering we have launched more spacecraft and rely more heavily on technology .
He emphasized that the airlines , the oil and gas industry , agriculture companies and others are dependent on technology that is vulnerable to the sun 's volatility .
For example , he said , highway companies , agro- business and deep sea drilling rigs rely on precision GPS technology .
Solar interference could knock them off about 100 yards , and even that could have a negative effect on their operations .
We 're More Susceptible but ' We 're Getting Smarter '
He and his colleagues are working to predict sun storms with the same accuracy as meteorologists who predict hurricanes but said they can only forecast about 12 to 17 hours in advance .
Given the potential impact of the storms , they 're working to refine their systems .
" It takes a less intense storm to do some damage , " he said .
" On the other hand , we 're getting smarter now . "

Jeremy one thing that bothers me about Miss Prejean is that she is blowing off the Miss California officials yet begs the Trump not to take her crown .
Why wont she quit if the job of Miss California is too much trouble ?
Heck Keith and Shanna say even her cell phone is answered by her pastor rather than Miss Prejean .

Sorry I did n't make that clear .

Patrick : Nah , you were clear enough .
I was just making sure , since I figured all of them " pissed you off " equally . :-)

It 's quite an obvious tug of war between Carrie 's handlers ( including ones that have materialized in the last 3 weeks ) and the Trump people .
Maybe it's a good thing if she 's back in the fold , as she may have received a strong cease & desist in regards to working with groups like NOM , etc .
And that way the martyr parade stops and so does the bigotry .
Maybe wishful thinking ?

Olbermann really nailed it ( her ) !
Her pouty / whiny ass tearing up because her first amendment rights were being stripped ( like her blouse from her fake , bare titty ) away from her !
The only way her first amendment rights could be stripped from her is if the government attempted to do it .
That people disagree with her , or hurt her wittle feelwings has nothing to do with her ability to be as inarticulate as her less - than - brilliant ( bare bunned ) ass wants to be .

I can't believe this person is still - STILL - playing herself as a victim .
What I find galling is the way she claims her right to free speech was violated .
People whose right to free speech is being taken away do n't appear on the Today show !
No , honey : they violated your made - up right to make any statement you want and expect there not to be consequences .
If she can't handle having a celebrity blogger ( I mean come ON , it 's Perez Hilton ! ) respond to something she said , she is obviously in way over her head .
Joe Salmonese had a good point on Hardball tonight : if this is the best their side can do , we do n't have much to worry about .

Last night Sen. John McCain ’s daughter Meghan addressed the Log Cabin Republicans .
In her speech , which barely made mention of gay issues , she spoke about how old school Republicans are scared shitless about the future .
She called for Republicans to stop embracing divisive issues and become more progressive .
She described what she has seen since she ventured into politics after the 2008 elections , “ I did not expect my frustration with what I perceive to be overly partisan and divisive Republicans to cause a national incident .
And no , I ’m not that engaged with myself to think it was even that much of an incident .
People in our country have much more important issues to deal with on a daily basis .
But the experience did reinforce what I learned on the campaign trail in some major ways .
I ’ll summarize them in three points :
Most of our nation wants our nation to succeed , most people are ready to move on to the future , not live in the past , and most of the old school Republicans are scared shitless of that future . ”
McCain described the GOP as unwilling to move towards the future , ” I believe most of our nation wants our nation to succeed .
I feel too many Republicans want to cling to past successes .
There are those who think we can win the White House and Congress back by being “ more ” conservative .
Worse , there are those who think we can win by changing nothing at all about what our party has become .
They just want to wait for the other side to be perceived as worse than us .
I think we ’re seeing a war brewing in the Republican Party .
But it is not between us and Democrats .
It is not between us and liberals .
It is between the future and the past .
I believe most people are ready to move on to that future . ”

She stressed that Twitter is not the answer , “ Simply embracing technology is n’t going to fix our problem either .
Republicans using Twitter and Facebook is n’t going to miraculously make people think we ’re cool again .
Breaking free from obsolete positions and providing real solutions that do n’t divide our nation further WILL .
That ’s why some in our party are scared .
They sense the world around them is changing and they are unable to take the risk to jump free of what ’s keeping our party down . ”
McCain laid out her definition of a progressive Republican , “ What I am talking about tonight is what it means to be a new , progressive Republican .
Now some will say I ca n’t do that .
If you are n’t this and that , then you ’re clearly a “ Republican in Name Only , ” also affectionately known as a RINO , suggesting the notion that one can be faithful to the original core values of the GOP while open to the realities of our changing world has really hit a chord with people .
And it seems to be the next , natural stage of the journey I ’ve been traveling . ”
She described a shift in the GOP , “ It would be easy to say my generation views politics very differently from others .
Maybe we ’re more progressive , socially liberal or just hate arguing in lieu of actually solving the problems at hand .
But what I ’ve learned though my experience is that these feelings are not contained to one age group .
They ’re the growing beliefs and desires of people of all ages , races , genders , faiths , persuasions and political parties . ”
It is obvious that the Republican leadership is scared out of their minds .
This is why they have been getting more paranoid since the election of Barack Obama .
McCain is also correct in pointing out that moving more to the right is not going to work for the GOP .
If her attitude is a reflection of her generation , you can see why Obama appeals to young people .
He talks about politics as problem solving .
It is not surprising that one of the few Republicans who understand their current predicament best is a 24 year old who has watched her father ’s career from the sidelines .
Of course , the GOP will reject Meghan McCain ’s ideas , and they will continue to lose elections , because they are n’t ready to move forward yet .

In what is not particularly surprising , February jobs data shows continued losses .
And , equally unsurprising , small business and medium sized business were the categories that suffered the most .
The Financial Times reports on the losses according to business size :
Mid-sized and small businesses suffered the most job cuts last month ,
shedding 314,000 and 262,000 workers respectively .
Large companies –
those with more than 500 employees – cut 121,000 jobs .
This offers continued evidence that more needs to be done in order to help small business owners survive .
Even though the " big guys " are in the news a lot , the fact of the matter is that small business and medium sized business does most of the employing in this country .
Perhaps its time to focus on bolstering the smaller businesses so that they do not have to keep making layoffs .

Dontcha know ?
North Dakota has the most job opportunities , per capita , in the country .
Last month , we showed you the most financially happy states when we released the MainStreet.com Happiness Index .
Now , we ’re bringing you this inaugural edition of the MainStreet.com Job Opportunity Index to show you where the jobs are .
According to the MainStreet.com Job Opportunity
Index , the jobs are not in the most populous states such as New York and California but are in the less densely populated middle of America .
North Dakota , the 3rd least populous state in the U.S. , took the top spot on the Index while New York came in at # 35 , Illinois ranked # 36 , and California landed at # 44 .
The Job Opportunity Index , which ranks all 50 states and the District of Columbia , looked at two factors in determining which states offer the greatest employment opportunity : available jobs in a given state ( relative to state population ) , and the unemployment rate in each state .
To estimate the number of available jobs per state , MainStreet partnered with Indeed.com , one of the most comprehensive job search sites on the web .
Indeed.com aggregates millions of job postings from thousands of web sites and serves more than 12 million job seekers a month .
In the face of a rising national unemployment rate , the Job Opportunity Index illustrates that companies are , in fact , hiring and points to the states which represent the best markets for job hunters .
“ The most important thing to know is that there are jobs out there , ” says Paul Forster , CEO and co-founder of Indeed.com .
“ Even though there may be no net growth in jobs through the economy , companies are always looking to replace people who have left .
People should remain optimistic , because there are jobs available as you ’ll see from any search on Indeed.com . ”
But , not all job markets are created equal .
North Dakota finished first with the 10th highest number of job opportunities in the nation and the lowest unemployment rate in the U.S. Wyoming ( # 2 ) and Virginia ( # 3 ) , also featuring high numbers of opportunities and low unemployment , followed closely behind .
( Given that our Happiness Index suggested that Nebraska , Iowa and Kansas are the most financially happy states , we here at MainStreet wo n't be surprised if there is a population surge in the heartland ! )
Meanwhile , Michigan , due to the troubled auto industry and continuing layoffs , was at the bottom of the list , preceded by Oregon ( #50 ) and Indiana ( # 49 ) .
One metropolitan area , the nation ’s capital and surrounding states , represented mixed and interesting results .
Washington D.C. , Virginia and Maryland have the highest numbers of available jobs but , while Virginia ( #3 ) and Maryland ( # 5 ) finished close to the top of the Index , Washington D.C. finished in the middle at # 22 .
Washington D.C. , even with the largest number of job openings per capita by far – thanks , in part , to the large volume of government jobs the region enjoys – was weighed down on the Index by one of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
For a deeper analysis into a comparison of the country ’s largest national metro areas showing the most job opportunities , take a look at Indeed ’s latest job trends heat map .
See the chart below ( and our accompanying Job Opportunity Slideshow with images of the 10 worst and the 10 best states ) for the full breakdown of the MainStreet.com Job Opportunity Index and be sure to check back next month for an update .

JERUSALEM , May 21 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. administration of President Barack Obama will not force Israel to state publicly whether it has nuclear weapons , an Israeli official said on Thursday .
He said Washington would stick to a decades - old U.S. policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell " .
Obama 's bid to curb Iran 's nuclear programme through diplomacy has stirred speculation that , as part of a regional disarmament regimen , Israel could be asked to come clean on its own secret capabilities .
But a senior Israeli diplomat , speaking after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held his first summit with Obama in Washington this week , said : " This has never happened , nor will it happen with this administration . "
That U.S. message had been conveyed , the diplomat said , " on the various levels of our bilateral talks " .
Israel is widely believed to have procured the Middle East 's only nuclear weapons .
It neither confirms nor denies this , under an " ambiguity " policy billed as deterring foes while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can trigger arms races .
Historians say that the Nixon administration forged a tacit policy of not pressing Israel on the matter .
The official American reticence angers Iran -- which denies seeking the bomb -- as well as the Arab world .

Obama to Worship Jesus with Homosexual Child Molesters
Everyone Is Lying ^ |

Posted on by Mathias Brinkley
My countrymen , it is a dark time for those of us that know how fiendish the homosexual agenda in this country really is .
Iowa and Vermont .
Now the news breaks that Obama the Shadow King is inviting homosexual couples to his Easter Party at the White House .
Truly an epic perversion of American cultural values , all across our nation .
---
The White House is allocating tickets for the upcoming Easter Egg Roll to gay and lesbian parents as part of the Obama administrations outreach to diverse communities .
Families say the gesture shows that the new Democratic administration values them as equal to other families .
And for many , being included in the annual tradition - dating to 1878 - renews hope that they will have more support in their quest for equal rights in matters such as marriage and adoption than under the previous administration .

Theyve taken our money and now they re brainwashing our culture .

The Real Story Behind Rev. Wright 's Controversial Black Liberation Theology Doctrine
Monday , May 5 , 2008
FoxNews / Hannity 's America
[ special Friday night edition - - original airdate May 2 , 2008 ] ( some key excerpts ) [ " ( Jose ) Diaz - Balart is the son of Rafael Diaz - Balart y Guitierrez ( a former Cuban politician ) .
He has three bothers , Rafael Diaz - Balart ( a banker ) , Mario Diaz - Balart ( a US Congressman ) and Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( also a US Congressman ) .
His aunt , Mirta Diaz - Balart , was Fidel Castro 's first wife . "
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Diaz-Balart]
JOSE DIAZ - BALART , TELEMUNDO NETWORK : " Liberation theology in Nicaragua in the mid-1980's was a pro-Sandinista , pro-Marxist , anti-U.S. , anti-Catholic Church movement .
That 's it .
No ifs , ands , or buts .
His church apparently supported , in the mid-'80s in Nicaragua , groups that supported the Sandinista dictatorships and that were opposed to the Contras whose reason for being was calling for elections .
That 's all I know .
I was there .
I saw the churches in Nicaragua that he spoke of , and the churches were churches that talked about the need for violent revolution and I remember clearly one of the major churches in Managua where the Jesus Christ on the altar was not Jesus Christ , he was a Sandinista soldier , and the priests talked about the corruption of the West , talked about the need for revolution everywhere , and talked about ' the evil empire ' which was the United States of America . "
REV .
BOB SCHENCK , NATIONAL CLERGY COUNCIL : " it 's based in Marxism .
At the core of his [ Wright 's ] theology is really an anti-Christian understanding of God , and as part of a long history of individuals who actually advocate using violence in overthrowing those they perceive to be oppressing them , even acts of murder have been defended by followers of liberation theology .

SCHENCK : " I was actually the only person escorted to Dr. Wright .
He asked to see me , and I simply welcomed him to Washington , and then I said Dr. Wright , I want to bring you a warning : your embrace of Marxist liberation theology .
It is contrary to the Gospel , and you need , sir , to abandon it .
And at that he dropped the handshake and made it clear that he was not in the mood to dialogue on that point . "

There is no one man that can take down America , save Jesus Christ of course , and the Antichrist , if permitted to do so by God .
The whole idea of America not surviving is ridiculous .
Perhaps the country may look different than how it is today , but half of us are for preserving it as our founders intended .
It takes a lot to destroy 50 % , and that ’s what it would take .
That is n’t going to happen , 150 million people in a country that has taught them God gives us life and the right to protect it , are n’t just going away without fighting for their lives .

Name two ( child molesters ) that will be there , with proof they have molested children .
The literalism of the post may have been a little over the top , but the sentiment is accurate .
Homosexuals are exponentially more promiscuous than folks of normal sexuality , often dangerously so , many times admitting to hundreds of anonymous sexual partners over a lifetime .
It has been openly admitted , by homosexuals themselves , that homosexuals , even in " committed " relationships , are still highly promiscuous , having regular consensual outside sexual forays - expected and considered " normal " within this debased sub-culture .
Indeed , sexual libertinism is considered their proper birthright .
Tell me how a child thrust , without any consent of his own , into this world of admitted sexual license and debauchery can escape the undeniable nature of this worldview paraded proudly by deviants ?
Molesters ?
Open to debate .
Abusers ?
DEFINITELY !

You know , I 'm no big queer fan , but when you have to resort to lying to make your point you lose all credibility .
Unless you have some information that would indicate that actual child molesters have been invited to the White House , you do nothing but disservice to those who oppose the homosexual agenda on an honest level .
You should be glad that I 'm not a mod because I would zot your ass faster than you could make up your next ridiculous headline to pimp your blog .

I find it beyond stunning that Obama would deliberately try to mix militant homosexual activists with young impressionable children on one of the most holy days of the year .

The season of teachers ' conferences is upon us , the time when their representatives grab headlines by saying what hell it is being a teacher .
Given their timing , I would love to dismiss Bousted 's words as grumblings designed purely to squeeze more sympathy and money out of the Government .
It would boost my sense of being a force to be reckoned with if I could summon the self - righteousness to barge into Ms Bousted 's office , grab her by the lapels and berate her ( and her colleagues ) for not doing a better job .
But the awful thing is that I fear she is right .
We parents – even those of us who do n't have the excuse of being single or trapped in poverty – are handing schools a headache in the form of our adored , wilful little treasures .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to create an independent commission to investigate the cause of the worst U.S. economic crisis in decades .
A street sign can be seen outside the New York Stock Exchange in New York March 11 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
“ The only way to get an objective evaluation of where mistakes were made is to create an independent commission of experts to ask what went right , what went wrong and what could we have done to prevent this , ” said Republican Senator Johnny Isakson , a chief sponsor of the measure .
On a vote of 92 - 4 , the Senate approved the measure as an amendment to a bipartisan bill headed toward anticipated passage that would crack down on financial fraud .
Both the House and Senate would have to pass legislation to create a commission before it could be signed into law by President Barack Obama .
“ The commission ... will investigate wrongdoing and help establish rules to help shore up our national economy and ensure this never happens again , ” said Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , another chief sponsor .
The 10 - member , bipartisan Financial Markets Commission would be modeled after the 9 - 11 Commission , which investigated failures leading up to the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States and made recommendations on how to avoid another such assault .
The commission would have subpoena power , 18 months to investigate the financial crisis and the authority to refer to the U.S. attorney general and state attorneys general any evidence that institutions or individuals violated the law .
At the end of its probe , the commission would report its findings and recommendations to Congress .
Members of the commission would be appointed by congressional Democratic and Republican leaders .
They would include financial experts and exclude members of Congress .
House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer earlier on Wednesday voiced support for creation of such a commission .
“ A commission certainly could be useful , ” Hoyer told reporters , adding “ We are moving in that direction . ”
The overall Senate bill would extend federal fraud laws to mortgage lending businesses , which the U.S. government does not now regulate or insure .
The bill would give the Justice Department $ 165 million a year for 2010 and 2011 to hire investigators and prosecutors to fight fraud .
The bill would also give extra funds to the Securities and Exchange Commission , the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and other agencies to fight fraud .

Fuck you Dick Cheney !
I just peeked out from behind my couch to check the living room and I thought I saw khalid Sheikh Mohammed with a nuke in his hand , no wait , that 's just a fucking chair .
But take heart my dear friends , that chair will not be hurting Americans in the near future .
I waterboarded it and it gave up the coffee table 's plot to stub my toe on Friday night .
Fuck , that was close .
After changing my shorts I started watching Dick again .
Wait , what ?
You are some kind of benevolent protector doing the difficult things to keep us safe ?
Fuck You !
You are a malevolent narcissistic asshole who is trying to tell us that we owe you a debt of gratitude for pissing on the ashes of the Constitution and getting us involved in wars that weaken our stance in the world both militarily and morally .
Fuck You !
We only waterboarded three of them ?
If you were doing everything you could , and waterboarding is n't a bad thing , why not more ?
Lets pick up people off the street and waterboard them just in case they are plotting the next 9/11 .
They might have a dirty bomb in their trunk .
We can't take that chance , Dick .
Fuck , I 'm scared .
" We ca n't just stop half of the terrorists with nukes from getting into America , we have to stop all of them ? "
Are you saying Obama wants us to get nuked ?
Fuck You !
Are you suggesting that torturing people is the only way to keep that from happening ?
Well then strap some electrodes to my balls , I 'm ready to do my part for national security .
But please , Dick , send Jack Bauer to do it , he 'll know when to stop .
We either have to do what you did or we 're fucked ?
It 's torture people , or 9/11 was one of a kind , or we 're fucked ?
Fuck You !
Putting terror suspects in supermax is supporting them ?
Fuck That !
Since when is Florence Colorado an Al Qaeida training camp ?!
Oh , and I do n't care what the fucking memos say !
How can I beleive a fucking word of it when you were fucking torturing the people who gave you the info ?
They could say that we thwarted a plot to kill Heidi and Spencer from the Hills , and it still could n't have less credibility to me .
They are memos written by people who needed a reason to justify torturing people containing content gained by said torture .
Are we fucking idiots !?
Do n't answer that , Dick , because I know what your answer is .
And since I know what you think of me , this is what I think of you .
FUCK YOU DICK CHENEY !!!

Update
My first time to the rec list !
Not that I normally write good diaries but I am a little suprised that it was this one .
Thanks everyone !
I think of you in the opposite fashion as I do Darth Cheney .
Update 2
WOW !
TOP of the rec list ?
You guys really do n't like Dick Cheney huh ?
Me I think he 's peachy .
OK , Let me just say this , I know that the Ray Comfort post I made last was a tad on the easy side … but , I mean , you ca n’t blame me for taking on a guy like this …. so much pride and assumption rolled into one little man…its just a temptation I can’t possibly refuse …. and now , I have even more for this guy .
This time I am gonna openly invite Mr. Comfort to this blog to engage me — I have a feeling he has already been here , so this should be pretty easy , but I ’m gonna make sure he knows that I am waiting for him by responding to one of his blog posts .
Secondly , I was perusing the inter - web the other day and I found this video linked on another Christian blog … it simply amazes me how Christians are eating this crap up , they really think these are good arguments … all I see is a fast talking salesman with an inch of magnetic hypnosis at the end .
Without further ado , here is the video :
im going to go through this with time stops … just follow along :
0:10 : you hear Ray saying “ I do n’t know exactly where it is but I do n’t wanna end up there , ” .
How sad to start off a video with fear mongering … now , we do n’t know for sure what the context is , because it is n’t given here , but my bet is on him talking about the fiery furnaces of hell ….. not a good start from a man that believes in a Loving Creator .
0:30 : Another analogy about a painting having a painter , or a building a builder ….his point , and he will get to it , is that CREATION …IE the world and everything in it and outside of it , must have had a creator ….
the main flaw in this argument is that , according to modern science , what we have is n’t defined as a Creation , it is a universe that is …a being or an existence …a result of cataclysmic events billions of years ago …starting off with the wrong definitions of what we have here — and eternally sticking to those guns is a sad mistake .
Mr. Comfort has a really hard time with definitions as far as I have seen–it gets worse as you go on .
If Creation were evidence for a Creator I have a hard time believing that the greatest scientific minds of our time would simply be covering that evidence up , simply because they want to keep searching for deeper and greater truths .
IF it were that simple , we would have stopped searching long ago , and simply adopted the Bible as the only necessary text book on science and reality …. that is n’t the case thankfully .
IF Creation is gods greatest evidence of himself , he did a really bad job — especially put in context with the Bible .
This creates , in my mind , a huge parallel between who god must be , and who god actually is if he exists .
On one side you have the all loving all knowing god that i struggled for so long to believe in and love , and on the other hand you are stuck dealing with a god that expects you to believe without providing any evidence …. my question is this :
Why love such a god … if that is god … screw him .
0:53 Scott , the Atheist , claims that he bets he could find the builder of that building , whilst Ray assures him that he ca n’t and that if he ca n ’t he must be wrong .
Scott , I am glad to say , is correct , that builder was indeed built by someone , and designed by someone …. if you go down the the Huntington Beach building records office , I can guarantee you will find records on not only the architect of the building , but the name of the construction company that did the building ….
1:55 : Humans breed like rabbits ?
Maybe in your family , but we try to avoid mutations in mine .
Ray here is claiming to know something that the Bible is clear about , that there were other people created at or near the time of Adam and Eve , because when Adams sons went to take wives they took them from other tribes .
( Gen 4:16 - 17 ) .
Most dispensationalists will admit this fact … most especially Finnis J. Dake — whom well qualifies himself .
2:04 : Begin Ad Hominem attacks against this guy .
Watch how Ray gets the audience on his side - by calling this man a murderer and adulterer to his face , at least Mr. Comfort does have some balls .
3:25 : Ray says , “ My opinion does n’t matter , ” further proof that some christian minds ca n’t tell the difference between fact and opinion , reality and belief .
3:56 more fear mongering … what if you are wrong about your eternal salvation ?
What if you are Mr. Comfort ?
5:15 : This is the most important part , what Ray is doing here is called Magnetism … this is a form of suggestive hypnosis that is incredibly easy to do .
I did it often as a Christian , and I am sure many of you did as well if you ever led people to Christ ( which i did a lot of ) .
What Ray is doing is setting the stage for this man to get home later on tonight and think about it , and at that time have an emotional conundrum … .
Ray is hoping that this man will be weak later on so that he might break down and ask for a sign or something like that .
This is a classic tactic used by Christians , Muslims , Apologists … almost anyone … .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints builds its entire church on this tactic , ” Read these verses and then pray to god that he give you a burning in the bosom if it is true , ” .
Damn right your bosom will burn , the thought has been implanted already .
Want to see the power of hypnotism ?
Check these videos out of an Atheist proving , through hypnosis , that god is real , to other atheists .
Darren Brown - Instant Conversion 1
Darren Brown - Instant Conversion 2
Scary huh ?
That ’s how easy this is .
The last thing that Ray asks Scott is about whether or not the Birds came about my accident …. once again proving that Ray does n’t understand definitions .
The Birds came about by cause and effect …. that was n’t an accident , and evolution does n’t teach that anything ever happened by accident … chance maybe , but never by accident .
This is just more of a Christian fundamentalist not understanding what he is detracting against .
Anyway , i hope you enjoyed this , please digg or stumble or technoratti this so that i can get it to the top of the charts to make sure that Ray sees it , and if you do see it Mr. Comfort , Please please use the Contact Me button at the top of the page and send me a message or email , we will set up a nice , friendly , rules followed debate between you and I .
Thanks

ORM in the PHP World
2009-05-21
Yesterday I gave a talk at the php|tek 2009 Conference about the ORM in the PHP World .
In the first part of the presentation , I 'm focusing on what an ORM is , what would make a great ORM , design patters for ORM and tying ORM systems to the PHP world in terms of philosophy , uses and approaches .
The second part of the presentation talks about a list of ORMs that I have seen and their pros and cons .
The ORMs I mention :
I plan on talking about each of these ORMs in detail in separate blog posts , so stay tuned !

The Mountain View giant , Google , became concerned about the fact the several of its executives left the company .
In order to stop losing talents , the number one search engine decided to come up with an algorithm that would identify employees that are more likely to quit .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Google developed the algorithm due to the fact that it was " concerned a brain drain could hurt its long - term ability to compete " .
The company analyzed information from the reviews of its employees as well as from their promotion and pay histories .
The goal was to identify among 20,000 workers , those who are more likely to quit the company , the newspaper wrote .
Laszlo Bock , who is responsible for running human resources department at Google , mentioned that the algorithm served as a tool that the company used to " get inside people 's heads even before they know they might leave " .
The Wall Street Journal said that the Google was unwilling to share detailed information about the formula , which is currently in the testing stage .
However , the its officials stated that they managed to identify a number of workers " who felt underused , a key complaint among those who contemplate leaving " .
Several current and former workers mentioned some of the reasons why people left Google , including low pay compared to what they could earn elsewhere , too much bureaucracy , poor management , poor mentoring , and a long - lasting hiring process ( more on why Google employees quit here ) .
It is worth mentioning that some of the talented employees that left the company include : Tim Armstrong , who held the position of a senior vice president , leaving Google in March and becoming the head of AOL ; display - advertising chief David Rosenblatt and Sukhinder Singh Cassidy , who was responsible for Asia - Pacific and Latin America branches .
In addition , a number of other employees left Google for Facebook and Twitter .
These are : the former lead designer for the company Doug Bowman , engineering director Steve Horowitz and search - quality chief Santosh Jayaram .

Charles Nesson is the William F. Weld Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and co-Founder of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society .
Together with a group of his students , he is defending Joel Tenenbaum , accused in federal court of sharing seven songs some years ago through KaZaA .
Due to the intense public interest surrounding the case , we have offered Professor Nesson the chance to lay out what 's at stake in his own words .
His views do not necessarily reflect those of Ars Technica .
Earlier this month my students stood in the rain for nearly seven hours in the heart of Harvard Square , raising money for and awareness of a lawsuit that has captured international attention .
My client is Joel Tenenbaum , a 25 - year old physics graduate student at Boston University , and he 's being sued by the music companies for sharing seven songs back in 2003 using KaZaA , a file - sharing network comprised of millions of his peers doing likewise .
The case has probably spent more time being discussed among the public than it has spent before judges .
And , quite frankly , that is the point .
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , which directs these lawsuits , will seek to prove that Joel downloaded those songs willfully and must therefore pay up to $ 1,050,000 to the record labels .
Joel has already been interrogated for nine hours straight in a forced deposition ; has been made to endure the depositions of his mother , father , sister , and friends ; and will be compelled to submit his current computer and his privacy to an " expert " of the RIAA 's choosing so they can make a mirror image of the hard drive for forensic analysis .
All this for seven songs ?
I believe that the RIAA litigation campaign against Joel and the millions of his generation like him is an unconstitutional abuse of law .
Imagine a law which , in the name of deterrence , provides for a $ 750 fine [ the lower threshold for statutory damages ] for each mile - per - hour that a driver exceeds the speed limit , with the fine escalating to $ 150,000 per mile over the limit if the driver knew she was speeding .
Raising awareness
Credit : D. Yvette Wohn
Imagine that the fines are not publicized , and most drivers do not know they exist .
Imagine that enforcement of the fines is put into the hands of a private , self - interested police force that has no political accountability , that can pursue any defendant it chooses at its own whim , that can accept or reject payoffs on the order of $ 3,000 to $ 7,000 in exchange for not prosecuting the tickets , and that pockets for itself all payoffs and fines .
Imagine that almost every single one of these fines goes uncontested , regardless of whether they have merit , because the individuals being fined have limited financial resources and little idea of whether they can prevail in a federal courtroom .
The intersection between technological norms and law that governs social norms is one of the most academically interesting and practically frustrating issues professionals have grappled with in a long time .
Tenenbaum is representative of his born - digital generation in every way .
A problematic tension remains between our antiquated copyright laws and the social reality of " digital natives , " a term my colleagues John Palfrey and Urs Glasser coined to describe the generation that grew up immersed in digital technologies and for whom a life fully integrated with digital devices that are by design free and open is the norm .
Surely , just because the laws of copyright have not yet fully acknowledged and addressed the ubiquity by which protected information is readily — and freely — available on the Internet , does not make good law moot .
But this case illustrates a civil sea change rooted in the transformative nature of technology , of code as law .
Joel 's case is indicative of a far greater trend .
Better understanding of how today 's generations interact with digital media will help us shape our regulatory and educational frameworks in a way that advances the public interest and better promotes " the Progress of Science and useful Arts . "
Goliath always wins
Joel , who was a teenager at the time of the alleged file - sharing , is like the 35,000 other individuals who have been sued and cannot afford an attorney to defend themselves .
Justice demands , however , that one man not be pilloried without the process due him as a civil right , without good counsel , and without the most rigorous proof that he has committed the wrongs alleged .
The situation speaks to one basic failing of the US legal system : it treats the plaintiff and the defendant as though they are equally powerful entities , regardless of the actual resources each may have .
It disregards the fact that the cost of preparing a legal defense for a trial is prohibitively high — unthinkable for any entity other than a wealthy individual or a good - sized corporation .
In most of the cases the RIAA has filed , the matter is resolved by the powerful organization threatening to press the suit into court unless individuals agree to their terms unconditionally .
The powerful crush the weak .
Goliath defeats David every time .
This is not the justice for which I live and fight .
Many have argued that if we want to challenge the status quo , changing the law is better pursued via the legislature , not the courts .
So why do we choose to fight in court when we could potentially affect policy in other ways ?
The answer is simple .
We did not choose the courts as a venue ; the RIAA did when it waged its massive litigation campaign .
In that decision , I believe it also chose to abuse our legal process by using courtrooms and judges as small claims courts .
Surely the Congress never imagined it would authorize a litigation campaign against pro se noncommercial defendants .
In short , Joel is merely fighting back .
Charles Nesson
Academics and professionals have described my style as unconventional and have accused me of creating an unnecessary circus around this case .
But just as Joel is David in his battle against the recording industry 's Goliath , so too am I , in the fight against traditional legal norms .
Hordes of professors and professionals vehemently disagree with the position I take when it comes to " fair use " in copyright law .
I have also raised more than a few eyebrows with my untraditional approaches in court and the openness on my blog and Twitter feed .
Justice demands that those who are treated unfairly take a public stand .
After all , David would never have beaten Goliath if he had not taken a chance with his slingshot while all Israel looked on .
By the end of the day , my students raised $ 156 dollars , which is not even enough money for us to purchase the depositions we need to adequately defend our client in court .
But that day — and every day we fight — my students educate hundreds of individuals about the fundamental unfairness that underlies Joel 's case .
If I can teach my students to educate others about justice and fairness , then we are on the path to winning a much bigger battle .
Andrew Stanton 's adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs pulp legend John Carter of Mars just got a new screenwriter … and it's one of the writers who best understands pulp science fiction .
Advertisement
Michael Chabon , author of such books as The Amazing Adventures Of Kavalier & Clay and The Yiddish Policemen 's Union , has signed on to rewrite the script for Disney 's big - screen adaption of A Princess of Mars , the first of eleven books in the John Carter saga .
Chabon 's previous screenwriting experience is writing a draft of Spider - Man 2 , although only about a third of his material made it to the finished film .

Nikki Finke 's Deadline Hollywood Daily on the LA Weekly website first mentioned this news last Wednesday in passing in a post about Chabon switching agents ; the post listed John Carter of Mars as one of his screenwriting credits .
Intrigued , Chabon fansite The Amazing Website of Kavalier & Clay contacted the man directly .
Chabon confirmed the story :
" I 've been hired to do some revisions to an already strong script by Andrew Stanton and Mark Andrews , " Chabon said .
" I wrote my original screenplay The Martian Agent back in 1995 because I wished I could do [ Edgar Rice ] Burroughs 's Barsoom .
So this is pretty much a dream come true for me . "

Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs first began exploring his vision of Mars , which he called Barsoom after the native Martians ' name for the planet , in the 1912 serial Under the Moons of Mars , which was later collected and published in 1917 as Princess of Mars .
The books follow John Carter , a Civil War veteran who is inexplicably transported to Mars and plunged into civil war between the dying planet 's many inhabitants .

Thanks to his bravery in battle and extensive military skills , Carter quickly earns the respect of the warlike Green Martians , but their capture and imprisonment of the Red Martian Princess Dejah Thoris soon tests his newfound allegiances .
Building off of nineteenth century astronomer Percival Lowell 's long since debunked notions of Mars , including the planet 's infamous supposed canal system , Burroughs spun a pulpy tale of epic adventure and romance that influenced the likes of Ray Bradbury , Arthur C. Clarke , and Carl Sagan .
Disney gained the rights to the John Carter books in 2007 , after Paramount gave up on the project .
Previous adaptation attempts had included directors such as Robert Rodriguez and Jon Favreau .
Current director Andrew Stanton is best known for his work with Pixar , where he directed Finding Nemo and Wall - E. Stanton and Mark Andrews completed a first draft in 2008 ; it is unclear whether Chabon will be simply revising or completely rewriting the script .
The movie is currently set for a 2012 release date to mark the centenary of the original serial .

Three police officers in Oakland , Calif. , were gunned down on Saturday and a fourth was critically wounded in an afternoon of violence that began with a routine traffic stop and ended with a grim 9 p.m. news conference to announce the toll of one of the worst days in the police department ’s history .
The police said a 27 - year - old gunman shot two motorcycle officers after being pulled over at 1:15 p.m.
Saturday , killing one and wounding the other .
The gunman then fled to a nearby apartment .
A manhunt ensued through the streets of the East Oakland section of the city .
When the police tracked down the gunman and burst into the apartment , he shot two more officers with an assault rifle , killing them both , before he was shot dead by the police .

If you ’re a realist , you know that people are different , have different abilities , and some are born bad and some are born good , and that all categories get fuzzy around the edges but still apply .
Then you run into the modern dogma that race is a “ social construct , ” or has no basis in biology .
As you remember from biology class , your genotype or genetic makeup determines your phenotype or the traits that show up in you .
Obviously , then , consistent differences between people have some root in genetics .
But thanks to those who want to be the popular kids , that ’s not what you ’re hearing from the multibillion dollar media sources of your government and your mainstream media .
However , some information has sneaked through the cracks and so I ’m compiling it here .
The purpose of this post is not to affirm racism , superiority or inferiority , or any of that jazz ; its only purpose is to point out that race does have a biological construct , and because all traits originate in genetic information , it ’s insane to insist any consistent difference in appearance , behavior or biological process has anything but a genetic basis .
Let ’s begin .
Recent research has produced a surprise , however .
Population geneticists expected to find dramatic differences as they got a look at the full genomes — about 25,000 genes — of people of widely varying ethnic and geographic backgrounds .
Specifically , they expected to find that many ethnic groups would have derived alleles that their members shared but that were uncommon or nonexistent in other groups .
Each regional , ethnic group or latitude was thought to have a genomic “ signature ” — the record of its recent evolution through natural selection .
All of Earth ’s people , according to a new analysis of the genomes of 53 populations , fall into just three genetic groups .
They are the products of the first and most important journey our species made — the walk out of Africa about 70,000 years ago by a small fraction of ancestral Homo sapiens .
One group is the African .
It contains the descendants of the original humans who emerged in East Africa about 200,000 years ago .
The second is the Eurasian , encompassing the natives of Europe , the Middle East and Southwest Asia ( east to about Pakistan ) .
The third is the East Asian , the inhabitants of Asia , Japan and Southeast Asia , and — thanks to the Bering Land Bridge and island - hopping in the South Pacific — of the Americas and Oceania as well .
Washington Post
The writer injects a certain amount of political correctness into the article , so I reversed the order of the three paragraphs above .
The point is this : we can trace the history of evolution through genes , and it shows us three groups which have small but crucial differences caused by “ genetic drift ” — in this case , the traits kept by being successful in the different areas to which these new populations adapted .
Geneticists are uncovering another level of human ethnic diversity :
It may not be which genes we have so much as the way they behave that accounts for our differences .
Using the International HapMap Project , which catalogs human gene variants across populations , University of Pennsylvania researchers Vivian Cheung and Richard Spielman first collected the gene sequences of a particular white blood cell from 82 Asians and 60 people of European descent .
Then , using microarray chips , they measured expression levels of those genes .
What they found was surprising : Although which genes were present didnâ€™t differ dramatically between the Asians and the Europeans , their expression did .
And that expression was governed by single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) â€ ” one - letter changes in DNAÂ­â€ ” in nearby regulator regions that determine how much of a geneâ€™s product is made .
Overall , 25 percent of the genes seem to show different levels of expression in Asians versus Europeans , and SNPs in regulatory regions probably account for much of the difference .
In the case of one gene , researchers found that Caucasians expressed it at 22 times the strength that Asians did .
Discover
I quote this article first for two reasons : first , it shows the clear differences in genetics ; second , it shows that we ’re not looking for a race gene , or identical genetics ; we ’re looking for genetic coding that expresses what goes into the organism .
As the article points out , the differences were n’t dramatic — but they occurred in crucial areas , just like the difference between the computer code for a word processor and a database program is mostly the same , but has important details changed .
It ’s like saying to person A “ Take ten of these red pills , and five of the green , after each meal ” and to person B “ Take five of these red pills , and ten of the green , before each meal ” — small but vitally different instructions .
And lest you missed it :
25 percent of the genes seem to show different levels of expression in Asians versus Europeans
One quarter of the instructions you give to person A and person B are substantially different , although both involve red pills and green pills .
Next up , a neat cascade by Steve Hsu , who fired off one of the more recent salvos in this fight by pointing out the obvious :
We were told long ago that there is no scientific basis for race .
Yet , it would be surprising if the distribution of individual genes were the same in all ethnic groups , with their different evolutionary histories of the last tens of thousands of years .
In fact , mtDNA tests can readily identify which of a few dozen matrilineal lines any modern human belongs to .
Each of these lines can in turn be traced to certain geographical regions to which early humans migrated from Africa , and correspond reasonably well to conventional racial categories .
Researchers last week described a new drug , called BiDil , that sharply reduces death from heart disease among African - Americans .
… But not everyone is cheering unreservedly .
Many people , including some African - Americans , have long been uneasy with the concept of race - based medicine , in part from fear that it may legitimize less benign ideas about race .
… The emergence of BiDil , described last week in The New England Journal of Medicine , is a sharp reality test for an academic debate about race and medicine that has long occupied the pages of medical journals .
Is there a biological basis for race ?
If there is not , as many social scientists and others argue , how can a drug like BiDil work so well in one race ?
… This month , in a special issue on race published by the journal Nature Genetics , several geneticists wrote that people can generally be assigned to their continent of origin on the basis of their DNA , and that these broad geographical regions correspond to self - identified racial categories , such as African , East Asian , European and Native American .
Race , in other words , does have a genetic basis , in their view .
… Some African - Americans fear that if doctors start to make diagnoses by race , then some in the public may see that as a basis for imputing behavioral traits as well .
” If you think in terms of taxonomies of race , you will make the dangerous conclusion that race will explain violence , ” says Dr. Troy Duster , a sociologist at New York University .
NYT InfoProc
I like how he excerpts the vital parts of this article .
But the point is clear , and this article was the first mention of it in the public eye : the races are biologically different , e.g. in homeostatic process , not just bone density , skull / facial shape , skin color , hair type , etc .
But now we ’re looking at it as biology as well :
But several other geneticists writing in the same issue of the journal say the human family tree is divided into branches that correspond to the ancestral populations of each major continent , and that these branches coincide with the popular notion of race .
“ The emerging picture is that populations do , generally , cluster by broad geographic regions that correspond with common racial classification ( Africa , Europe , Asia , Oceania , Americas ) , ” say Dr. Sarah A. Tishkoff of the University of Maryland and Dr. Kenneth K. Kidd of Yale .
Although there is not much genetic variation between the populations of each continent , write Dr. Joanna L. Mountain and Dr. Neil Risch of Stanford University , new data “ coincide closely with groups defined by self - identified race or continental ancestry . ”
The data is based on DNA elements outside the genes with no bearing on the body ’s physical form .
The pattern reflects the fact that once humans dispersed from Africa , the populations on each continent started breeding in isolation and developing their own set of genetic variations .
NYT
“ Not much ” is somewhat arbitrary .
Just as one percent of a computer program being changed could cause it to act radically differently , even a tenth of a percent of our DNA being different could create different results .
Even more , DNA is not linear , so a single difference in a key place makes it operate differently .
So when scientists bandy about terms like us being 90 % similar to chimpanzees , or 99 % similar between ethnic groups , keep in mind that those figures understate how radically different the results can be .
Forensic experts are increasingly relying on DNA as “ a genetic eyewitness , ” says Jack Ballantyne , associate director for research at the National Center for Forensic Science at the University of Central Florida in Orlando , who is studying whether a DNA sample can reveal a person ’s age .
The push to predict physical features from genetic material is known as DNA forensic phenotyping , and it ’s already helped crack some difficult investigations .
In 2004 , police caught a Louisiana serial killer who eyewitnesses had suggested was white , but whose crime - scene DNA suggested — correctly — that he was black .
Britain ’s forensic service uses a similar “ ethnic inference ” test to trace murderers and rapists .
In 2007 , a DNA test based on 34 genetic biomarkers developed by Christopher Phillips , a forensic geneticist at the University of Santiago de Compostelo in Spain , indicated that one of the suspects associated with the Madrid bombings was of North African origin .
His body was mostly destroyed in an explosion .
Using other clues , police later confirmed he had been an Algerian , thereby validating the test results .
Worried about the ethical and social challenges , Germany does n’t permit the forensic use of DNA to infer ethnicity or physical traits .
Nor do a handful of U.S. states , including Indiana , Wyoming and Rhode Island .
The U.K. and the Netherlands allow it .
DNA - based racial profiling “ has to be used carefully , ” especially in a diverse country like America , says Bert - Jaap Koops of Tilburg University in the Netherlands , who has studied the regulatory picture in different countries .
“ Some people could make connections between race , crime and genetic disposition ” and thereby encourage stigmatization .
WSJ
A small amount makes a big difference .
And by reading that genetic history , we can tell where something evolved and , increasingly , what its traits are .
Biologists have constructed a genetic map of Europe showing the degree of relatedness between its various populations .
All the populations are quite similar , but the differences are sufficient that it should be possible to devise a forensic test to tell which country in Europe an individual probably comes from , said Manfred Kayser , a geneticist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands .
The genetic map of Europe bears a clear structural similarity to the geographic map .
The major genetic differences are between populations of the north and south ( the vertical axis of the map shows north - south differences , the horizontal axis those of east - west ) .
The area assigned to each population reflects the amount of genetic variation in it .
NYT
Not only can we tell that races have different homeostatic processes , but we can tell them apart — and ethnicities too , including ancient ones .
That ’s a big blow to the idea that there ’s no ethnic component to race .
Starting about 1968 , it became taboo to note differences between races ; if you did , you got called a bumpkin , a redneck , an uneducated hick , and people assumed you did it because you had no money and hated society .
This kind of groupthink is never healthy , and it ’s thoroughly opposed to everything that science is supposed to stand for , but if you ’re a scientist looking for grant money and to further his own career , you ’re not going to take on an unpopular issue .
During the 1990s , this hysteria peaked and we had common statements like : there ’s more difference between individuals of the same race than between individuals of different races , we ’re 99 % similar , race is a social construct , and so on .
2. Race has no genetic basis .
Not one characteristic , trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so - called race from all the members of another so - called race .
5 . Most variation is within , not between , “ races . ”
Of the small amount of total human variation , 85 % exists within any local population , be they Italians , Kurds , Koreans or Cherokees .
About 94 % can be found within any continent .
That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian .
9 . Race is n’t biological , but racism is still real .
Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources .
Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth , power , and resources to white people .
This affects everyone , whether we are aware of it or not .
PBS
Note how they have to fall into bad science :
Not one characteristic , trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so - called race from all the members of another so - called race .
But race has always been assumed to be a collection of traits ; it ’s only anti-racists that refer to it as a difference in skin color .
Gradually , this view has fallen into panicked disrepair as science has assaulted it , starting with The Bell Curve and then The Blank Slate , showing that for every ability we have , there ’s a gene , and that collections of genes make races and ethnicities , even class distinctions .
This upsets people who want equality and an end to all strife , because lack of equality means strife and possibly that someone will interrupt them doing whatever they want to do .
Here ’s a great assault on these scientific fallacies :
Once one accepts that genetic information clusters people together according to geography and that these clusters sometimes correspond to race , the next question is , do these genetic differences add up to phenotypic differences ?
The answer to this question is slowly emerging , and in the shadows I see the outline of a “ YES ” .
All of the studies I will cite are based on the HapMap , a resource with genetic data as well as cell lines for individuals from four populations – one of Western European ancestry , an Nigerian population , a Chinese population , and a Japanese population .
Does the Nigerian population represent all populations in the African cluster , or the European population represent all the populations in the Eurasian cluster ?
Of course not , but analyzing them certainly gives an insight as to what makes one population different from any other .
First , the genetic data from the different populations can be analyzed to search for areas of the genome that have been under recent selection– i.e. that have recently become beneficial for Nigerians , or Chinese , or whichever group .
That analysis was done by two groups ( both papers are open access ) , though I will discuss the second one .
What they found was that each of the populations ( they group the Chinese and Japanese together into a single population ) has been under , and probably continues to be under , natural selection .
It would be theoretically possible ( if remarkable ) to find that all humans are undergoing the same selective pressures and responding identically to them , but that is not the case .
I ’ve posted on the right a Venn diagram from the paper showing that most of the loci identified as under selection are detected in only one of the three groups , indicating that selection is causing people in different parts of the globe to become more distinct .
The precise effects of the genetic variation between populations is unclear , but ( as it ’s under selection ) it ’s certainly phenotypically relevant .
And lest you think the genes under selection are related only to “ boring ” physiological traits , note that one of the papers found that a number of genes involved in “ neuronal function ” have been under selection .
Even more recently , another group analyzed gene expression in both the Asian HapMap samples and the European HapMap samples and found that around 25 % of the genes in the two were differentially expressed , and that this differential expression is due to genetic differences in many cases .
The road from genotype to phenotype goes through gene expression , so this is a major step in connecting genetic variation to phenotypic variation .
So it ’s clear that populations differ genetically and that these differences are relevant phenotypically and informative about race .
So , do genetic differences explain racial differences in any given phenotype ?
I hope that for phenotypes like eye color and skin color people accept the answer as obviously yes ; these sorts of things have been convincingly demonstrated .
For other phenotypes like IQ or personality , if you ’re inclined to react negatively , I say wait a few years before you get too confident ; the study of human genetic variation is in its infancy , and once it hits adolescence it ’s going to start becoming a real pain in the ass .
GNXP
As people are learning , the fallacy that people are more different within ethnic groups than between ethnic groups ( Lewontin ’s fallacy ) makes no sense biologically , but it made a good sound bite .
If differences are considered to exist when individuals can be accurately classified according using a single randomly chosen trait , then Lewontin ’s results imply that human races are not distinct in this sense .
Wikipedia
We ’re looking for a single trait again ?
Yet people have never claimed race is determined by a single trait , but by multiple traits :
In response to questionable interpretations of the U.S. Endangered Species Act , and to help ensure the evolutionary significance of populations deemed â€˜subspecies , â€™ a set of criteria was outlined in the early 1990s by John C. Avise , R. Martin Ball , Jr. [ 10 ] , Stephen J. Oâ€ ™Brien and Ernst Mayr [ 11 ] which is as follows : â€œmembers of a subspecies would share a unique , geographic locale , a set of phylogenetically concordant phenotypic characters , and a unique natural history relative to other subdivisions of the species .
Although subspecies are not reproductively isolated , they will normally be allopatric and exhibit recognizable phylogenetic partitioning .
â€
The Race FAQ
That ’s a scientific definition of race .
People who argue against race generally make up a definition they think they can beat , and then disprove it .
That trick sort of works on undergraduate papers but its value disappears when there ’s real - world consequences on the line .
Here ’s a good definition as well :
That is , we think that what most people call â€œracesâ€ are actually independently evolved sub-populations , but that human races exist in the same sense as ecotypes exist among other animals and plants .
An ecotype is a locally adapted population ( say , characterized by an â€œalpineâ€  phenotype for a plant , or a â€œhigh light intensityâ€ phenotype for a human ) , which is not genetically much different from other populations of the same species , except for genes specifically influencing whatever traits are adaptive in that environment ( say , short and branched stalks in alpine plants , to protect against strong wind ; or dark skin in humans living near the Equator , to protect from high light intensity ) .
Scientific Blogging
Jonathan Haidt points out that these small differences , which are tiny compared to the amount of code required to create a body and brain , could influence not just physical traits and mental traits , but also that subset of mental traits known as moral traits :
The most offensive idea in all of science for the last 40 years is the possibility that behavioral differences between racial and ethnic groups have some genetic basis .
Knowing nothing but the long - term offensiveness of this idea , a betting person would have to predict that as we decode the genomes of people around the world , we ’re going to find deeper differences than most scientists now expect .
Expectations , after all , are not based purely on current evidence ; they are biased , even if only slightly , by the gut feelings of the researchers , and those gut feelings include disgust toward racism ..
But the writing is on the wall .
Russian scientists showed in the 1990s that a strong selection pressure ( picking out and breeding only the tamest fox pups in each generation ) created what was â€ ” in behavior as well as body â€ ” essentially a new species in just 30 generations .
That would correspond to about 750 years for humans .
Humans may never have experienced such a strong selection pressure for such a long period , but they surely experienced many weaker selection pressures that lasted far longer , and for which some heritable personality traits were more adaptive than others .
It stands to reason that local populations ( not continent - wide “ races ” ) adapted to local circumstances by a process known as “ co-evolution ” in which genes and cultural elements change over time and mutually influence each other .
The best documented example of this process is the co-evolution of genetic mutations that maintain the ability to fully digest lactose in adulthood with the cultural innovation of keeping cattle and drinking their milk .
Skin color has no moral significance , but traits that led to Darwinian success in one of the many new niches and occupations of Holocene life â€ ” traits such as collectivism , clannishness , aggressiveness , docility , or the ability to delay gratification â€ ” are often seen as virtues or vices .
Virtues are acquired slowly , by practice within a cultural context , but the discovery that there might be ethnically - linked genetic variations in the ease with which people can acquire specific virtues is â€ ” and this is my prediction â€ ” going to be a “ game changing ” scientific event .
I believe that the “ Bell Curve ” wars of the 1990s , over race differences in intelligence , will seem genteel and short - lived compared to the coming arguments over ethnic differences in moralized traits .
I predict that this “ war ” will break out between 2012 and 2017 .
Edge
Others can provide more on the IQ - race differences :
What I ’ve found is that in brain size , intelligence , temperament , sexual behavior , fertility , growth rate , life span , crime , and family stability , Orientals , as a group , consistently fall at one end of the spectrum , Blacks fall at the other end , and Whites fall in between .
On average , Orientals are slower to mature , less fertile , and less sexually active , and have larger brains and higher IQ scores .
Blacks are at the opposite end in each of these areas .
Whites fall in the middle , often close to Orientals ( see Chart 1 )
Of course , these three - way racial differences are averages .
Individuals are individuals .
However , I ’ve found that this three - way pattern is consistently true over time and across nations .
That the same three - way racial pattern occurs repeatedly on some 60 different biological and behavioral variables is profoundly interesting and shows that race is more than â€œjust skin deep.â€ 
The international data come from the World Health Organization , the United Nations , and Interpol .
Recently , I even traveled to South Africa to collect new IQ data .
Charles Darwin Research
This fits in with what we know about humans as a whole , which is that traits like intelligence are heritable along with physical constraints , with a small amount of influence for other factors of gene expression and factors of nurture , such as better diet and exercise .
Even more , it fits in with a view of the world that many find disturbing , which is one that views the world by IQ :
This roughly mirrors the pattern of evolution , and the racial makeup of different nations .
Pretty hard to argue with there .
Others get more into the IQ debate — I start to shut off at this point , although I ’m a big believer in IQ :
A 60 - page review of the scientific evidence , some based on state - of - the - art magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of brain size , has concluded that race differences in average IQ are largely genetic .
The lead article in the June 2005 issue of Psychology , Public Policy and Law , a journal of the American Psychological Association , examined 10 categories of research evidence from around the world to contrast “ a hereditarian model ( 50 % genetic - 50 % cultural ) and a culture - only model ( 0 % genetic - 100 % cultural ) . ”
The paper , “ Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability , ” by J. Philippe Rushton of the University of Western Ontario and Arthur R. Jensen of the University of California at Berkeley , appeared with a positive commentary by Linda Gottfredson of the University of Delaware , three critical ones ( by Robert Sternberg of Yale University , Richard Nisbett of the University of Michigan , and Lisa Suzuki & Joshua Aronson of New York University ) , and the authors ’ reply .
“ Neither the existence nor the size of race differences in IQ are a matter of dispute , only their cause , ” write the authors .
The Black - White difference has been found consistently from the time of the massive World War I Army testing of 90 years ago to a massive study of over 6 million corporate , military , and higher - education test - takers in 2001 .
“ Race differences show up by 3 years of age , even after matching on maternal education and other variables , ” said Rushton .
“ Therefore they can not be due to poor education since this has not yet begun to exert an effect .
Medical News
While all this seems a bit much , all of it underscores the vital truth : race is genetic , just like abilities are genetic ; races and ethnicities are defined by clusters of inherited abilities relevant to the specific conditions under which that group developed .
While these are a small number of our overall genetic makeup , most of the makeup we have in common is to establish the very basics of our bodies and minds , and its the tweaks that give us special abilities beyond the utter average .
That makes knowing that race is genetic important ; there ’s also another reason why we should care — it ’s ignorant to deny science , and yet people are trying to censor science in this regard .
The Soviet Union lost a generation of genetics research to the politicization of science when Trofim Lysenko , director of biology under Joseph Stalin , parlayed his rejection of Mendelian genetics into a powerful political scientific movement .
By the late 1920s , Lysenko had denounced academics embracing Mendelian genetics , which some said undermined tenets of Soviet society .
His efforts to extinguish ‘ harmful ’ scientific ideas ruined opponents ’ careers and delayed scientific progress .
Yet the spectre of Lysenkoism lurks in current scientific discourse on gender , race and intelligence .
Claims that sex - or race - based IQ gaps are partly genetic can offend entire groups , who feel that such work feeds hatred and discrimination .
Pressure from professional organizations and university administrators can result in boycotting such research , and even in ending scientific careers .
Nobel prizewinner William Shockley became a subject of controversy in the 1970s , after his work turned to racial differences in intelligence .
In recent decades , the writings , statements and teachings of Arthur Jensen , Michael Levin and John Philippe Rushton , also on racial differences in intelligence , have met variously with acclaim , outcries and demands for job termination .
So have writings of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray on the differential distribution of IQ by race .
And Frank Ellis , a lecturer at the University of Leeds , UK , took early retirement in the face of an ethical storm that developed after he suggested in a student newspaper that intelligence levels were related to ethnicity .
The list goes on .
Many have been dissuaded from even looking at the research topic for fear of condemnation .
The outcries against those who speak of racial and gender gaps in IQ have become deafening , at times resembling Lysenkoism in language if not in deed .
Nature
We , the people , will empower others to alter our reality if we demand the right to alter reality through censorship and boycott of the topics that scare us .
I do n’t believe in racism , which seems to me to be a preference for putting others down because of their race .
However , it ’s not clear to me how recognizing racial differences is inherently racist , and like the writers above , I am appalled at the idea of censoring science for political pretense .
Right now most of the divide is political .
Leftists prefer multiculturalism because it guarantees them power , while nativist movements oppose both raw capitalism and socialism , seeing both as components of the globalism that replaces culture with rules and commerce .
If we are to ever face the truth of this issue , we must look past politics to see reality , and that states with recognizing that race is a biological reality .

Here is a quick hack that I wrote .
It 's a Python library to search Google without using their API .
It 's quick and dirty , just the way I love it .
Why did n't I use Google 's provided REST API ?
Because it says " you can only get up to 8 results in a single call and you can't go beyond the first 32 results " .
Seriously , what am I gonna do with just 32 results ?
I want to automate my Google hacks and I want millions of results .
For example , I want to monitor popularity of keywords and websites , and to use it for various other reasons .
One of my next post is going to extend on this library and build a tool that checks your spelling and grammar .
I have been using Google for a while now to check my spelling .
For example , " across " vs. " accross " .
A common misspelling .
The first one is correct and the second one is incorrect .
Googling for these words reveal that the first has 323,136,000 results , but the second has 278,000 results , so I trust Google that the first spelling is more correct than the second one .
Subscribe to my posts via catonmat 's rss , if you like this .
I 'll soon build this tool and you 'll receive my posts automatically .
How to use the library ?
First download the xgoogle library , and extract it somewhere .
At the moment it contains just the code for Google search , but in the future I will add other searches ( google sets , google suggest , etc ) .
To use the search , from " xgoogle.search " import " GoogleSearch " and , optionally , " SearchError " .
GoogleSearch is the class you will use to do Google searches .
SearchError is an exception class that GoogleSearch throws in case of various errors .
Pass the keyword you want to search as the first parameter to GoogleSearch 's constructor .
The constructed object has several public methods and properties :
method get_results ( ) - gets a page of results , returning a list of SearchResult objects .
It returns an empty list if there are no more results .
- gets a page of results , returning a list of SearchResult objects .
It returns an empty list if there are no more results .
property num_results - returns number of search results found .
- returns number of search results found .
property results_per_page - sets / gets the number of results to get per page .
Possible values are 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 .
- sets / gets the number of results to get per page .
Possible values are 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 . property page - sets / gets the search page .
As I said , get_results ( ) method returns a SearchResult object .
It has three attributes -- " title " , " desc " , and " url " .
They are Unicode strings , so do a proper encoding before outputting them .
Here is a screenshot that illustrates the " title " , " desc " , and " url " attributes :
Google search result for " catonmat " .
Here is an example program of doing a Google search .
It takes the first argument , does a search on it , and prints the results :
from xgoogle .
search import GoogleSearch , SearchError try : gs = GoogleSearch ( " quick and dirty " ) gs.results_per_page = 50 results = gs.get_results ( ) for res in results : print res.title.encode( " utf8 " ) print res.desc.encode(" utf8 " ) print res.url.encode ( " utf8 " ) print except SearchError , e : print " Search failed : %s " % e
This code fragment sets up a search for " quick and dirty " and specifies that a result page should have 50 results .
Then it calls get_results ( ) to get a page of results .
Finally it prints the title , description and url of each search result .
Here is the output from running this program :
Quick - and - dirty - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Quick - and - dirty is a term used in reference to anything that is an easy way to implement a kludge .
Its usage is popular among programmers , ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick-and-dirty
Grammar Girl 's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing - Wikipedia ... " Grammar Girl 's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing " is an educational podcast that was launched in July 2006 and the title of a print book that was ...

...
http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/ [...]
Compare these results to the output above .
You could also have specified which search page to start the search from .
For example , the following code will get 25 results per page and start the search at 2nd page .
gs = GoogleSearch ( " quick and dirty " ) gs.results_per_page = 25 gs.page = 2 results = gs.get_results ( )
You can also quickly write a scraper to get all the results for a given search term :
from xgoogle .
search import GoogleSearch , SearchError try : gs = GoogleSearch ( " quantum mechanics " ) gs.results_per_page = 100 results = [ ] while True : tmp = gs.get_results ( ) if not tmp : # no more results were found break results.extend ( tmp ) # ... do something with all the results ... except SearchError , e : print " Search failed : %s " % e
You can use this library to constantly monitor how your website is ranking for a given search term .
Suppose your website has a domain " catonmat.net " and the search term you want to find your position for is " python videos " .
Here is a code that outputs your ranking : ( it looks through first 100 results , if you need more , put a loop there )
import re from urlparse import urlparse from xgoogle .
search import GoogleSearch , SearchError target_domain = " catonmat.net " target_keyword = " python videos " def mk_nice_domain ( domain ) : " " " convert domain into a nicer one ( eg. www3.google.com into google.com ) " " " domain = re.sub ( " ^www ( \d + ) ?\. " , " " , domain ) # add more here return domain gs = GoogleSearch ( target_keyword ) gs.results_per_page = 100 results = gs.get_results ( ) for idx , res in enumerate ( results ) : parsed = urlparse ( res.url ) domain = mk_nice_domain(parsed.netloc ) if domain == target_domain : print " Ranking position %d for keyword ' %s ' on domain %s " % ( idx+1 , target_keyword , target_domain )
Output of this program :

GOP activists and operatives say they hear intense anger at the White House and at the party 's own leaders on familiar issues .
In GOP base , a ' rebellion brewing '
A quick tour through the week ’s headlines suggests the Republican Party is beginning to come to terms with the last election and that consensus is emerging among GOP elites that the party needs to move away from discordant social issues .
There was Sen. John McCain 's daughter and his campaign manager who last week demanded that their fellow Republicans embrace same - sex marriage .
Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman – the most devoted modernizer among the party 's 2012 hopefuls – won approving words from New York Times columnist Frank Rich for his call to downplay divisive values issues .
The party ’s top elected leaders in Congress , meanwhile , spooked by being attacked as the “ party of no , ” were recasting themselves as a constructive , respectful opposition to a popular president .

But outside Washington , the reality is very different .
Rank - and - file Republicans remain , by all indications , staunchly conservative , and they appear to have no desire to moderate their views .
GOP activists and operatives say they hear intense anger at the White House and at the party ’s own leaders on familiar issues – taxes , homosexuality , and immigration .
Within the party , conservative groups have grown stronger absent the emergence of any organized moderate faction .
There is little appetite for compromise on what many see as core issues , and the road to the presidential nomination lies – as always – through a series of states where the conservative base holds sway , and where the anger appears to be , if anything , particularly intense .
" There is a sense of rebellion brewing , " said Katon Dawson , the outgoing South Carolina Republican Party chairman , who cited unexpectedly high attendance at anti-tax “ tea parties ” last week .
That same sense is detectable in New Hampshire , where Union Leader publisher Joseph McQuaid – a stalwart of the base – warned in a column last weekend that the push for same - sex marriage in the state legislature was really about “ forcing society to embrace and give positive reinforcement to their lifestyle and agenda in our schools and in every other area of public life imaginable . ”
And it is perhaps most tangible in Iowa , where same - sex marriage will become the law this month in response to a state Supreme Court ruling .
There , Republican activists and officials say the party is as resolute as ever , if not more so , on cultural issues – regardless of the soundings of some party elites .
Rep . Steve King , an outspoken conservative who represents all of rock - ribbed western Iowa and may run for governor next year , said he had held 11 town hall meetings across the state since the early April state Supreme Court decision .
" Of those 11 meetings , 10 of them were full .
Most of them were standing room .
The marriage issue was the No. 1 issue on their minds .
No. 2 was the massive federal spending taking place .
In every discussion , immigration came up . "
And these Iowans , King noted , " stand in the same square they always have :
They believe marriage is between a man and a woman , and they 're opposed to amnesty . "
" My e-mail overfloweth , " said David Overholtzer , a longtime GOP activist in western Iowa 's Pottawattamie County .
" Amnesty is still very much a hot - button and gay marriage especially is here in Iowa .
The view is that we 've got to hold our legislators ' and governors ' feet to the fire . "
" I ’ve never seen the grass - roots quite as motivated , concerned and angry , " said Steve Scheffler , the head of the Iowa Christian Alliance and the state 's RNC committeeman .
The marriage issue and other traditional conservative litmus tests are n't likely to fade before the state 's next presidential caucuses , either .
Asked about how a presidential candidate urging the party toward the middle on cultural issues would fare , Scheffler said flatly : “ They ’re not gonna go anywhere . ”
In one sense , Republican leaders face the same challenge their Democratic counterparts did during the Bush years : how to effectively channel the deep emotion of the base while tamping down its excesses .
But the party ’s battered infrastructure , still recovering from its drubbings in 2006 and 2008 , is also listing to the right .
Liberal Republican groups like the Main Street Republican Partnership and the Republican Majority for Choice remain essentially irrelevant , and even the main gay GOP group , the Log Cabin Republicans , is fending off a challenge from a more conservative gay splinter faction .
Ralph Reed , the longtime Christian conservative activist and former chair of the Georgia GOP , predicted that opposition to same - sex marriage would become , like abortion , a litmus test , if a lower - profile one .
" There used to be muscular and vocal disagreement in the party on our pro-life plank , " he recalled .
" That has largely been resolved .
Nobody raises the issue of changing the pro-life plank . "
Meanwhile , the hottest new conservative outfit is the National Republican Trust PAC , which raised a stunning $ 6 million in the waning days of the 2008 contest from millions of small donors who helped fund a slashing television advertisement attacking Obama for his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
It ’s taken a similar approach to recent congressional races .
Rick Wilson , a consultant to the group , explained the outlook of “ real Republicans ” when it comes to Obama .
“ They think this guy has grabbed the reins of power and that he is racing as fast as he can first off to reshape the economy and the culture in his image – they are mortified at that and they are terrified of it . ”
“ There is a fever pitch , ” he said , dismissing the notion that the party must sacrifice some of the intensely held views of base voters to expand its coalition to include more young and minority voters .
“ You do n’t get a new coalition by abandoning your old coalition . ”
The grass - roots fervor is pushing the party to the right in another concrete way :
Two of the most prominent GOP Senate moderates face serious primary challenges in 2010 .
In Pennsylvania , former Congressman Pat Toomey , a down - the - line economic and social conservative , is running against Sen.
Arlen Specter , attacking his “ liberal agenda on social , labor , immigration and national security policies . ”
In Arizona , Chris Simcox , the founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Project , a group that mounted armed opposition to illegal immigration at the border , announced this week that he ’s running against McCain .
“ We ’ve had it with the elitist establishment in Washington and John McCain is one of those , ” Simcox said .
A conservative Republican operative , meanwhile , said two other prominent conservatives are mulling challenges to sitting GOP senators .
The party will be shaped most clearly , however , when its presidential hopefuls begin their early state pilgrimages after the 2010 midterms .
And they ’re unlikely to emerge convinced that courting gay and Hispanic voters , in particular , is politically saleable within their parties .
" John McCain found out the hard way that being where he was not an asset , ” Reed recalled of last year 's presidential primary , noting that the eventual nominee either shifted or downplayed some of his unpopular stances , including on immigration .
A presidential candidate 's arrival in an Iowa or South Carolina , Reed noted with a chuckle , offers “ what I like to refer to as ‘ a dramatically clarifying experience . ’ ”
Obama : No More Cash for Jailing Illegals
May 12 , 2009
President Barack Obama has asked Congress to end federal payments to states and communities for jailing illegal immigrants as he continues along a path toward legalization of undocumented aliens .
The budget plan Obama released on Thursday would end the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program ( SCAAP ) , under which states received $ 400 million in the current fiscal year to cover the cost of incarcerating convicts and pre-trial detainees who are illegally in the U.S .
Specifically , the SCAAP reimburses states and counties for jailer 's salaries for holding illegal immigrants who are apprehended and found to have at least one felony and two misdemeanor convictions .
" The evidence suggests that the funds are often used in a variety of ways that are tangential to the direct cost associated with imprisoning unauthorized immigrants , " Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag told reporters .
A list of budget cuts asserted that money in the program " can be used for extraneous items and services such as bonuses , consultants , and purchase of vehicles . "
Politico's Josh Gerstein observed : " That may be so .
However , the cost of keeping illegal aliens in jail is clearly higher than what the federal government pays .
California is getting $ 118 million through the program this year , but estimates it spends about $ 1 billion on jailing " undocumented persons . "
So , wherever the federal funds are directed , they don�t come close to covering the costs . "
Justice Department officials told reporters that the federal government wants to spend the money instead on new initiatives to secure the border with Mexico .
But " those total about $ 232 million , so some of the alien - jail money is just being shifted away , " Gerstein writes .
Ironically , Obama co-sponsored an amendment in the Senate to increase funding for the program .
The amendment was defeated .
With states along the Mexican border hard pressed to balance their budgets , the federal cut would likely lead to reduced incarceration of illegal aliens .
Obama 's Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has in fact stated that illegal immigration is really not a crime , saying in a CNN interview in April that " crossing the border is not a crime per se . "
However , a statue clearly stipulates that crossing the border without authorization is a crime .
The elimination of the SCAAP
The elimination of the SCAAP is the latest sign that the Obama administration is softening the approach to illegal immigrants already in the country .
The New York Times reported in early April that Obama would draft legislation this year allowing illegal immigrants to become legal citizens .
The Times cited U.S. officials as saying that " the Obama administration favors legislation that would bring illegal immigrants into the legal system by recognizing that they violated the law , and imposing fines and other penalties to fit the offense . "
Obama said in an interview with Univision Radio that he is " very committed " to immigration reform , stating : " We 're going to start by really trying to work on how to improve the current system so that people who want to be naturalized , who want to become citizens . . . that they are able to do it . "
New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , chairman of the Senate 's Immigration , Refugees and Border Security Subcommittee , recently said he expected Senate hearings to lead to a major change in U.S. immigration policy this year .
As Newsmax reported earlier , Republicans fear that Obama and Congressional Democrats are pushing for amnesty for illegals to increase Democratic electoral chances .
Studies show that new immigrants vote overwhelmingly Democratic .
But Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies told The Hill newspaper that it is " very unlikely " that Obama 's plan to cut the SCAAP will be accepted by Congress .
One Republican and two Democratic congressmen from California have drafted a letter urging a House Appropriations subcommittee to restore funding for the SCAAP .

Transparency is Bunk
Adapted from an impromptu rant I gave to some people interested in funding government transparency projects .
I ’ve spent the past year and change working on a site , watchdog.net , that publishes government information online .
In doing that , I ’ve learned a lot : I ’ve looked at everything from pollution records to voter registration databases and I ’ve figured out a number of bureacratic tricks to get information out of the government .
But I ’ve also become increasingly skeptical of the transparency project in general , at least as it ’s carried out in the US .
The way a typical US transparency project works is pretty simple .
You find a government database , work hard to get or parse a copy , and then put it online with some nice visualizations .
The problem is that reality does n’t live in the databases .
Instead , the databases that are made available , even if grudgingly , form a kind of official cover story , a veil of lies over the real workings of government .
If you visit a site like GovTrack , which publishes information on what Congresspeople are up to , you find that all of Congress ’s votes are on inane items like declaring holidays and naming post offices .
The real action is buried in obscure subchapters of innocuous - sounding bills and voted on under emergency provisions that let everything happen without public disclosure .
So government transparency sites end up having three possible effects .
The vast majority of them simply promote these official cover stories , misleading the public about what ’s really going on .
The unusually cutting ones simply make plain the mindnumbing universality of waste and corruption , and thus promote apathy .
And on very rare occasions you have a “ success ” : an extreme case is located through your work , brought to justice , and then everyone goes home thinking the problem has been solved , as the real corruption continues on as before .
In short , the generous impulses behind transparency sites end up doing more harm than good .
But this is nothing new .
The whole history of the “ good government ” movement in the US is of “ reformers ” who , intentionally or otherwise , weakened the cause of democracy .
They too were primarily supported by large foundations , mostly Ford and Rockefeller .
They replaced democratically - elected mayors with professional city managers , which required a supermajority to overrule .
They insisted on nonpartisan elections , making it difficult to organize people into political blocs .
Arguing it would reduce corruption , they insisted city politicians serve without paying , ensuring the jobs were only open to the wealthy .
I worry that transparency groups may be making the same “ mistake ” .
These are some dark thoughts , so I want to add a helpful alternative : journalism .
Investigative journalism lives up to the promise that transparency sites make .
Let me give three examples : Silverstein , Taibbi , Caro .
Ken Silverstein regularly writes brilliant pieces about the influence of money in politics .
And he uses these sorts of databases to do so .
But the databases are always a small part of a larger picture , supplemented with interviews , documents , and even undercover investigation — he recently did a piece where he posted as a representative of the government of Turkmenistan and described how he was wined and dined by lobbyists eager to build support for that noxious regime .
The story , and much more , is told in his book Turkmeniscam .
( His book Washington Babylon is similarly indispensible . )
Matt Taibbi , in his book The Great Derangement , describes how Congress really works .
He goes to the capitol and lays out the whole scene : the Congressmen naming post offices on the House floor , the journalists typing in the press releases they ’re handed , the key actions going on behind the scenes and out of the public eye , the continual use of emergency procedures to evade disclosure laws .
And Robert Caro , in his incredible book The Power Broker ( one of the very best books ever published , I ’m convinced ) takes on this fundamental political question of “ Who ’s actually responsible for what my government is doing ? ”
For forty years , everyone in New York thought they knew the answer : power was held by the city council , the mayor , the state legislature , and the governor .
After all , they run the government , right ?
And for forty years , they were all wrong .
Power was held — held , for the most part , absolutely , without any checks or outside influence — by one man : Parks Commissioner Robert Moses .
All that time , everyone ( especially the press ) treated Robert Moses as merely the Parks Commissioner , a mere public servant serving his elected officials .
In reality , he pulled the strings of all those elected officials .
These journalists tackled all the major questions supposedly addressed by US transparency sites — who ’s buying influence ?
what is Congress doing ?
who ’s in power in my neighborhood ? — and not only tell a richer , more informative story , but come to strikingly different answers to the questions .
In this era where investigative reporting budgets have been cut to the bone and newspapers are folding left and right , it ’s fallen to nonprofits like ProPublica and the Center for Independent Media and , from a previous era , the Center for Public Integrity , to pick up the slack .
They ’ve been using the Internet in innovative ways to supplement good old - fashioned narrative journalism , where transparency sites are a supplement , rather than an end - in - themselves .
For too long we ’ve been funding transparency projects on the model of if - we - build - it - they - will - come : that we do n’t know what transparency will be useful for , but once it ’s done it will lead to all sorts of exciting possibilities .
Well , we ’ve built it .
And they have n’t come .
The only success story its proponents can point to is that transparency projects have bred even more transparency projects .
I ’m done working on watchdog . net ; I ’m done hurting America .
It ’s time to give old - fashioned narrative journalism a try .

Gas power plants could be cheaply retrofitted to generate hydrogen as well as power
Gas power plants could be cheaply retrofitted to generate hydrogen as well as power , chemists say in a Royal Society of Chemistry journal .
A catalyst would convert methane into hydrogen gas and combustible coke , allowing the power station to produce hydrogen alongside electricity .
Gadi Rothenberg and colleagues at the University of Amsterdam and at IRCE Lyon report in Green Chemistry that the catalyst could be cheaply installed into existing plants .
This kind of technology could ease a transition to a hydrogen economy , reducing the need for heavy investment in large hydrogen - focused plants .
Generating hydrogen and power together " is a conceptual change , " says Rothenberg .
" When you 're going to produce hydrogen , you need n't build a huge new power plant to do that .
Diverting some of your existing methane feed to produce hydrogen just makes sense . "
The group tested many new catalysts based on ceria doped with other metals .
One nickel - based form shows excellent catalytic activity and would cost only $ 10 per kilogram .

After the EU Commission 's ruling against chip giant Intel and AMD 's praising of the decision , it appears that NVIDIA has also taken the opportunity to express its discontent with some of Intel 's business practices .
According to a recent news report , NVIDIA 's chief executive officer , Jen-Hsun Huang , has taken the chance to call Intel 's chip pricing unfair , in regard to the manufacturer 's pricing scheme for the Atom processors .
Despite the harsh statement , NVIDIA 's CEO continued by saying that his company would not seek an antitrust action against the world 's largest chip maker , at least not at this time .
Currently , Santa Clara , California - based Intel is selling its low - powered Atom chip for US $ 45 , for those who want to buy the processor alone .
However , as part of a bundle that includes a three - chip set , the Atom is priced at US $ 25 .
In a recent news article , Reuters reports that Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang , NVIDIA CEO , has recently talked about Intel 's pricing policy for the Atom processors .
“ That seems pretty unfair , ” Huang said to Reuters .
“ We ought to be able to compete and serve that market . ”
However , NVIDIA is n't currently looking for another legal dispute with Chipzilla , according to him .
“ I hope it does n't come down to that , ” he said , adding , “ We have to do whatever we have to do when the time comes .
We really hope this company ( Intel ) will compete on a fair basis . ”
According to the same news report , Intel 's Bill Calder said that the company 's pricing was correct and further emphasized previous statements according to which Intel competed fairly .
“ We compete fairly .
We do not force bundles on any computer makers and customers can purchase Atom individually or as part of the bundle , " said Bill Calder , a spokesman for Intel .
" If you want to purchase the chip set , obviously there is better pricing . ”
Although we are not big fans of anime ( actually , I hate to admit that I do n’t really know much about it , so do n’t ask ) , my son and I attended the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2009 in Odaiba , Tokyo , Japan , while my wife went shopping nearby ( will blog about Odaiba at a future post ) .
It was held in the Tokyo Big Sight , with an admission of 1,000 yen ( about US$ 10 ) for adults and 500 yen ( US$ 5 ) for those under 18 – good thing my son brought his student id because they did n’t believe he was under 18 ( he is very tall for a 13 year old ) .
Some 255 companies from Japan and overseas introduced their latest anime items at 759 booths , with attendance expected at 120,000 – yes , it was very crowded ( and hot ) !
There were lots of figures …
… some cute ones and not so cute ones .
You can also find lots of cute characters …
… and not so cute ones .
Finally , there were many people working in the booths dressed up in anime characters ( do n’t ask me who these characters are , no idea – but I do see a samurai though , so Japanese ) .
Anime ( short for Japanese animation ) , in addition to manga ( Japanese comics ) , is extremely popular in Japan and well known throughout the world .

Bees and ants are true team players unlike other creatures who seek safety in numbers for selfish reasons , according to researchers .
Scientists from Edinburgh and Oxford Universities used mathematical models to study " swarm behaviour " .
They found that bison or fish want to get to the centre of large groups to keep themselves safe from predators .
Ants and bees worked together as a single unit , and were prepared to die for the greater good of the colony .
The study 's findings appear to echo the insect worlds portrayed in the animated films Antz and Bee Movie , in which the characters live in rigidly conformist societies .
In a beehive , the workers are happy to help the community , even to die , because the queen carries and passes on their genes
Dr Andy Gardner
In some co-operative groups of animals - known as superorganisms - members are closely related , and work together to ensure their shared genetic material is passed on , the researchers concluded .
In other groups they perform a policing role , for instance in honey bee hives where worker bees destroy any eggs not laid by the queen to ensure the queen 's offspring survive .
Dr Andy Gardner , from the University of Edinburgh , said : " We often see animals appearing to move in unison , such as bison or fish .
" However , what looks like a team effort is in fact each animal jostling to get to the middle of the group to evade predators .
" By contrast , an ant nest or a beehive can behave as a united organism in its own right .
In a beehive , the workers are happy to help the community , even to die , because the queen carries and passes on their genes .
" However , superorganisms are quite rare , and only exist when the internal conflict within a social group is suppressed - so we cannot use this term , for example , to describe human societies . "
The findings , funded by the Royal Society , are published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology .

California health regulators fined Kaiser Permanente ’s Bellflower hospital $ 250,000 Thursday for failing to keep employees from snooping in the medical records of Nadya Suleman , the mother who set off a media frenzy after giving birth to octuplets in January .
The fine is the first monetary penalty imposed and largest allowed under a new state law enacted last year after widely publicized violations of privacy at UCLA Medical Center involving Farrah Fawcett , Britney Spears , California First Lady Maria Shriver and other celebrities .
Since the law took effect Jan. 1 , hospitals have reported about 300 incidents in which patient records were inappropriately accessed or disclosed .
Most of those were inadvertent , such as giving discharge instructions or medication orders to the wrong patients , but some involved prying into patients ’ records without permission .
The state Department of Public Health found that breaches of Suleman ’s records extended beyond the Bellflower hospital and continued even after Kaiser first informed regulators it had a breach .
Eight workers at other Kaiser hospitals and the chain ’s regional office were among those implicated , said Kathleen Billingsley , deputy director of the Public Health Department ’s Center for Health Care Quality .

The steps Kaiser took to protect Suleman ’s privacy were not aggressive enough , Billingsley and other state health officials said .
“ It ’s the hospital ’s job to prevent these breaches from occurring , not just crack down after the fact , ” said Kim Belshe , secretary of California ’s Health and Human Services .
The law allows the Department of Public Health to impose fines against healthcare facilities of up to $ 25,000 per patient for the first violation and $ 17,500 for each additional violation , up to $ 250,000 .
A separate law allows fines to be imposed against individual healthcare workers .
Belshe said the Kaiser workers were still being investigated by the California Office of Health Information Integrity , which will decide whether individual penalties will be imposed .
“ The fine issued today should be a reminder that there are consequences for violations of medical privacy , ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a written statement .

Kaiser told the public health agency on Feb.
5 that two employees inappropriately accessed the records of Suleman , who gave birth on Jan. 26 to the world ’s only surviving octuplets , according to a Public Health Department report issued Thursday .
By Feb. 20 , six employees had been identified as having accessed records without authorization .
On March 20 , 17 more employees were added to the list , including two doctors , for a total of 23 .
Of those , 15 were either terminated or resigned under pressure and eight faced other disciplinary actions , the state said in a report .
The doctors were among those disciplined , not fired .
As is common practice , the state did not identify Suleman by name , but the facts , dates and circumstances match those of her case .
Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson said the hospital took numerous steps to protect Suleman ’s privacy .
It issued repeated warnings to staff members about privacy laws and added a prompt to her computerized records warning employees of the consequences for looking without permission .

Anderson said there was no proof that any of the employees leaked information to the media .
“ We share the department ’s concern for patient confidentiality , which is why we took all the strong action we took in this case , ” Anderson said .
“ Despite everything we did to try to prevent these kinds of things from happening , it is obvious that curiosity got the better of some people . ”
Jeffery Czech , Suleman ’s lawyer , said his client was not happy that unauthorized personnel looked at her records .
But given the amount of gossip that has been printed about her private life , Czech said , “ she ’s a little deadened to it . ”
“ I think Kaiser handled it professionally .
They found out , they terminated the employees , they brought it to our attention .
They certainly did n’t try to hide it , ” he said .
In their report , state officials said Kaiser ’s risk management office did not produce a list of all the employees who accessed Suleman ’s records until Feb.
5 , more than a week after she gave birth .

“ I believe that they should have anticipated it , ” Billingsley said .
“ If you know someone is coming in , a well - known individual or something that has the potential for other people to be curious . . . you should be able to come up with a solution . ”
Kaiser has 10 days to decide whether to appeal the fine .
Anderson said officials were still evaluating the matter .
The breaches involving Fawcett ’s medical records -- first reported by The Times in April 2008 -- enraged California lawmakers and prompted the new law .
In Fawcett ’s case , a low - level UCLA employee accessed her records more often than her own doctors .
The employee pleaded guilty last year to federal felony charges of selling the information to the National Enquirer .
The woman died of cancer in March before she could be sentenced .
Although state inspectors last year found widespread privacy violations at UCLA , the hospital cannot be fined under the state law because the breaches took place before the law took effect .

Federal law prohibits the unauthorized accessing of a patient ’s medical records .
Since 2003 , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has received nearly 44,000 privacy complaints .
The agency has said it favors helping facilities make needed changes voluntarily as opposed to imposing fines .
Dr. Deborah Peel , founder of Patient Privacy Rights Foundation in Austin , Texas , said new technologies should be used to prevent unauthorized workers from accessing data in the first place .
“ Fines are a last resort and I ’m sure they will help , ” Peel said , but unprotected patient information is “ like leaving money in an unlocked room . ”

Book Review : The Science of Fear
Daniel Gardner ’s The Science of Fear was published last July , but I ’ve only just gotten around to reading it .
That was a big mistake .
It ’s a fantastic look at how how humans deal with fear : exactly the kind of thing I have been reading and writing about for the past couple of years .
It ’s the book I wanted to write , and it ’s a great read .
Gardner writes about how the brain processes fear and risk , how it assesses probability and likelihood , and how it makes decisions under uncertainty .
The book talks about all the interesting psychological studies — cognitive psychology , evolutionary psychology , behavioral economics , experimental philosophy — that illuminate how we think and act regarding fear .
The book also talks about how fear is used to influence people , by marketers , by politicians , by the media .
And lastly , the book talks about different areas where fear plays a part : health , crime , terrorism .
There have been a lot of books published recently that apply these new paradigms of human psychology to different domains — to randomness , to traffic , to rationality , to art , to religion , and etc. — but after you read a few you start seeing the same dozen psychology experiments over and over again .
Even I did it , when I wrote about the psychology of security .
But Gardner ’s book is different : he goes further , explains more , demonstrates his point with the more obscure experiments that most authors do n’t bother seeking out .
His writing style is both easy to read and informative , a nice mix of data an anecdote .
The flow of the book makes sense .
And his analysis is spot-on .
My only problem with the book is that Gardner does n’t use standard names for the various brain heuristics he talks about .
Yes , his names are more intuitive and evocative , but they ’re wrong .
If you have already read other books in the field , this is annoying because you have to constantly translate into standard terminology .
And if you have n’t read anything else in the field , this is a real problem because you ’ll be needlessly confused when you read about these things in other books and articles .
So here ’s a handy conversion chart .
Print it out and tape it to the inside front cover .
Print another copy out and use it as a bookmark .
Rule of Typical
Things = representativeness heuristic
Example Rule = availability heuristic
Good - Bad Rule = affect heuristic
confirmation bias = confirmation bias
That ’s it .
That ’s the only thing I did n’t like about the book .
Otherwise , it ’s perfect .
It ’s the book I wish I had written .
Only I do n’t think I would have done as good a job as Gardner did .
The Science of Fear should be required reading for …well , for everyone .
The paperback will be published in June .
But , amazingly enough , the hardcover is on sale for only $ 6 at Amazon .
Buy two and give one to someone else .
Here ’s a link from Powell ’s , if you ’re boycotting Amazon .

More than one billion to go hungry in 2009
By Hiram Lee
2 April 2009
In a report delivered before the United Nations ' Food Policy conference in Bangkok Thailand on Monday , Jacques Diouf , the director general of the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) warned that more than one billion people across the world were now likely to go undernourished in 2009 .
That number is up from the 963 million , or roughly 1 in 7 people , projected by the FAO for 2008 .
Diouf pointed out that while prices for essential agricultural commodities such as rice , corn and wheat have fallen from the destructive heights they reached in 2008 , they remain approximately 30 percent higher than 2005 rates .
Diouf told the Financial Times in an interview last week , " The food crisis is not over . "
Current prices are already placing an enormous burden on poor and working class people throughout the world .
However , Diouf further warned that prices could soar once again to the highs recorded between 2007 and 2008 due to the lack of credit currently available to farmers , which has affected their production and expansion capabilities .
During 2007 - 2008 the price of corn rose 31 percent , rice 74 percent , soybeans 87 percent and wheat 130 percent .
The inability of masses of people to afford basic food necessities under these conditions led to global unrest , with food riots breaking out in no less than 30 countries .
The FAO has documented at length a number of the ongoing emergencies in food security .
In the most recent update on food emergencies from February , the FAO reports that 32 countries around the world are in a state of immediate crisis and food insecurity , requiring external assistance .
The FAO has placed particular emphasis on the Gaza Strip , devastated by recent Israeli aggression , as well as Kenya , Somalia and Zimbabwe , where " the food security situation is precarious following drought - reduced crops , civil disturbance and / or economic crisis . "
The report notes , " More than 18 million people face serious food insecurity due either to conflict , unrest , or adverse weather or a combined effect " in Eastern Africa .
In Kenya , the FAO reports , millions are faced with food insecurity , and the government " has declared a state of National Disaster and indicated that about 10 million people are highly food insecure including 3.2 million drought - affected people . "
" In Eritrea , [ in Northeastern Africa ] , " the report states , " cereal prices remain high affecting the food security of large sections of the population " while across its Western border in southern Sudan , " despite an overall improvement in the supply of cereals , inadequate transport and marketing systems will prevent any significant movements from surplus to deficit areas . "
A report released by the International Trade Union Federation in March titled A Recipe for Hunger : How the World is Failing on Food , attempts to paint a broader picture of the crisis while echoing predictions made by Diouf and the FAO : " In Africa the poorest are hit the hardest .
160 million people are trying to survive on an income of less than half a dollar a day .
Most of those households are net buyers of food , not producers .
The result is that soaring food prices hit household budgets of the poor in the developing countries .
An impact felt instantly because an average of 50 to 70 percent of their budget is spent on food , leaving no room for a well - balanced , highly nutritional diet . "
The report goes on to say that " not since the 1970s and the international oil crisis have food prices across the globe been this elevated .
...
The shock of high prices began already in 2006 , and agricultural commodity prices continued to rise until mid-2008 .
Medium - term projections from FAO indicate that food prices in 2009 may fall but will still remain well above their pre-2004 level in the coming years . "
Having made a number of dire predictions regarding world hunger , Diouf 's proposed solution for confronting the crisis is to appeal to the leaders of the G20 countries for funds .
" The first and foremost important element , " says Diouf , " is the need to invest in agricultural production , and this would require $ 30 billion a year . "
The proposed solution to the problem presented by Diouf , the FAO and similar agencies entrusted with the monitoring of food emergencies , does n't approach the heart of the problem .
If $ 30 billion per year or more is required to save agricultural production from a state of crisis , one must ask , under whose control and in whose interests those investments are to be made
To leave the food supplies and their distribution to the world 's population in the hands of the G20 leaders and the ruling elites of the nation states they represent , only leads the food crisis into continued chaos .
The already vulnerable and anarchic state of worldwide food production was exploded by the credit crisis and the rampant speculation in food commodities that came as credit bubbles burst , but the root cause of widespread food insecurity is not the current crisis but the very nature of the capitalist system itself , from which the crisis has emerged .
SEOUL  Two American journalists detained in North Korea will be indicted and tried on charges of perpetrating " hostile acts " against the Communist state , a crime punishable by years in a labor camp , the North ’s state - run news agency reported on Tuesday .
Pyongyang ’s decision to put Laura Ling and Euna Lee on trial signaled that the regime has no intention of freeing them soon .
Their indictment comes amid heightening tension between Pyongyang and Washington over a North Korean plan to launch a rocket by Wednesday next week .
United States officials consider a possible rocket launch a provocative test of the North ’s long - range missile technology .
Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee , reporters for Current TV , a San Francisco - based media venture founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore , were arrested by the North Korean military on March 17 on charges of illegally crossing the border from China .
They were in China to report the plight of North Korean refugees who fled hunger at home and were living in hiding there .
Though I ’m fighting a battle with flab , I ’m not into diets .
Never have been .
Probably never will be .
I ’m much more interested in overall healthier living , rather than sporadic dieting .
Why deprive myself ?
There are plenty of ways to eat healthy and yet enjoy really good food .
That ’s why I ’m glad Ellie Krieger feels the same way .
I ’ve spoken about her in the past — she ’s the nutritionist and cook from Food Network ’s “ Healthy Appetite ” and released a cookbook just last year called The Food You Crave : Luscious Recipes for a Healthy Life .
Her philosophy of food is that a person really should n’t have to sacrifice the things they like to eat , because there are ways to make them healthy .
Case in point : Pancakes .
I love pancakes .
Fluffy , delicious , swimming in sweet syrup pancakes — but without the fat ?
Seems like a tall order .
Well , I happened to have a small carton of strawberries in my fridge that I did n’t want to go to waste , so when I saw this as the very first recipe in the book , I stopped right there and made them for dinner .
That ’s right , dinner .
Because I ’m just that bad ass .
Come on , I know I ’m not the only one out there who would eat breakfast any time of the day .
Our dear web admin was not as enthused .
He was worried that it was a lot of sugar for dinner .
“ Nope , ” I said , “ there ’s no sugar except for the two tablespoons of pure maple syrup and sprinkle of powdered sugar on top . ”
Once he was on board , I set up the kitchen and started making breakfast .
Ellie includes nutritional information with each recipe .
Here ’s how this stacked up :

Whole Wheat Pancakes with Strawberry Sauce
Adapted from Ellie Krieger ’s Healthy Appetite & The Food You Crave 3/4 cup all - purpose flour
3/4 cup whole - grain pastry flour or whole - wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup lowfat buttermilk
3/4 cup nonfat milk
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Cooking Spray
Confectioner ’s Sugar ( optional )
Strawberry Sauce ( recipe follows )
In a large bowl , whisk together the flours , baking powder , baking soda , and salt .
In a medium bowl , beat together the eggs , buttermilk , nonfat milk , honey , and vanilla .
Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients , mixing only enough to combine them .
The batter will be somewhat lumpy .
Coat a large nonstick griddle or skillet with cooking spray and preheat over medium - low heat .
Use a 1/4 measure to ladle the batter onto the griddle or skillet .
Flip the pancakes when they are golden brown on the bottom and bubbles are floating on top , about 1 1/2 minutes .
These fluff up really nicely in the pan .
I was elated to see that they became these puffy clouds — I hate flat pancakes .
At the time , I was worried about cooking them on medium - low , but they did quite well and cooked pretty quickly on that setting .
I played with the heat a bit to see what might work better , but in the end I thought medium - low worked better , as they cooked just as quickly and the ends did n’t darken as much as when I had it up higher .
Cook the other side until golden brown , about 1 1/2 minutes .
Keep the pancakes warm in a 200 - degree F oven as you finish cooking the remaining ones .
A trick my mom used to do is she would cover the pancakes with a damp towel and put them in the oven .
The steam from the towel would keep the pancakes from drying out .
That method works well for me .
Strawberry Sauce
2 pints ( 16 ounces ) fresh strawberries , hulled , or 4 cups frozen unsweetened strawberries , thawed
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
Place the strawberries in a food processor and process them into a chunky puree .
Stir in the lemon juice and maple syrup .
Plate , sprinkle with powdered sugar , eat , enjoy .
Lick plate clean .
I suggest the powdered sugar for anyone who is used to high sugar content .
If you are a person who is trying to change your palette into something a little more healthy and needs something that ’s got a hint of sweetness in it , put a shake or two of powdered sugar on top .
I put a few spoonfuls into a sifter and just shook it over the pancakes .
What you ’re seeing in the picture is a bit much —
I ’d cut that down to half for the right amount of sweetness without making the healthier pancake a moot point .
It ’s like going to McDonald ’s and ordering a diet coke with your burger and fries .
I really enjoyed the pancakes and strawberry puree together .
Let me explain — I did n’t like them separately .
I tried the pancake alone .
It was okay , but some of the ingredients were a little odd just plain .
The strawberry puree alone was also a little funky .
Somehow the syrup in the puree really threw me off because , although there was n’t much in there , I could taste a lot of it .
Together , it all worked .
I spread some of the puree on the pancake , and really liked how the fruit and hint of sweetness in the strawberries brought out the different flavors inside the pancake .
It was a light meal , and I was happy to know that I was eating something nutritious .
Next time I probably wo n’t put as much confectioners ’ sugar on it , but I do believe it required a tiny bit for additional sweetness .
These pancakes were a fun and healthier option of the regular smothered in sugary syrup breakfast — or dinner , whatever your poison .
Lots of dishes involved in this one , because there ’s mixing and pouring and pureeing .
The taste was delicious and it ’s something I will make again as a fun and tasty treat , and is even something I would serve to guests .
It ’s not what I ’d consider five - star , so I do have to knock it down for that , but the healthy component and the fact that it ’s tasty enough to be served at a quaint , country bed and breakfast support a positive rating .

Demographics
4117 individual applicants were seen on as many as four occasions between November 2001 and June 30 , 2007 .
All were seeking a physicians ' approval of their use of cannabis ; 3187 ( 77.4 % ) , were male , ranging in age from 16 to 91 when first seen ( median age 31 ) .
930 ( 22.6 % ) were female , ranging in age from 16 to 89 , with a median age of 36 .
The median age of the entire population was 32 , reflecting both the smaller number of females and their somewhat greater age when first seen .
Table 1 shows race / ethnicity for the entire population .
Analysis by year - of - birth ( Table 2 ) reveals more Asians and Hispanics among the younger applicants , reflecting the two groups that have been immigrating to California in the greatest numbers in recent years .
Analysis by both age and race also revealed other differences .

As subsequently shown by a more searching analysis , the composition of the applicant population has been changing steadily .

Tables 3 and 4 summarize educational and occupational histories ;
Table 5 provides data on applicants who were unemployed when first seen .
Overall , this population exhibited lower High School drop out rates and higher percentage of graduates than national averages .
The percentages earning Bachelors ' degrees and Doctorates are nearly identical to the national average , but only about one half as many had earned Masters ' degrees .

The two groups are quite similar except for the relative scarcity of retirees in the applicant population .
Full size table
Their occupations resembled US averages in some employment areas and were quite different in others ( Table 4 ) ; in terms of non-occupational divisions ( Table 5 ) , a much smaller percentage are retirees , a finding that reflects both their relative youth and the paucity of applicants born before 1946 .
Although the extremes of applicant age ranged from 16 to 91 , only 3 were under 18 when first seen .
The great majority ( 84.16 % ) were between 21 and 60 , a finding further emphasized when the population is examined by year of birth ( Table 6 ) , a perspective that also discloses how few ( 4.53 % ) had been born before 1946 .
The overall male female ratio was nearly four to one ( Table 7 ) ; however when examined as year of birth cohorts , it varies from over 5:1 for the youngest applicants to almost 3:1 for the oldest .
Nearly 70 % were Caucasians and 16 % were Black , with sizable numbers of Hispanics and Asians ( Table 1 ) .

This further emphasizes that one 's birth cohort determines what drugs one can try during adolescence .

Table 7 Birth cohorts and gender ( N = 3906 ) .
Although women were outnumbered by men in each cohort , there were significant differences noted with age .

Initiation and use of cannabis
An overwhelming majority ( 87.9 % ) of 3038 applicants queried about the details of their cannabis initiation had tried it before the age of 19 , usually in the company of older siblings , cousins or peers .
After subtracting those born before 1946 , the percentage of applicants who had tried marijuana before the age of twenty went up to 90 % .
Some became regular users almost immediately , while others remained sporadic users for years ( that interval was estimated by asking them when they first began to " buy their own " ) .
Amounts and patterns of cannabis use
Essentially all applicants queried about their current use were consuming inhaled cannabis on a regular basis in amounts that varied considerably , but tended to remain stable over time .
The range is from less than one sixteenth ounce per week to over one ounce , with about 70 % estimating they consume between 1/8 and 1/4 oz . / week .
Almost 90 % acknowledge daily , or near daily ( " six days a week " ) use , with about 10 % insisting their use is far less frequent , in the range of two to five days / week .
Mode of cannabis use
There was a decided preference for inhaled cannabis .
Most had not tried edibles until their own recommendation , or that of a friend , gave them access to edibles from a club or dispensary .
Only 50 of 830 ( 6 % ) questioned about edibles were using them on a regular basis .
The reasons given were that edible effects were more difficult to control and more likely to be undesirable and / or prolonged .
Initiation and use of tobacco and alcohol
One of the more significant patterns revealed by comparing average initiation ages for cannabis , alcohol and tobacco within the context of birth cohorts was that the oldest Baby Boomers had tried cannabis at a considerably later age than their younger successors .
By 1975 , less than ten years after the " Summer of Love , " in 1967 , cannabis was being initiated by over half of all American adolescents at close to the same average ages they also were trying alcohol and tobacco ( Table 8 , Figure 1 ) .
Table 8
Average initiation ages for entry level agents ( N = 2498 ) .
This table is depicted by Figure 1 and emphasizes the rapid fall in age at initiation of cannabis after it first became available in high schools .
Full size table
Figure 1 Average initiation age tobacco , alcohol and cannabis .
Those born before 1940 were fewest in number ; they had also tried cannabis at the oldest average age .
Baby Boomers born after 1946 were the first large cohort , and their successors were still younger when they tried cannabis .
The 61–65 cohort initiated cannabis , alcohol , and tobacco at essentially the same average age .
Full size image
Essentially all applicants also admitted to trying alcohol .
Nearly two thirds ( 64.3 % ) of the 1226 specifically queried about alcohol blackouts had experienced at least one and 6.26 % admitted to four or more .
Of 1214 applicants asked to compare their current alcohol consumption with their previous lifetime peak , 130 ( 10.7 % ) claimed to be abstinent , 341 ( 28 % ) said they were drinking less than 5 % of their lifetime peaks , and an overwhelming 1058 ( 87 % ) claimed to be drinking less than half as much .
Most of those who noted little change from their lifetime peaks had been moderate drinkers to begin with .
This is evidence that once cannabis was established as their drug of choice , this population 's subsequent alcohol consumption diminished ; both collectively , and as individuals , a finding that clearly deserves further evaluation .
A history of cigarette initiation , later followed by chronic use , was prevalent in this population .
2559 of 2741 ( 96.4 % ) applicants , when asked if they had ever tried inhaling a cigarette , had done so ; of 1324 who were specifically queried about their lifetime cigarette use , 872 ( 65.8 % ) had become daily smokers for some length of time .
Although all but four of those still smoking claim they want to quit , only 316 ( 36.2 % ) of all smokers ( 23.9 % of respondents ) had been able to do so by the time of the interview .
Most who are still smoking have reduced their daily cigarette consumption ; a majority relate temporary increases in their daily cigarette use to " stress . "
Thus the impact of daily cannabis use on cigarette consumption , although less impressive than is the case with alcohol , also seems significant and worthy of further exploration .
Other drug initiations
When examined from the standpoint of both year of birth ( YOB ) cohorts and admitted initiations of other illegal agents ( Table 9 , Figure 2 ) noticeable and consistent differences are revealed : whites in every age cohort had consistently tried all other illegal agents more frequently than other racial groups ( Table 10 ) .
Table 9 Initiation rates for other illegal drugs by YOB cohorts ( N = 2364 ) .
With the exception of " magic mushrooms , " and ecstasy ( a psychedelic made illegal in 1988 ) , initiation rates for all Schedule One drugs have declined since 1975 .
Full size table
Table 10 Initiations of other illegal drugs by race ( N=2400 ) .
Although race seems related to initiation rates throughout , this shows that drug initiations by all aces trying cannabis have been falling proportionately as the adolescent market matured .
Full size table
Figure 2
Other illegal drugs tried by 10 year cohort analysis .
Interestingly , while all cohorts sampled other illegal drugs aggressively during adolescence , the rates at which they 've done so have fallen progressively .
Note also the striking generational differences in peyote / mescaline initiations by older cohorts and ecstasy by younger ones .
Full size image
Further cohort analysis of this population 's adolescent interest in other illegal drugs , plus its nearly universal initiation of alcohol and tobacco , suggest that while race ( Table 10 ) , and generation ( Table 9 ) exert significant influences , gender merely parallels ethnicity ( Table 11 ) .
Table 11 Initiations of Other Illegal Drugs by Gender ( N=2464 ) .
Similarly , although women consistently tried all agents somewhat less often than men , the close parallels and internal consistency suggests the data are reliable .

Despite such differences ( Tables 9 &10 ) , all cohorts and racial groups have shown steady downward trends in their initiation of all other illegal drugs , with the interesting exception of psychedelic mushrooms ( psilocybin ) and , perhaps , ecstasy ( MDMA ) .
China also has good reasons for not wanting to see the kind of North - South Korean conglomerate that might ultimately emerge from collapse .
Reunification of the Korean Peninsula would be , to say the least , geopolitically inconvenient to China .
Jutting out far from the Asian mainland , the Korean Peninsula commands all maritime traffic in northeastern China and , most importantly , traps in its armpit the Bohai Sea , home to China ’s largest offshore oil reserve .
Moreover , a unified Korea would likely be nationalistic , with distinctly mixed feelings toward its large neighbors , China and Japan , who have historically sought to control and even occupy it .
And so Kim lives in dread of the Chinese slowly , methodically undermining his regime in a way that will lead to him being replaced — in a palace coup , perhaps — without the implosion of the North Korean state .
His only hope is to draw America into direct talks , with Washington implicitly recognizing his regime , so that he can leverage Washington against Beijing .
Nuclear tests and missile launches are his own warped way of trying to get the attention of the new Obama Administration .
He needs to be enough of a problem that Washington will have no choice but to deal with him directly , rather than merely as one party among several in the multilateral talks that have characterized negotiations with North Korea since 2003 .
This strategy poses a real problem for President Barack Obama .
If he does n’t hit North Korea hard with sanctions , he risks demonstrating to Iran that America is a pushover .
Indeed , Obama ’s Iran policy – which requires the stick of tough action in addition to the carrot of talks and recognition – is on the line in North Korea .
On the other hand , vigorous sanctions against North Korea could lead to the collapse of the regime .
And anyone who talks breezily about “ helping ” North Korea to collapse has simply not learned the lesson of Iraq :
The only thing worse than a totalitarian state is no state at all .
North Korea , with 23 million people , is roughly the size of Iraq — and its population is less educated and has much less experience with democracy than do the Iraqis , who had enjoyed several decades of semi-democracy in the early - and mid-20th century .
A regime breakdown in Pyongyang might necessitate the mother of all humanitarian interventions , with the American military and the Chinese People 's Liberation Army being forced to work together .
Nobody wants to go down that road , certainly not China or the U.S.
A nuclear test in the North irritates the Chinese leadership , but the thought of large - scale violence and millions of refugees outright terrifies them .
Bottom - line : tough sanctions will have to be smart sanctions – measures that hurt the regime more than the North Korean population , thus keeping the North Korean state alive but weakened .
We say that we want a free , democratic , and unified Korean Peninsula .
But what we should want more specifically is a long , gradual transition to such an outcome .
Pushing for North Korea ’s precipitous demise would only alienate South Korea and propel it into the arms of China , for South Korea , too , would be threatened by the chaos of a sudden regime collapse .
Now is not the time for unilateral threats .
The disaster in Iraq should be foremost in our minds when dealing with North Korea .
And that means , hard as it may be to swallow , working with Beijing .
Gene patents have always been a contentious topic , as many have questioned whether the products of millions of years of evolution really merits the same sort of protection that a new process technology does .
Nevertheless , the issue appeared to be diminishing in importance , as the rate of gene patenting dropped and most researchers were n't finding their work inhibited by patents .
Now , it appears that the issue will be coming back to the fore , as the ACLU is announcing a major lawsuit against Myriad Genetics , which holds patents related to testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes , which are often mutated in hereditary breast cancer cases .
The ACLU is organizing and promoting the suit — it has a website devoted to it , complete with video — but it has been joined by a variety of academics involved in clinical research , as well as a number of medical organizations , including the American College of Medical Genetics , and three different pathology groups .
Patients affected by the limits placed on BRCA testing have also joined the suit .
The ACLU has lined up statements of support from a number of organizations that focus on medical ethics , as well as a Nobel Laureate .
The heavy legal lifting will be done by the Public Patent Foundation , which is associated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law .
On the receiving end of all that legal firepower are the groups associated with the patents , the University of Utah Research Foundation ( the BRCA genes were first identified by researchers located at the U of U ) and the company the patents were licensed to , Myriad Genetics .
But the suit also brings in the US Patent and Trademark Office , which granted them in the first place .
The BRCA patents and their discontents
To understand the issues , it 's necessary to take a short diversion into the patents themselves .
When the genes were first cloned and the patents filed , it was n't clear that a genetic test was even feasible , as the genes were very large , had many complex mutations , and sequencing DNA was very slow .
Fortunately , a small subset of mutations were prevalent in a number of ethnic groups , presumably due to founder effects .
This allowed Myriad to market a useful test , which brought in more and more samples .
Further analysis of these samples allowed Myriad to build what 's currently the most comprehensive database of BRCA mutations and their implications .
These genes , their effects , and the correlations between the genes and disease were created by nature and exist in nature .
They are pure information and , in order to build upon them , one needs to utilize the patented sequences , which is not permissible under the patents .
To protect its monopoly on testing , Myriad has continued to file patents that , in sum , prevent anyone from looking too carefully at the BRCA DNA sequences .
The patents list a wide variety of common gene variants that Myriad considers significant , but provide no details on what , precisely , their significance is .
It even patented the mere action of comparing BRCA sequences in patient samples , even though that process involves little more than standard laboratory techniques and the use of sequence comparison software , free versions of which are available both as freeware and commercial software .
In short , perfectly legal techniques become patent infringement when applied to these specific genes .
All of these aspects of the patents come under fire in the suit , which lists all sorts of ways in which the patents have inhibited patient care and science .
For example , early in the testing history , variations that were n't recognized as significant were n't examined as part of the standard procedure .
Now , improved tests are available , but anyone who had an earlier test done would need to repay for this more detailed information .
Several parties in the suit are patients that have insurance that is n't accepted by Myriad , which means they either need to come up with the cash or do without .
The suit also alleges that , because the first founder mutations were discovered in Caucasian populations , there 's now a strong bias towards variations known to affect these groups ; public study of BRCA mutations could correct this , but it is disallowed by the patents .
So far , Myriad has n't generally enforced its patents against researchers simply interested in studying the gene ( although the suit alleges that there are a number of exceptions ) .
But that mere fact places medical researchers in an awkward position .
As part of their studies , they 're likely to identify BRCA carriers , and will feel ethically compelled to inform them .
But this goes directly against Myriad 's financial interests , and is likely to see a response from the company .
All of that is bad , but it does n't necessarily make the patents invalid .
The suit argues that the way Myriad has operated , however , violates the basic premise of US patent law .
The system was designed so that patents would result in the disclosure of information , which would further progress by allowing others to build on that information .
Instead , the way things have been operating , that 's impossible .
" These genes , their effects , and the correlations between the genes and disease were created by nature and exist in nature , " the suit claims .
" They are pure information and , in order to build upon them , one needs to utilize the patented sequences , which is not permissible under the patents . "
Gene patents as an uncertain value proposition
This seems like a bit of a reach , and I do n't have the legal knowledge to evaluate whether these claims are too far out there for serious consideration by the legal system .
But , for Myriad , even a loss in the courts may not matter .
At this point , anyone with a PCR machine and access to DNA sequencing could obtain the sequence of their BRCA genes without Myriad being any the wiser .
In fact , a number of people , such as James Watson , essentially have , as they 've had their entire genome sequenced .
As sequencing comes down in price , the genie covered by this patent will be forever out of its bottle , making the current attempt to invalidate them little more than an acceleration of the inevitable .
That does n't mean that Myriad will be out of business , however — thanks to its dominance in this area , it now has a comprehensive database of variants and prognoses that nobody else will be likely to match .
In the near future , that will probably mean that it will be in a position to allow anyone to sequence the BRCA genes in any way they want ; they 'll just have to pay Myriad to have the results interpreted .
Of course , that would n't stop low - cost competitors from providing a cheaper , but less - accurate analysis , which would open up another ethical can of worms .
Will other companies find themselves in a similar position regarding other genes ?
Given the current patent system , it 's entirely possible .
If you 'd like to have some say on the matter , the Department of Health and Human Services is in the process of setting an official policy on gene patenting and will be accepting public comment on drafts of the policy for a few more days .

This joyful stress would begin with the city ’s most important meal : breakfast .
Despite its laid - back aura , Portland is an early - rising town , and its commuting cyclists need fuel for their morning rides .
They could do worse than stop at Bunk Sandwiches , which in the six months since it opened has started a meat - and - other - things - on - bread renaissance by combining high - quality ingredients in innovative ways .
The house creations appear each day on a chalkboard near the doorway — an Oregon albacore tuna melt , a P.B.L.T. of pork belly , lettuce and green tomato pickles — but at 7 a .m. there ’s really only one choice , the classic breakfast sandwich ( sausage patty , sharp Tillamook Cheddar and a fried egg on a poppy - seed hard roll , $ 5 ) .
As is , it ’s stellar .
But add anchovies ( $ 2 ) , and it ’s something else entirely , the fishy saltiness amping up the sausage ’s sweetness and the tartness of the cheese .
Seven bucks may seem a lot , but for the best breakfast sandwich ever , it ’s a bargain .
Another morning , I met my friend Alison Williams Colman and her husband , Laurence Colman , at Broder , a Scandinavian brunch spot on a quintessentially Portland section of Southeast Clinton Street .
( Bike lane ?
Check .
Brewery ?
Check .
Discount art - house cinema ?
Vintage stores ?
Punk rock record shops ?
Check , check , check ! )
Broder was packed , but the free coffee in the next - door waiting room kept us going until we could squeeze into a table and order some smoked - trout hash .
When the $ 41 check came , Alison surprised me by whipping out a $ 25 coupon she ’d bought for $ 2 on Restaurant.com .
The waiter accepted it without a peep ( he got a big tip ) , and I marveled again at how well Portlanders live on so little .
Portland ’s food carts may be the best example of that .
Carts have existed for roughly a decade , offering low - cost lunchtime grub , but in the last couple of years they ’ve exploded in numbers and ambition , with cuisines ranging from Mexican and Thai to Korean and Kazakh to Dutch waffles and Belgian fries .
( A Russian cart even found brief fame as a destination on last season ’s “ Amazing Race ” finale , but it has since closed . )
Today , there are almost 400 carts around Portland , most of them clustered into “ pods ” that ring parking lots , and thanks to low start - up costs and Multnomah County ’s straightforward licensing and inspection regime , aspiring chefs can make their names without major investments .
As a New Yorker I was jealous ; as the Frugal Traveler , overjoyed at what I could find within a single pod .
The slices ( $ 2 to $ 3 ) at Give Pizza a Chance were excellent , with a thin inner crust , a thicker , chewy outer crust and fresh , brightly flavored toppings ( like the tomatoes , basil , artichokes and onions on the “ Compost ” slice ) .
Next door , at Tábor , I followed the painted instructions to “ Czech Out Czech Food ” and fell in love with the schnitzelwich ( $ 6.50 ) , a fried pork or chicken cutlet bound to soft bread with ajvar ( a red- pepper spread ) and stinging horseradish sauce .
Brunch Box , around the corner , was making its own English muffins , plus crazy burgers like the OMG !
( $ 6 ) , a cheeseburger with egg , ham , SPAM and bacon ; and the YouCanHasCheeseburger ( $ 5 ) , a patty stuck between two Texas - toast grilled cheese sandwiches .
( Bring Lipitor . )
One of the best things about food carts , in Portland and elsewhere , is getting to talk to the person who ’s cooking your meal .
Ziba Ljucevic , who runs Ziba ’s Pitas , is one of the sweetest operators in all of Portland ’s pods .
A Bosnian immigrant , she arrived in 2002 just after the Balkan wars , speaking almost no English but fluent in the culinary language of her homeland .
Unlike Greek pitas , Ms. Ljucevic ’s are round , bready pies of surpassing lightness , stuffed with ground meat , spinach , zucchini or ( my favorite ) eggs , cheese and sour cream .
For $ 5.95 , she ’ll give you a quarter of each , plus cucumber salad and a puddle of ajvar , and if you chat with her , as I did , about regional pita variations among the former Yugoslav republics , she may throw in a free drink .
The food carts even have Portland ’s second - favorite beverage covered .
Spella Caffè , next door to Ziba ’s , pulls what I deemed the best espresso in Portland , rich and mellow .
At $ 1.75 , it ’s also the least expensive of the city ’s high - end coffee drinks .
At Stumptown ’s several locations , the sharp , bitter and acidic shot costs $ 2 .
It ’s meant to go with milk , they say ; alas , I ca n’t drink milk .
Sri Lanka : Ten Questions
By Satya Sagar
30 May , 2009
Countercurrents.org
As the gory details of what the Tamil population of northern Sri Lanka have been subjected in recent weeks emerge - bit by bloody bit - there is need for a full accounting of every act of barbarity committed against them by the Sri Lankan government .
For , behind Colombo ’s public parade of bodies of dead rebels and tasteless celebrations of ‘ victory ’ over the Tamil Tigers there hides today a horror list of unspeakable crimes carried out by the Mahinda Rajapakse regime .
Make no mistake about it - for all the Sri Lankan spin about what really happened in the final weeks of assault on the LTTE - the simple fact remains that this was a war conducted with no respect for either global opinion or any human norm , international convention or law .
And the governments of the world , blinded as they are by the perverse notion that every evil is acceptable in the global ‘ War on Terror ’ , seem to have completely lost their moral compass in the case of Sri Lanka .
Or are they keeping quiet because those who died in this grossly one - sided war were dark - skinned , poor and the term ‘ genocide ’ cannot be applied to them no matter how many of them are murdered in cold blood ?
For the people of the world , the perpetual and historical victims of state terror , there remains no option but to fight back and demand justice .
To begin with here are ten questions that need to be answered immediately :
1 ) How many civilians died in the final weeks of assault on the LTTE inside the ‘ no fire ’ zone and what has happened to their corpses ?
2 ) Why were hospitals treating the injured and the sick inside the ‘ no fire ’ zone repeatedly shelled by the Sri Lankan army and what is the fate of the Tamil doctors who reported this to the global media ?
3 ) What kind of banned weapons did the Sri Lankan forces use in their operations against the LTTE and which governments around the world supplied these to them ?
4 ) Despite repeated official assertions that the ‘ war is over ’ why is the Sri Lankan government afraid of allowing independent media , humanitarian workers and human rights groups access to war affected areas ?
5 ) Why are the thousands upon thousands of Tamil refugees – Sri Lankan citizens all of them - still being kept behind barbed wires like cattle corralled off before slaughter and why are Tamil youth being abducted from within these camps ?
6 ) Why are the repeated reports of Tamil women being raped by Sri Lankan army personnel not being investigated ?
7 ) Why are Sri Lankan journalists questioning the conduct of the war being killed , tortured or forced into exile if the government has nothing to hide ?
8 ) How can a chauvinist regime responsible for the worst kind of prejudice and atrocities against its minority population be entrusted with either their immediate rehabilitation or long - term solutions to the island ’s ethnic question ?
9 ) How long will it be before Mahinda Rajapakse and all high officials under his command are brought before an International Tribunal to account for their war crimes and crimes against humanity ?
10 ) Now that the Tamil Tigers are defeated is it not time for the world to tame the rampaging Sinhala Lion too ?

The following is a post from the site Euro Intelligence , published just 5 days ago regarding the Swedish solution to the banking crisis .
I am providing this version with the author ’s permission , who should be credited with much of the Swedish bank resolution solution ’s creation .
A longer version is linked at the bottom of this post .
Lars Jonung , who wrote this piece , is now a research adviser at the European Commission in Brussels .
He was previously professor of economics at the Stockholm School of Economics .
He has published many books and articles in English and Swedish and is the co-author of the leading macroeconomic textbook in Swedish .
You should also note that Jonung served as chief economic adviser to the Prime Minister Carl Bildt in 1992 - 94 when the Swedish solution was implemented .
I would also say that his characterization of events in this piece is very much at odds with what Alan Blinder recently said in a New York Times piece .
Given Jonung ’s prominent role in the process , this discrepancy should be noted .
Banks all over the world are in deep trouble .
This has created an interest in the successful bank resolution policy adopted in Sweden in the early 1990s .
But can the Swedish model of yesterday be applied in other countries today ?
When Sweden was hit by a financial crisis in 1991 - 93 , its response comprised a unique combination of seven distinctive features : 1 ) swift policy action , 2 ) political unity , 3 ) a blanket government guarantee of all bank liabilities ( including deposits but excluding shareholder capital ) , 4 ) an appropriate legal framework based on open - ended government funding , 5 ) complete information disclosure by banks asking for government support , 6 ) a differentiated resolution policy by which banks were classified according to their financial strength and treated accordingly , and 7 ) an overall monetary and fiscal policy that facilitated the bank resolution policy .
Two major banks were taken over by the government .
Their assets were split into a good bank and a bad bank , the “ toxic ” assets of the latter being dealt with by asset - management companies ( AMCs ) which focused solely on the task of disposing of them .
When transferring assets from the banks to the AMCs , cautious market values were applied , thus putting a floor under the valuation of such assets , mostly real estate .
This restored demand and liquidity , and thus put a break on falling asset prices .
The Swedish model proved successful .
The banking system was kept intact .
It continued to function , swiftly emerged from the crisis and remained mainly in private hands .
Taxpayers did not lose out in the long run .
The net fiscal cost of the bank resolution 15 years after the crisis is close to zero .
The policy priority of saving the banks , not the owners of the banks , kept moral hazard at bay .
The bank resolution policy was carried out transparently and openly .
The centre - right government under Carl Bildt cooperated with the social democratic opposition , creating public trust in the resolution process .
Today ’s global crisis is different from the Swedish crisis of the 1990s in important respects .
The Swedish financial system was small , with only half a dozen major banks .
It was also bank - based , with few major non-bank financial actors , and was less sophisticated and less globalized than the current world financial system .
Still , there are lessons from the Swedish resolution policy that may serve as guiding principles today .
First , the Swedish experience demonstrates that a genuine threat of public receivership or nationalization does galvanize banks into action .
With this threat hanging over them , private banks in Sweden made great efforts to solve their problems themselves by asking their owners for capital .
The lesson is that no government support should be given to a financial institution with zero or negative equity until its present owners have surrendered their control and ownership .
Banks and their networks of debtors and creditors should be saved – not bank owners and not bank managers .
Once this principle is commonly accepted , government rescues will be easier to carry out .
Moral hazard will be reined in – today and in the future .
Taxpayers will more readily accept the necessary public expenses .
Presently , policy choices are often hampered by a political dislike of public receivership ( nationalization ) – even if such a step would be economically more efficient and just .
The Swedes , however , put ideology and fear of big government aside .
Their priority , from the Conservative party to the Social Democrats , was to find a quick , workable solution .
Today , major steps towards pseudo - nationalization have been taken in many countries , creating the worst of all possible worlds : governments are financing bad banks without outright owning them and failed managers and owners are not punished .
This creates public distrust in the resolution policy as a whole .
Temporary public receivership with a clear exit strategy is a more efficient approach , and less costly to the taxpayers .
As any student of finance knows , the value of a bankrupt bank is zero .
Second , the Swedish experience suggests that all banks that are put under public receivership should be split immediately into a good bank and a bad bank , under the control of an independent authority with the goal of terminating the operations of the bad bank in a specified time frame , say within less than 10 years .
This avoids Japanese - style “ zombie ” banks .
Alternative solutions include purchase - and - assumption transactions , in which a part of a bank ’s good assets and matching liabilities are sold to another bank .
The good bank should continue operation and be re-privatized as soon as possible .
The bad bank should manage the bad assets taken from the old bank with a view to selling them in due course .
This will help recreate a market for such assets .
Third , the Swedish case shows that the bank resolution policy should have an open - ended financial commitment from the government to be credible and efficient .
At this stage of the global crisis , it is impossible to estimate exactly the cost of rescuing a financial system in any country .
However , the ad hoc measures that have been taken in many countries seem to be an open invitation for struggling banks and institutions to demand more funds .
Any attempt to fix a sum for the rescue effort undermines its credibility .
It should be made clear that the government is ready to mobilize the resources needed .
Fighting a financial crisis is like fighting a war .
Losing is simply unthinkable .
Finally , the process of bank resolution should be transparent , based on full disclosure of the steps taken and the valuations of assets made .
Openness fosters public trust in the bank resolution policy and in the financial system that will emerge after the crisis .
And trust is the basic building block of any banking system .
“ Saying that the situation is the same for all central and eastern European states , I do n’t see that …… you cannot compare the dire situation in Hungary with that of other countries . ”
Angela Merkel , Brussels , Sunday
“ Happy families are all alike ; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way ”
Tolstoy
In Europe , leaders rejected pleas for a comprehensive rescue plan for troubled East European economies , promising instead to provide â€œcase - by - caseâ€ support .
That means a slow dribble of funds , with no chance of reversing the downward spiral .
Paul Krugman
Bank regulators from Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Poland , Romania and Slovakia met today and issued a joint statement , ostensibly to reduce the some of the impact of what they term “ alarmist comments ” from the Austrian government about how the regional banking system is now in such a precarious state that it requires urgent action at EU level to prevent meltdown .
The Austrian government are , of course , concerned about the impact of any meltdown on their own banking system .
The result of this “ reassuring statement ” can be seen in the chart below ( 10 years , HUF vs Euro ) .
Within minutes of the joint statement Hungary ’s currency plummeted to an all - time low against the euro and to a 6.5 - yr low versus the US dollar .
In fact the HUF rapidly depreciated to 312 per euro from 307.50 before climbing back in later trading to 310 .
And the reason for this swift reaction ?
Hungary was not invited to join the statement .
As the forint plunged , Hungary ‘s banking regulator hurriedly signed up to the statement , blaming the original omission on a communications mess - up , but the damage was already done .
â€ œEach of the CEE Member States has its own specific economic and financial situation and these countries do not constitute a homogenous region .
It is thus important first to distinguish between the EU Member States and the non-EU countries and also to clarify issues specific to particular countries or particular banking groups . ”
Well this just takes us back to Tolstoy , each of them have their own specific problems , but the underlying reality is that they all face problems , and are vulnerable , each in their own way .
Hungary ’s economic fundamentals are clearly much weaker than those to be found in the Czech Republic and Poland as things stand , but what about Bulgaria and Romania ?
And the Czech Republic and Poland are about to have a pretty hard time of it as a result of their export dependence on the West , and Poland has the unwinding of the zloty options scandal still to hit the front pages .
So there is plenty of food for thought here before throwing Hungary to the wolves .
A default in Hungary could very easily lead to contagion elsewhere , and then the impact in the West is very hard to foresee .
We should not be playing round with lighted matches right next to our fireworks stock .
“ Hey , it ’s dark in here ” and then “ boom ” .
Yesterday it was Latvia ’s turn , and the cost of protecting against a Latvian default ( Latvia is the first European Union member priced at so- called distressed levels ) rose to a record following the announcement that the unemployement level rose from 8.3 % in December to 9.5 % in January , the highest level in nearly nine years .
In fact credit - default swaps linked to Latvia increased nine basis points to an all - time high of 1,109 basis points , according to CMA Datavision in London .
The cost is above the 1,000 level , breached last week , that investors consider distressed , and is now about 270 basis points above contracts linked to Lithuania , the next - highest EU member .
So two countries are being systematically detached here – Latvia and Hungary – and statements by EU leaders are unwittingly aiding and abetting the process .
But we should all remember , after they have eaten Latvia and Hungary for breakfast , the financial markets will undoubtedly chew on other luckless countries over lunch ( Romania ’s Q4 GDP data was out today , and it was a shocker , and S&P have already said they are “ closely monitoring ” the situation ) , before perhaps moving on to bigger game for supper .
And we should remember here , no one is too big to fall , and I have already been warning about the gravity of Germany ’s situation , with a rapidly ageing population , a hefty bank bailout of its own to swallow , and total export dependence for GDP growth .
Final data from Markit economics out today showed that Germany ’s composite PMI fell to 36.3 in February from 38.0 in January .
That was the lowest level registered since the series began in January 1998 .
And it means that the German economy – which is highly interlocked with the whole of Eastern Europe ( Austria holds the finance and Germany the industrial exposure ) – is certainly contracting more rapidly in the first quarter of this year than it was in the last quarter of 2008 , and may well contract in whole year 2009 by something in the order of 5 % .
Further evidence comes from the latest VDMA machine producers association report which shows that exports orders for German engineering companies were 47 per cent down on a year earlier in January .
Overall industrial machinery orders were 42 per cent lower than in January 2008 , with domestic orders down 31 per cent , while foreign orders fell 47 per cent .
This is more or less Japan territory in its scale .
So maybe someone over there in Germany should be reading the poem you will see below to “ our Angela ” right now , just so she does n’t miss the point ( Oh , and if you do n’t speak German , you can find a translation here ) .
Als die Nazis die Kommunisten holten ,

Als sie die Juden holten ,

I am not entirely sure about the implications for our lives in the immediate future , however .
( I am typing without spell - checker and am German , so bear with me in case of mistakes and typos , please ... )
I want to share an e-mail I received from a reader I know as Derek .
His Oil Drum name is " Ndege " ( Kiswahili for ...
Bird , Airplane , Helicopter , Airport , Butterfly , flying -- one word covers quite a lot of related concepts ) .
We had been corresponding about another matter , and I had sent him a link to this presentation I have given several times recently .
Based on some experience , I have a ' feeling ' that the doom we see coming will actually not result in real doom on the ground – after a period of severe adjusting , that is .
At least , it must n't really ' feel ' like doom .
Things could go ' bad ' - and we still ( many , many , many of us ) could have not such a bad life after - all - including an economy with things ( some ) and food ( less exotic ) .
There is this thought / observation / concept ( of mine ) , and it might interest you .
That 's why I feel it 's okay to take some of your time .
When I read the scenarios on The Oil Drum , I believe them .
They make sense .
Yet I feel there is something missing .
Or , rather , some factor factoring in too much : the way we measure events and changes that we see coming , and how we consider them to be ' bad ' or ' good ' .
We merely measure them ( as one always does , I guess ) against the known constants of our own lives , our own known parameters for survival and happiness .
But I have a feeling that by generalizing this , yes , by assuming that this is a necessary standard in the first place , we might be wrong .
And , therefore , many ( not all ) of our fears may actually be much less justified .
Not because that sort of envisioned change is n't coming - but because the change really wo n't ' feel ' as bad as we now believe that it must .
I may have that feeling , because I also know a different set - up , one where , for a very large part , the standard of what to expect is not based on an oil - fueled society with all its trimmings .
You see , during the past 28 years , I have spent a lot of time in Kenya , where our family has a home .
What I experience there is a society that does pretty well with VERY little energy , all things considering .
Mind you , not ' pretty well ' by any standard of the Western world .
But survival - and happiness !
- are pretty much possible .
Oddly , a first - time visitor would think , but , yes , even ( I would say , especially ) the Masai , who really live lives quite , well , horrible ( in the eyes of Westerners ) are very happy people ( and would n't want to change a thing , basically .
A solar cell to get some TV and the mobile charger , that 's all ) .
It 's the mindset that makes most Kenyans experience a happiness most Westerners would never consider to be possible given realities - as they see and experience them .
In Kenya , we do use electricity ( hydro / diesel ) , if we can .
We have constant power cuts .
But that 's not the only limit .
In fact , the vast majority of us , even the so - called middle - class , build our lives around limits .
Limits are the basis for every decision we make , business or otherwise .
It is , you could say , a way of life that is happy when it is not done in - not unhappy if things go wrong ( I am not sure that this makes sense ) .
People there - including me - celebrate every day that was a good day .
And a good day is one where we got by .
I would say , for 95 % of Kenyans , life there is very much focused on the hour - and hardly ever on the future .
We are used to being very mindful of how to not waste water .
Or anything , really !
Things get mended and re-used and re-used .
Still , even our - middle class - standard of living FEELS like it is much higher than even here in cozy Europe , where I spend about two - thirds of the year .
We - and our guests - do really feel much better ' down there ' - despite lacking certain consumer - and other creature comfort .
When we get a nice block of ( imported ) chocolate , it is something special ( as , I guess , it should be ) .
It tastes great .
It 's fun to share something like this with guests ( and , please , we have a big house - 500 sq. meters - so we are not ' poor ' nor are our guests .
We just do n't define happiness by the amount of shopping for consumer goods - and use of energy .
There is a big limit of both : things to buy ( shops are far away , Western - lifestyle - items are very expensive ) ; and energy .
When you go to the towns and villages , except for the ever - present mobile phones , everything else is pretty much powered by people doing their work by hand ( one way or another ) .
The approach employs a great number of people ( although , mainly ' outside the legal employment system ' ) .
Everyone I know ( or see ) is constantly busy doing something .
Not very efficient by ' our ' standards , everything takes a long time to get accomplished , but , well , people do stuff , which creates opportunities to survive .
The outcome is different in the respect that little energy is put into things that may be fun , but are not important in the end .
We go for income that generates food .
Not tons of toys or consumer - stuff .
Buildings are build by hand - even our house was .
Not with machines .
I guess there was only a special saw used once when certain stones had to be cut perfectly ( but we would have well survived without them stones cut like we wanted them to be cut ) .
Everything else was done by hand , using ZERO energy .
Our house was built according to local tradition ( for such Mzungu - white - houses ) .
We do n't need AC .
Not even with 32 Celsius .
Credit is not really something that propels that part of the Kenyan economy that the vast majority depends on for its survival .
It is people , social structures , give and take , barter on a certain level ( I assist you with providing you with a certain contact / job ; you return the favor - or else ... ) .
And it is - mostly - cash ... wads of cash .
All the time .
It is a society that is extremely people - orientated , extremely network - reliant .
And , when it comes to financial transactions , they are cash - based , even for big projects .
Builders for the houses are paid in cash in most cases .
When people buy cars , they pay in cash , mainly .
And cars are expensive - they cost at least US $ 20.000 - even for a Toyota Corolla ( that 's why I do n't have one ; I use a taxi or public transport if I have to get someplace - as do most Kenyans ) .
I am not saying there are n't any problems there .
In fact , there are many and they are huge .
But they are related to a very basic human - and modern - ( mis - ) behavior .
One : political leadership squandering resources , getting into debt for silly things ( things 99 % of Kenyans have no use for ) , constant in - fighting to sit at the source of power .
The other : people making too many babies , which is a tradition , because there is not much else to do in the villages ( I am serious ) and because , up until recently , many of them died within the first year or so .
( Some Kenyan cultures do n't give names to their babies within the first year still to this day . )
Except , since the onset of modernity ( farming / medicine ) many of these babies do make it , which , please do n't get me wrong , is fine with me - I love children , but which puts obvious strains on resources .
But , on the other hand , I have also been witness to a great many situations where people lost their children , cried for a week , and moved on , had new babies , were n't depressed - nor impressed ( strangely ; I am still not getting over this - but that 's the way it is ; again : different view on things in Kenya ) .
It is safe to say that Kenyans would use even less energy and yield much higher economic results where it matters for most of them if there were NO politicians , no political structures , at all ( and no credit facilities ) .
Most Kenyans get along not because of modern financial and social structures , but despite them .
In Kenya , most of what we assume to be a modern society actually is a hindrance ( because it is so corrupt and because it does n't fuse well the traditional culture , which is group - and NOT AT ALL individual based ) .
I am pretty sure you wo n't find a Kenyan believing otherwise .
I am writing this because I believe ( well , know , actually ) that what we consider to be a ' flourishing ' economy must n't be the standard to go by when judging whether we , as people , can live without fear of constant social meltdown - and without perceiving our lives to be happy ones .
I think the coming changes will hit different societies differently .
Maybe European and American people will have to let go of much more ( stuff ) than we in Kenya .
We really have very little to lose as it is .
There is very little credit - internally - to unwind , and people are n't too attached to it in the first place , knowing how difficult it is to hold on to stuff - or people , really .
I would n't be surprised if what you called the ' bad option ' for the future ( new currency etc. ) may actually , after only a surprising limited amount of time of re-adjusting , be the better option .
Because , it seems to me , things have to shrink a LOT .
And they will .
Because , at the end of the day , it is our lifestyle that is doing us in .
Our desires , not our needs .
Nor the amount of oil available or not ( which was just a propellant that was used to build a certain kind of society , which is by no means the only kind possible ) .
Maybe , one day , someone will come up with something that is available indefinitely to provide an indefinite lifestyle for an indefinite number of people ( I doubt it ) .
But as long as that is not the case ( or as soon as oil gets uneconomical ) , I guess different ways to survive and to make a living are going to take place - and are , as such - not at all bad , once we arrive at that point .
To go from here to there , the way it will happen , and the decrease in population so far sustained by a lot of cheap energy , that will be horrible .
The loss of lives , that is the price that will have to be paid .
Credit ?
Consumer goods ?
Nice to have , perhaps .
But not that important , really , to have a nice day .
I am pretty sure that this unwinding of the market - and of populations - will take place rather quickly .
And afterwards , maybe not on a personal level , but for societies , life can and will continue .
And it wo n't necessarily be a bad life .
It may be one that feels , at first , like waking up from a dream , where everyone went shopping for tons and tons of things with a credit card - and finding one - self in a reality where there is less stuff , less choice in supermarkets , less of everything , but where one still does all kinds of things ( including surviving ) , also ' modern ' things , using a lot less resources - and still having a laugh , friends , fun , joy .
I guess what I am trying to say is this : even if all you wrote comes true ( and , I am damn sure it will ; option ' B ' that is ) , life must n't necessarily be bad for those who can survive - which , I guess , will be all those countries with a food - surplus , or , roughly , enough food to hang on .
Kenya can be one of those places ( after a decrease of population , which , knowing Africa , would take place rather quickly ) .
Especially since we produce food with a lot less oil - input than the so - called First World .
In other words ... what we assume to be so bad ( change of economy and lifestyle ) will most likely prove to be quite okay once we get there - and live it .
Forgive my ramblings .
Thought I should share .
And thank you , thank you , thank you ... for all the mind - expanding input you and your fellow contibutors made available to me on The Oil Drum !
Cheers ,

JEDDAH ( Reuters ) - A 50 - year old Saudi man has agreed to divorce his 9 - year - old bride , media reported on Thursday , after the marriage drew international criticism .

The decision , reported by newspapers Alwatan and Al - Riyadh , came after months of court hearings , criticism from the United Nations and an international media frenzy about Saudi Arabia ’s human rights practices .
“ This is a good step and I think the man did it because he was in a lot of pressure from everyone , ” Wajeha Al - Huaider , founder of the Group for Women ’s Rights in Saudi Arabia , told Reuters by telephone .
Al - Huaider , who campaigned for the child , said she hoped the pressure generated by the case would eventually lead to a law banning child marriages .
The child ’s mother , who opposed the marriage which took place when the girl was 8 years old , took the case to court last year .
The court in the small town of Onaiza upheld the marriage on condition that the husband did not consummate it until the girl reached puberty .
In Saudi Arabia ’s patriarchal society , which applies an austere version of Sunni Islam , fathers have the right to decide whom their daughters marry .
“ Islam does not specify an age for the marriage contract .
The contract is one thing and the consummation of marriage is another , ” Ahmed Al Modi , an Islamic scholar and writer , told Reuters .
In the case of the Onaiza child bride he said the judge could not order a divorce because the marriage contract was carried out according to established rules for marriage , which include the approval of the father .
“ When the child is under age the father can approve the marriage contract but as soon as the child reaches puberty she can object to the marriage , ” Al Modi said , emphasising that it was merely a contract , signed to “ secure her future . ”
He explained that in such cases the child usually remained in her parents ’ custody and her husband would be able to visit her .
But he would not be permitted to live with her or consummate the marriage until she had reached puberty .
Discussion about a legal age for marriage in Saudi Arabia took off after a senior Saudi cleric , Sheikh Mohsen al - Obaikan , was quoted in a local newspaper recently saying that girls under 18 years of age should not be allowed to marry .
Many clerics in Saudi Arabia , including the Kingdom ’s chief cleric , Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul - Aziz Al al - Sheikh , endorse the practice of young girls marrying .
The Onaiza case attracted international criticism .
“ Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework , the marriage of a child is a violation of that child ’s rights , ” UNICEF ’s chief , Ann Veneman , said earlier this month .
Al Modi said Saudi Arabia was falling behind in the issue of child marriage .
“ Egypt assigned a legal age for marriage in 1975 , now we have started to awaken , ” he said , adding that Arab countries like Jordon Syria , Lebanon and Egypt had already assigned a legal age for marriage .
The Italian prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , today sparked controversy when he said the 17,000 people made homeless by Monday 's earthquake should think of themselves as being on a " camping weekend " .
Berlusconi made the remark during an interview with a German television channel as he visited one of the emergency camps set up to cater for people who have lost their homes in the disaster .
The quake , which devastated the city of L'Aquila and surrounding towns and villages , has now claimed 260 lives .
Berlusconi told the reporter for the N - TV channel that the homeless quake victims " lacked nothing " .
" They have medicaments .
They have hot food .
They have shelter for the night , " he said .
" Of course , their current lodgings are a bit temporary .
But they should see it like a weekend of camping . "
His remarks – which seem to have been intended to reassure the public – scarcely correspond to the experiences of the homeless .
Between Monday and Tuesday , they had to endure a night of driving rain and hail during which temperatures fell to 4C ( 39 F ) .
Yesterday , Berlusconi told a press conference in L'Aquila that 14,500 tents had been made ready and another 2,000 were available on standby .
However , tents were still lacking for 200 people by the time night fell .
Twenty " tent cities " have been set up to take the homeless , while other people driven out of their houses by the earthquake have been lodged in hotels and elsewhere .
Berlusconi's comments came as rescuers continued searching for survivors after a powerful aftershock brought two apartment blocks crashing down in L'Aquila today , causing panic among rescue workers and survivors .
The aftershocks caused chunks of masonry to fall from damaged buildings , including parts of the basilica in L'Aquila .
The tremor – measured by the US Geological Survey at magnitude 5.6 – was felt as far away as Rome .
A 76 - year - old Roman man was reported to have died of a heart attack following the tremor , according to Reuters .
Berlusconi said 260 people including 16 children , had died , while nine bodies remained to be identified .
He said about 100 of the injured were in serious condition .
The Ansa news agency reported today that four students trapped in the rubble of a dormitory of the University of L'Aquila had died .
The first funeral of a victim was due to take place in the town of Loreto Aprutino today , led by the archbishop of Pescara .
Pope Benedict XVI said he would visit the shocked and injured people of the area as soon as possible .
The pontiff praised the relief operations as an example of how solidarity could help overcome " even the most painful trials " .
The Vatican said he would visit the stricken area after Easter Sunday .
Berlusconi has said he will appeal for special European Union funding to deal with the consequences of the disaster , which came as his debt - laden government was struggling to respond to the global economic crisis .
He suggested that some of the cash earmarked for infrastructure projects designed to revive the economy could be spent in the L'Aquila area .
Series : How to Choose PC Parts – Part 2 – Motherboard
Are you lost when it comes to motherboards ?
Or do you think that you know everything about them ?
Not so quick !
Read on as I share insider knowledge with you !
Wait … What is a motherboard ?
Also known as the mainboard , system board or logic board and sometimes casually shortened to mobo , the motherboard is the central Printed Circuit Board ( PCB ) found on one of the inside side of the PC .
It ’s easy to recognize because nearly every hardware components plugs into it in some way .
How do I choose the right motherboard ?
Form factor :
The first thing you should figure out is the size factor of your motherboard that you want .
The two main standards are :
Micro ATX : 9.6 ″ x 7.6 ″
ATX : 12.0 ″ x 9.6 ″
This is mostly important when you will pick up your case .
Note that Micro ATX motherboards tend to cost less , but also offer less features , due to space limitations .
If you ’re looking to get Crossfire or SLI , ATX is the way to go .
Platform : AMD or Intel ?
Before you go any further , you should know whether you will use a cpu made by AMD or by Intel .
Why ?
Because they require different motherboards , meaning that an AMD cpu will only work with a motherboard designed for an AMD cpu and vice - versa .
Have no idea what cpu you want ?
Check out the first part of this series :
How to choose the cpu that offers the best bang for the buck .
Going with an AMD cpu ?
Read on .
Intel cpu ?
You may want to skip to the Intel part .
AMD platform :
Different sockets :
A cpu will be inserted into a socket .
Depending on the cpu that you chose , you will need either a socket :
AM2
AM2 +
AM3
This is clearly indicated when you buy the cpu .
For example , if you buy a Phenom II X3 720 , you see that it is based on the AM3 socket .
Simply verify this before buying the motherboard .
Backward compatibility :
However , some AM2 motherboards do support AM2 + cpus and most AM2 / AM2 + motherboards do support AM3 cpus .
You may need to update the BIOS in order to get backward compatibility or support for newer cpus .
Keyword here : SOME motherboards do support backward compatibility , not all of them .
Sometimes , it is also limited to only up to 95W cpus .
Reasons for no support may include but is not limited to : No BIOS update , motherboard not designed for new power requirements .
Etc. Usually , you will find a list of compatible cpus on the motherboard product page .
It ’s always good to contact the seller or the manufacturer when in doubt .
DDR2 vs DDR3 :
With the newest socket , AM3 , AMD introduced the DDR3 RAM standard to its platform .
Does it bring anything to the table vs DDR2 ?
Yes , higher frequency speed , but at the costs of higher latencies .
Meaning that the performance is the same for DD2 800 / DDR3 1066 and DDR2 1066 / DDR3 1333 .
If anything , my recommendation is to get a good well known AM2 + motherboard and to use it with a AM3 cpu .
If you ’ve read the AMD section , you may choose to skip to the Features section .
Intel platform :
Different sockets :
With Intel , it ’s simple right now .
If you want any Pentium , Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad cpu , you will be using the socket 775
If you want a Core i7 cpu , you will be using the socket 1366 .
DDR2 vs DDR3 :
With the newest socket , 1366 , Intel introduced the DDR3 RAM standard to its platform .
Does it bring anything to the table vs DDR2 ?
Yes , higher frequency speed , but at the costs of higher latencies .
Meaning that the performance is the same for DD2 800 / DDR3 1066 and DDR2 1066 / DDR3 1333 .
In this case , if you have a socket 775 platform , you ’ll be using DDR2 most probably .
Core i7 cpu? DDR3 for sure .
Alright , we ’re done with AMD and Intel , for now .
Let ’s move on to :
Features :
When choosing a motherboard , pay close attention to features that you want , as each motherboard model will offer different features .
The form factor , chipset and price of the motherboard will determine what features you ’ll get .
Here ’s a list of the most common ones :
Integrated peripherals
Memory controller : Getting phased out , as its integrated in all AMD cpus currently available , same goes for Intel ’s Core i7 .
The memory controller is only used on Socket 775 motherboards .
Disk Controller : for a floppy disk drive , up to 2 PATA drives , and up to 6 SATA drives ( may include some form of RAID support )
Integrated Sound Card : Most integrated sound card include 5.1 surround sound with respectable sound quality .
Will include some form of output / input on the rear panel .
Integrated Video Card :
Not designed for heavy 3D gaming , more for display or multimedia purposes .
WIll include a or some form of outputs on the rear panel .
Ethernet network controller :
Used to connect an ethernet cable to your PC , in order to access your network / Internet .
Maximum speed varies from 10 Mbps to 1000 Mbps .
USB ports :
Used to connect tons of devices .
Numbers included varies from 2 to 10 , with an additionnal one or two on - board USB , to connect to your case usb ports .
PS/2 : Used to connect mouse and keywords , slowly getting phased out .
Fan Headers :
Used to power up cpu/case fans , to cool down the system .
E - Sata :
Used to connect external storage device , usually hard drives .
Firewire : Used to connect external storage device , usually hard drives .
And many others …
Peripheral card slots
A standard ATX motherboard will typically have 1x PCI - E 16 x connection for a graphics card , 2x PCI slots for various expansion cards and 1x PCI -E 1 x which will eventually supersede PCI .
This varies depending on the brand and model .
SLI / Crossfire
Nvidia SLI and ATI Crossfire technology allows two or more of the same series graphics cards to be linked together to allow faster graphics - processing capabilities .
Obviously , you will require a compatible motherboard with at least two 16x PCI - Express slots , unless you get an X2 card .
Crossfire is available with AMD chipsets and opened in 2006 to also be available on Intel ’s chipsets .
As for SLI , it requires a motherboard with Nvidia ’s own NForce chipset series , with the exception of Intel ’s X58 .
Solid capacitors vs Electrolytic capacitor
In the last few years , many people reported problems with Electrolytic capacitors leaked , breaking down early or simply exploding .
This is caused by cheaply made electrolytic capacitors made by “ no - name ” companies in China .
While this has been corrected and is now rarely a problem , some people swear by solid capacitors that are in no way affected by the same problem .
Personnally , I think that for most systems , good quality electrolytic capacitors will do , but solid capacitors are desirable for high - end systems , especially with quad - core cpus .
How to choose the right chipset
Simply choose the one that offers the features that you want .
However , you may want to keep in mind any future upgrades that you may want to perform , for example if you want to combine two Geforce card in SLI in the future , I ’d suggest getting a motherboard that does support that feature .
Some recommendations of mine
Here are some of the best motherboards you will find , for different type of setups , starting with the AMD platform , then the Intel one .
According to me that is 😉 Enjoy !

Evidence continues to mount that Apple will deliver a touchscreen tablet next year , with an analyst laying out solid reasoning for this rumored device to become a reality .
It appears more likely to be an oversized iPod Touch , not a tabletized MacBook .
" Between indications from our component contacts in Asia , recent patents relating to multi - touch sensitivity for more complex computing devices , comments from [ chief operating officer ]
Tim Cook on the April 22 conference call , and Apple 's acquisition of PA Semi along with other recent chip - related hires , it is increasingly clear that Apple is investing more in its mobile - computing franchise , " Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a research statement issued to clients .
Apple 's next step in mobile computing will likely be the release of a touchscreen tablet featuring a 7 - to - 10 - inch display sometime in the first half of 2010 , Munster predicts .
Apple enthusiasts have been gossiping about a Mac tablet since July 2008 , when the first rumor about the fabled device surfaced at MacDailyNews .
Since then , a stream of clues , rumors and statements from Apple suggest this product will indeed join the Apple product family soon , as Gadget Lab has been reporting for several months .
Apple itself has steadfastly refused to confirm or deny any hint of an Apple tablet .
While in theory Apple could simply make a larger - screen iPod Touch , Munster believes creating a tablet will be more complex .
He speculates the operating system will be a hybrid between the iPhone 's mobile operating system and Mac OS X .
Or , Apple could optimize a version of Mac OS X for the multitouch interface .
Price range ?
Munster is guessing between $ 500 and $ 700 , positioning this device as Apple 's response to netbooks .
At its recent quarterly earnings call , Apple chief operating officer Tim Cook said the company had no plans to release a netbook , calling the device category " junky . "
" For us , it ’s about doing great products , " Cook said .
" And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today , I see cramped keyboards , terrible software , junky hardware , very small screens and just not a consumer experience … that we would put the Mac brand on , quite frankly . "
Other indications that it's an upsized - iPod - Touch–style tablet in the works ( rather than a " junky " netbook ) involve Apple 's recent hiring of several chip designers , as well as its acquisition of PA Semi to develop mobile processors .
Would a touchscreen tablet be worth putting the Mac brand on ?
We think so .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Senate Democrats will pull money to close the Guantanamo Bay military prison from a war funding bill instead of face an onslaught of criticism from Republicans , CNN has learned .
Sources say Senate Democrats will not approve of the administration 's request to close down Gitmo .
Democratic leaders made the decision Tuesday morning , according to two Senate Democratic leadership sources .
It is a blow to President Obama who announced , as one of his first official duties as president , that he would close the base by next January 22 .
Republicans have argued it would be reckless to shutter the prison before the Obama administration has decided where to transfer the terrorism suspects who are detained there .
The Senate war supplemental bill , which is scheduled to be voted on this week , included $ 80 million for the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice to begin the process of shutting down the prison .
Now , that money will be stripped out and replaced with language saying no funds can be used to transfer detainees from Guantanamo , a military installation in Cuba , to the United States and no additional money will be approved until 60 days after the president submits to Congress his plan to close the facility .
That language is similar to a provision in the House bill .
Fact Box
These states have introduced legislation this year calling for a ban on Guantanamo Bay detainees on their soil :
Alabama
California
Indiana
Kansas
Louisiana
Missouri
New Mexico
Oklahoma
Pennsylvania
South Carolina
Tennessee
Texas
( Information courtesy of the National Conference of State Legislatures )
Republicans launched a high - profile campaign against closing the base prematurely , just this morning releasing a statement headlined : " Meet your new neighbor , Khalid Sheikh Mohammad ? "
" Republicans see this as a wedge issue against Democrats and we 're not going to let them do it , " explained one of the sources .
Privately , some Democrats have complained the president put them in an awkward position of having to defend funding the closure before a plan was developed , one of the sources said .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday that there is " nothing to indicate " the deadline to close Guantanamo by January 2010 is " at all in jeopardy . "
" As far as I can tell , everything remains on track for action to be taken with regard to the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility ... according to the timeline prescribed by the president in the executive order , " Morrell said .
He added that the Department of Defense officials who are " most intimately involved " with the effort to shut down the facility , including the Pentagon 's general counsel and deputy secretary , are in " near constant meetings with their counterparts at Justice , at State , in the White House on these very , very complicated matters . "
Senate Democrats follow in the steps of House Democrats , who have demanded that Obama submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the facility .
Last week , House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey , D - Wisconsin , added that requirement to the $ 96.7 billion war funding bill for Iraq and Afghanistan .
It directs the administration to provide details to Congress on where Guantanamo prisoners would be transferred , the cost of shutting down the facility and the cost of securing prisoners at other detention centers .
The report is due by October 1 .
The move came as House Republicans introduced a bill called the " Keep Terrorists Out of America Act . "
It would bar the administration from moving any detainee to the U.S. without first getting approval from the governor and state legislature of any state selected to receive detainees .
Rep. Peter King , the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee , said , " The president made a decision to close Gitmo to fulfill a campaign promise , perhaps to satisfy world opinion , without ( in ) any way thinking through the consequences of his action or what was going to happen next , where these detainees were going to go . "
Where to send the prisoners has been a hot - button issue on both sides of the aisle -- especially among Republicans who have continued to beat the " Not in my backyard " drum .
Several Republicans members of Congress want the administration to halt plans to move " violent terrorists " from Guantanamo .
" This presents a clear and present danger to American lives , " said Rep. Lamar Smith , R - Texas .
" All the administration has to do is reconsider .
They do n't have to keep this misguided campaign promise . "
'' The world suddenly did not become safer on January 20 , 2009 , '' House Minority Leader John Boehner has said .
" Our constituents do n't want these terrorists in their neighborhoods . ''
Kansas , for one , is home to both a federal penitentiary and a maximum security military prison at Fort Leavenworth .
The state 's top senator is wholeheartedly against moving detainees there .
" Please not at Leavenworth , " Brownback recently said .
" This is a hot topic in my state . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a floor speech Monday that the American people " want to keep the terrorists at Guantanamo out of their neighborhoods and off of the battlefield . "
It 's a sentiment his Democratic colleague seems to agree with .
" I think that the people who have been held in Guantanamo are being charged essentially for acts of international terror , for acts of war , and they do n't belong in the judicial system , and they do n't belong in our jails , " Sen .
Jim Webb , D - Virginia , said on ABC's This Week Sunday .
Last Thursday , Attorney General Eric Holder , faced with bipartisan resistance , promised a Senate committee he would not release suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo into the United States .
He was less clear about what would be done with any detainees the administration decides are not terrorists .
" We would not bring them into this country and release them , anyone , we would consider to be a terrorist , " Holder told the panel .
He said the safety of the American public will be his " paramount concern . "
Holder emphasized he has made no decisions about whether or when any of the 241 remaining detainees may be moved .
But a day after House Democrats rejected the president 's funding request to close down the prison , a senior Senate Democrat seemed to suggest he would support the plan .
" The president has already said he 's going to close it down , " said Sen .
Tom Harkin of Iowa , a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee , " and we ought to put the money there to continue on the pathway and get it done before the year is out . "
CNN 's Terry Frieden and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

Why would Ed Schultz invite Tom Tancredo onto his show -- a known anti-immigration wingnut , and a guy who does n't hold any position of authority right now -- to comment on Judge Sotomayor ?
Of course Tancredo is going to say something ridiculous , like :
I ’m telling you she appears to be a racist .
She said things that are racist in any other context .
That ’s exactly how we would portray it and there ’s no one who would get on the Supreme Court saying a thing like that except for a Hispanic woman and you ’re going to say it does n’t matter !
Ah -ha !
I get it .
I know why .
Ed Schultz , I 'm sorry I doubted you .
Invite a Republican onto television who will blurt out the race - baiting and Southern Strategy nonsense that fuels the party , thus exposing its ugliness to the viewing public .
Excellent .
Adding ... Sullivan :
Putting Tom Tancredo front and center against Sotomayor must be the Obama administration 's dream come true .
And Amato :
His form of racism is an affront to all decency .
As I 've said before , I do not speak Italian because of the racism my grandparents endured when they came to America .
He 's Italian and he should be ashamed of himself .
As a fellow Italian , I hate to say it but Italians are often really , really racist .
Do you have any big goals that you ’re struggling to make a start on ?
Or goals which you ’ve had a go at several times – but where you keep failing ?
Perhaps you think there are some areas of life where you ca n’t succeed : you might be great at hitting targets at work , but you just ca n’t ever stick to an exercise routine for more than a week .
Or maybe you ’re on track to start your own business this year , but all your attempts to tackle your long - standing weight problem have failed .
The problem might be that you ’re trying to change too much , too fast .
It might seem odd to ask you on The Change Blog to cut back on how change you ’re trying to work into your life … but I want to focus on getting you to think about making lasting changes that stick , rather than trying to completely change your habits overnight .
Think again about those goals you think you ’ll never meet .
Perhaps some of them are failed New Years ’ resolutions –like exercising more , eating healthily , losing weight , quitting smoking .
If you ’re like most people , you probably tried to make sweeping changes overnight , and it did n’t work .
Where Do You Want To Get To ?
Perhaps you ’ve got a challenging target in mind .
You might want to :
Lose 50 lbs
Cut out caffeine
Slash your sugar intake
Meditate daily
Go for a five mile run every morning
Get up at five am
Quit your day job
Save up $ 500 / month
These are all great targets – but they ’re also enormous steps to take overnight .
Instead of trying to take an unmanageable leap straight away , look for ways you can reach those targets by making manageable , incremental changes .
Where Are You At Now ?
Spend a week tracking the area which you ’re trying to improve : you need to find out what level you ’re at before you know the first steps you need to take in order to improve .
You can track your spending , your exercise , your food intake , your usual waking - up time , your daily cups of coffee …
Sometimes , taking a good honest look at where you ’re currently at can be discouraging at first : there might be a big gulf between where you are and where you want to be .
You might even feel that you do n’t have the strength , courage or self - discipline to get to your goal .
Perhaps that is the case at the moment – but all you need is the ability to take the next step .
You ’ll gain the mental strength you need along the way .
Taking Small Steps
Work out incremental steps which you can take to reach your goal , based on where you are now .
For example , if you want to lose 50 lbs , break this down into a target of 1lb per week .
Yes , it ’ll take you a year to get to your goal , but that time will pass anyway .
Do n’t underestimate how much you can achieve by taking small steps .
You waste a lot more time by throwing yourself at an unrealistic target , getting rapidly overwhelmed and giving up after the first week .
It ’s also really disheartening to approach your goals in this way : you ’ll start telling yourself that you ’ll never succeed or that you lack self - discipline .
So What Does This Mean For You ?
All of the above is quite theoretical – and you might be struggling to apply it to your own life and goals .
So here are some practical examples of how taking small steps really can help you to reach big goals .
Goal : Cutting out caffeine
Cutting out caffeine Current state : Drinking eight cups of coffee a day
Drinking eight cups of coffee a day Target : Reduce your intake by one cup per day , per week ( so seven cups / day for the first week , six cups / day for the second week , and so on . )
Reduce your intake by one cup per day , per week ( so seven cups / day for the first week , six cups / day for the second week , and so on . )
Time taken to reach goal : eight weeks .

Goal : Going for a five mile jog every day
Going for a five mile jog every day Current state : Coach potato
Coach potato Target : Start with a one mile brisk walk each day for the first week .
Build up to two miles in the second week , and so on .
Then alternate walking and jogging a mile in the sixth week ( walk three , jog two ) , then jog three and walk two miles in the seventh week , and go for jogging the full five miles in the eighth week .
Start with a one mile brisk walk each day for the first week .
Build up to two miles in the second week , and so on .
Then alternate walking and jogging a mile in the sixth week ( walk three , jog two ) , then jog three and walk two miles in the seventh week , and go for jogging the full five miles in the eighth week .

Waking up at eight am Target :
Set your alarm fifteen minutes earlier each week – do n’t go for the full two hours straight away !
Set your alarm fifteen minutes earlier each week – do n’t go for the full two hours straight away !
Time taken to reach goal : eight weeks

Goal : Writing a 200 page ebook to sell on your website
Writing a 200 page ebook to sell on your website Current state : 0 pages
0 pages Target : Aim for 25 pages a week ; that ’s 3 pages a day on weekdays , 5 a day at weekends .
Aim for 25 pages a week ; that ’s 3 pages a day on weekdays , 5 a day at weekends .
Time taken to reach goal : eight weeks
As you can see – a lot of big goals are perfectly achievable in under two months , so long as you do n’t demand instant success from yourself .
You can achieve those hard goals which you ’ve failed at in the past : just take small , incremental steps .
What are your challenging goals – big or small – that you ’ve failed to reach in the past ?
Where are you currently , and what steps can you take , week by week , to reach your eventual targets ?

At least four people were killed and 15 injured when a parked car exploded outside a restaurant in the Alawi neighborhood in central Baghdad , police said .
A bomb in a parked car exploded as a convoy that included an Interior Ministry official passed .
While the official was n't injured , a guard and a bystander were killed and four others were wounded , the ministry said .
Two bombings were reported in Baghdad 's Um al - Malif area , the Times reported .
Preliminary reports indicate at least people 12 died and more than 25 were wounded in the two blasts .
In Husainiya , a city northeast of Baghdad , another car bomb killed four and wounded 20 .
Monday 's bombings occurred three days before the April 9 anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime six years ago .
The anniversary evokes divergent emotions among Iraqis , the Times reported .
WASHINGTON - Polio has spread out of Nigeria to reinfect neighboring countries that had eliminated the disease , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported yesterday .
The new Nigerian outbreaks set back a bid to wipe out the water - borne disease globally , the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease .
Polio attacks the nervous system and can cause paralysis , breathing problems , and sometimes death .
" Despite accelerated efforts , polio cases increased 26 percent , from 1,315 cases in 2007 to 1,655 in 2008 .
This increase primarily resulted from an increase in Nigeria from 285 cases in 2007 to 801 cases in 2008 , " the CDC report said .
" During the second half of 2008 , ( polio ) originating from northern Nigeria spread to eight neighboring African countries , including six that had been polio - free since having cases during 2003 - 2005 . "
The World Health Organization and several private groups , including Rotary International and the non-profit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , have been working to eradicate polio through a global vaccination effort .
It has been successful except in a few areas , mostly those experiencing conflicts , that have provided a hiding place and breeding ground for the virus .
Wild polio - as opposed to a rare infection caused by one of the vaccines - has been wiped out everywhere but in four countries : Afghanistan , India , Nigeria , and Pakistan .
Nigeria reported 801 polio cases in 2008 , but the virus has also spread into Angola , Chad , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Niger , and southern Sudan , the CDC said .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A Russian karate expert has been charged with beating to death a 61 - year - old woman and her son , whom he accused of infecting his wife with lice , an investigator said Friday .
The drunk 26 - year - old burst into a neighboring room in his hostel Tuesday and used karate moves to kill the pair , state investigator Eduard Abdullin said by telephone from Kazan , a city 700 km ( 430 miles ) east of Moscow .
“ He literally beat them to death with his hands and feet , ” Abdullin said .
“ The family were poor and drank a lot .
He blamed them for infecting his wife and the entire corridor with lice . ”
The 58 - year - old husband of the dead woman was also badly beaten , but survived .
The suspect , who studied karate for seven years , faces life in prison if convicted , Abdullin added .
Goma , Democratic Republic of Congo 28 Feb 2009 - The International Rescue Committee says civilians in eastern Congo's North Kivu province continue to endure chaos , displacement and suffering - with tens of thousands of uprooted people in dire need of food , shelter , water and sanitation .
At least one million people have been forced from their homes in North Kivu as a result of spiraling violence that put this war - weary region on the map once again in late 2008 .
A joint Rwandan - Congolese military operation continues in the region , aimed at routing enemy militias .
The increased troop presence is yet another source of instability , fear and uncertainty for civilians .
" We constantly monitor the movement of fleeing civilians in North Kivu , in order to respond to their unfolding needs , " says Bob Kitchen , the International Rescue Committee 's country director in Congo .
" While we are seeing tentative returns in some areas , we are also seeing new displacement due to ongoing rape , killings and looting . "
An IRC team in Rutshuru territory , the heart of this regional conflict , recently assessed needs in villages where homes and schools have been pillaged .
As is the case throughout North Kivu , different armed groups have controlled the area at various points in the past four months .
Sporadic eruptions of violence have spurred waves of displacement .
In the towns of Ishasha and Nyakakoma , the IRC recently registered and assisted more than 14,000 refugees who had returned from Uganda .
Many found their homes looted and empty .
The IRC provided each family with a kit containing a tarp , clothing , and pots and pans to help them re-establish basic shelters and meet family needs .
Kitchen says congestion is a serious problem at camps set up for the displaced people and in the homes where their relatives are hosting them .
" One household assisted by the IRC had 11 people living in a three - meter - square room , " he said .
He also noted that discussions with displaced villagers indicated high numbers of at - risk widows and orphans .
In addition to helping vulnerable people with essential supplies , the IRC 's emergency response team helps rebuild schools to accommodate large numbers of displaced students , and builds latrines , showers , and water sources in camps and overcrowded communities .
IRC first stepped up its emergency response in North Kivu in 2007 .
A sharp increase in violence in late 2008 captured the attention of the international community , but there has been no significant change in security for the region 's beleaguered population since then .

You can help today by contributing directly to our humanitarian programs for innocent civilians - including thousands of children - whose lives have been shattered by the violence .

Since the end of February when the S&P 500 closed at 735.09 , the index has been pushing strongly ahead , closing on Friday , May 8 , at 929.23 — an increase of 26.4 % .
We suggest that the key driving force behind this strong bounce is a massive increase in liquidity .
What is it all about , and how do changes in liquidity drive the stock market ?
In a market economy , a major service that money provides is that of the medium of exchange .
Producers exchange their goods for money and then exchange money for other goods .
The increase of production of goods and services results in a greater demand for the services of the medium of exchange ( the service that money provides ) .
Conversely , as economic activity slows down , the demand for the services of money follows suit .
The demand for the services of the medium of exchange is also affected by changes in prices .
An increase in the prices of goods and services leads to an increase in the demand for the medium of exchange .
People now demand more money to facilitate more expensive goods and services .
A fall in the prices of goods and services results in a decline in the demand for the medium of exchange .
Now , take the example where an increase in the supply of money for a given state of economic activity has taken place .
Since there was n't any change in the demand for the services of the medium of exchange , this means that people now have a surplus of money or an increase in monetary liquidity .
Obviously , no individual wants to hold more money than is required .
An individual can get rid of surplus cash by exchanging the money for goods .
All the individuals as a group , however , cannot get rid of the surplus of money just like that .
They can only shift money from one individual to another individual .
The mechanism that generates the elimination of the surplus of cash is the increase in the prices of goods .
Once individuals start to employ the surplus cash in acquiring goods , this pushes prices higher .
As a result , the demand for the services of money increases .
All this in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary surplus .
Once money enters a particular market , more money is now paid for a product in that market .
Or we can say that the price of a good in this market has now gone up .
( Remember a price is the number of dollars per unit of something . )
Note that what has triggered increases in the prices of goods in various markets is the increase in the monetary surplus or monetary liquidity in response to the increase in the money supply .
While increases in the money supply result in a monetary surplus , a fall in the money supply for a given level of economic activity leads to a monetary deficit .
Individuals still demand the same amount of the services of the medium of exchange .
To accommodate this , they will start selling goods , thus pushing their prices down .
At the lower prices the demand for the services of the medium of exchange declines and this in turn works toward the elimination of the monetary deficit .
A change in liquidity or the monetary surplus can also take place in response to changes in economic activity and changes in prices .
For instance , an increase in liquidity can emerge for a given stock of money and a decline in economic activity .
A fall in economic activity means that fewer goods are now produced .
This means that fewer goods are going to be exchanged , implying a decline in the demand for the services of money — the services of the medium of exchange .
Once , however , a surplus of money emerges , it produces exactly the same outcome with respect to the prices of goods and services as the increase in money supply does , i.e. , it pushes prices higher .
An increase in prices in turn works towards the elimination of the surplus of money — the elimination of monetary liquidity .
Conversely an increase in economic activity while the stock of money stays unchanged produces a monetary deficit .
This in turn sets in motion the selling of goods thereby depressing their prices .
The fall in prices in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary deficit .
There is a time lag between changes in liquidity , i.e. , a monetary surplus and changes in asset prices , such as the prices of stocks .
For instance , there could be a long time lag between the peak in liquidity and the peak in the stock market .
The effect of previously rising liquidity could continue to dominate the effect of currently falling liquidity for some period of time .
Hence the peak in the stock market emerges once the declining liquidity is starting to dominate the scene .
( The reason for the lag is because when money is injected it does n't affect all the individuals and hence all the markets instantly .
There are earlier and later recipients of money . )
Exploring how changes in liquidity had historically been driving the stock market .
For instance , the yearly rate of growth of our monetary measure AMS stood at 4.1 % in March 1974 and 4.5 % in May the following year .
Despite the relative stable money - supply rate of growth , the yearly rate of growth of monetary surplus had a large increase from negative 7.7 % in March 1974 to a positive figure of 7.6 % in May 1975 .
( Note that the yearly rate of growth of the consumer price index ( CPI ) eased from 10.1 % in March 1974 to 9.3 % in May 1975 .
The yearly rate of growth of industrial production fell from 1.7 % in March 1974 to negative 12.4 % in May 1975 . )
In response to the increase in the monetary surplus , the S&P 500 shot up from 68.6 in December 1974 to 95.2 by June 1975 — an increase of 38.8 % .
Now , the yearly rate of growth of liquidity topped in November 1927 at 10.2 % .
After a time lag of 22 months , the S&P 500 responded by peaking in August 1929 at 31.71 .
In 1987 the time lag between a peak in liquidity and a peak in the stock market was much shorter .
The yearly rate of growth of liquidity topped in January 1987 at 15.1 % .
The S&P responded to this by peaking eight months later at 329.9 in September of that year .
According to the historical data , the yearly rate of growth of liquidity bottomed at negative 16.6 % in May 1929 .
Yet it took a long time before the S&P 500 responded to this .
It took over three years after the bottom in liquidity was reached before the S&P started to recover .
The stock - price index bottomed in June 1932 at 4.43 .
The time lag between the bottom in liquidity and the bottom in the stock market has been shorter in more recent history .
Thus the yearly rate of growth of liquidity had bottomed at negative 5.7 % in September 2000 .
It took twenty - five months before the S&P 500 bottomed at 815.28 by September 2002 .
What is the current state of US liquidity , and where is the S&P 500 heading ?
The current bear market that started in October 2007 was preceded by a peak in the liquidity rate of growth in June 2003 — a time lag of over four years .
The yearly rate of growth of liquidity stood at 7 % in June 2003 .
The S&P 500 climbed to 1,549.38 by the end of October 2007 .
Observe that at the end of February 2009 , the S&P 500 closed at 735.1 — a fall of 52.6 % from the peak in October 2007 .
The yearly rate of growth of monetary liquidity hit bottom in January 2008 at negative 6.1 % .
By the end of April , the yearly rate of growth of liquidity stood at positive figure of 24.9 % .
On the face of this , and on account of aggressive monetary pumping by the Fed , one is tempted to argue that the time lag from the bottom of liquidity to the bottom of the stock market may have significantly shortened and is about one year .
In short , the stock market is already in the bull phase .
We suggest that a shaky state of the pool of real savings might pose a threat to the stock market notwithstanding the massive monetary pumping by the Fed .
Here is why .
We have seen that in some cases , such as the Great Depression of the 1930s , the time lag between the bottom in the growth momentum of liquidity and the beginning of a new bull market can be extremely long .
An important factor that prolongs the lag is that an increase in liquidity on account of a collapse in the economy is not a great incentive to put money into stocks .
Despite massive increases in liquidity , as we had during the 1930s , the risk - adjusted return for being in stocks was n't that attractive relative to some other asset classes , such as treasuries or just keeping money in cash or in short - term money - market instruments .
An increase in liquidity rather than entering the stock market in this case supports other markets .
Note that by June 1931 the S&P 500 stood at 14.8 , against 21.45 in December 1929 — a fall of 31 % .
This fall took place despite an increase in the rate of growth of liquidity from 4.7 % in December 1929 to 21 % by June 1931 .
In contrast , the increase in liquidity was supporting Treasuries .
The yield on the 10 - year Treasury bond was in a gentle downtrend .
The yield eased from 3.4 % in December 1929 to around 3 % by June 1931 .
We suggest that , at present , if the pool of real savings is still in trouble , then we are unlikely to have a sustained economic revival .
If anything , all the rescue packages and all the massive pumping by the Fed has made things much worse as far as the underlying economic bottom line is concerned .
This in turn means that , despite lofty liquidity , bad economic fundamentals might force investors to direct their money towards other assets , such as Treasuries — and gold .
If our assessment regarding economic fundamentals is correct , then the underlying downtrend in long - term Treasuries is likely to stay in force while the price of gold is likely to easily surpass the $ 1,000 mark .
Conclusion
Video : No more Morias .
No more lies .
The angry crowd had one thing on its mind .
" Jihad , Jihad , Jihad , " was the chant , before they listed their enemies : " Luis Moreno - Ocampo " and " America . "
Speaker after speaker shouted their defiance Wednesday before a fist - waving audience of about 2,000 people in the center of El Fasher , the dusty capital of North Darfur .
The city is a hub for international aid being distributed in the region .
The crowd assembled about an hour after the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in The Hague had announced that it was issuing its first - ever warrant for the arrest of a sitting president : Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir .
They arrived on foot – chanting and waving placards that read " Down with Ocampo " and " Stop the Conspiracy " – or in government buses .
Mr. Ocampo is the chief prosecutor at the ICC .
They heard from a succession of government officials and community leaders , who all voiced their anger .
" We are ready to set up camps to train our youths to defend our country against America and the enemies of Islam , " Dirdiri Mohamed Ahmed , head of El Fasher 's police .
" We are with you President Bashir and are ready to die for you . "
A sea of raised fists greeted every word .
There were similar scenes in Khartoum , where banner - waving crowds massed on the banks of the Nile , chanting , " We love you President Bashir , " and trampling on portraits of Ocampo .
The public outcry was not unexpected .
Embassies had warned foreign nationals to stock up on water and essentials and stay home Wednesday .
Charity offices closed for the day and the United Nations sent nonessential staff home .
Certainly , there is genuine popular outrage over the arrest warrant , but the government - led protests organized around the country seemed a little lackluster , a little routine .
They will allow the Bashir government to cite " public anger " with the ICC , while fighting the charges and keeping its options open too .
Most people here are waiting to see what comes next .
Diplomats in Khartoum say the regime 's real reaction will take weeks to emerge .
Much will depend on how the world now treats a president accused of war crimes , they say .
Darfur aid workers worry
But international aid agencies here fear a backlash that could further disrupt the world 's largest humanitarian operations .
They are some of the most visible representatives of the international community and have long had a fraught relationship with the government .
Six – including Care International , CHF International , and the British charity Oxfam – have already seen their operations pared back .
On Sunday , they were told to pull international staff out of 10 camps and towns in the region .
In El Fasher , NGO officials spent Wednesday morning in discussions with the wali ( governor ) , trying to ensure that their activities would not be further disrupted .
" No one knows what will happen , " said Thierry Durand , director of operations for MSF - France , reached by telephone in Khartoum .
" Since the request by Ocampo to the judges last year , things have been very difficult in terms of the administrative burden and red tape .
We are caught in this arm wrestling between Sudan and the ICC . "
A show of military might
Earlier in the day , the government gave a more palpable and unmistakable statement about the ICC rulng – and any suggestion that instability might follow .
Sudan 's military machine put on a show of force in and above the streets of El Fasher .
It began with a steady rumbling .
As it drew nearer the ground began to shake .
Armored personnel carriers led the column .
Then came the " technicals , " pick - ups converted into battlewagons armed with heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns .
Soldiers lounged against the high - caliber barrels .
And behind them were the trucks crammed with infantry , some wearing balaclavas , others with scarves wrapped around their faces – all shouting , " Allahu Akhbar " ( " God is Great " ) .
" This is to show that the government is still in control of the town and if any of the rebel movements think they can try something then they should think again , " said Elesail Abdul Munim , as more than 150 military trucks rumbled past a growing crowd in the town 's market .
Just as the vehicles disappeared in a cloud of dust , the screech of two Air Force jets split the air .
Two Chinese - built Sukhoi ground - attack planes passed low and fast overhead to the cheers of a gathering crowd .
The message to the people of Darfur was clear .
While the ICC issued warrants for the arrest of Bashir , there should be no doubt about who was in control .
LES ULIS , France — Yasmina was 12 years old when an aunt and uncle brought her to France from Mali to be a live - in nanny to their children .
Once she was settled in a suburb near Paris , her new life consisted of 16 hours of household chores and regular beatings with electric cables .
The first time she ran away , the couple found her , brought her home , stripped her nude , tied her hands behind her back and beat her bloody .
“ My aunt put pepper on my wounds and also rubbed it in into my vagina , ” according to Yasmina ’s testimony , documented by the Paris - based Committee Against Modern Slavery , a 15 - year - old organization that to date has helped more than 500 victims reclaim their lives and identities once they have escaped from their captors .
In one horrifying example after another , summaries of domestic slavery cases like Yasmina ’s , with quotations from the victims , were displayed on square poster boards alongside a stark image of the building where the abuse allegedly occurred .
Part of a public awareness campaign , the exhibit currently located at a community center in Les Ulis , a southwestern suburb located about 14 miles from Paris , coincided with activities leading up to the commemoration of the 1848 abolition of slavery in France .
Since 2006 , May 10 has been observed as a national day of remembrance .
Although slavery is illegal in most of the world , an estimated 27 million people live in bondage , according to Free the Slaves , a Washington D.C. - based non-profit group working to eradicate the phenomenon globally .
That the public was even reading about Yasmina and the other cases meant that the women had escaped and had sought help , said Sophia Lakhdar , director of the committee which helps victims deal with the legal administrative , medical and emotional aspects of their lives after captivity .
Although the cases shown were long resolved — and in some cases , the abusers punished — the victims ' last names were withheld to protect their identities .
“ Next door to you , there may be people being exploited ” is the point of the campaign , said Lakhdar , 34 , who has a legal background and has been working with the anti-slavery organization for more than a year .
In France , 334 cases were brought to the committee ’s attention in 2007 and of those the group opened 25 new cases .
In 2008 , out of 191 alerts , including that of 31 men , the committee opened 33 new cases .
So far this year the organization has been notified 79 times about possible slavery cases .
Alerts can come anonymously from neighbors , from other associations or social workers .
Five criteria help initially determine whether a case of human bondage exists .
In addition to being forced to work for little or no pay , victims often live under the tyranny of an employer who maintains a chokehold on the person ’s life .
In almost all the cases , the victims ’ passports and identity papers have been confiscated , making it difficult for them to leave , and contact with family or anyone outside the home has been cut off , leaving the employer as the only conduit to the outside world .
Lakhdar said she is asked often , by police for instance , why a person does n’t leave the home when presented with the chance , while the family is on vacation or while out running an errand like picking up a child from school .
“ The barriers can be mental , ” she said .
Victims are often told they ’ll be arrested for being in the country illegally if caught by police .
Most often , the abused know their abusers and likely come from the same social circle , village or even family .
In cases involving high - ranking officials , the enslavement might occur with impunity because of diplomatic immunity .
Often wives , who are more apt to deal with household matters , are complicit in the abuse against other women , Lakhdar said .
In France , Lakhdar said about 10 to 20 percent of the cases she sees also involve sexual abuse and rape .
Physical abuse can include smashing teeth , torturing with pepper , hitting with high heels on the arms and burning with cigarettes .
Mental abuse can range from depriving a person of food , or only allowing her to eat only scraps ; forcing her to sleep on the ground , while the rest of the household sleeps in beds , or allowing her to bathe only once or twice per week .
“ I never imagined there were such cases in France , ” said Gillaume Herbaut , a French photojournalist whose work documenting the victims as a newspaper assignment turned into an ongoing project with Lakhdar and the committee .
His series , which included an award - winning image of a masked victim in a forest , will be part of a future public awareness campaign .
He said the unusual setting was a metaphor for the victims he met and spoke to for hours .
“ They ’re lost when they ’re enslaved , and they ’re lost when they are free , ” he said .
“ They have to relearn freedom . ”
Lakhdar said one case that struck her particularly was that of a 17 - year - old girl whose brother essentially sold her to her abusers on the pretense that she would receive job training in France .
After months of abuse and of being raped , the young woman was so desperate to escape that she tried to kill herself by drinking cleaning products .
Even as she vomited violently for three days , she was obliged to continue working .
She is now 21 and the committee is handling her case .
“ She ’s had a bad start in life , ” Lakhdar said .
“ That one really marked me . ”

The Department of Energy is releasing a record amount of supercomputing time , 1.3 billion processor hours , which has astrophysicists , biologists and everyone in between drooling in anticipation .
Starting in 2010 , some of them will have the chance to run the biggest and most intricate simulations ever , creating experimental galaxies , plasma fusion reactors and global climates to help solve some of science 's most complex problems .
They 'll be competing for time on the Cray XT system " Jaguar " at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and the IBM Blue Gene / P " Intrepid " at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois , two of the most powerful supercomputer facilities in the world .
Unlike many of the DOE 's big machines , they 're dedicated to open , unclassified research .
" This is an incredible increase in computing power , which was itself a huge increase from the year before , " said DOE spokesman Jeff Sherwood .
" It 's for research that would not be possible without petascale computing . "
In 2009 , 900 million processor hours were up for grabs ( a million processing hours would take 1,000 processors 1,000 hours , or around 41 days ) , but both computers received huge performance boosts this year .
Jaguar 's processor count has shot up from 31,328 to 180,832 , while Intrepid now boasts 163,840 from 32,768 .
Jaguar 's peak performance is now a blistering 1.64 petaflops ( a quadrillion and a half floating point operations per second ) , making it the second most powerful supercomputer on Earth .
The only number cruncher with more power is IBM's " Roadrunner " at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , which runs simulations of nuclear weapons , and sits behind the rather impenetrable firewall of national security .
The boost will allow scientists to tackle traditionally cantankerous problems that involve multiple simultaneous physical phenomena .
In enormous , high - resolution simulations , they can tweak an unprecedented multitude of conditions to test their theories .
" These are the only places in the world where you can do these types of simulations , " said Bronson Messer of ORNL , whose simulations of core - collapse supernovae were allocated 75 million processing hours in 2009 , more than any other project .
" In the case of stars and dark matter , there 's a lot of physics going on .
They 're very attractive targets for a big machine like this . "
Messer hopes to understand how stars more than 10 times the mass of our sun die .
Such deaths are the dominant source of elements in the universe .
Giant stars live much shorter lives than sun-size stars — about 10 million years rather than 5 to 15 billion — and they do not die quietly .
The iron core collapses from a couple thousand miles in diameter to about 35 miles in half a second , reaching a density equivalent to the mass of all humans on Earth packed into a sugar cube .
The core then rebounds with a blast of neutrinos and a shock wave that rips the star apart .
As the saying goes , these supernovae " live fast , die young , and leave a beautiful corpse , " but astrophysicists do n't understand some of the basic mechanisms of how the alluring explosions take place .
" People have been trying to attack this on computers for 40 to 50 years , " Messer said .
" We 're using simulations to basically pick a neutrino and ride along as it flies out of the star , and do this with as many neutrinos as possible .
We 're finally starting to see some hints of what 's happening , and we 're pretty jazzed about it . "
The team has used Jaguar to simulate the supernova up to about 100 milliseconds after the shock wave begins , and they hope to reach half a second .
" If we can use 180,000 processors , we 'll get much more accurate physics , " Messer said .
Another astrophysics project on Jaguar led by Piero Madau at the University of California , Santa Cruz will use 5 million processor - hours to explore the invisible halo of dark matter that surrounds the Milky Way .
Madau 's simulations , the largest ever performed for the Milky Way , will divide the halo into 30 billion parcels of dark matter and will simulate their evolution over 13 billion years .
In an earlier simulation on Jaguar , he produced the most detailed picture of the Milky Way 's halo , showing that small clumps of dark matter from the early galaxy survived to present day .
" In fact , the entire galaxy is decidedly clumpy , including our own neighborhood , " he said .
" Earlier simulations on less powerful systems had shown the dark matter smoothing out , especially in the galaxy 's dense inner reaches , because they did not have the resolution to resolve the unevenness . "
Astrophysics projects get the biggest allocation of Jaguar 's processing time — between 18 and 19 percent of the total .
But other areas involving vast scales and multiple physical phenomena , like climate and combustion , also get sizable chunks of processing time .
Jackie Chen of Sandia National Laboratories is using 30 million processor - hours on Jaguar to simulate the combustion process of alternative fuels , like biofuel and ethanol .
Her modeling of flames , ignition and turbulence can influence engine design , allowing for higher - efficiency and lower emissions vehicles .
" To understand the underlying physics of what 's going on in the internal combustion engines with alternative fuels , " said Chen , " we need some of the world 's largest calculations . "
Other ongoing projects seek to understand how proteins misfold in neurodegenerative diseases , develop thermoelectric materials to capture wasted heat from tailpipe emissions and create high - resolution climate models .

When President Obama declared Monday that the United States “ is not , and will never be , at war with Islam , ” he was addressing Turkey ’s parliament .
But his audience was the wider Muslim world .
The president ’s ringing affirmation of partnership with Turkey , which he described as a vital bridge between East and West , was interwoven with a highly personal appeal for a change in the tone of discourse between the United States and the world ’s Muslims .
The speech , the centerpiece of the president ’s first official visit to a Muslim - majority nation , was widely watched outside Turkey ’s borders and covered live on the largest Arabic - language satellite channels , Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya .
His 26 - minute speech , which was punctuated several times by applause , addressed a region where the president is personally very popular but faces large expectations .
In advance of his visit , Turks had pointedly reminded Obama he had fences to mend .

Commentators in Turkey interpreted his remarks before the Grand National Assembly as a determined effort to shake off the deep - seated mistrust that characterized the Bush administration ’s dealings with the governments of many predominantly Muslim nations .
Obama also hailed what he described as warming ties between Turkey and its neighbor Armenia , which have long been shadowed by Ankara ’s denial that the mass killing of ethnic Armenians in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire was genocide .
Sidestepping the question of how the Armenian deaths should be labeled , Obama instead urged a full normalization of relations and stressed that he did not want to make any remarks that would prejudice talks between the two countries .
His stop in Turkey generated scattered protests , but also an air of excitement .
Many cafes and shops had their TVs tuned to the speech , and Turks appeared as star - struck as some citizens of other countries on his current trip .
One baker created a borek , a pastry , with Obama ’s image on it .
“ You come to a country that is a friend of the U.S. , ” the national daily Hurriyet wrote in a front - page commentary Monday .
“ However , our hearts have been broken in the last eight years .
Now is the time to make repairs . ”

As if in reply , Obama made a simple but striking overture .
“ Let me say this as clearly as I can , ” he told lawmakers , officials and dignitaries .
“ The United States is not , and never will be , at war with Islam .
In fact , our partnership with the Muslim world is critical . ”
Drawing on his own background and heritage , the U.S. leader noted that many Americans had ties to Islam through family connections or by living in Muslim countries .
“ I know , because I am one of them , ” he said to warm applause .
Obama ’s father was a Muslim from Kenya , and he lived for a time in Indonesia , the world ’s most populous Muslim - majority nation .

Gazing around the ornate chamber , the president said the U.S. relationship with the Muslim world must be based on mutual respect , and must encompass more than the fight against terrorism .
“ America ’s relationship with the Muslim world cannot , and will not , be based on opposition to Al Qaeda , ” he said .
“ We seek broad engagement based on mutual interests and mutual respect . ”
In apparent deference to Turkey ’s status as a secular republic , Obama ’s aides refrained from characterizing his speech in the capital , Ankara , as a fulfillment of the pledge he made to address the Muslim world in his first 100 days in office .
Analysts in the Middle East said there were few surprises in the speech .
“ They see the small things here and there -- change in language , gestures , terminology , ” said Timur Goksel , a former United Nations official who teaches at the American University of Beirut .
“ He has time .
But because they expect so much from him he ’ll be under scrutiny .
They ’ll be watching him carefully . ”

Obama ’s foreign policy focus in the first months of his presidency has largely been on the Islamic world .
He has announced plans to withdraw combat forces from Iraq , but he has ordered more troops to Afghanistan and is pressing Pakistan to do more to subdue a Taliban insurgency .
He also is pursuing an opening to Iran .
Though many people may believe Obama wants to change the U.S. image in the Arab and Muslim worlds , they are n’t convinced a change in tone means a change of policies .
They ’re disappointed by his decisions to send more troops to Afghanistan and adhere to Bush - era policies on the Mideast conflict .
New Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office issued a statement saying Israel appreciated Obama ’s commitment to its security and the pursuit of peace , and promised to work closely with the U.S .
In Turkey , many feel the Bush administration took for granted that the country , a NATO ally , would provide logistical and other support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , despite strong popular sentiment against the war here .

“ In the Bush era , it was as if , ‘ If you clash with the U.S. , you are fundamentalists , radical Islamists . ’
Now it seems they have moved away from this , ” Hasan Koni , a political analyst from Bahcesehir University , told Sky Turk television .
Both in his speech and at the news conference , Obama emphasized the importance of Turkey ’s contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization force in Afghanistan , and said Turkey ’s views on both Afghanistan and Iraq would receive close attention .
Obama reiterated American support for Turkey ’s efforts to join the European Union -- although only a day earlier , key European partners France and Germany had again expressed their reservations about it .
Human rights activists had hoped the president would seek to nudge Turkey ’s government in the direction of greater recognition of the rights of ethnic and religious minorities .
He did , though cautiously .

“ Robust minority rights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens , ” Obama told lawmakers .
Turkey has a tradition of taking umbrage when outsiders criticize its historically harsh treatment of ethnic groups such as the Kurds and its discrimination against religious minorities .
But the president softened his implied criticism by noting that the U.S. itself “ not too long ago made it hard for someone who looks like me to vote -- let alone become president . ”
He also made it clear that there was no U.S. sympathy for the PKK , or Kurdistan Workers Party , which has waged a violent uprising against the Turkish state .
The United States designates it a terrorist organization , and the president said information - sharing about the group would continue .
In an apparent concession to the U.S. leader , Turkey ’s top military commanders , including army Chief of Staff Gen .
Ilker Basbug , were in the audience in parliament .
It marked the first time senior military commanders had appeared there since Kurdish political parties , whom authorities accuse of ties to the PKK , won representation in the chamber .

Times staff writer Borzou Daragahi in Beirut and special correspondent Noha El - Hennawy in Cairo contributed to this report .
There is an intense battle going on in Canada and internationally over the continuing export of Canadian asbestos to developing countries .
But most Canadians remain largely unaware of the battle and the high stakes involved .
Included amongst those Canadians , apparently , was Michael Ignatieff .
Speaking in Victoria , Mr. Ignatieff was asked whether he supported ending the export of asbestos .
Admitting that he might be getting into trouble for his answer , the Liberal leader was nonetheless unequivocal in his common sense answer : " Our export of this dangerous product overseas has got to stop . "
But just two days later , after being briefed about the role that this poisonous substance plays in the politics of Quebec , Mr. Ignatieff recanted -- and denied ever having said the fateful words .
The Leader of the Opposition declared : " What I said ... is that we have an obligation , it 's an international Convention , to warn countries to which we export this product , so that they know that there are risks for public health .
That is all I said .
That 's my position . "
In the political gulf between these two quotes lies the long and sordid story of Canada 's role in continuing to export what is far and away the most deadly workplace substance in human history .
In B.C. alone 300 people will die from workplace exposure to asbestos this year .
Still , this madness continues simply because no political party with significant Quebec representation in Parliament has had the guts to call for a ban on exports .
Indeed , neither Liberal nor Conservative federal governments have even been willing to place chrysotile asbestos on the list of the Rotterdam Convention on hazardous chemicals .
The convention requires importing countries to provide " prior informed consent " which would give them the right to be informed about , and to refuse , extremely hazardous chemicals and pesticides .
The Harper government 's determination to prevent the listing , against the recommendations of the Convention 's own expert committee , has effectively destroyed the convention which operates on a consensus basis .
This killer industry is itself dying .
There are only 550 miners left -- one tenth of the peak numbers -- and they have had their wages cut ; they work only part of the year .
In 2007 , one of the two remaining asbestos mining companies , LAB Chrysotile Inc , filed for bankruptcy protection .
In fact , both would have disappeared long ago were it not for Canada 's status in defending the industry .
In return for its influential international voice , other exporters , producing at much lower cost , permit Canada to keep its market share .
But when you have both corporate Quebec and Quebec labour gunning for any dissenter , it is not surprising to see politicians run for cover .
Clément Godbout , the President of the Chrysotile Institute ( named after chrysotile asbestos , the only form of asbestos that is produced and sold around the world ) is a former president of the Quebec Federation of Labour -- the second QFL president to hold the position .
Ninety - five percent of Canada 's exports go to third world countries which have woefully inadequate regulations and even worse enforcement .
Thousands of workers are affected and once asbestos disappears into concrete ( its principal end point ) and is cut , crumbles or is demolished , the deadly stuff is released into the air .
Amongst the long list of health organizations calling for the banning of chrysotile asbestos are The World Health Organization , the International Labour Organization , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the Canadian Cancer Society , the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health .
The evaluation by the International Agency for Research on Cancer -- the most respected cancer investigative organization in the world -- states that all forms of asbestos , including chrysotile asbestos , cause cancer .
The science is irrefutable .
But this does not stop the Chrysotile Institute ( CI ) .
The CI admits that chrysotile asbestos is carcinogenic but says it is much less so than other forms and it can be handled safely .
But it also quotes favourably a self - proclaimed expert with no scientific credentials who claims that chrysotile asbestos is not carcinogenic , stating that it " disappears " when it is mixed with cement and consequently becomes harmless -- a claim universally ridiculed by scientists in the field .
The Canadian Medical Association Journal editorial of Oct. 21 , 2008 accused the Canadian government of " contributing to asbestos - related illnesses and deaths in the developing world . "
Mr. Ignatieff could do three things to correct this appalling situation , if he becomes Prime Minister : withdraw the quarter million dollar grant Ottawa gives annually to the CI ; aim to save the Rotterdam Convention by formalizing , as Liberal Party policy , his recent commitment to list asbestos as a dangerous substance ; and lastly , to achieve true hero status , call for a complete ban on the export of asbestos and for transition funding and training for the workers displaced .

Jessica Simpson ( and of course , Ken Paves ) are in NYC working on some special photoshoot .
The pics look pretty cool from the Polaroids Jessica is holding in her hand .
I wonder what they are for - perhaps a new album or maybe just another magazine spread .
For the first time in a while , I will say I like this version of Jessica - the T - shirt and jeans girl with no extensions still looking like a star .
