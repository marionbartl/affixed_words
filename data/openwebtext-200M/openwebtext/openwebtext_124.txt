New York police spied broadly before 2004 GOP convention
" For at least a year before the 2004 Republican National Convention , teams of undercover New York City police officers traveled to cities across the country , Canada and Europe to conduct covert observations of people who planned to protest at the convention , according to police records and interviews , " the New York Times reports in Sunday 's edition .
Records show that in hundreds of files labeled " NYPD Secret , " the NYPD intelligence operations " chronicled the views and plans of people who had no apparent intention of breaking the law . "
The files included members of church and anti-war groups , environmentalists , and even three New York City elected officials .
In some cases , records of lawful activities were shared with police departments in other states .
Excerpts from the report follow :
#
From Albuquerque to Montreal , San Francisco to Miami , undercover New York police officers attended meetings of political groups , posing as sympathizers or fellow activists , the records show .
They made friends , shared meals , swapped e-mail messages and then filed daily reports with the department 's Intelligence Division .
Other investigators mined Internet sites and chat rooms .
From these operations , run by the department 's " RNC Intelligence Squad , " the police identified a handful of groups and individuals who expressed interest in creating havoc during the convention , as well as some who used Web sites to urge or predict violence .

Submarines , Secrets and Spies
The transcript of a NOVA film that explores the U.S. - Soviet Cold War submarine cat - and - mouse game .
In late May of 1975 , Americans awoke to the headline " Submarines of U.S. Stage Spy Missions Inside Soviet Waters " on the front page of The New York Times .
The story , by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , gave details of how the highly classified Navy missions were tapping into Soviet communications .
The Ford White House was disturbed by the revelations , and the president 's chief of staff , Donald Rumsfeld , wanted action .
His young deputy , Dick Cheney , began gathering and assessing the options , and his notes and memos were first described in Challenging the Secret Government : The Post - Watergate Investigations of the FBI and CIA , a book by University of California , Davis Professor Kathryn S. Olmsted .
FRONTLINE obtained Cheney 's notes from the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library .
The notes reveal how Cheney went about considering a response after collecting and synthesizing the opinions of others in the administration .
In handwritten notes , dated three days after the article was published , Cheney asks : " What does the law say -- is there a violation ? "
He then lays out options , discussed with Attorney General Edward Levi and White House Counsel Philip Buchen , including :
An FBI investigation of the Times , Hersh and / or " possible gov't sources " ;
, Hersh and / or " possible gov't sources " ; Grand jury indictments of Hersh and the Times ;
; A search warrant " to go after Hersh papers in his apt " ;
Informally discussing the incident with the Times ;
; " Do nothing " .
Cheney speculates that a disillusioned former CIA officer could be one of Hersh 's possible sources .
He also weighs the strength of the government 's case ; the political considerations -- including avoiding " the Pentagon Papers syndrome " ; and the timing of when the investigation would become public knowledge .
The following day , in another note , Cheney outlines the government 's six goals if it were to take action :
Enforcing " the law which prohibits such disclosure " ;
Discouraging the Times and others from similar publications ;
and others from similar publications ; Finding and prosecuting the person who leaked the information ;
Discouraging others from leaking ;
Demonstrating " the dangers to nat'l security which develop when investigations exceed the bounds of propriety " ;
Creating " an environment in which the ongoing investigations of the intelligence community are conducted without harming our intelligence capabilities " .
The same day , he sends a memo updating Rumsfeld , who is in Brussels on a presidential trip , on the administration 's options .
Attached is an eight - page memo from Attorney General Levi , who outlines the options .
However , Levi notes two significant problems with pursing legal action : 1 ) much of the material in the Times article had been published more than a year earlier in an article by Laurence Stern in The Washington Post ; and 2 ) in prosecuting , the government would be forced to confirm and prove the new disclosure that U.S. submarines were tapping into Soviet undersea cables .
" This would put an official stamp of truth on the article , " Levi writes , " and could have diplomatic consequences which would otherwise not follow from an unofficial account . "
Levi also warned that prosecuting Hersh , who was unlikely to reveal his sources , " would also turn the case into a cause celebre . "
It 's not known whether the government took similar steps to investigate the first " leak , " which occurred during the Nixon administration .
Stern , who died in 1976 , had reported the existence of the program and its code name , going so far as to characterize it as " probably the most hush - hush of all U.S. electronic intelligence operations . "
Hersh , who cited Stern 's article , reported that the Post article had " angered " the Pentagon , but that " no significant modification of the operation took place , " despite the fact that the Russians seemed to be " increasing their efforts against the reconnaissance missions . "
In the end , although the file from the Ford Library includes a letter dated June 2 from Deputy Attorney General Harold R. Tyler to CIA Director William Colby with the list of 11 questions intelligence agencies need to answer in order to open a leak investigation , ultimately the government did n't go after Hersh or the Times .
In his interview with FRONTLINE , Hersh shrugs off the incident .
" At the time , I did n't think it was serious .
...
Somebody in Justice warned me they were looking at me .
Duh .
Big deal .
It did n't happen . "
As for the Bush administration prosecuting reporters under the Espionage Act , Hersh is skeptical : " Underneath all of this bluster and talk and threats , anybody knows that if they make a serious move on the First Amendment , they do so at their political peril . "

Facebook LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Four dead dolphins have washed ashore with fatal bullet wounds and fifth with lacerations on its pectoral fin , said authorities who have offered a reward for information on the slayings .
The long - beaked common dolphins were all discovered between Carlsbad State Beach and Oceanside Harbor between May 29 and June 5 .
Photos showed their normally sleek gray skin mottled and stained with blood from the bullet wounds .
" It 's a horrendous thing that happened , " said Mark Oswell , spokesman for the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration .
" That someone would go out there and shoot four dolphins . "
Necropsies revealed that the dolphins , which were healthy with bellies full of fish , may have been shot at the same time with the same gun .
Four had between one and three bullets of the same caliber in the same part of their heads .
Federal officials say that nationwide , they normally get one report of a dolphin shooting a year .
The last time San Diego reported such a death was five years ago .
Before that there had n't been one in the area since the 1960s .
" It usually turns out to be a fisherman , " said Oswell , adding there have been cases when anglers take out their frustrations on dolphins and other mammals that eat their catch .
The agency is offering up to $ 2,500 for information on the deaths .
If caught , the perpetrator could face civil penalties of up to $ 12,000 or a criminal fine of up to $ 20,000 , as well as jail time .
Harassing or killing dolphins is a violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 , a federal law that protects seals , sea lions , dolphins , whales and other marine mammals .

Revisiting my awkward ( est ) years , one Baby - Sitters Club book at a time .
Books in digital format , also known as e-books , can be read on devices lacking the power and screen space to afford a regular Web browser .
Several publishers , not to mention projects such as Project Gutenberg , have provided thousands of new and classic titles in digital format .
The problem is both the hardware — be it generic PDAs or dedicated devices — and the whole e-book publishing industry are much more fragmented than are PCs and Web browsers .
Therefore , it is probable that the e-book you recently bought will not be readable ten years from now — nor tomorrow , should you decide to use a laptop or change PDAs .
To help combat this fragmentation , this article discusses some existing command - line tools that can convert the most popular e-book formats to ASCII or HTML .
Practically no tools exist now to export e-book formats to PDF or OpenDocument , the new OASIS standard used in OpenOffice.org , but this is not necessarily a big deal .
Once text is in ASCII or HTML format , it easily can be moved to plain - text or PDF format by using a text browser such as w3 m or programs such as html2ps .
If you go this route for conversion , you are able to do it today , and because it's an open format , 20 years from now too .
PalmDoc On PalmOS , the original and most common e-book format is PalmDoc , also called AportisDoc or simply Doc , even though it has nothing to do with Microsoft Word 's .doc format .
Doc , recognizable by the extensions .pdb ( Palm Database ) or .prc ( Palm Resource Code ) , basically is a PalmPilot database composed of records strung together .
This standard has spun off several variants , including MobiPocket , which adds embedded HTML markup tags to the basic format .
Each Palm e-book is divided into three sections : the header , a series of text records and a series of bookmark records .
Normally , the header is 16 bytes wide .
Some Doc readers may extend the width at run time to hold additional custom information .
By default , the header contains data such as the total length of the uncompressed text , the position currently viewed in the document and an array of two - byte unsigned integers giving the uncompressed size of each text record .
Usually , the maximum size for this kind of records is 4,096 bytes , and each one of them is compressed individually .
The bookmark records are composed of a 16 - byte name and a 4 - byte offset from the beginning of text .
Because bookmarks are optional , many Doc e-books do n't contain them , and most Doc readers support alternative — that is , non-portable — methods to specify them .
Other reader - specific extensions might include category , version numbers and links between e-books .
Almost always , this information is stored outside the .pdb or .rc file .
Therefore , you should not expect to preserve this kind of data when converting your e-books .
Pyrite Publisher , formerly Doc Toolkit , is a set of content conversion tools for the Palm platform .
Currently , only some text formats can be converted , but functionality can be extended to support new ones by way of Python plugins .
Pyrite Publisher can download the documents to convert directly from the Web ; it also can download set bookmarks directly to the output database .
The package , which requires Python 2.1 or greater , can be used from the command line or through a wxWindows - based GUI .
The software is available for Linux and Windows in both source and binary format .
Should you choose the latter option , remember that compiled versions expect Python to be in /usr .
The Linux version can install converted files straight to the PDA using JPilot or pilot - link .
Pyrite installed and ran flawlessly on Fedora Core 2 .
Unlike the other command - line converters presented below , however , Pyrite can save only in ASCII format , not in HTML .
The name of the executable is pyrpub .
The exact command for converting . pdb files uses this syntax : pyrpub - P TextOutput -o don_quixote.txt \ Don_Quixote.pdb
Pyrite can be enough if all you want to do is quickly index a digital library .
On the other hand , it is almost trivial to reformat the result to make it more readable in a browser .
The snippet of Perl code in Listing 1 , albeit ugly , was all it took to produce the version of Don Quixote shown in Figure 1 .
Listing 1 . A simple Perl script converts Pyrite 's extracted text to HTML .
#!
/usr/bin/perl undef $ / ; $ TEXT = <>; $ TEXT =~ s/
/<p>/gm ; print << END_HTML ; < html >< body >
$ TEXT </body ></html > END_HTML
Figure 1 . A PalmDoc file converted to HTML for viewing in a browser .
The script loads the whole ASCII text previously generated with Publisher , and every time it finds two new lines in a row , it replaces them with HTML paragraph markers .
The result then is printed to standard output and properly formatted as basic HTML .
To change justification , fonts and colors , you simply need to paste your favourite stylesheet right after the < html > < body > line .
OpenOffice.org 2.0 , expected to be released in spring 2005 , will be able to save text in .pdb format .
If it also is able to read such files , its mass conversion feature ( File →AutoPilot → Document Converter ) would solve the problem nicely .
I have tried to do this with the 1.9.m65 preview , but all I got was a General input / output error pop-up message .
Hopefully , this functionality will be added to future versions .
The P5 Perl Package Pyrite Publisher is designed mainly to go from normal HTML or text files to the Palm platform , not the other way around .
The procedure discussed above is not really scalable to scenarios such as converting a great quantity of Palm e-books to customized HTML , with hyperlinks and metadata included .
In such cases , the best solution might be a Perl script combining the standard XML or HTML modules for this language with the P5 - Palm bundle ; these are available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ( see the on- line Resources ) .
The P5 - Palm set of modules includes classes for reading , processing and writing the .pdb and .prc database files used by PalmOS devices .
Rocket Ebook and MobiPocket RocketBook e-books have several interesting characteristics , including support for compressed HTML files and indexes containing a summary of paragraph formatting and the position of the anchor names .
These and many more details on .rb file internals are explained in the RB format page listed in the on-line Resources .
Rbmake Rocket Ebook and Mobipocket files can be disassembled with a set of command - line tools called Rbmake .
Its home page offers source code , binary packages , a mailing list and contact information to report bugs .
To use rbmake , you need libxml2 , version 2.3.1 or higher ; the pcre ( Perl - Compatible Regular Expressions ) library ; and zlib , to handle compression .
To compile from source — at least on Fedora Core 2 — it also is necessary to install separately the pcre - devel package .
The Rbmake Library A nice feature of Rbmake is the source code is structured in a modular manner .
An entire library of object - oriented C routines can be compiled and linked independently from the rest of the package from any other program dealing with .rb files .
In this way , should you want to write your own super - customized Rocket Ebook converter or simply index all of your e-books into a database , you would need to use only the piece that actually knows how to read and write the .rb format , the RbFile class .
This chunk of code opens the file , returns a list of the sections composing the book and uncompresses on the fly only the ones actually required by the main program .
Should you need them , the library also includes functions to match and replace parts of the content through Perl - compatible regular expressions .
The Rbmake tools should compile quickly and without problems on any modern GNU / Linux distribution .
Exhaustive HTML documentation also is included in the source tarball .
The binary file able to generate HTML files is called rbburst .
It extracts all the components — text , images and an info file — present in the original .rb container .
Figure 2 shows , in two separate Mozilla Windows , the cover page and the table of contents of the file generated by rbburst when run on The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells .
Figure 2 . Rbmake extracts all the components of a RocketBook file , including text and images .
Microsoft Reader Microsoft 's Reader files , recognizable by the .lit extension , have many of the characteristics of traditional books , including pagination , highlighting and notes .
They also support keyword searching and hyperlinks , but they are locked in to one reader platform .
The tool for converting these files is called , simply , Convert Lit .
Running the program with the - help option lists , according to UNIX tradition , all the available command - line options .
This program has three modes of operation : explosion , downconversion and inscribing .
Explosion is the one needed to convert an existing .
lit file to an OEBPS - compliant package .
OEBPS ( Open eBook Publication Structure ) is covered later in the article .
Figure 3 shows a version of Shakespeare 's A Midsummer 's Night Dream obtained by using explosion from the Convert Lit program .
Downconversion is the opposite process ; it generates a . lit file for use by a Microsoft Reader - compliant device .
Inscribing is when the downconversion attaches a user - defined label to the .lit file .
The exact syntax is explained on the program 's home page ( see Resources ) .
Figure 3 . Convert Lit creates a readable HTML file with a hyperlinked table of contents .
We already mentioned that Convert Lit creates an OEBPS package made of different files .
Here is the complete list for the example above : Contents.htm , copyright.html , ~cov0024.htm , cover.jpg , MidSummerNightDream.opf , MobMids.html , PCcover.jpg , PCthumb.jpg , stylesheet.css and thumb.jpg .
HTML , CSS and JPG files were to be expected , but what is the .opf file ?
It is an XML container describing the structure and several portions of the original book 's metadata .
The extension OPF stands for open electronic book package format .
The OPF file contains references to the other pieces of the e-book , as well as descriptions of their attributes .
To have a clearer idea of its role , a short excerpt of MidSummerNightDream.opf is shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . OPF is an XML - based format for book attributes .
< dc: Title > A Midsummer - Night 's Dream </ dc: Title > < dc:Creator role = " aut " file - as = " Shakespeare , William , 1564 - 1616 " >
William Shakespeare , 1564 - 1616 </dc:Creator > < dc:Description > fiction , poetry < / dc: Description >
The practical consequence of this is Convert Lit could be useful even if you wanted to leave all of your collection in a proprietary format .
You still could run the program on all your .
lit e-books and delete everything but the .opf files .
Then , any quick script or full - blown XML parsing utility could scan them and index everything into the database of your choice .
Convert Lit also removes digital rights management ( DRM ) infections from e-book files using the older DRM1 version .
And if you have Microsoft Reader e-books , you likely have a Microsoft Windows system and a licensed copy of Microsoft Reader .
According to the Convert Lit Web site , you can build and run Convert Lit on Windows to first convert new DRM5 e-books to DRM1 , using the Windows DRM library .
Mass Conversion
In general , we have discussed only command - line processing in this article .
If , however , you have a whole collection of e-books in different formats , you can convert them all at one time with a simple shell script .
As we already have shown , once the text is in ASCII or HTML format , the sky is the limit .
You can add one or two lines to the loop to index with glimpse or ht : : dig , print everything in one single PostScript book and much more .
Here 's a link to the previous episode in case you missed it : Tales from the Interview .
Do n't forget to send in some of your own for next time .
It Seemed Like too Much Work
from Troy
We interviewed a candidate for a developer position once .
This guy was a character .
His resume was great , his code samples were great , but the total package was somewhat - unusual .
At one point in the interview , he mentioned , " That was about the time I drove my car off a mountain . "
Interest piqued , we had to ask , " Why did you drive your car off a mountain ? "
The story was long , but it boiled down to a lesson in stupidity .
He drove half way up the mountain on day 1 , camped out that night , and by the next morning his car was covered in dust .
The morning light blazing down on his dust - covered windshield made it opaque at best .
Instead of wiping the dust off , he just drove blindly up the winding mountain road and over the edge .
When queried about why he did n't clean his windshield , he just said , " it seemed like too much work " .
Somehow he cheated Darwin on that deal and wound up in our office , and we struggled to rescue some positive aspects of our candidate from that story ( we failed ) , but we continued on with the interview anyway , perhaps just to see what he'd say next .
We gave him a simple database schema design question ( written out on paper ) with 3 requirements and asked him to draw his database design .
He scribbled for 5 minutes or so before proudly mumbling , " I guess I 'm done " .
He managed to satisfy 1 of the 3 requirements and when asked about the fate of the missing 2 requirements he huffed and puffed for a bit , looked exasperated , then said , " Well , to be honest , I did n't really read this thing . "
Before he left , never to be seen by us again , we made one last request .
" Please , drive safely " .
Our office was on a dirt road and cars had a tendency to accumulate dust during the day .
We could n't have any of our employees being run over by this candidate on the way out .
A Nice New Pair of Kicks
From Martin Burns , during his tenure as recruiter for an actuarial search firms ...
I was working for a national contingency agency , and our specialty was actuarial search .
Once of our major long - term clients was one of the top employee benefit consulting firms in the country ( name withheld for all the usual reasons ) .
For this search , they were looking for a top - level actuarial consultant .
For those of you unfamiliar with the actuarial field , well let 's just say that finding an actuary who 's comfortable in front of people is kind of like finding a Leprechaun who does n't lie about where their pot of gold is hiding .
So when I sourced a guy in Texas who was personality + with phenomenal scores on the grueling actuarial exams & open to relocation nationally , I did the foolish thing of assuming I 'd already made a placement .
We got on the phone with our client immediately .
They loved what they heard ; phone screened him for a role in Chicago , and booked flight up while they were still talking .
I started doing the money dance in my head , thinking about the new Bang & Olufson speakers I would buy , all of that .
This would be a 6 figure salary at a 35 % fee ( ahh , the idiot 90's ) .
I phone prepped him , but since I was cocky about this one , did n't do more than say to him " make sure you wear a suit " , to which he said : " Do n't worry Martin , I 've got a new blue one with a nice new pair of kicks . "
I 'm from Boston .
I though " kicks " meant shoes .
They met him at the airport with a limo & two senior consultants .
The called me the minute the car pulled up to their office and one of them could cut away .
They did n't yell , but I think that would have been better .
In a ( very ) cold tone , they said : " He 's wearing a powder blue leisure suit with cowboy boots . "
Shockingly , I did n't get my Bang & Olufson's .
I still do n't have them .
I 'm a Perfect Ten !
From Deanna Peugeot ...
I was interviewing a candidate for a testing position .
The product was a linux based embedded system , so , obviously , Linux skills were a must .
This guy had a decent resume , and interviewed reasonably well , until I got to the subject of Linux ...
Me : How would you rate your Linux skills on a scale of 1 to 10 ?
Tester : Ten , definately .
Me :
What command would you run to find a file in Linux ?
Tester : I do n't know
Me : Would you still rate your skills as a ten ?
Tester :
Of course
The scary thing is that he was the best of all the interview candidates and we hired him !
I Forgot to Introduce You
From the interviewee for an entry - level programmer position who asked to remain anonymous ...
After graduating , I was fortunate enough to know some one ( my cousin ) inside of a fairly large organization .
He offered to help me get a job there and set up an interview with Mark , a senior development manager .
Before the interview , he warned me : " Whatever you do , do n't go through HR .
They are completely useless .
They do n't know how to judge a candidate . "
We both laughed ; I guess that was a funny joke .
When I arrived for the interview , I was met by the receptionist , who escorted me to Mark 's extremely large and lavish office .
Mark welcomed me and asked me what was up .
I decided to reiterate what was apparently a very humorous joke , and told him " I 'm looking for a job .
I thought of going through HR but everyone says they are useless .
So I came to you . "
Time stopped .
Out of the corner of my eye I saw the receptionist stiffen up as if imitating a wooden plank .
Mark fixed me with a steely gaze .
Hours ( probably seconds ) passed .
" I 'm sorry ; I forgot to introduce you , " Mark said , motioning to the receptionist , " this is Betsy ; she 's VP of HR here . "
Several more eternal seconds passed as I began to understand the magnitude of my faux pas .
It became clear that Betsy was simply waiting for me at the receptionist 's desk and was n't actually the receptionist .
I tried to decide if I should simply bolt from the room , or try to sort things out .
I went for the tactical retreat : " Err , maybe I should just leave ? "
" No , " Mark replied , " I think you should actually explain yourself . "
At this point the blood is racing , so I 'm not sure exactly what I said but it was something along the lines of " It 's not that HR is bad .
It 's more that you know me better than they do and are more capable of assessing me . "
A minute or so later I stumbled out of the room gasping for air .
Despite all that , I still received an offer .
Thank goodness for nepotism .
Pants - Free Fridays
From Don B ...
In the late '90s , the company I was working for was trying to hire a technical writer .
Our boss thought it was important that the developers , all four of us , interview each candidate as a group .
Since I 'm terrible at conducting interviews , I figured I would sit back and let our manager and the other developers do all the work .
My plan back - fired .
When my manager asked the candidate if she had any questions for us , she responded with a fairly tame question :
What do each of you like about working here ?
Yup , I blew it .
Not being prepared and trying to come off as casual and funny I answered , What I love about working here is Pants - Free Fridays .
Stunned silence was followed by forced laughter .
After a few more quick and awkward questions the interview was over .
I was politely , and thankfully , asked not to sit on any more interviews .
We ended up offering her the position but for some reason she turned it down .
Massachusetts voters sick of holding their noses on Election Day could get another option : none of the above .
The proposal would let voters reject all candidates and demand a new election .
" Occasionally , when you get an application for a position , none of them are qualified , " said William H. White , a retired systems analyst from East Dennis spearheading the scheme , who testified yesterday before state lawmakers .
The measure , pending before the Legislature , would add the line " None of the Above ; For a New Election " to every state and local race on the ballot .
If that option won the most votes , another election would be held in 60 to 80 days , and other candidates would be allowed to run .
In a state where 70 percent of candidates ran unopposed last year , the bill would let voters try to force competition by calling for a new election .
The bill was sponsored at White 's behest by Senator Robert A. O'Leary , a Barnstable Democrat , and Representative Cleon H. Turner , who represents Dennis .
Turner said yesterday that the novel idea has gained little traction so far on Beacon Hill .
The bill 's approval would make Massachusetts the first state to offer voters such a choice that is binding .
Nevada has given its voters a nonbinding none - of - the - above option in statewide races since 1975 .
Under
White 's proposal , the presidential race would be the only one in which voters could not demand a new election .
But they could register their discontent by voting for none - of - the - above , as well as a candidate .
" That would signal that this candidate would not have a mandate , even if they won , " said White .

The US military has embarked on a new and risky strategy in Iraq by arming Sunni insurgents in the hope that they will tackle the extremist al - Qaida in Iraq .
The US high command this month gave permission to its officers on the ground to negotiate arms deals with local leaders .
Arms , ammunition , body armour and other equipment , as well as cash , pick - up trucks and fuel , have already been handed over in return for promises to turn on al - Qaida and not attack US troops .
The US military in Baghdad is trying to portray the move as arming disenchanted Sunnis who are rising up in their neighbourhoods against their former allies , al - Qaida and its foreign fighters .
But the reality on the ground is more complex , with little sign that the US will be able to control the weapons once they are handed over .
The danger is that the insurgents could use these weapons against American troops or in the civil conflict against Shia Muslims .
Similar efforts by the US in other wars have backfired , the most spectacular being the arming of guerrillas against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
Major General Rick Lynch , a senior US commander in Iraq , insisted no weapons would be given to insurgents who had attacked Americans .
" We have not crossed that line , " he said .
The US said it would use fingerprinting , retinal scans and other tests to establish whether insurgents had been involved in fighting against American troops .
But a reliable witness to a meeting this month between US forces and insurgents in the Sunni stronghold of Amadiya , in Baghdad , expressed scepticism about the strategy .
Far from being a popular uprising against al - Qaida , only a handful of armed men turned up .
The US handed over ammunition to them .
The witness said that US soldiers watching the handover were dismissive , seeing it as a stunt .
The strategy was discussed in Baghdad this month between the new US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and his field commanders .
They decided to leave it to each commander to decide locally .
The Pentagon insisted the latest strategy was not recognition that president George Bush 's " surge " policy had failed .
All of the extra 30,000 US troops ordered by Mr Bush in January to Baghdad and Anbar province , one of the centres of the violence , had only just been fully deployed and it was too early to judge it .
Initial successes of the surge in pacifying parts of Baghdad have now been reversed , with the death toll among US troops and Iraqi civilians last month among the highest since the 2003 invasion .
The US military first tested the strategy of arming its former enemies in Anbar province .
Anbar is now relatively quiet , but that could be because the US has flooded the province with US troops .
The Anbar model is being extended to Amariya , as well as Diyala and Salahuddin provinces .
The US insists that the Sunni disenchantment with al - Qaida is because of the group 's suicide bombings that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians .
The arming of the Sunni insurgents reflects US unhappiness with the slow progress of the Iraqi army , which it suspects of being too close to the Shia militias , and with the police , which is even more riddled with sectarianism .
At a press conference , Gen Lynch said he was concerned about corruption within Iraq 's police force and by interference from the national government in security issues , particularly in the release of suspected insurgents held by Iraqi security forces .
Part of the problem is that the US needs its security efforts to be accompanied by political progress but the Iraqi coalition government has so far been unable to reach agreement on the biggest divisive issues .
In a further upset , Iraq 's Shia - dominated parliament voted yesterday to remove the speaker , Mahmoud al - Mashhadani , a Sunni , over alleged scandals .
His bloc , the Sunni Arab Iraqi Accordance Front , was asked to submit an alternative .
The manoeuvring came on another day of bloodshed across the country , which left 36 Iraqis and three US soldiers dead .
In a separate attack , a suicide bomber destroyed a bridge over the Diyala river , north of Baghdad .
Changing tactics
1999 : Operation Desert Crossing
A series of war games conducted by the US in 1999 by General Anthony Zinni , who concluded that a force of 400,000 troops would be needed to invade and pacify Iraq .
The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , instead plans for 130,000 US troops and 45,000 from Britain and elsewhere .
2003 : Operation Iraqi Freedom
Codename for the US invasion .
Britain called it Operation Telic .
In May , President George Bush , right , declares hostilities at end , with a banner behind him saying " Mission Accomplished " .
Paul Bremer , the US head of the provisional government , disbands the Iraqi army , sending tens of thousands of trained and armed men into unemployment and potentially into the insurgency .
The US denies there is a resistance .
Saddam Hussein is captured on December 13 , 2003 on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn .
2004 : The US battles Shia militia in Najaf and mounts a full - scale assault on Falluja to root out Sunni insurgents and take revenge for the gruesome deaths of US contractors .
2005 : Paul Wolfowitz announces that 15,000 US troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the spring .
There is a temporary reduction in violence .
2006 : Mr Bush points to the success of a US commander , Colonel HR McMaster , in Tal Afar , near the Syrian border , as " the outlines of the Iraq we 've been fighting for " .
Col McMaster cut off Tal Afar , divided it into small neighbourhoods and established permanent posts in them instead of defeating insurgents and then leaving .
In October the US military announces that Operation Together Forward has failed to stop violence in Baghdad .
The Iraq Study Group , made up of former US politicians and officials , proposes a troop reduction .
2007 : Mr Bush ignores the Iraq Study Group in favour of a 30,000 - strong " surge " in US troops to pacify Baghdad and Anbar province .
Tony Blair announces that following the success of Operation Sinbad in the British sector , the UK will reduce its military presence .
Mr Bush appoints Lieutenant - General Douglas Lute to coordinate Iraq and Afghanistan .
The surge , after an initial reduction of violence in Baghdad , has in the last two months had little impact , with the death toll last month one of the highest since the invasion .
The US opts for arming its former enemies , Sunni insurgents , to try to split them from the more extremist al - Qaida in Iraq .
Ronco Spray - On Usability
This one is funny .
Eric S. Raymond — the renowned Linux / Open Source evangelist / essayist — could n’t figure out how to connect to a shared printer .
So he wrote an essay describing the problem ( the UI for printer configuration on his Linux system is horrible ) and proposing a solution ( open source developers should do a better job with UI design ) .
Raymond wrote :
The configuration problem is simple .
I have a desktop machine named ‘ snark ’ .
It is connected , via the house Ethernet , to my wife Cathy ’s machine , which is named ‘ minx ’ .
Minx has a LaserJet 6MP attached to it via parallel port .
Both machines are running Fedora Core 1 , and Cathy can print locally from minx .
I can ssh minx from snark , so the network is known good .
This should be easy , right ?
* hollow laughter * Famous last words …
( Side note : parallel port ?
What year is it in the Raymond household ? )
Raymond ’s description and criticism of the usability problems he encountered trying to achieve this are accurate and apt .
The gist of it is that what seemed like the obvious way to go about the task was in fact completely wrong , and worse , there was no indication from the system that he was n’t on the right track .
This setup alone is sort of funny — Linux Advocate Struggles to Configure Printer — ha-ha .
Even funnier considering past statements from Raymond regarding Linux -vs . - Windows usability ; e.g. the foreward for the book “ Everyday Linux ” , wherein he wrote :
Conventional wisdom has it that Linux is doomed to a niche role on the desktop because it ’s too difficult for Aunt Tillie to run .
But the days when Linux was really more complex to administer than a Windows machine are long past us .
In the last three years the open - source community has made enormous strides in simplifying installation and normal housekeeping and presenting it through graphical user interfaces — to the point where it ’s really quite a bit easier over time to maintain a Linux box than a Windows machine , whether you ’re an expert techie or not .
I mean , come on , it ’s funny that the guy who wrote that could n’t connect to a shared printer .
But it ’s when Raymond begins proposing “ solutions ” to the problem — where “ the problem ” is the larger issue of open source software usability in general , not just the specific case of CUPS printer configuration — that things get hilarious .
In his follow - up article , Raymond summarizes his proposal thusly :
A few days ago I uttered a rant on user - interface problems in the Common Unix Printing System .
I used it to develop the idea that the most valuable gift you can give your users is the luxury of ignorance — software that works so well , and is so discoverable to even novice users , that they do n’t have to read documentation or spend time and mental effort to learn about it .
Sounds good , on the surface .
And indeed , most of the follow - up article is devoted to the congratulatory email Raymond received in response to part one :
This rant made it onto all the major open - source news channels , so I was expecting a fair amount of feedback ( and maybe pushback ) .
But the volume of community reaction that thundered into my mailbox far surpassed what I had been expecting — and the dominant theme , too , was a bit of a surprise .
Not the hundreds of iterations of “ Tell it , brother ! ” , nor the handful of people who excoriated me as an arrogant twerp ; those are both normal features of the response when I fire a broadside .
No , the really interesting part was how many of the letters said , in effect , “ Gee .
And all this time I thought it was just me … ”
I agree that this is an interesting response , but not for the reason Raymond does .
What I find interesting about the “ I thought it was just me ” response is that it points to the gaping hole in Raymond ’s proposal , but which he does n’t acknowledge .
Raymond ’s recommendations center around the idea that open source developers need to meet the needs of “ Aunt Tillie ” , whom Raymond defines as “ the archetypal nontechnical user ” .
( Hereafter referred to as A.T. , because the name Aunt Tillie is so queer that it makes yours truly a tad queasy . )
The idea being that if open source software is usable by A.T. , then it ’ll meet the usability needs of everyone else , too .
But the whole A.T. angle is quite disingenuous .
It was n’t A.T. who could n’t connect to a shared printer .
It was Raymond himself who could n’t figure it out .
Yes , I see the point that if it were so easy and obvious that A.T. could do it , a nerd like Raymond could do it too .
But this is putting the horse way in front of the carriage .
In what world does the “ archetypal nontechnical user ” have two computers connected by Ethernet ?
When A.T. needs to configure a printer , it ’s going to be connected directly to her computer , not shared over a network .
By focusing on A.T. , Raymond is ignoring the actual depth of the problem .
It ’s easy to say , The open source community needs to do better , we need to create software A.T. can use .
But they ’re so far away from this right now that even an expert like Eric Raymond ca n’t figure out how to use their software .
The “ I thought I was the only one ” letters that Raymond found so interesting are n’t coming from the A.T. - set ; they ’re coming from Linux geeks who read essays written by Eric Raymond .
And they ’re frustrated by open source software ’s terrible usability .
The problem is n’t just that dear old A.T. ca n’t use desktop Linux — the problem is that even Linux geeks have trouble figuring it out .
Furthermore , the “ I thought I was the only one ” response raises the question : what planet are these guys from ?
Is n’t it common knowledge that desktop Linux usability tends to suck ?
How can anyone write an essay proposing to fix this without mentioning , let alone responding to , Matthew Thomas ’s seminal essay , “ Why Free Software usability tends to suck ” ?
Easy Rider
Raymond writes as though they ’re almost there , but just need , you know , the finishing touches .
The extra yard .
The cherry on top .
The pièce de résistance .
I.e. , We ’ve got the hard part done — the under - the - hood foundation — now we just need a better UI and we ’ll be set .
But this is not a radical new direction for open source desktop software .
What Raymond is proposing , in fact , is no change at all .
This idea , that the hard work of development is in building the underlying foundation , and that the easy part is writing a “ GUI wrapper ” , has been the Linux / Unix way all along .
Raymond ’s proposal is predicated on the idea that good UI design and development is easy , that developers simply need to keep dear old A.T. in mind and the design will fall into place .
Raymond writes :
None of this is rocket science .
The problem is n’t that the right things are technically difficult to do ; CUPS is already supposed to have discovery of active shareable queues as a feature .
The problem is that the CUPS designers ’ attitude was wrong .
They never stepped outside their assumptions .
They never exerted the mental effort to forget what they know and sit down at the system like a dumb user who ’s never seen it before — and they never watched a dumb user in action !
And again :
As I said before , the point of this essay is not especially to bash on the CUPS guys .
They ’re no worse than thousands of projects out there , and that is the point .
We talk about world domination , but we ’ll neither have it nor deserve it until we learn to do better than this .
A lot better .
It ’s not like doing better would be difficult , either .
None of the changes in CUPS behavior or documentation I ’ve described would be technical challenges ; the problem is that these simple things never occurred to developers who bring huge amounts of already - acquired knowledge to bear every time they look at their user interfaces .
Oh , I see : the problem is that Linux developers are just so fucking smart that they overlook the problems faced by “ dumb users ” such as dear old A.T.
But everything will fall into place with just a little attitude adjustment .
Well , allow me to retort .
UI development is the hard part .
And it ’s not the last step , it ’s the first step .
In my estimation , the difference between :
software that performs function X ; and
software that performs function X , with an intuitive well - designed user interface
is n’t just a little bit of extra work .
It ’s not even twice the work .
It ’s an entire order of magnitude more work .
Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work .
Raymond acknowledges neither .
It ’s not something every programmer can learn .
Most programmers do n’t have any aptitude for UI design whatsoever .
It ’s an art , and like any art , it requires innate ability .
You can learn to be a better writer .
You can learn to be a better illustrator .
But most people can’t write and can’t draw , and no amount of practice or education is going to make them good at it .
Improved , yes ; good , no .
Conversely , some people who are good UI designers are n’t programmers .
But the rock stars are the guys who can do both , and they are few and far between .
If there ’s a glib , nutshell synopsis for why Linux desktop software tends to suck , it ’s this : Raymond and his ilk have no respect for anyone but themselves .
They have no respect for the fact that UI design is a special talent .
They have no respect for the fact that good UI design requires a tremendous amount of time and effort .
And , most importantly , they have no respect at all for real users .
The idea that GUI software needs to be designed for “ dumb users ” — which is Raymond ’s own term , and an indication of what he really means when he refers to dear old A.T. — is completely wrong .
Great software developers do n’t design for morons .
They design for smart , perceptive people — people just like themselves .
They have profound respect for their users .
Show Me the Money
This is not a Mac thing .
Well , it is , but what I mean is that it ’s not just a Mac thing .
There are a lot of developers creating good UIs for Windows , for the web , and for other platforms .
And , yes , there are even developers creating great UIs for software running on Linux .
But the undeniable truth is this : successful open source software projects tend to be at the developer - level , not the end - user level .
I.e. , successful open source projects have programming interfaces , not user interfaces .
Apache , Perl , Python , GCC , PHP , the various SQL databases .
The list of fantastic open source developer software is long .
The list of fantastic open source GUI software is short .
This is not a function of chance .
The open source revolution has done nothing to change the fact that the best - designed , most - intuitive user interfaces are found in closed - source commercial software .
I ’m not saying all commercial software is well - designed , nor that all free software is poorly - designed — what I ’m saying is that software that does provide a well - designed , intuitive interface tends to be closed and commercial .
The bigger the software , the more likely this is to be true .
The most obvious explanation is that the open source model does not work well for producing software with good usability .
Everything in Raymond ’s article hints at this truth .
( Not to mention MPT ’s aforementioned essay , which addresses this directly . )
Good user interfaces result from long , hard work , by talented developers and designers .
The distributed , collaborative nature of open source software works for developer - level software , but works against user - level software .
Imagine a motion picture produced like a large open source project .
Different scenes written and directed by different people , spread across the world .
Editing decisions forged by group consensus on mailing lists .
The result would be unfocused , incoherent , and unenjoyable .
Movies are collaborative art , but require strong direction .
So it is with end user software .
One exception is the Mozilla project , which has released two very well - designed web browsers , Camino and Firefox .
But Mozilla ’s long development was in large part fueled by full - time Netscape engineers .
And look at how well that ’s worked out for Netscape .
Talented programmers who work long full - time hours crafting software need to be paid .
That means selling software .
Remember the old open source magic formula — that one could make money giving away software by selling “ services and support ” ?
That has n’t happened — in terms of producing well - designed end user software — and it ’s no wonder why .
In Raymond ’s own words , the goal is :
software that works so well , and is so discoverable to even novice users , that they do n’t have to read documentation or spend time and mental effort to learn about it .
It ’s pretty hard to sell “ services and support ” for software that fits that bill .
The model that actually works is selling the software itself .
This is politically distasteful to open source zealots , but it ’s true — and it explains the poor state of usability in open source software .
Raymond also complains about CUPS ’s shoddy and inaccurate documentation , but that ’s just another side of the same glove .
Technical documentation is also hard work , and requires talent to be done well .
Writers need paychecks , too .
( Trust me . )
Mac and Windows vs. Linux
Raymond is quite complimentary to Mac software in these articles — he holds it up as an example for Linux developers to emulate .
But he fails to acknowledge that most Mac software — such as the System Prefs panel you use to connect to a shared printer — is closed source , and produced by full - time professional engineers .
He also fails to acknowledge another uncomfortable truth : Unix nerds who care about usability are switching to Mac OS X in droves .
In fact , most of them have already switched .
This trend is n’t necessarily a market share bonanza for Apple — all the “ Unix nerds who care about usability ” in the world amount to only a fraction of a percent of the general population .
But it ’s a trend that bodes poorly for usable desktop Linux software .
Most of the talented developers still using desktop Linux are either cheapskates or free - software political zealots .
This is n’t to say desktop Linux is n’t growing in use .
It is , and will continue to .
But it ’s growing at the bottom end of the market — cheap $ 400 computers from Wal - Mart .
That ’s a market where software usability is not a key feature .
Raymond ’s stance toward Windows , however , is childish .
E.g. , he writes :
If the designers were half - smart about UI issues ( like , say , Windows programers [ sic ] ) they ’d probe the local network neighborhood and omit the impossible entries .
If they were really smart ( like , say , Mac programmers ) they ’d leave the impossible choices in but gray them out , signifying that if your system were configured a bit differently you really could print on a Windows machine , assuming you were unfortunate enough to own one .
I question how “ unfortunate ” one would be , at least in this situation , given that it ’s easy to configure a shared printer with Windows XP .
In fact , even dear old A.T. might actually have a chance to make this work , if she were given the head start Raymond himself had at the beginning of his adventure ( i.e. , with the network already set up , and the printer already connected to and shared from the other PC ) .
This sort of task - driven interface is Windows ’s forte .
Those step - by - step “ wizards ” are generally irritating for advanced users who want to do something the wizard does n’t quite support , but for basic tasks — like , say , connecting to a shared printer across the room — they work .
And they make these tasks approachable for dear old A.T .
And they ’re the result of a lot of work by a lot of well - paid full - time Microsoft engineers .
It ’s common for the Linux hacker set to poke fun at Windows ’s wizard - style configuration tools , but the entire desktop Linux user interface is a pale imitation of Windows — much , much more of a rip - off of Windows than Windows ever was of the Mac .
But the resemblance is merely cosmetic ; functionally , desktop Linux is nowhere near as usable as Windows .
There ’s an old engineering adage : “ Fast , good , cheap : pick two . ”
( Where “ fast ” regards development time , not performance . )
Desktop Linux software is cheap ( free ) and fast ( release early , release often ) , but it ’s not good .
Or , perhaps one could argue that it is cheap , and eventually it ’s going to be good , but it ’s getting there very slowly .
Windows and Mac OS , on the other hand , are fast and good .
For the sake of this discussion , it does n’t matter which is better and which is improving faster .
What matters is that neither is cheap .
It ’s very difficult to beat the fast / good / cheap rule .
For example , look at how much Mac OS X has improved in the last three years alone .
Even if desktop Linux is improving — and I do think it is — it ’s improving at a much slower pace than Mac OS X .
It ’s easy to ridicule the estimated 2006 - or - 2007 ship date for Longhorn , the next major release of Windows .
But do you doubt for a moment that Longhorn will provide more improvements from Windows XP than desktop Linux will gain during the same period ?
More often than not , you get what you pay for .
Just recently , we hired a new systems administrator named Mark .
He lives in Virginia .
That ’s six hours off the GMT .
One less than the current five guys in Chicago .
Two less than Jamis in Idaho .
So what ?
He was the best of the candidates available , we ’d be crazy not to pick him up , no ?
Well , apparently there are still plenty of “ crazy ” companies and hiring managers out there .
People unwilling to pick the better candidate because of geography .
Jonathan gives us just one example in his an Open Letter to Job Board Advertisers .
So I thought this would be a good occasion to get the excuses out there :
Why are you not hiring remote workers ?
s science fiction writer Neal Stephenson wrote , " In the beginning was the command line . "
Before the web and graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) , computer operators used the lowly command line to control their computers .
As antiquated as the command line is , you can still find it in any major , modern operating system .
The DOS shell survived intact within early versions of Windows , and its descendant , the Command Prompt , exists in even the latest versions of Windows .
And the venerable Unix shells live on in GNU / Linux and other Unix variants , including Mac OSX .
This article describes how to implement a command line in a browser using JavaScript , which has a certain irony .
Browsers use graphics heavily and JavaScript exists primarily to activate those graphics , yet the JavaScript technique in this article actually strips away the graphics to get at the unadorned command line .
You can use the command line described in this article in many ways .
It can be a , quick shortcut on your homepage , enabling a web search with just a few keystrokes .
Or , it can be a part of a larger system , allowing access to features that do n't have a graphical interfaceor at least , do n't have one yet .
The browser command line also is extensible ; you can easily define your own commands .
Also , because it 's written in JavaScript , you do n't have to compile or link ; you can just hit reload and run your new command .
Personally , I like the browser command line because moving my hand from the keyboard to the mouse and back again takes more too much time .
Trying It Out
First , let 's take a look at the command line ( see Figure 1 ) .
If you want to try it out yourself with source code , simply unpack the code download and direct your browser to the " index.html " file .
This will , in turn , load " bcl.js " , which contains the implementation of the command line .
You can also extract the form HTML from " index.html " and add it to your own web page .
Just make sure that the < script > tag ( which loads " bcl.js " ) is loading it from the correct directory .
Figure 1 . The Browser Command Line
One of the example commands is g , which does a Google search .
Figure 2 shows using the command g command line for the phrase " command line . "
Figure 2 . Doing a Google Search
When you press Return , the command line sends you to Google , searching for " command line " .
Figure 3 shows the results .
Figure 3 . The Resulting Search
You can also go directly to image search , using the command line g i command line .
Yet another command is al , which simply calls the JavaScript alert ( ) function .
This is n't very useful , but it shows what the command line can do .
Now , take a look inside the code to see how it works .
Diagram of car showing clutch location .
See more transmission images
If you drive a manual transmission car , you may be surprised to find out that it has more than one clutch .
And it turns out that folks with automatic transmission cars have clutches , too .
In fact , there are clutches in many things you probably see or use every day :
Many cordless drills have a clutch , chain saws have a centrifugal clutch and even some yo - yos have a clutch .
In this article , you 'll learn why you need a clutch , how the clutch in your car works and find out some interesting , and perhaps surprising , places where clutches can be found .

Clutches are useful in devices that have two rotating shafts .
In these devices , one of the shafts is typically driven by a motor or pulley , and the other shaft drives another device .
In a drill , for instance , one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck .
The clutch connects the two shafts so that they can either be locked together and spin at the same speed , or be decoupled and spin at different speeds .
In a car , you need a clutch because the engine spins all the time , but the car 's wheels do not .
In order for­ a car to stop without killing the engine , the wheels need to be disconnected from the engine somehow .
The clutch allows us to smoothly engage a spinning engine to a non-spinning transmission by controlling the slippage between them .
To understand how a clutch works , it helps to know a little bit about friction , which is a measure of how hard it is to slide one object over another .
Friction is caused by the peaks and valleys that are part of every surface -- even very smooth surfaces still have microscopic peaks and valleys .
The larger these peaks and valleys are , the harder it is to slide the object .
You can learn more about friction in How Brakes Work .
A clutch works because of friction between a clutch plate and a flywheel .
We 'll look at how these parts work together in the next section .

Usable Interface Design
As an information designer the interfaces we currently work on — no matter whether Apple or Windows — bother me .
Yes , OS X looks a lot better than its predecessors , and Windows ’ upcoming rip off of OS X looks better than the previous rip off .
But however pretty , glossy and likable those Interfaces may look , no matter how many twist and turn effects they build in — the problem they have is not one of special effects .
If a good interface were a matter of special effects , George Lucas ’ Industrial Light and Magic might do a very good job .
The Problem is the Metaphor
The problem is the metaphor they are built on .
The basic metaphor they are built on is static :
The typewriter .
We still have folders and tabs , and the frame of our windows still defines the way we deal with data .
Aqua : Write on Water ?
Operating system nomenclature ads to the confusion by using confusing names like Windows and Aqua .
Why , if not for design reasons , should the basic metaphor of a GUI be water ?
What can you read on water ?
Well , data flows , you might say .
And Aqua refers to the way my data changes its shape when I work on it .
Nonsense .
Aqua is just a cool name for a cool graphic design approach .
Vista : Write on Glass ?
Now Microsoft will introduce glass as the basic material for their windows .
Sounds actually pretty consistent ( windows – vista = viev – glass ) , as long as you forget what a window really is .
Can you write on glass ?
Is it easy to read on glass ?
Windows are actually Frames
Frame is a better , far more precise word for what has been introduced to us as a window on a screen .
It ’s frames , not windows we are dealing with until now .
Of course it ’s too late for that kind of reasoning .
And it is as hypothetical to say that the more appropriate name for the Windows OS is actually Frames .
By making glass frames , Microsoft does n’t really make things easier .
In the future 90 % of the computer population will be writing on windows that they can twist but not open up .
Windows ?
Why do ( es ) Windows not Open Up ?
A window as such is not just a frame .
It is something that opens up .
I miss this function — opening up — within Windows since the very start .
Windows should open up , you should be able to zoom into a computer window like you “ zoom ” into a real window , when you open it up to look outside .
Get Rid of the Frames
Transparent frames ?
Why not get rid of the frames in the first place .
It ’s the frames that make it hard to deal with data .
Where is my window ?
Is it below , is it on top ?
Is it in the bar down there ?
Did I close it ?
Making windows transparent does n’t solve the problem , it only makes it more shiny .
Data should always be “ open ” , always be there , and always be at the same place , and it should be zoomable .
Better Metaphor : Flying
A much better metaphor for data display is flying .
We should not need waste our time by aiming and clicking on window frames all the time , dragging them , minimizing them , maximizing them and now turning them around .
We should be able to zoom in and out of our frameless documents as we wish .
Zooming in just as with a camera or as an eagle when he zooms in on the rabbit down there running on the ground .
Everybody would understand that concept right away .
Instead of pushing and clicking a mouse we should be working with birds .
We should be flying not flowing through our data .
No More Folders
We do n’t need folders either .
A better search will do just fine .
Google demonstrated that it works .
Apple is on the way to make it work as well .
Windows is working on a better desktop search and hopefully it works .
Get Rid of the Heavy Coloring
The graphics of the user interface should stay in the background .
A user interface should be as neutral as possible , leaving the spectacular colors to the contents .
No More Data Loss
Basically every manipulation of data should be saved right away .
There is no reason why we cannot go back in the history of a document as far as we wish .
Our hard drives are big enough , or machines are fast enough to deal with that .
Also , all data should automatically be backuped on the net .
No More Monster Programs
We do n’t need no programs .
What we need are tools to work a document .
Why do I need so many programs to work on text and graphics ?
What I need is Word ’s text manipulation , Photoshop ’s pixel manipulation , Illustrator ’s vector functionality , Dreamweaver ’s simultaneous HTML translation .
I should be able to use them whenever I like in whatever document I like .
So instead of buying huge programs of which I only need a small set of functions I should be able to buy ( or even better : rent ) functions , filters , specific tools to manipulate my data — without opening programs that limit the use of my data .
No More Long Starting Up
There is no technical need for computers to start up , except for one :
If they crash .
Computers should by default go to sleep when turned off , and , when turned on , wake up right away .
As a professional you have probably stopped shutting down your computer a long time ago , but regular users still actually loose a lot of time by starting up .
So why are Computers not Flying ?
Information design is all about reduction .
Reduction not in the sense of limitation but in the sense of simplicity .
It is not about limiting functionality , but limiting sources of confusion .
So if it is mostly about reduction , why are computers not working like that already ?
Also , most of these ideas are not new or hard to understand or particularly original .
They are simple .
In practice , simplicity is harder to achieve than complexity .
But as technology usually develops from simplicity to the complexity and back to simplicity , we might be optimistic that one day we will have computers that allow us to fly through our data .
Hopefully that happens before we fly in cars .

What does Salmon do in this position — for example , on matters of climate change research , assessment , and communication ?
The position of Associate Under Secretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy is immediately under that of Raymond L. Orbach , Undersecretary for Science .
Orbach is the first holder of this position , which was established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , and was sworn in on June 1 .
Jeffrey Salmon is also identified as Chief of Staff for the DOE Office of Science The Office of Science manages a set of very large interdisciplinary research programs and 10 national laboratories .
According to the Marshall Institute web site : “ From 1991 - 2001 Dr. Jeffrey T. Salmon was the Executive Director of the George C. Marshall Institute .
Previously he was senior speechwriter to Secretaries of Defense Dick Cheney and Caspar Weinberger and Senior Fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University . ”
Is this another example , as described in a recent four - part series in the Washington Post , of how the Vice President has populated federal agency policy positions with his own loyalists ?
The four - part series on the role of the Vice President — “ Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency ” — published by the Washington Post , June 24 - 27 , 2007 , has this in part one :
As constitutional understudy , with no direct authority in the executive branch , Cheney has often worked through surrogates .
Many of them owed their jobs to him .
While lawyers fought over the 2000 Florida ballot recount , with the presidential election in the balance , Cheney was already populating a prospective Bush administration … .
Close allies found positions as chief and deputy chief of the Office of Management and Budget , deputy national security adviser , undersecretary of state , and assistant or deputy assistant secretary in numerous Cabinet departments .
The DOE web site provides a biographical sheet with the credentials of Under Secretary for Science Orbach .
In contrast , it appears to provide no information about Associate Under Secretary and Office of Science Chief of Staff Salmon .
Why ?
What are Salmon ’s credentials for overseeing a multi-billion - dollar national research enterprise ?
Whose idea was it to give him jurisdiction over DOE climate science research ?

Scientists Confront Renewed Backlash on Global Warming By WILLIAM K. STEVENS
As the Clinton Administration prepares to announce in the next few weeks a plan for controlling waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere , conservatives and industry groups have mounted a renewed assault on the idea that global warming is a serious and possibly catastrophic threat .
In a drum roll of criticism over the last few months they have characterized the thesis of global warming as a “ flash in the pan , ” “ hysteria , ” “ scare talk ” and a ploy by socialists to justify controls on the economy … .
In recent months , a number of newspapers , including The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal , have published articles debunking global warming .
In the July issue of Commentary , Jeffrey Salmon , executive director of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington , stated categorically that there is “ no solid scientific evidence to support the theory that the earth is warming because of man-made greenhouse gases . ” …

April 1998 : Oil and Gas Industry Representatives Draft Plan to Discredit Prevailing Opinion on Global Warming
The Global Climate Science Team drafts a memo outlining a plan to invest millions of dollars in an effort to undermine support for the Kyoto Protocol and discredit the scientific consensus opinion that greenhouse gases are causing the planet to warm .
The draft plan , titled “ Global Climate Science Communications Action Plan , ” concedes that opposition to the protocol is not shared by the public .
“ There has been little , if any , public resistance or pressure applied to Congress to reject the treaty , except by those ‘ inside the Beltway ’ with vested interests , ” it notes .
A key component of the plan would be to “ maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours on Congress , the media , and other key audiences . ”
To do this , they would “ recruit a cadre of scientists who share the industry ’s views of climate science and to train them in public relations so they can help convince journalists , politicians and the public that the risk of global warming is too uncertain to justify controls on greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap the sun ’s heat near Earth , ” the New York Times reports .
They would look to recruit scientists “ who do not have a long history of visibility and / or participation in the climate change debate , ” the memo says .
According to the plan , “ Victory will be achieved when … recognition of uncertainty becomes part of the ‘ conventional wisdom . ’”
One method the institute would employ to measure the plan ’s progress would be to count the number of news reports that express uncertainty about the issue of global warming .
People involved in devising the strategy included Jeffrey Salmon of the George C. Marshall Institute ; Steven Milloy , who later becomes a FoxNews.com columnist ; David Rothbard of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow , which has received $ 252,000 from ExxonMobil ; Myron Ebell of Frontiers of Freedom , also funded with money ( $ 612,000 ) from the oil giant ; and ExxonMobil lobbyist Randy Randol .
Representatives of the Exxon Corporation , the Chevron Corporation , and the Southern Company , were also involved .

Also in 1998 , Salmon provided this example in the spirit of the plan — attempting to manufacture an exaggerated sense of uncertainty about climate change by drawing selectively on a few favored scientists , instead of using the well - vetted climate science assessments authored by the leading scientists , and elevating the few “ skeptic ” scientists out of all proportion to the marginal and even discredited standing of their views within the larger scientific community :
Greenhouse Fears vs. Science
Data show the issue is far from ‘ settled ’
By Jeffrey Salmon
Published by : The Heartland Institute
April 1998
The Clinton administration contends that the science of global warming is “ settled , ” and dangerous climate change from carbon dioxide produced by burning coal and oil is no longer a theory but a “ fact . ”
Yet the administration continues to spend a great deal of time arguing about the science of global warming .
From a major scientific roundtable on climate change last summer , to Congressional staff briefings , to a series of regional meetings on greenhouse warming run by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , the administration is making an all - out effort to convince the country that , according to President Clinton , “ if we do n’t cut our emissions of greenhouse gases , we will disrupt the global climate . “ 
The Washington , DC - based George C. Marshall Institute has put those claims under a microscope , performing a detailed analysis of “ The Truth About Ten Leading Myths , ” a document issued by Dr. Michael MacCracken .
MacCracken heads the Office of the United States Global Change Research Program ( USGCRP ) , the government agency charged with tracking and funding global warming science .
The Marshall Institute analysis was performed by Drs. Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon , both widely published scientists .
Their report relies exclusively on peer - reviewed scientific literature for its conclusions .
Baliunas and Soon conclude that this literature , as well as the report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which represents the so - called “ scientific consensus , ” clearly show global warming fears are exaggerated .
According to Baliunas and Soon , if the science of global warming is “ settled ” at all , it is settled against the administration ’s policy and against the recently negotiated Kyoto agreement .
Baliunas and Soon report that the USGCRP document bases much of its argument for man-made climate change on the reliability of computer projections of the Earth ’s climate .
Sea level rise , melting glaciers , fewer frosts to kill off disease carriers , and a drier Great Plains , are among the misfortunes alleged by the computer models to be a result of greenhouse warming .
But the scientific literature is replete with warnings about taking such computer projections seriously … .
First , note Baliunas and Soon , to contend that “ the climate is changing ” is little more than fear - mongering .
Since when has the climate not changed ?
Climate change is neither good nor bad ; it is simply a fact … .
The administration contends that the scientific facts prove man-made warming is a global threat .
Science supposedly forms the basis of the Kyoto agreement on climate change .
But a look beyond the rhetoric to the scientific literature itself makes it clear that greenhouse anxiety has no scientific foundation .
And this :
Nineteen reasons to stop worrying about global warming
By Jeffrey Salmon
Published by : The Heartland Institute
April 2000 The Washington Post ran a story recently with this howler of a headline : “ Global Warming is ‘ Real , ’ Report Finds . ”
The Post could just as easily have gone with the blockbuster revelation “ Earth Revolves Around Sun , Report Finds ” and it would have been as newsworthy ….
And this :
Marshall Institute Study Challenges “ Flawed ” Global Warming Assessment
Copyright 2000 U.S. Newswire , Inc
November 1 , 2000 The U.S. National Assessment of climate change wo n’t provide policymakers or the public with useful information because it relies on computer climate models that are incapable of making accurate regional predictions of global warming , according to a study released today by the George C. Marshall Institute .
The study ’s author , Dr. David Legates , who is Associate Professor of Climatology in the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware , noted that “ these models , which are intended to describe climate only on a very large scale , are currently used by the National Assessment to describe possible scenarios of regional climate change in the U.S. ” …
Shortly before leaving the Marshall Institute and being tapped for a position in the Bush - Cheney administration , Salmon propagandized against both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts ( a major federally - supported study by an eminent panel that has been used and praised in reports issued by the National Academy of Sciences ) , and called on the incoming administration to deal with the global warming issue in the context of Vice President Cheney ’s development of the administration ’s energy policy :
Time for a Real National Assessment of Climate Change
By Jeffrey Salmon
Marshall Institute
February 15 , 2001
As the year 2000 ended , the outgoing Clinton Administration released the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Change Variability and Change for the Nation , a document clearly intended to generate increased fears of global warming and promote policies restricting the use of fossil fuels .
To help citizens and policymakers appraise the validity of the Assessment , the Marshall Institute asked Professor David Legates of the University of Delaware , a noted climate - modeler , to prepare a thorough , scholarly analysis of the computer models on which the government conclusions are based … .
Let us hope that with a new Administration , Washington will use its resources more wisely .
The Bush White House is already taking steps toward more effective energy policy under the direction of Vice President Cheney .
The politically sensitive issue of global warming must also be confronted .
One useful step would be a three - or four - month moratorium on U.S. participation in international climate change negotiations .
During that time , the White House could assemble a high - level task force of scientists , economists , and policy specialists to review the entire issue of human - caused global warming and put it into the context of national energy policy .
Another useful step , one now being contemplated here at the Marshall Institute , would be to call together a panel of experts to review the UN ’s science report [ i.e. , the IPCC Third Assessment Report ] on global warming and to provide its own report on the policy implications of the current state of knowledge on climate .
As it now stands , the UN ’s thousand - plus pages of science is condensed to a 10 - page Policymakers Summary by a small team of highly motivated political actors .
The results are more spin than science .
An alternative is needed ….
That piece could serve as a nice segue for Salmon to transition into the Bush - Cheney global warming and energy policy operation .
From 2006 to 2012 , thousands of people from across the world lit numbers on The Darfur Wall , donating over $ 100,000 to aid organizations .
The Wall has stopped taking donations , but it stands in gratitude of those who donated and in memory of the Darfuri people who lost their lives .
IN praise of the opaque green liqueur beloved by his creative contemporaries , Oscar Wilde once posed the rhetorical question , “ What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset ? ”
The prosaic answer , at least for Americans , has long been one of legality : sunsets can be freely enjoyed , but absinthe was forbidden because it contained thujone , a potentially toxic compound .
Intrepid drinkers have worked around the ban by ordering imported bottles off the Internet or smuggling them back from Eastern Europe .
Now they have a third , less dodgy option : Lucid , which is being marketed as the first legal , genuine American absinthe in nearly a century .
Lucid is the debut product from Viridian Spirits of Manhasset , N.Y. , founded in early 2006 .
According to Jared Gurfein , Viridian ’s president , the company ’s first order of business was to contact Ted Breaux , a chemist known for his detailed analyses of vintage absinthes .
Iraq is over .
Iraq has not yet begun .
Two conclusions from the American debate about Iraq , which dominates the media in the US to the exclusion of almost any other foreign story .
Iraq is over insofar as the American public has decided that most US troops should leave .
In a Gallup poll earlier this month , 71 % favoured " removing all US troops from Iraq by April 1 of next year , except for a limited number that would be involved in counter - terrorism efforts " .
CNN 's veteran political analyst Bill Schneider observes that in the latter years of the Vietnam war , the American public 's basic attitude could be summarised as " either win or get out " .
He argues that it 's the same with Iraq .
Despite George Bush 's increasingly desperate pleas , most Americans have now concluded that the US is not winning .
So get out .
Since this is a democracy , their elected representatives are following where the people lead .
Whatever the result of the latest round of Congressional position play - which included an all - night marathon on the floor of the Senate from Tuesday to Wednesday this week as Democrats attempted to outface a Republican filibuster - no one in Washington doubts that this is the way the wind blows .
Publicly , there 's still a sharp split along party lines , but leading Republicans are already breaking ranks to float their own phased troop reduction plans , together with proposals for partitioning Iraq between Sunni , Shia and Kurds .
Bush says he 's determined to give the commanding general in Iraq , David Petraeus , exactly the troop levels he asks for when he reports back this September , and the White House may hold the line for now against a Democrat - controlled Congress .
Leading Republican contenders for the presidency are still talking tough .
However , the most outspoken protagonist of hanging in there to win in Iraq , John McCain , has seen his campaign nosedive .
Even if the next president is a hardline Republican , all the current Washington betting will be confounded if he does not , at the very least , rapidly reduce the number of US troops in Iraq .
After all , that 's what the American people plainly say they want - and so , incidentally , did 72 % of American troops serving in Iraq , according to a Zogby survey conducted early last year .
In fact , the boys themselves said they wanted to come home in the course of 2006 .
The American people 's verdict is remarkably sharp on other aspects of the Iraq debacle .
Asked who they blamed most for the present situation in Iraq , 40 % of those polled for Newsweek said the White House , and another 13 % said Congress .
In a poll for CNN , 54 % said the US 's action in Iraq was not morally justified .
In one conducted for CBS , 51 % endorsed the assessment - shared by most of the experts - that American involvement in Iraq is creating more terrorists hostile to the US rather than reducing their number .
If once Americans were blind , they now can see .
For all its plenitude of faith , this is a reality - based nation .
So Iraq is over .
But Iraq has not yet begun .
Not yet begun in terms of the consequences for Iraq itself , the Middle East , the US 's own foreign policy and its reputation in the world .
The most probable consequence of rapid US withdrawal from Iraq in its present condition is a further bloodbath , with even larger refugee flows and the effective dismemberment of the country .
Already some 2 million Iraqis have fled across the borders and more than 2 million are internally displaced .
Now a pained and painstaking study from the Brookings Institution argues that what its authors call " soft partition " , involving the peaceful , voluntary transfer of an estimated 2 to 5 million Iraqis into distinct Kurdish , Sunni and Shia regions , under close US military supervision , would be the lesser evil .
The lesser evil , that is , assuming that all goes according to plan and that the American public is prepared to allow the troops to stay in sufficient numbers to accomplish that thankless job - two implausible assumptions .
A greater evil is more likely .
In an article for the web magazine Open Democracy , the Middle East specialist Fred Halliday spells out some regional consequences .
Beside the effective destruction of the Iraqi state , these include the revitalising of militant Islamism and enhancement of the international appeal of the al - Qaida brand ; the eruption for the first time in modern history of internecine war between Sunni and Shia - " a trend that reverberates in other states of mixed confessional composition " ; the alienation of most sectors of Turkish politics from the west , and the stimulation of authoritarian nationalism there ; the strengthening of a nuclear - hungry Iran ; and a new regional rivalry , pitting the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies , including Syria , Hizbullah and Hamas , against Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan .
For the US itself , the world is now , as a result of the Iraq war , a more dangerous and hostile place .
At the end of 2002 , what is sometimes tagged al - Qaida Central in Afghanistan had been virtually destroyed and there was no al - Qaida in Iraq .
In 2007 , there is an al - Qaida in Iraq ; parts of the old al - Qaida are creeping back into Afghanistan ; and there are al - Qaida emulator groupuscules spawning elsewhere , notably in Europe .
Osama bin Laden 's plan was to get the US to overreact and over - reach itself .
With the invasion of Iraq , President Bush fell slap - bang into that trap .
The US government 's own latest national intelligence estimate , released earlier this week , suggests that al - Qaida in Iraq is now among the most significant threats to the security of the American homeland .
Americans have probably not yet fully woken up to the appalling fact that , after a long period in which the first motto of their military was " no more Vietnams " , they face another Vietnam .
There are many important differences , of course , but the basic result is similar .
The mightiest military in the world fails to achieve its strategic goals and is , in the end , politically defeated by an economically and technologically inferior adversary .
Even if there are no scenes of helicopters evacuating Americans from a flat roof of the US embassy in Baghdad , there will surely be totemic photographic images of national humiliation as the US struggles to extract its troops and all the heavy equipment it has poured into the country , perhaps this time an image snapped on a mobile phone and posted on the internet .
Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo have done terrible damage to America 's reputation for being humane ; this defeat will convince more people around the world that it is not even all that powerful .
And Bin Laden , still alive , will claim another victory over the death - fearing weaklings of the west .
In history , the most important consequences are often the unintended ones .
We do not yet know the longer term unintended consequences of Iraq .
Maybe there is a silver lining hidden somewhere in this cloud .
But so far as the human eye can see , the likely consequences of Iraq range from the bad to the catastrophic .
Looking back over a quarter - century of writing about international affairs , I can not recall a more comprehensive and avoidable man-made disaster .

Note : some aspects of this concerning interest rates were written in 2003 and 2004 , when interest rates were very different .
The principles remain the same .
The principles still apply .
Updated 11/29/2016 reflective of what I have learned in the last decade or so .
New material is in bold
Even before I had some minor success with a couple of startups , I had moved from just below the poverty line to reasonable comfort , with a house , a year 's expenses in savings , and no debt ( other than a house mortgage ) .
I 've learned a few things , some in classes , some in the college of hard knocks .
I 've also had a little help along the way from relatives , some of it purely one - sided , and some of it mutually beneficial .
I would like to pass on this information to those of you who are just getting started in life .
( Some of this advice will be valuable to those of you who are n't just getting started in life , too . )
The most valuable three hours I think I have ever spent was at a free financial planning class in Irvine in 1985 .
It was , quite literally , free .
Yes , they were trying to sell us on paying for a more comprehensive class , but what I learned in those three hours , in retrospect , was worth $ 10,000 to me .
What I learned there was freely given , and I give it to you freely as well .
Running a Budget Surplus Consistently
“ My other piece of advice , Copperfield , ” said Mr. Micawber , “ you know .
Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six , result happiness .
Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery . "
[ Charles Dickens , David Copperfield , ch. 12 ]
To translate it into modern terms : " Take home $ 40,000 a year , and spend $ 39,500 , result happiness .
Take home $ 40,000 a year , and spend $ 40,500 , result misery . "
Obviously , the greater the difference - - either way -- the more rapidly you will see the result .
At one time , I commuted 25 miles each way to work .
Because only part of the costs of commuting are visible on a daily or weekly basis , I did n't realize that I was spending more than I was earning .
When the invisible part of the commuting costs would show up , in a brake job , tune - up , or tires , it was always a crisis -- and of course , charging those bills just led to the next crisis -- interest on credit cards ( to be discussed later ) .
You must figure out what you are actually spending .
You will not find this out by adding up your bills for a month .
There are too many big bills that only come up every few months ( tune - up , brake job , paying for that vacation you just took ) .
Proper budgeting means going through your check register for many months .
It also means having a realistic picture of what you are buying in cash .
My experience is that most people , especially most people without kids , are absolutely shocked by how much they spend in cash eating out each month .
Start saving the receipts , even if it 's just a Big Mac , fries , and a Coke - - add them up at the end of the month .
Are you increasing your credit card debt every month ?
That increase in debt -- the amount that your balance increases in month -- is part of your monthly expenditures .
Do n't tell yourself , " This was a one - time expense - - it wo n't happen again . "
There are very , very few such expenses .
Cars : The Monkey On Your Budget Back
For most people , there is one additional expense that is hard to measure , and that 's car repairs and maintenance .
The cents per mile figure that the federal government allows for tax purposes really does n't do the job adequately .
The major marginal maintenance expenses of operating a car are usually gasoline , tires , brakes , oil changes , and tune - ups .
You know ( or should know ) roughly what sort of gas mileage you get : 20 miles per gallon is 1/20 gallons per mile .
Multiply by the price of gas , then multiply by the number of miles a month that you drive .
Find your last tire purchase receipt , divide the total price tag by the number of miles you get on that set of tires ( e.g. , $ 300 for four tires , they lasted 30,000 miles , that 's $.01 per mile ) .
Ditto for brakes , oil changes , and tune - ups .
Do n't worry if you do n't have the exact amount , or the exact number of miles -- it will be close enough .
Insurance and registration fees are primarily determined by the number of months that you have the car - - not the number of miles you drive .
Some auto insurers will determine rates by your daily commute , and for what purpose you use the car -- but this usually does n't make a big difference in the total bill .
Treat auto insurance as a monthly expense , and do n't try to factor it into your mileage costs .
Depreciation is often the biggest chunk of the expense of driving a car , but unless you buy new cars and then sell them every three or four years , this is not likely to be a significant part of your annual budget -- and you do have the advantage that you do n't suffer the depreciation until you actually sell the car .
This is n't really a regular expense for you .
Here 's a tip : buy cars that are still under factory warranty , but are 1 - 2 years old .
In 2002 I bought a 2000 Corvette with 23,000 miles on it for $ 33,500 .
Brand new , it cost about $ 48,000 .
The first buyer thus spent 63 cents a mile JUST ON DEPRECIATION !
I would have to drive the car another 60,000 miles to knock another $ 14,500 off its value .
I eventually sold it with 107,000 miles for $ 8500 .
The one uncertainty is repairs .
While piling up debt by buying a new car is usually a mistake , there are circumstances where it can make sense .
What do you get with a new car ( or , in most cases , a slightly used car ) ?
The remainder of the factory new car warranty .
Relatively new cars are also eligible for extended warranties .
If your car with 90,000 miles on it has already demanded a transmission rebuild , a valve job , and a new master cylinder -- and you have no idea what it will need next -- it might make sense to buy a new , cheap , sensible car .
You will have a regular monthly car payment , but you can budget around that , in a way that you can't budget around the next repair that your heap needs ( or that the mechanic claims that it needs ) .
" Yeah , your Johnson rods are shot , your muffler bearings need to be repacked , and it 's time to rotate the air in your tires . "
Okay , enough with the car digression .
You must find out where you are spending your money , and either reduce spending , or increase income .
More about that in the next installment .
While you are waiting , however , remember this : an extra dollar earned , because of federal , state , and Social Security taxes , is typically $ 0.55 to $ 0.65 more in your pocket .
A dollar reduction in spending , however is $ 1 towards solving your budget problem .
Dealing With the Budget Problem
So , now you know what your budget is .
You are either spending more than you make , or spending less than you make .
If you are spending more than you make -- well , you are pretty typical of a lot of people in America .
Been there , done that , got the financial scars to show for it .
There are three choices : cut spending , increase income , or borrow the difference .
( Well , there is the counterfeiting option , but that has its own set of problems -- I would strongly discourage it . )
Too many Americans take " borrow the difference " as their solution , increasing their credit card debt every month .
Some think that they are being clever by opening an equity line of credit to borrow the money at a lower interest rate .
Well , it 's more clever than paying 18 % on your credit card bill , but that 's like calling yourself educated , compared to an illiterate .
There are circumstances where borrowing against your home equity can make sense -- but not to pay for meals out , an oil change for your car , groceries , or your annual vacation to Hawaii .
As I mentioned previously , it is usually better to cut spending , rather than trying to increase income .
Increasing your income means that 1/3 to 1 / 2 of your gain goes to taxes , as part of the government 's campaign to make sure that no new rich people happen ; reducing spending does n't enrich the government .
There 's a place for both actions , however , and we 'll cover both of them .
Cutting Spending
" What 's this for ? "
" That 's the dog 's psychiatrist . "
" Why does your dog need a psychiatrist ? "
" If we leave him in the house , he pees on the carpet .
If we leave him outside , he barks and the neighbors get upset . "
" You 're about to go into bankruptcy .
Get rid of the dog ! "
Learn to distinguish " need " from " want . "
Shelter , food , transportation to work and school are needs .
Vacation , pets , fancy cars , entertainment equipment , a health club , and yes , dog psychiatrists , are wants .
In some cases , you will discover that you signed up for low easy payments for the next decade to pay for one of your " wants . "
It may be the case that getting out of that bill is n't going to save you much money at all .
Just stop adding to your woes , however , until you get your finances straightened out .
Even in the category of needs , however , look carefully at what you are buying .
Most Americans are carrying too much weight .
This suggests that while food is a " need , " for most Americans , their eating is a mix of " need " and " want . "
Most prepared foods are expensive compared to buying staples .
Yes , pizza tastes better than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich .
But you will soon discover that eating when you are hungry ( as opposed to satisfying your desire to enjoy a wonderfully tasty meal ) will save you a pile of money each month .
Restaurants : ditto .
If it 's really necessary to eat out , hit the fast food places until your financial woes are resolved -- and then go for the smallest and cheapest item that will fill you up .
It 's amazing how many adults are still eating like they did as teenagers .
My son is 15 , and like most teenaged boys , he can go through a truly astonishing quantity of food , and still be thin as a rail .
I was like that .... long , long ago in a galaxy far , far away .
At 15 , Supersizing the Big Mac Value Meal may be necessary to keep from eating the upholstery in the car ; at 25 , it 's just wasting money , and contributing to long - term weight and health problems .
If you doubt this , let me introduce you to the myocardical infarction ( technical term for a heart attack ) I had at 57 , followed by a stroke after they cleaned the plaque out of the clogged artery .
Housing : if you are renting , ask yourself if you would get any benefit from moving to a less expensive place .
You should at least look at this possibility , but most of the time , unless you are childless , or are living in an extravagantly expensive place , this really is n't a big win .
Look carefully at what you will spend on renting a truck , paying for pizza for your friends to help you move -- it may take a long time to save enough on rent to justify it .
At least , when I lived in Irvine , I did the math , and concluded a move would take me 13 months to pay for itself -- and we ended up being relocated to San Jose by my employer before that point was reached .
There 's one other big category of spending reduction , but that 's in the segment on interest and credit , so you 'll have to wait on this .
Increasing Income
" Why , I would be overjoyed to give you a 10 % raise !
Anything for my loyal employees ! "
Okay , back to reality .
The best that you can hope for is that your income will rise faster than your expenses .
Yes , maybe working a little harder will impress the boss , but that 's not one of the more likely strategies to increasing your income .
When I was living in Irvine , and confronting financial reality , I was rather stuck .
My wife had just had our first baby , and there was no realistic way for her to make enough money to pay a babysitter , and still come out with any net increase in income .
( Not that either of us was keen on that anyway . )
I went out and found a moonlighting job taking inventories in stores .
This was a job that started at 9:00 PM and ended typically about midnight .
After working all day long , this was a grueling experience .
The pay was n't much - - $ 7 an hour -- but any increase in income without a corresponding increase in spending is a win .
Fortunately , another , better moonlighting opportunity came along a few weeks later , doing software development for $ 20 an hour .
I did this for about five months , and the extra money provided the downpayment we needed for our first house .
Make sure that whatever moonlighting job you get does n't involve driving an extra 200 miles a week to bring in $ 50 net taxes .
That will be a lot of work for little or no net gain .
Also make sure that you do n't impair your effectiveness at your day job .
It is better to work harder and get a better than average raise .
The Magic Secrets of Personal Finance
There is a magic secret that enables you get in deep financial trouble very quickly -- and get out almost as quickly .
This is one of those items that is blindingly obvious -- and yet most people do n't ever think about , until you tell them .
Let 's say that you are a typical American .
You spend $ 4000 a month ; you bring home $ 4000 a month ; you have a few hundred in savings , and $ 10,000 in credit card debt .
You never get ahead financially , but at least you are n't sinking .
Then , one day , you need to replace the engine on your car -- and now , to keep your monthly minimums on your credit cards , you now are spending $ 4100 a month .
As Mr. Micawber would tell you , " result misery . "
You are now getting further behind every month -- and in a few months , even if nothing else goes wrong , you are now spending $ 4150 or $ 4200 a month .
Soon , you are beginning to watch those ads from bankruptcy lawyers .
Magic Secret # 1
Once you have wiped out MasterCard A , it 's time to tackle the next one -- and here 's the magic trick .
Take the $ 400 a month that were spending on paying down MasterCard A -- and now apply it to the other credit card with a $ 5000 balance .
You were already putting out $ 200 a month on that credit card bill , so it will shrink away a lot faster than MasterCard A .
This requires a lot of self - discipline -- to stop spending money on things that you do n't truly need -- and using the money that you have freed up from debt service to pay down other debts as quickly as possible -- instead of celebrating .
" Whee !
I 've got $ 400 a month freed up -- I can trade in my Toyota on a Lexus ! "
Magic Secret # 2
At the time , my sister Susan was getting 9 % yield on her money market funds .
She was looking for a better return , and I was looking for a lower interest rate .
Voila !
She loaned me the money at 14.5 % APR .
She was now getting a better return on her money ; my minimum monthly payment dropped .
But instead of paying it back to my sister over the same four year repayment term as my credit card , I doubled up the payments , and paid it off in two years .
Susan was richer ; I was less in debt .
What you need to make this work : a relative , or a close friend , who trusts you enough to loan you money unsecured .
You need to offer them an interest rate that is attractive , relative to what they are getting in their incredibly boring and safe money market funds or CDs .
However , the gap is still huge .
My money market fund is paying me about 1.1 % yield right now ; my one year CDs are about 2.2 % .
Interest rates on credit cards are still absurd -- 12 % - 18 % .
Look around -- you may find an older relative who has the money to refinance your debt -- especially if you can make a strong case to them that this will improve your long - term financial picture , that you are going to aggressively pay down your debts -- and that you are n't going to flake on them .
( I 've lent significant chunks of money to friends and relatives three times ; once to pay for an engine repair -- almost none of it was paid back ; once to my brother - in - law , so he would n't lose his mobile home , almost none of it was paid back ; once to help some people at church consolidate their debts -- most of it was paid back . )
By the way , this strategy really only makes sense for unsecured debt .
Car loans are typically financed at rates low enough that this sort of private refinancing is n't going to be a huge win .
I think that there may be some liability issues in some states as well on being the lienholder on a car .
It 's tempting to use this strategy for putting together the down payment on your first house .
The problem is that increasingly , lenders wo n't allow it -- the money has to be a gift , not a loan .
My mother was willing to loan us the money for our first house , and did so , but fortunately , by the time we were ready to plunk down the cash , the strategy above had cleaned up our debts to the point where we were able to pay her back , and do the down entirely on our own .
What To Do When You Get Down To Just Rent and Car Payments
Okay , you have cleaned up your finances enough that all you have is your rent and car payments .
What now ?
Should you cut your credit cards up ?
No .
You just need to be careful what you pay for with your credit cards .
I am at a point now where almost everything that I purchase , other than groceries , I put on my Discover Card .
It 's convenient ( much quicker than writing a check ) , and I get 2 % of my total purchases back from Discover .
Should you do this ?
Hmmm .
Maybe not -- at least until you are sure that you are n't going to return to the bad practices of the past .
What Credit Cards Are Good For
They are a relatively low cost way to amortize larger purchases over a 1 - 3 month period , especially if writing a check would deplete your savings account .
These should be purchases that are necessary , unusual , and that you do n't expect to repeat during the time that you are paying for that purchase .
Good examples : tires ; brake job .
Bad examples : groceries ; meals out ; books .
Yes , the interest rate is high , but if you have something that you truly need , use the credit card to finance it over a short period of time .
Yes , 18 % APR over three months will be about 4.5 % that you are paying for that purchase .
If you can pay cash or check , all the better .
But if paying by cash or check means that you have $ 28 left in savings , it might be better to pay the interest , and keep your savings account a little healthier to cushion any surprises that come along .
Some people , unfortunately , can't handle a credit card .
If you find yourself ( or worse , your spouse ) charging stuff like groceries , or confusing " want " with " need , " it might be best for the credit cards to go into a drawer , and stay there until a legitimate need for them arises .
If you really have no self - control , give up the card -- but remember that if you have screwed up badly in the past , getting a new credit card might be a lot harder now than it was before .
Building Up A Savings Account
1 . They provide a cushion against unexpected financial disasters .
2 . They gather interest ( pitiful as interest rates are right now , it 's better than 0 % ) .
3 . They are a staging area to bigger forms of wealth -- like houses .
It used to be a widely spouted rule that you should have six months living expenses in savings .
There 's certainly some merit to this idea , but this rule seems like it was designed for the era before unemployment insurance , and there was only one person in a family bringing home a paycheck .
Today , if you get laid off , unemployment insurance will help a bit .
If you are a two paycheck family ( as is , unfortunately , now the norm ) , if one of you loses his or her job , the disaster wo n't be quite as sudden as it traditionally was for the one paycheck family .
I would encourage , however , the idea that you should strive for having at least a couple of months expenses saved up before you start looking at the next step : buying a home .
Buying a Home
But if you are likely to live in the same area for the next several years , and especially if your household income exceeds $ 60,000 a year , it almost certainly does make sense to buy a house .
The reasons are :
1. Equity .
2. Appreciation .
3. Lowered income taxes .
Equity is obvious .
If you pay $ 900 a month in rent , that 's all money that is down the tubes .
If you pay $ 1100 a month for a mortgage , most of that is interest , but some of it is payment on the loan principal .
You will , after a few years , own some equity in your home .
More importantly than the equity you gain from paying down the loan , however , is that real estate usually appreciates .
It does n't always appreciate - - a friend of mine likes to tell of how his family managed to lose money because they bought a house in Malibu , California , and sold it a few years later .
People who buy houses during California 's periodic panic buying frenzies can find themselves regretting it two or three years later .
In some areas of the country , appreciation is quite slow - - or even negative .
A figure that is often quoted for the Boise , Idaho area where I live is 1 % - 3 % a year .
Where I lived in California , however , it was often a bit higher than that .
We bought a house in San Jose in 1985 for $ 115,950 , and sold it in 1987 for $ 125,000 ( 3.9 % per year ) .
We bought a house in Rohnert Park for $ 116,000 in 1987 , and sold it for $ 160,000 in 1995 ( 4.7 % per year ) .
We bought a house for $ 244,000 in 1995 , and sold it for $ 429,000 in 2002 ( 10.8 % per year ) .
None of these are spectacular results for California real estate , but they are all a giant improvement over renting .
Another advantage of buying over renting -- you have a pretty good idea what the mortgage is going to be .
If you get a fixed mortgage , you know exactly what your payment will be for the next 30 years .
Even with most adjustable mortgages , you know the maximum payment for the next several years .
This cannot always be said for rent !
I 'm not going to try and go into all the nuances of buying houses -- there 's far more than I can ever tell you , and I wo n't claim to any great expertise in this area -- but I will tell you these items that I have learned over the years :
1. Adjustable mortgages are really , really scary .
Why , if interest rates went up 5 points , your house payment could be $ 1400 a month !
However -- if interest rates went up that high -- and stayed up that high for very long -- the whole economy would collapse .
Lunatics sometimes get in charge of the asylum in Washington , but they do n't hold it indefinitely .
In addition , most people refinance their house , or sell , within five years .
Calculate what a fixed mortgage will cost you over the next five years -- and then what an adjustable will cost your over the next five years , even if interest rates went up so fast that you were paying the maximum possible payment .
You 'll often find that the fixed mortgage is n't going to be dramatically cheaper .
The more realistic scenario - - interest rates go up , but not radically -- and the adjustable will usually be a bit cheaper .
( Be careful , however , about the difference between the " teaser " rate that is in effect for the first six months , and the actual rate you will pay for the following year , three years , or five years . )
2 . Do n't buy a house primarily for the appreciation .
There are too many people who spent too much time watching programs about how to become rich in real estate who ended up in bankruptcy .
Buy a house because you need a place to live , and you want to pay yourself part of that monthly payment , not a landlord , and reduce your income taxes .
3 . Do n't buy the biggest house you can afford .
At best , you may find yourself living on beans and peanut butter for the next several years .
At worst , you may find yourself out of the house , with a foreclosure black mark on your credit history .
You will discover unexpected surprises when you move in .
Remember : you are responsible for the repairs -- there 's no landlord to call up and have fix the clogged toilet , or the leaky faucet .
Buy the smallest house that you can afford that meets your needs -- even if it is only for a few years .
Our first house was 887 square feet , 3 bedroom , 1 bath .
It was cramped , but it was brand new , and it was adequate for my wife and our rambunctious toddler .
4. Condos and townhouses may be an adequate substitute for a real house in crowded big cities .
They are generally harder to sell than real houses .
With condos and townhouses , there are usually homeowners association fees that you have to pay as well -- and these can be surprisingly steep .
That 's just money down the drain .
5 . In spite of the hype from people selling timeshare condos , this is not a substitute for a house .
Buy the house first .
If you want a timeshare condo on the Kona coast ( I visited a nice one there when we were vacationing there last year -- but we did n't buy ) , wait until you have bought the house first .
6 . If you want a snazzy car -- buy the house first .
Four or five years after you buy your house , your income will have risen so much faster than your house payment that you will be able to buy the snazzy car without pain .
Trust me on this .
I spent too much money on new cars when I started working at 18 , and not enough saving for the house .
Update for 2018 Tax Year
The 2017 tax law changes increased the standard deduction for a married couple to $ 24,000 .
Unless you have a huge mortgage or are making charitable contributions in the $ 20,000 a year range , the standard deduction is a better deal than itemized deductions so you might as well pay off the mortgage .
My wife and I did so in January of 2019 .
The credit union mortgage officer admitted this was unusual , except we were the third that day .
I guess the word got out .
The 2017 tax law changes also limits how much property tax you may deduct as well .
You may no longer deduct more than $ 10,000 in state , local , and property taxes .
If you live in one of the coastal states , and have a high income and expensive house , this means that you get less benefit from the property tax deduction than before .
It also allows you to deduct interest on only the first $ 750,000 of a mortgage .
This is why the Democrats so strongly opposed Trump 's tax law change -- their donors were hurt .
Dealing With Money Conflict In Marriage
When I first started mulling this series over , I did n't even think about this topic : financial struggles with your spouse .
I received enough emails suggesting that I deal with it -- because they were dealing with it .
I 'm going to keep this short and simple , because this is only partly a financial planning problem ; it is mostly a problem of your relationship with your spouse .
Almost any advice I can give about how to handle financial disputes with your spouse is going to be wrong for some of you .
The Spendthrift Spouse
There are a lot of causes of this tendency .
In the case of this particular guy , the problem was probably two factors combined : he came out of a physically abusive home with an alcoholic father ; he had been sexually abused by a Scoutmaster as a child .
Children growing up in alcoholic homes often have trouble with the notion of causality -- that action A results in result B -- and that this is likely to be a repeatable phenomenon .
Why ?
Because in homes where alcohol is a major influence on people 's behavior , there is no causality .
The mother or father who is sweet and concerned one evening may be a violent , raging monster the next .
You can't predict the future because the past makes no sense .
You 've got an extra $ 200 this month ?
Quick , spend it !
It may disappear over night !
The sexual abuse had also left some very serious scars on this guy .
In some respects , he had never grown up .
Again , this is no surprise .
I know several dozen child sexual abuse survivors ( remember , I 'm from California ) , and all of them , to one degree or another , are still exhibiting signs of that damage .
Difficulties with emotional maturity seem to be common .
Of course , not every spendthrift has deep and dark secrets driving them .
Some people just do n't like to exercise the self - discipline that says , " I do n't really need this . "
Others become convinced that they are never going to have anything anyway , so why bother to save ?
( I speak from experience on both counts . )
Persuading a spendthrift spouse to rein in their unnecessary spending is a very , very hard thing to do .
If there are some deep dark secrets driving this behavior , professional counselling may be in order -- but I would n't make that assumption , especially in a society that encourages spending and materialism as a way to achieve happiness .
It almost never does provide happiness ; at most , your latest purchase is a short - term distraction -- and then you feel the need to spend again .
A friend of mine calls it " retail therapy . "
Retaliatory Purchasing
In the especially brutal form , this is done surreptiously .
If you have good credit , this can escalate to a point where a financial crisis makes bankruptcy look like a good idea .
Most of the time , it 's a bit more restrained than that , and just leads to increasing resentment .
Sometimes , neither party sees their complicity in this .
" Everything I buy is reasonable and necessary ; she 's the spendthrift ! "
Sometimes , this spending frenzy is the result of an agreement : " I want new furniture for the living room ; you can go buy that milling machine you want . "
This is an improvement over the retaliatory purchasing approach , but something you need to think about when you get to a point of negotiating extravagant purchases with your spouse : would I rather have new living room furniture this year , or would I rather be wealthy in five or ten years ?
The choice is yours .
Divorce : A Really Effective Way to Prevent Wealth
The only longitudinal studies that I have seen about the effects of divorce on the kids suggest that you are going to be putting out money to help them through their feeling of abandonment and responsibility for the divorce .
I 've also personally seen a lot of these damaged kids .
Divorce : it 's a luxury that you can really only afford when you get really , really rich .
I 've watched ( from a painfully close distance ) dozens of marriages break up .
I 've only seen a couple where the divorce was really necessary ( spousal or child abuse ; repeated infidelity ) .
Quite a number of these divorces can be laid at the feet of a materialism that says , " We gotta have all those toys that everyone else has ! "
The result : husband and wife both working their tails off , coming home exhausted , then Mom cooks dinner , helps the kids with their homework , and does the laundry .
By the time Dad and Mom crawl into bed , he 's ready ; she 's just ready to go to sleep .
Eventually , Dad meets a woman who is n't too tired for sex , or Mom meets some guy who listens to her complaints sympathetically .
Shortly thereafter , Mom tells Dad to move out .
Here 's the hardest question I am going to ask in this entire series : how important are those toys you want to buy ?
Is it worth you and your spouse being so exhausted that you have to make a weekend getaway to make love ?
You are both working too hard .
As our kids were growing up , my wife stayed home and raised our kids .
She was there doing the housework , dealing with plumbers , taking the kids to doctors and dentists , sitting on hold with insurance companies .
I was able to devote my full energies to my job .
Are you surprised that our marriage held together , and most others did not ?
A lot of people misunderstand how much extra they are gaining from having both parents working full - time .
If Mom is working full - time , grossing $ 3,000 extra per month , on top of Dad's $ 3,500 a month , how much extra do they actually get to keep ?
Perhaps $ 3,000 extra a month .
Out of this , you have the commuting costs , day care costs ( if the kids are still small ) , extra money on clothes ( if Mom has to get dressed up for her work ) , the cost of lunches out -- and then , because both of you are exhausted at the end of the day , a lot more dinners out , or pizzas delivered .
Yes , there is actually a net gain from Mom working -- but once you figure in those other costs , you may be astonished at how little it turns out to be .
Your personal equation is going to be dependent on what you do for a living .
If your paycheck is $ 5,000 per month , even after paying those bills , the job will contribute significantly to your wealth -- but there are a lot of Moms out there whose gross income is more like $ 1,500 a month , probably netting , after taxes , commuting , and day care expenses , closer to $ 600 a month .
You should consider whether you can cut expenses instead .
Can you operate with one car instead of two , if one of you is n't working ?
For a number of years , my wife and I had one car .
I walked or took the bus to work most days ; sometimes she would drop me at work and pick me up .
( Obviously , this only works if your job is close to home . )
Now , it 's true that a stay - at - home Mom ( or Dad - - your choice ) is n't a guarantee of a successful marriage , and there is certainly a price to pay in reduced income .
But from what I have seen , the model of two full - time working parents while the kids are small leads to divorce far more often .
Retirement Plans
I am reluctant to get too specific about the sequence to follow on this , because everyone has slightly different situations .
If you are single , or you and your spouse are n't planning to have kids anytime soon , buying a house may not make sense immediately .
If you have a low income -- and are therefore in a low marginal tax bracket -- it may not make sense to buy a house either .
What I intend to do is show you the sequence that my wife and I followed , as modified by what I have since learned .
401(k ) Plans
Of course , you do n't just put in $ 100 once ; you put $ 100 in every month .
If you start early enough at this , it turns into a huge pile of money .
Start at age 22 .
Put $ 100 a month into your 401 ( k ) .
If your 401 ( k ) averages 8 % return ( which is not a terribly high return , when you consider the last 60 years ) , it will have $ 299,470 and some change when you retire at age 60 .
I cannot emphasize too strongly how important it is to get started early .
This is one of the few cases where time is on your side .
Instead of starting at 22 , what happens if you start contributing at age 32 ?
When you retire at age 60 , instead of $ 299,470 , you have $ 126,621 -- or less than half the amount .
But in what sort of mutual funds should you invest your 401 ( k ) money ?
The traditional model says that a young person should invest in the most aggressive stock growth mutual funds ( which exchange high risk for high yield ) .
As you reach your 40s , you start to move the money into more conservative stock funds .
As you approach retirement , say , in your 50s , you move most of the money into bond funds ( which have disappointing returns , and lower risk ) , and then , when you are ready to retire , any additional money going into your 401 ( k ) should be in money market funds ( almost no return , but no real risk ) .
There 's a lot to be said for this model -- and I kick myself that when I first start contributing to a 401 ( k ) in the mid-1980s , I put everything into bond funds .
I was so scared that the money might evaporate away .
Even into the early 1990s , I was still far too heavily weighted towards bond funds and conservative stock funds .
If I had followed the traditional advice on this , I would have benefited from the most amazing stock market boom in history -- the 1990s bubble -- and I would probably have another $ 200 K - $ 400 K in my 401 ( k ) account than I have now .
However : there is something to be said for being cautious , especially when you are living in " interesting times . "
( There is supposedly an old Chinese curse , " May you live in interesting times . " )
A lot of people saw their 401 ( k ) funds drop quite impressively in value since May of 2000 , as the stock market bubble deflated with all the charm and grace of a tire running over a nailstrip .
I think it is likely that over the next two to three years , all of this will be a painful memory ( for most Americans ) .
Those who cashed out their 401 ( k ) , or who had to retire , or moved 401 ( k ) money from stock funds to bond funds -- they are never going to forget this experience -- and not in a positive way .
DO NOT PANIC IN A BEAR MARKET !
This not only wipes out the advantages of the bull market that you just enjoyed , but you , along with millions of other nervous nellies , cause the market to sink even faster , because you are trying to sell when others are doing likewise .
The time to buy is when others are losing their heads in panic ; the time to sell is when others insist that the market can only go up .
( Thanks , Abby Cohen , the stock analyst who was talking about Dow 20,000 just before the 2000 crash , and persuaded me to stay in the stock market .
Yes , that " thanks " is sarcasm . )
I was about 15 years away ( I have since retired ) from the magic age where I expected to start using some of that 401 ( k ) money , so I had been allocating my new contributions to medium - term bond funds -- funds that invest in corporate and governmental bonds that will come due roughly when I will start to draw down on that money -- and very conservative stock growth funds ( the kind that emphasize stocks that pay a regular dividend ) .
I generally leave money that is already in existing funds in place , hoping that the managers of those funds are smart enough to make sensible decisions with the money .
I still think that people in their 20s should be investing primarily in stock growth funds -- but I would emphasize growth funds that buy stocks in blue chip companies -- the kind that pay dividends ; not the funds that invest in companies that have never made any money , but that everyone knows are going to be worth a lot one of these days .
Yeah , those days of high tech companies losing piles of money while their stock rises 800 % a year will come again -- but it seems like a pretty risky thing to put much money into .
This is n't play money ; you are going to need this to pay for your health insurance in 30 years .
I emphasized " hoping that the managers of those funds know what they are doing " a couple of paragraphs ago .
This is one of the reasons why I think it is best to have the money in your 401 ( k ) plan distributed among several different plans .
I do n't think it is likely that any of these mutual funds is going to make the headlines when the fund manager cashes out everyone 's money and moves to Brazil .
Mutual funds tend to have lots of checks and balances to prevent that sort of thing .
But it is not unknown for mutual fund managers to make very , very poor decisions -- and it would be nice if only 10 % of your 401 ( k ) money ended up disappointing you , instead of 100 % of it .
You may not have access to a 401 ( k ) fund at your employer .
There are Individual Retirement Accounts available to you .
I do n't know enough about them to tell you much , however .
( Well I could , but I might well mislead you , and I would rather not do that . )
Indecent Behavior With Your 401( k )
Some people get especially screwed on this because they take the money out when their job evaporates , live on it for a few months , and forget about the tax problem .
Come the following April , they are scurrying around looking for $ 10,000 to pay to IRS and their state income tax agency .
Another really amazing behavior that I will mention , because I 've heard of people doing this : a guy leaves a job he has held for 15 years to go to work for a startup .
He takes a huge wad of money out of his 401 ( k ) plan because he is convinced the startup is going to make him rich .
He buys himself a very fancy car ( so he does n't have to wait for the startup to be successful ) .
The startup makes him a very disappointing amount of money ( if it does n't just go down the tubes , like my last startup did ) .
Whoops !
There went $ 65,000 on a fancy car -- and it 's not going to be available for his retirement in another 20 years .
Dumb , dumb , dumb .
Understanding Bonds
Bonds , stocks , mutual funds , money market accounts -- what are all those things ?
Today we will start to cover bonds .
Until you have $ 20 K - $ 40 K sitting around with nothing to do , I would not encourage you to buy bonds of any sort .
But : you need to understand bonds in order to understand bond mutual funds .
We 'll get to mutual funds in a later segment ; you need to understand bonds and stocks first , because most mutual funds are built on top of bonds and stocks .
Bonds are enough of a struggle to get through that I 'll take two segments to get through them , followed by stocks , then by mutual funds .
A bond is a loan to a government or corporation for a certain period of time at a certain interest rate .
As an example , I had some 30 year Treasury bonds that are due November 15 , 2016 .
When the U.S. government first sold these bonds in 1986 , they sold for $ 1000 each .
( That 's also known as the par value or face value . )
The U.S. government promises ( cross their heart and hope to die ) to pay 7.5 % ( or the coupon rate ) of the par value as a dividend every year .
This dividend is actually paid in two halves -- one half on the anniversary date , November 15 , and the other half on May 15 ( six months later ) .
When the bonds are due , on November 15 , 2016 , they will make the final dividend payment , and the par value of the bond .
Now , this is n't like a marriage ; you can sell a bond before maturity .
( Okay , maybe it is like a marriage . )
At any given time , there are people trying to sell bonds , because they want the capital out of them ; there are other people who are buying bonds .
As it happens , I was one of those people that was looking to buy bonds back in 1997 .
My first , very nervous foray into long - term investing , was to buy those Treasury bonds from someone who had bought them when they were first issued .
If bonds were a straightforward loan , this would be simple to understand .
But there 's a little complexity here .
It turns out that interest rates rise and fall -- but the dividend that the government promised when they issued that bond does n't change .
If you think about this for a minute or two , you 'll realize that a bond that pays 7.5 % interest -- and has the full faith and credit of the United States government behind it -- is really , really good today .
If you tried to buy new government bonds today , you would be lucky to get 2 % interest .
So , these older bonds , that pay much higher interest rates , are in high demand .
What happens to the price of a bond that everyone would like to buy ?
The price of the bond goes up .
You must pay above par in order to buy that bond .
The dividend each year will still be 7.5 % of the par value of the bond -- but you now have to pay $ 1300 to buy that $ 1000 bond .
You 'll get $ 75 a year in interest for the next 13 years , but in 2016 , when that bond is redeemed , you will have lost $ 300 .
This goes the other way , too .
If interest rates rise , a bond issued today that pays 4.5 % dividend is going to be unattractive to bond buyers .
Its price will fall .
This leads us to the concept of " yield to maturity " ( YTM ) .
If you buy that $ 1000 par value bond for $ 1300 , but it pays 7.5 % of the par value each year , how much will you make on this bond , including both dividend payments , and the change in value of the bond from now to when it is redeemed ?
This is the annualized YTM -- the yield divided by the numbers of years left .
( Watch carefully - - you will sometimes see YTM listed for a bond that has less than a year left .
This may not be the annualized yield to maturity . )
So , if you want to make money on bonds , you buy when interest rates are high , and sell when interest rates are low , right ?
Well , you can do that .
If you hold a bond for more than one year , the difference between the purchase and sale price is taxed as a long - term capital gain .
Long - term capital gains are subject to a maximum 15 % federal income tax rate -- for most well - paid people ( the only sort who are going to be buying and selling bonds ) , this is a big improvement over the 28 % or 31 % federal income tax rate .
( The states , however , do n't necessarily follow the federal rules on this .
Idaho , for example , taxes capital gains as ordinary income . )
If you have a really good crystal ball , the strategy could be : buy bonds when interest rates are high , and earn high dividends ; sell the bonds when the economy is in recession and interest rates are low ; put that money into savings ; wait for interest rates to go up again , and take the money you earned from the dividends and the capital gain on the bonds , and buy more bonds .
The problem , of course , is that good crystal balls are in short supply .
Had I realized that interest rates were going to be this low , instead of buying 50 of those Treasury bonds , I would have bought 200 of them .
I had the cash available at the time , but I did n't have the guts to do it .
Later , I looked at those 50 Treasury bonds , and I was tempted to sell them while interest rates remained low .
I paid about $ 47 K for them ; I could have sold them for about $ 65 K .
Of course , that would mean paying about $ 4900 in capital gains taxes to the federal and Idaho governments , and giving up that lovely $ 3750 a year in dividend income ....
When I ran the spreadsheet , it told me that I would have to reinvest the money in a 6.6 % YTM bond next year to break even with this strategy -- and I did not expect to see Treasury bonds with yields that good over the next few years .
Generally , the reason to buy bonds is for the dividends .
There are people that make a living buying and selling bonds .
My own calculations suggest that unless you are doing this on a pretty large scale ( millions of dollars in bonds ) , and have somewhere interesting to park the cash when interest rates are low , you are better off buying bonds and holding them to maturity .
There are a couple of interesting exceptions , however , which I will now discuss .
Bond Maturity and Volatility
Some years ago , having watched the stock market sit in the doldrums , I decided to sell off some of my worst performing mutual funds , and move some of my spare cash , into bonds .
But interest rates were low .
Buying bonds with long maturities would have meant low interest rates , and the danger of the prices falling when interest rates start to rise again ( as I expect that they will in 2004 or 2005 ) .
On the other hand , letting this money sit in a money market fund at 1.1 % interest just was n't attractive .
So I bought bonds with relatively short maturities ; some AT&T bonds due in 2007 ; some Capital One Bank bonds due in 2005 ; some Ford Motor Company bonds due in 2007 ; some Verizon bonds due in 2005 .
These were all short enough maturities that if rising interest rates sneaked up on me , I could sell them and buy long - term bonds without much danger that my short - term bonds would fall dramatically in price from what I paid for them last year .
If worst comes to worst , I can just sit on these bonds until they come due .
The Ford bonds and the AT&T bonds , for example , have an annualized yield to maturity exceeding 7 % .
I can live with that !
Bond Creditworthiness , Risk , and Volatility
Down from this are U.S. Government agencies , such as the Government National Mortgage Association , Federal National Mortgage Association , Student Loan Marketing Association , and a bunch of others that I can't even begin to keep track of .
These are commonly referred to by " cute " abbreviations : Ginniemae , Fanniemae , Salliemae .
( Hurricanes used to all be female ; now that seems to be reserved for government credit agencies . )
These do n't have " full faith and credit " behind them , but I get the impression that very , very few bond professionals believe that the U. S. Government would let any of these agencies go down the tubes .
Just to make this confusing : the minimum denomination on these bonds is $ 10,000 .
There are also what are commonly called municipal bonds .
These are , as the name implies , usually issued by cities , but also counties , states , school districts , and all the uncountable government agencies that you do n’t even realize exist until you start reading through these lists of bonds .
Most of these “ municipal ” bonds are backed by some government agency .
Some are incredibly tiny operations that startle you to discover even exist ; others are used by states like California and New York to finance airports and other major projects .
Municipal bonds are n’t like U.S. government bonds in a couple of very interesting ways :
1 . They can default — meaning that you do n’t get your money out .
We ’ll discuss defaults , insurance , and ratings below .
2 . The income from these bonds is ( usually ) exempt from federal income taxation , and from state income taxation for that state .
This means that if you live in California , and you buy San Francisco Airport bonds , the interest is exempt from federal and California state income taxes .
If you buy Oregon bonds , and you live in California , you are only exempt from federal income taxes on the interest .
That ’s still a pretty good deal — but as a consequence , the interest rates are much lower than a U.S. government bond , or a corporate bond .
If you are making $ 100,000 a year , the lower interest rate is probably a reasonable trade - off for the tax exemption ; if you are making $ 40,000 a year , you are better off buying U.S. government or corporate bonds , and paying the income taxes .
Let ’s talk about that matter of bond defaults .
Corporations and government agencies issue gobs of bonds .
If corporations and local governments , like the U.S. government , never went bankrupt … well , there would be a lot of winged pigs overhead as well .
When a corporation or local government goes under , bondholders get paid ( usually ) before stockholders , but after IRS , and employees asking for their back wages .
Fortunately , it ’s not a crap shoot — well , not entirely .
It turns out that there are two private firms that examine the creditworthiness of both local governments and corporations : Standard & Poor ’s , and Moody’s .
They have different ways of rating bonds , and of course , incompatible ways to describing those credit ratings .
I do n't know enough to give you a clear picture of why you should trust one over the other , but essentially , consider these pretty good ways to know whether your bonds are likely to be repaid , and remember that neither firm employs mind readers .
Defaulting Bonds
As a general rule : highly rated ( S&P A and above ) corporations do not default , and even those corporations that start out A do n't work their way down to the lower ratings very quickly .
It can take years for an S&P A - rated corporation to sink to the point where you have to worry about it .
Another rule : S&P Baa rating is considered the bottom of " investment grade " bonds .
Everything below that rating is considered a " junk bond . "
That means that you are earning a lot higher interest rate in exchange for a lot more risk .
Junk bonds have some of the same risk potential of playing the stock market , but seldom the opportunity to get rich .
So , what happens when you buy bonds ?
Keep your eyes wide open .
If you buy corporate bonds that have a long maturity , there is the real possibility that the corporation could get to the point , five years hence , where you might find your bonds are keeping you up at a night , whispering , " Default risk . "
The smartest thing to do , however , is to buy a diversified portfolio of bonds : not all in the same industry , and certainly not all in the same corporation .
This means that if one of your bonds is defaulted , you are n't completely wiped out .
I have n't done the best possible diversification .
( Learn from my mistakes . )
When I first started buying corporate bonds last year , I was so taken by the yield ( exceeding 7 % annualized yield to maturity ) on some Ford bonds due in 2007 , that I bought $ 150 K worth of them .
Subsequent purchases of corporate bonds have been in smaller chunks -- $ 30 K or $ 50 K per bond .
But because I have so much tied up in an automobile industry bond , I am reluctant to buy any GM bonds ( which are usually somewhat lower yields ) .
Ford and GM are n't likely to both go belly up , but let 's say that someone perfects the teleportation disks in Larry Niven 's novels ....
Municipal Bonds
Another problem is that some municipal bonds are actually financing private ventures that some government agency has talked themselves into believing are good for the public .
These private venture municipal bonds have some quirks concerning the tax - free nature of the interest that I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about to discuss -- but I know that they can surprise you at tax time , especially if the dreaded phrase " Alternative Minimum Tax " is part of your tax return .
( Been there , almost done that , avoided it by careful exercising of stock options partly in one year , and partly in the next . )
Stocks
What Are Stocks ?
Stock is partial ownership of a corporation .
If you buy stock in a company , you are either buying it directly from the company , or from someone who bought it from the company , or someone who bought it from someone who bought it from the company .
Regardless of how many steps you are removed from the initial sale of the stock by the company , the net effect is the same : buying stock provides capital that allows the company to build factories , purchase materials to turn into a product , hire engineers to design a product , or one of the thousands of other necessary and sometimes unnecessary things on which companies spend money .
What do you get when you buy stock ?
There are only three rational reasons to buy stocks : dividends , capital appreciation , or control .
You may find that the stock you purchased only gives you one of these three items .
( If it does n't give you any of the three , you probably should n't be buying it . )
Dividends
Capital Appreciation
1. not profitable ;
2. had never made a profit ;
3. did n't see a profit coming anytime soon ;
4. so everyone and his brother bought the stocks , and drove them to truly insane levels .
What 's going on with that ?
If you think a company that sells for $ 20 per share will be selling for $ 40 per share in six months , why do you care that they are n't making any money ?
After all , you 'll double your money in six months !
Okay , but why will the company 's stock double in value in six months ?
Because everyone is buying it with that expectation .
And what happens if , one beautiful morning , enough people get nervous that this can't go on forever , and start selling ?
Hmmm .
No dividends because no profits .
The stock stops rising in value .
I guess I better sell .
So why will anyone buy the stock that you are trying to sell ?
I guess they wo n't , will they ?
And you know why the great bubble of high - tech collapsed in April of 2000 .
Capital Appreciation & Dividends Dance Together
You buy a stock like GM for the combination of dividends and capital appreciation .
The two , of course , are related .
If GM 's profits go up next year , and they raise the dividend , it makes the stock more attractive .
This encourages people to buy GM stock , and drives up the price .
If GM 's profits fall , and they lower the dividend , some stockholders will say , " Why am I holding a stock with a poor dividend -- and a falling stock price ? "
Control
Common vs. Preferred Shares
Preferred shares have one other great advantage over common stock ( something I have learned since I first wrote this ) : they often have a very high yield , and relatively stable stock price .
The stable stock price is because the high yield does n't change much , so they have many of the advantages of a corporate bond .
Preferred stocks are callable like bonds at a specified price and earliest call date .
If you buy a preferred stock above the call price , you might lose money .
Just make sure the earliest call date allows enough dividends to cover the potential drop between purchase price and call price .
I generally buy preferred stocks if they are below call price , with the hope that if called , I will get the dividends in the meantime and a profit on the stock price .
As an example , I recently bought GENERAL ELEC CAP CORP NT 53 GEH : NYSE , a preferred stock with a 4.88 % annualized yield .
Not a spectacular yield but I was trading trading yield for long - term security ; I can't picture General Electric going under .
I bought at $ 24.96 on 11/25/2016 , below its call price of $ 25 per share .
The next possible call is 01/29/18 , so I can be sure of getting some okay dividends over the next year plus two months .
As a high - yield example , I also bought BCS / PRD : NYSEADR , preferred stock of Barclays Bank below the $ 25 call price .
It has been paying over 8 % annually ever since .
Buying Stocks : How To Make Stockbrokers
Rich
Stock brokers make their money on the transaction charge involved in buying and selling stocks .
If you buy a stock at $ 20 a share , and resell it at $ 21 a share , there are two possibilities :
1 . You are selling such a huge number of shares that the broker 's commission is noise .
2 . You are selling such a small number of shares that the broker 's commission is as big as your net profit .
Either way , this is a sobering reminder that if you plan to make money " day - trading " ( as the rapid in and out of stock trading is called ) you need at least one of the following :
1 . A discount broker with very low commissions .
2. Enormously good skill in identifying stocks that are undervalued .
3 . The ability to forsee the future .
4. Enormous guts .
My very first stock trading exercise was when I was 16 years old .
I had become enamored of Interdata Corporation for the reason that only a teenaged computer nerd would : I loved the instruction set of their minicomputers .
So I bought 15 shares at $ 9 a share .
( In my family , this pegged me as an aspiring Alex Keaton - - for those of you who remember the series Family Ties . )
A few months later , Perkin - Elmer Corporation bought Interdata .
During the run-up in Interdata 's stock price , I sold those 15 shares for $ 18.75 per share .
The broker 's commissions were more than my net profit .
I made about $ 60 profit from my incredible foresight ( actually , just dumb luck ) .
In 1993 , I was a pretty active day - trader .
I spent a lot of time plotting the price and volume of DSC stock , day to day .
DSC had acquired my employer , Optilink Corporation , and my Optilink stock options had become DSC stock options , so this was more than an academic exercise .
In addition to my stock options , I was also buying and selling pretty gutsily ( or stupidly ) large blocks of stock : 500 and 1000 share trades , when the stock was in the range $ 40 - $ 65 a share .
Because there were large traders that had computers placing buy and sell trades based on arcane theories of price movement , DSC stock was often engaged in something that looked like a drunken sine wave , with a period of 1.5 to 2.5 days .
I was trying to buy at the bottoms , and sell at the tops , and on average , it worked pretty well .
I was making $ 1000 - $ 1200 per trade ( when it worked ) and losing $ 500 - 800 per trade ( when I guessed wrong ) .
It was , however , very rough on my stomach -- these were huge amounts of money for me back then , and even today , this level of day - trading for someone at my wealth level back then was , in retrospect , insane .
To top it all off , because all of these capital gains were short - term ( measured in hours and days ) , 40 % of the profit was going to taxes .
Why bother ?
Well , along with the stomach - wrenching moments watching the stock rise and fall ( distracting not only myself , but lots of other engineers from what we were supposed to be doing during the day ) , there was an adrenalin rush to it .
If you have read Tom Wolfe 's The Bonfire of the Vanities ( a splendid novel about New York City ) , you may recall the expression that the bond trader describes himself with : " He - Man Master of the Universe . "
( I 've since read that this is actually a very cleaned up version of what real Wall Street sorts call themselves -- but I 'm too polite to use the expression that they use . )
I was at least a " He - Man Master of My Neighborhood . "
It was a heady feeling , and if I was not such a risk - averse person , might have been led into the sort of nonsense that sinks day - traders with more guts than sense .
Should You Buy Stocks ?
If you buy stocks directly , rather than buying a mutual fund that buys stocks , remember :
1 . Any individual stock involves significant risk .
( although preferred stocks involve much less )
Even if the average of the stock market rises , the individual stocks that you buy could plummet very unexpectedly because of dishonesty in accounting that has just been discovered .
The company may make mistakes ( the infamous exploding Pinto gas tanks problem of Ford ) .
They could get stuck with the bill for something that they did n't do , but the courts found them a convenient deep pocket .
Sometimes , stocks fall for no apparent reason , other than a lot of investors simultaneously decide something else is sexier .
2 . If you are buying stocks based on rumors about a new product , the chances are excellent that what you are hearing are the result of a " pump and dump " specialist -- someone who buys a stock , circulates rumors about how well the company is doing , or is about to do , waits for you and the other suckers to drive up the price -- then they dump the stock at the higher price .
Once you ( and the rest of the market ) find out that the rumors were false , the stock has fallen back down again .
I get at least four to five rumor emails a week that are obviously " pump and dump " conmen , trying to provoke a buying panic in some low - priced stock .
3 . You can get around the problem of large stock commissions by buying really large blocks of stock -- but usually , this means that you need to buy a low - priced stock .
A stock that sells for $ 3 a stock means that you can a thousand shares very cheaply .
If the stock goes up a dollar in value , you can sell it , and even after paying the brokerage commission , you can make more than $ 900 .
The problem is that a lot of low - priced stocks are low - priced for a reason .
Our next segment will discuss why it is generally a better idea to buy stocks through mutual funds -- and explain what mutual funds are .
Rebalancing Your Portfolio
Every so often , it is good to examine your portfolio .
In my case , there are a number of stocks that I purchased for their high dividend yield .
Some have risen a bit in value ; others , such as SPH and FTR , have dropped a good bit .
So does it make sense to take my losses and reinvest that money in a mutual fund ?
Curiously , what made those high - dividend stocks so attractive is often even more the case at the lower stock price .
At SPH 's current $ 24.02 price , the annualized dividend yield remains 14.64 % .
FTR now at $ 14.31 still has a 16.72 % yield .
One tragedy of my portfolio , AT , has dropped dramatically because they stopped paying dividends some time back , amid allegations of intentional misrepresentation of their earnings .
The question is whether to shoot this dog and reinvest that money , or hope for the stock price to rise .
Dog shooting is often done at the end of the year , because capital losses offset capital gains ( up to a $ 3000 capital loss for the year ; beyond that point , the loss carries over to subsequent year capital gain calculations ) .
Should You Pay Cash For a Car ?
But even if you do n't have the courage ( or is it insanity ? ) to invest in the stock market -- you may be better off borrowing for a car , and keeping the money in savings .
I recently ( late December of 2008 ) bought a 2005 Jaguar X - type -- and got a spectacular price on it ( less than $ 16,000 , plus title and sales tax ) .
I could have paid cash -- but in November of 2008 , I had put money into some five year Certificates of Deposit with a 4.30 % annual yield .
I ended up with an interest rate of 5.24 % on a five year used car loan .
So even though the interest rate on the car loan is higher than the interest rate on the CD - - I came out ahead taking a loan .
The interest on the CD is taxable , of course , but assuming a 33 % marginal federal and state income rate , over five years I will still earn a net $ 2943.55 in interest income .
The total interest paid over 60 months on the car loan is $ 2458.23 .
( Remember that the interest you pay on a car loan is on the declining principal balance -- while the interest earned on the CD is on the accruing balance of principal and interest . )
Okay , that 's a net gain .
If I had paid cash for the Jaguar , by taking money out of the CD , I would have paid no interest on the car loan -- and I would have put $ 335.97 per month into savings , and gathered interest on that rising balance .
What interest would the $ 335.97 per month payment accrue over those 60 months ?
Remember that the 4.30 % APY CD was because I locked that interest in during November -- and I would not get that interest rate today -- and the way things are going , not likely again for another year or more .
Also , that rate required me to lock it in for five years .
While some of the early car payments could be locked in for five years , and get a roughly similar situation , the vast majority of those payments would be in the second , third , fourth , and fifth years .
Unless I was locking up that money for five years ( which is not a comparable situation ) , I would never get 4.30 % APY -- not even close .
Furthermore , my credit union has a minimum $ 500 balance to get CD rates that high , so at least every other month I would just have the money sitting in a demand deposit account , at a much lower rate .
If I managed to earn 3 % a year on the money that would otherwise be going to car payments ( which seems extremely unlikely , with current interest rates ) , I would only have a net interest income of $ 1029.11 over five years -- and I would be forgoing the $ 2943.55 net interest income that the $ 17,700 would have earned in the CD .
So , if I keep the money in a CD , and make payments : $ 2943.55 CD income - $ 2458.23 car loan interest = $ 485.32 net income .
If I had paid cash , and broken a couple of CDs : $ 1029.11 net interest income ( and that is making the optimistic assumption of 3 % yield ) - $ 2943.55 lost CD income , for a net loss of $ 1914.44 .
Even with a completely unrealistic 6 % yield as I put those " car payments " into savings , this still comes to a net loss of $ 815.99 over five years .
So , what about the supposed rule that you should never make payments , if you can afford to pay cash ?
If there is a big difference in interest rates between CDs and loans , this might be true .
Under some economic conditions , this might be true .
If you do n't have a spectacular credit score ( my FICO number is 819 ) , you may get stuck with such a high interest rate that you would be better off paying cash .
But my guess is that many people that can afford to pay cash for a car probably also have a pretty decent credit score .
( Okay , drug dealers might be the exception . )
More recently , I bought a Jaguar XF and because I was able to get a 2.3 % interest rate on the car loan ( by then my FICO score was 850 ) ; I took it .
Interest rates on CDs were dismal when I bought it but when I later considered liquidating the CDs and paying off the loan , I discovered it made more sense to break the CDs one at a time , put the money in savings , and arrange automatic transfer of the car payments from savings .
Paying off the loan was about $ 2000 more expensive than breaking CDs as needed and making payments .
I am adding the spreadsheet for modeling the X - type loan here .
This should apply to any loan where the interest is not tax deductible .
Houses and student loans require different treatment -- I may work on that as I feel more energetic .
Precious Metal Vampires
Pretty regularly , I get breathless emails about buying gold or silver , because either intentionally or because of gross incompetence , the banksters are going to destroy the world economy , and we are going to be reduced to eating rats to survive .
The ads you see on cable TV ( at least on Fox News ) are a bit more subtle , but still preaching the same message : buy gold or silver now to make big profits and protect your wealth .
This is a a scam .
Let me explain .
Gold and silver are not investments ; there is no return on your gold or silver except for increases in prices , and neither metal reproduces ( unless you have the rare organic gold ) .
At best , gold and silver are inflation hedges .
If there is a 10 % inflation of the money supply , your gold or silver will likely appreciate in value 10 % relative to the dollar .
But you are not going to get more than inflation related gain .
If demand for either metal increases ( say , from $ 1200 to $ 1500 per ounce for gold ) , you may get a net gain of 15 % ( 25 % appreciation minus 10 % inflation ) , but such a growth is only likely if lots of people suddenly start buying gold in such quantities that it increases the inflation - adjusted price .
In practice , war is one of the only certain causes of gold price increases .
Gold prices over time :
There are two big peaks on this chart : one when I bought wedding rings in 1980 ; the other in mid-2011 .
If you bought $ 2100 of gold in 1980 , in 2001 , it would be worth $ 373 , and that is inflation - adjusted .
Similarly , $ 1697 of gold bought in August , 2011 would be worth $ 1216 today ( again inflation - adjusted ) .
Yes , buying at the lows and selling at the highs would be very profitable , but similar investments in stock mutual funds would have given similar results with less risk .
Silver :
In December , 1979 , the Hunt brothers tried to corner the world silver market , driving up prices to $ 102 / ounce and losing $ 750,000,000 in the process as the price plummeted , eventually losing all the billions their father ( an oilman who brought his lunch to work and drove a beat - up pickup ) had left them .
By 2001 , it was back to $ 5.76 / ounce , a historically typical price .
There was a similar run-up and collapse with gold in 2011 .
A personal story : my sister and brother - in - law had a small quantity of silver coins inherited from our Depression - era mother .
They were trying to sell it some months ago when silver was briefly $ 20 / ounce .
Now it is $ 16.84 / ounce .
Some precious metal nuts said to keep it because it had to go up .
Glad they sold it at $ 20 / ounce .
For people with nothing , buying precious metals as a economic collapse idea might make sense , but even then ammunition and guns makes more sense : these have practical value in a Mad Max world .
While gold and silver have very real industrial uses , they are pretty well useless to most people except as a currency .
Ammo and guns are immediately useful to everyone in a post - apocalyptic world .
Buy cheap guns , by the way .
Many years ago , I talked with a guy who came to America from post - war Germany .
In the postwar chaos , he said his wife 's jewelry was more useful than gold bars .
( I was too polite to ask how he obtained gold bars . )
" Have you ever tried to get a haircut with a $ 50 bill ? "
Today , substitute $ 100 or $ 500 bill .
What is driving this gold and silver madness ?
Yes , these are both very pretty metals when polished .
( With silver , plan to polish it regularly . )
Some of this are people with limited understanding of economics and finance .
Some of this is the gold and silver firms , cashing in on fearful people .
If you are dirt poor , gold and silver are highly risky inflation hedges .
If you are obscenely rich , they are bad investments compared to your multimillion dollar survival condo and 100,000 rounds of 9 mm .
If you are middle class , keep putting money in your 401k and maybe buy an extra 1000 round case of 9 mm occasionally .
The sky is unlikely to fall .
Do not reach 65 relying on a piddling Social Security check .
You want half a million minimum in your 401k when you retire .
My wife reminded me of the Twilight Zone episode where the criminals steal an armored car of gold and spend a 100 years in suspended animation waiting for the heat to die down .
When they wake they have to get out of Death Valley on foot .
The last survivor tries to get help by offering a gold bar to some passers - by .
The wife says , " Was n't gold worth something once ? "
The larger issue here is fear .
A lot of people spend their lives in often irrational fear .
Retired
I am now retired .
The heart attack and stroke at 56 disabled me from my occupation of software engineer .
( That part of my brain did not survive very well . )
Not quite the disaster it sounds ; I was planning to retire at 59 1/2 when I could start drawing from my 401( k ) .
Disabled means that I get a Social Security disability check , very near the highest level that they pay .
The $ 200,000 I put into Social Security ( and the matching taxes my employers put in ) over 30 + years could have been better invested by myself , but at least I get something back for it .
I am withdrawing 5 % a year from my 401 ( k ) , and when the time comes that I need it I will do the same from my Schwab account .
Because both accounts will almost certainly grow 8 % - 12 % a year ( still invested in stock mutual funds in the 401 ( k ) and high - dividend stocks in the Schwab account ) , I can later increase the amount I withdraw if I need it , and likely leave a million plus to my wife and thereafter to our kids .
Since I wrote this , my IRA has grown 37 % ( even while taking out 5 % per year ) .
I have since started taking out 6 % per year of my now larger IRA .
I expect to continue increasing the amount ( 6 % of the new higher balance ) every year or so , improving my standard of living .
I still hope to leave a million or more to my kids .
How is my retirement ?
I bought a new 2014 Jaguar XF to go with the 2005 Jaguar X - type .
We have n't put the Jaguars in the same garage , but we are still hoping for kittens . :-)
I get to do what I love ( historical and legal work for NRA and writing books and running my small manufacturing business for telescope accessories .
I have since sold this business to an American living in Poland .
( You can make up to $ 1080 per month net in earned income before it reduces your Social Security disability checks . )
Life is good !
Let 's say your portfolio has been doing well , providing a healthy income while continuing to grow in value , but you need a larger lump of cash for a one - time unusual project ( such as building a workshop / observatory ) .
Do not just take the money distributed across all your mutual funds like you do for your monthly income .
Look for a mutual funds that has underperformed the rest .
When you sell shares from it , the capital gains you will pay taxes on will be less than selling shares in your better performing mutual funds .
At tax time , you will pay much less income tax on the capital gains .
In my case , FLSPX had only grown 62 % over the last six years , so it is the dog .
When it comes time to replace the Jaguar with a Corvette convertible , part of this dog will die .
( I am glad my Springer spaniels do not read my blog . )

Quote of the Day
" Work is the curse of the drinking class . "
~ Oscar Wilde
The idea that Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Diaz will do six months in the brig for committing the brave and even noble deed of leaking the names of all Guantanamo detainees to human rights lawyers is profoundly distressing :
A military jury recommended Friday that a Navy lawyer be discharged and imprisoned for six months for sending a human rights attorney the names of 550 Guantanamo Bay detainees .
... Diaz was convicted Thursday of communicating secret information about Guantanamo Bay detainees that could be used to injure the United States and three other charges of leaking information to an unauthorized person .
... After the first day of his trial Monday , Diaz had told The Dallas Morning News he felt sending the list -- which was inside an unmarked Valentine 's Day card -- was the right decision because of how the detainees were being treated .

WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union today strongly rebuked new legislation offered by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) that would give the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court " optional " review over the National Security Agency ’s controversial program to spy on Americans .
The legislation was announced this morning and was drafted in close consultation with the White House .
The ACLU and other organizations have filed challenges to the legality of the NSA program .
" This Specter - Cheney bill is nothing short of a capitulation by Chairman Specter to the White House , " said Anthony Romero , Executive Director , American Civil Liberties Union .
" The ‘ review ’ contained in the bill is nothing more than a sham .
The president could still choose to ignore the optional court oversight on the program .
This new bill would codify the notion that the president is not bound by the laws passed by Congress or the Constitution .
It would reward his abuse of power . "
" The Senate - and the entire Congress - must provide proper oversight over the executive , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" The law has been broken by the president , and instead of demanding answers , the Specter - Cheney bill would sanction his illegal activity .
We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to stand for the rule of law and reject this proposal . "

The more the state plans , the more difficult planning becomes for the individual .
~ Friedrich Hayek
Progress is precisely that which rules and regulations did not foresee .
~ Ludwig von Mises
Each year in early October my grandfather summoned my entire family to come to his farm and harvest potatoes .
Hunched over on all fours , each person quietly filled their buckets with these “ earth apples . "
Each year he used a different field for his crop .
One year he would plant potatoes , the next year beets or wheat .
The potato replaced the grain diet on the European continent .
It became survival food , especially during the two World Wars .
Dumplings , potato salad and mashed potatoes are only a few potato dishes found in a long list in the European cuisine .
The easy adaptability of the potato to grow almost anywhere in the world can produce an annual crop of 322 million tons of potatoes .
Many African countries greatly benefit from growing the potatoes because they make them more self - sufficient in their food production .
In the age of nation building , stamping out of global warming , and driving for energy self - sufficiency , the new state appointed rival of the potato is maize , which is better known as corn — the yellow cob -born grain used in the production of ethanol fuel .
As a blend with gasoline , biofuel powers automobiles and farm equipment .
Its environmental friendly side effect is to reduce greenhouse gases , and some say it is the key to everlasting energy security in the future .
Ethanol fuel production received its first stimulus after the Arab oil crisis in 1973 .
During 1978 the US federal government sealed the project with the Energy Tax Act authorizing tax exemptions by blending gasoline with 10 percent ethanol .
A floodgate of free money opened up for farmers and ethanol producers as the energy and agricultural departments spent billions of dollars on subsidies .
This year ’s estimates are between $ 5.5 billion to $ 7.3 billion of our tax dollars to be handed out to corn growers .
The incentives for farmers to grow corn in the US is not to meet the needs of a market that entails a healthy profit .
Instead , they plant corn because they get paid to do so by a federal government interested in ethanol production .
And as it turns out , producing ethanol is an expensive process .
Archer Daniels Midland Corporation ( ADM ) out of Illinois , one of the largest producers of ethanol , received as much as $ 10 billion in subsidies between 1980 through 1997 along with favorable tax breaks costing taxpayers an average of $ 30 for every dollar ADM earns in profits .
Add to that the $ 500 of federal and state subsidies it takes to reduce one metric ton of CO2 - equivalent , one can literarily say that it is governments who heat up the globe by burning cash .
This year corn production has already increased by 15 percent over last year .
Even President Bush , not a green lover but excited about ethanol , is expecting that farmers will plant 90.5 millions of acres of corn in 2007 in order to meet the demands of ethanol production of 132 billion liters by 2017 .
Corn prices already went up by 50 percent .
The average price per bushel of $ 1.95 , which had held steady over the past eight years , jumped up to $ 3.05 in January of this year , and is expected to rise as high as $ 3.40 .
Corn is feedstock .
It is consumed not only by humans but also by hogs , chickens and cattle .
The drastic side - effect of higher corn prices is now reflected in the higher prices in the grocery store .
The price of food went up 3.9 percent last year — faster than the inflation rate , which ranges around 2.7 in 2007 .
In particular , pork , beef , milk , eggs and poultry show drastic increases in their prices .
So do fruits and vegetables .
Considering that most people spend an average of 10 percent of their disposable income on food , higher prices in grocery reduces the spending on cars , homes or clothing .
Health Nazis should also be concerned , since these higher prices drive people to cheaper processed foods that add to increased health risks in the poor segment of the population .
The US Federal Government ’s targeted goal is to replace gasoline with corn-based fuel as an alternative energy source .
This has caught the attention of poorer countries .
Mexico , for example , is gradually replacing agave , a spiky - leaved , large plant which grows on high and arid land and takes eight years to reach maturity , with corn .
Agave is the main ingredient for Tequila .
Mexico produced 25 to 35 percent less agave this year and farmers take less care of their agave crop in favor of higher corn prices .
The World Food Program ( WFP ) , which recently stated that it can no longer feed the poor due to the impact of biofuel demand on food prices , is foolishly encouraging African and Latin American countries to take advantage of the rising demand of biofuels by planting corn ; a popular world practice that is now devastating 900 million of the world ’s poorest which rely on the UN feeding program .
It is quite clear that the state - inflated demand for corn is causing a global imbalance in food production .
Farmers are replacing a variety of vegetables and fruits with corn due to the higher profit - per - acre corn brings .
The two - year practice of crop rotation for corn drains the soil and requires more fertilizers on the following soybean crop .
The additional cost ends up with the consumer .
As food prices rise , it is the poor who suffer most from this inflated demand for biofuel .
It is a burden that most people cannot afford as inflation keeps rising because of irresponsible spending and government debt .
The federal budget for the fiscal year beginning this October called for $ 2.9 trillion dollars in government spending .
It includes increases for all the various cabinet - level departments .
Among them were a 5.4 percent increase for the Department of Energy and 3.6 percent increase for Agriculture .
According to Richard M. Ebeling , President of The Freeman , the average US household would have to shell out approximately $ 25,845 in taxes to cover the budget .
Include with it the US federal government ’s pre-existing liabilities of several trillion , and the average US household would have to pay an additional $ 31,000 a year for 75 years to pay off the debt already incurred by government spending .
How can an average income household cover the basic needs such as food , clothing , and shelter when tax burdens already devour the wages of a lower income population ?
Poor people only become poorer as spending continues .
Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ron
Paul seems to be the only congressional member who understands the global effects of subsidies .
During his second presidential debate the question came up about oil profits .
His response was : “ I do n’t think the profits are the issue .
The profits are okay if they ’re legitimately earned in a free market .
What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D ( Research & Development ) money .
I do n’t think that should be that way .
They should take it out of the funds that they earn … ”
Here lies the answer to many of the energy questions .
Let the private sector find a solution to new energy sources .
Already technology advances at a rapid speed and its products remain ultimately competitive on the market where prices drop and become affordable to the average consumer .
Just think of recent changes from VCRs and phonograph records to DVD ’s and CD players , and the addition of cell phones and portable computers to modern life .
All are now available at reasonable prices to low - income households .
Industry continually comes up with new inventions that contribute highly to communication , organization and entertainment .
The only sectors that remain high in cost with outrageous prices are sectors that are under government regulation and control : health care , medicine , education , housing , and now food prices .
It would be a life - saving act of mercy to close these various departments of government , if people want to have a future for the next generation .
The trouble caused on the global market by the federal government ’s sponsored ethanol industry increasingly outweighs the good it does .
The idea of sacrificing food production in the name of biofuel as a future source of energy is an irrational concept .
The consequence of higher food prices due to corn production has n’t come from consumer choice but from government coercion .
If the demand for energy is increasing , and biofuel is the answer , then where will the world grow its food ?
The big believers in a government supported biofuel industry might have to prepare for another big tsunami to hit the shores of Third World countries and at home if this insanity is n’t stopped .
Just do n’t blame capitalism if and when it comes .

First issuing of ' Attorneygate ' subpoenas to White House Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 13 , 2007 Print This Email This
This article has been updated to reflect official releases from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees .
Two former White House officials will face subpoenas for their involvement in the firing of 8 US Attorneys earlier this year .
RAW STORY has confirmed with House Judiciary Committee staff that House investigators will issue a subpoena for Harriet Miers , former White House Counsel , and the Senate will issue a subpoena for Sara Taylor , a former top aide to Karl Rove .
Both committees also sought a variety of documents from the White House .
" Let me be clear : this subpoena is not a request , it is a demand on behalf of the American people for the White House ... to help us answer the questions that remain , " said Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
" The breadcrumbs in this investigation have always led to 1600 Pennsylvania .
This investigation will not end until the White House complies with the demands of this subpoena in a timely and reasonable manner so that we may get to the bottom of this . "
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) also accused the White House of seeking confrontation .
" By refusing to cooperate with congressional committees , the White House continues its pattern of confrontation over cooperation , and those who suffer most in this case are the public and the hard - working people at the Department of Justice , " said Leahy , Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" The White House can not have it both ways -- it cannot stonewall congressional investigations by refusing to provide documents and witnesses , while claiming nothing improper occurred .... Some at the White House may hope to thwart our constitutional oversight efforts by locking the doors and closing the curtains , but we will keep asking until we get to the truth . "
White House responds to subpoenas
In response , spokesman Tony Snow said the White House is " aware of the judiciary committee plans to issue subpoenas and will respond appropriately . "
" The committees can easily obtain the facts they want without confrontation by simply accepting our offer for documents and interviews but it 's clear that Senator Leahy and Representative Conyers are more interested in drama than facts , " Snow added .
In a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee on June 7 , White House Counsel Fred Fielding made it clear that he would not make any White House staff available for on the record , sworn testimony on a voluntary basis .
" We think the Committees ' suggested next steps in this matter must be fairly assessed against the backdrop of the extraordinary access acquired to date and the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing by White House officials , " President Bush 's counsel wrote .
" The President has proposed an accommodation that would provide the Committees with still more information on the US Attorneys matter ...
It is difficult to see how this proposal will not provide your Committees with all the information necessary to evaluate the White House 's connection to the Department 's request for US Attorney resignations . "
He also expressed his " strong hope that the Committees will not feel compelled to elevate the stakes by pursuing the path of subpoenas and compulsory process referred to in your recent letters . "
Senator Leahy slammed Fielding for his reasoning in a response today .
" In response to our efforts to narrow our dispute by gaining access to documents you agreed to produce as part of your offer for off - the - record interviews or to information that forms the basis of the Presidents conclusion that no wrongdoing has occurred , you have merely restated your initial , unacceptable offer , " the Senate Chairman wrote .
" The White House can not have it both ways -- it cannot withhold documents and witnesses and thereby stonewall the investigation and , at the same time , claim that the facts about the White Houses improper influence over federal law enforcement have not been revealed in detail . "
He continued , " The White Houses continued stonewalling leads to the obvious conclusion that the White House is hiding the truth because there is something to hide .
Because the White House has continued its refusal to provide the requested information to the Senate Judiciary Committee on a voluntary basis , I am issuing subpoenas . "
Rep. Conyers also stated that he did not believe the White House 's earlier offer for cooperation was reasonable .
" In view of the compelling need for relevant information , your ' all or nothing ' proposal remains completely unacceptable , as we have previously stated , " he wrote .
" Conducting interviews without a transcript in a matter of this complexity and scope is likely to lead to unnecessary confusion and factual disputes down the road .
It is even more problematic to try to limit the scope of document production and interviews to communications between the White House and outside parties . "
Taylor set to testify before Senate Committee July 11 Sara Taylor , the former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Political Affairs , reported to Karl Rove in the White House .
She has been subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Committee , and is scheduled to testify before it on July 11 .
Taylor reportedly ' cleared out her office ' at the end of May .
E-mails released yesterday depicted her extensive involvement in the firing of at least one US Attorney , Bud Cummins from the Eastern District of Arkansas .
Senator Leahy excoriated Taylor for failing to provide answers to inquiries sent to her in April .
" I received no response from you to my April 11 letter seeking your voluntary cooperation with the Senate Judiciary Committees ongoing investigation of the firings and replacements of a number of United States Attorneys , " he wrote .
" It is now clear from the evidence gathered by the investigating Committees of the Senate and House that , at the time you were White House Director of Political Affairs , you and other White House officials played a significant role in originating , developing , coordinating and implementing the plan and the Justice Departments response to congressional inquiries about it . "
Miers set to testify before House Committee July 12 Harriet Miers has been subpoenaed by House investigators .
She has been asked to testify on July 12 at the House Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law .
Miers , a one - time pick for the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush , served as White House Counsel until January when she stepped down and was replaced by Fred Fielding .
Miers is known to have been extensively involved in the firing of the US Attorneys , with Kyle Sampson , the former chief of staff to the Attorney General , telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that he often discussed the firing of Attorneys with her informally after weekly Judicial Selection Committee meetings at the White House .
RAW STORY 's coverage of the Justice Department 's release of documents Tuesday night , which show Taylor and Mier 's involvement in the firings of the US Attorneys , can be read at this link .

What a great jam , I think I ’ve watched this video over 10 times now .
This video is an experiment to see how rapidly the theremin can be injected into the world ’s collective consciousness .
Speaking of great Theremin music , the wonderful Theremin lounge band Project : Pimento ! will be performing Laughing Squid : Paradise Lost on July 28th .
Oracle sued SAP , alleging employees with the German firm passed themselves off as Oracle customers so they could engage in the wholesale theft of proprietary Oracle support materials .
Over a five - month period starting last September , the employees allegedly gained access to Oracle 's password - protected support site by using the log - in credentials of Oracle customers whose service contracts had , or were about to , expire , according to the complaint ( PDF ) .
Once inside , they made more than 10,000 unauthorized downloads of documents relating to hundreds of different Oracle programs .
Oracle said there are " indications that this number may go significantly higher if traced further back in time . "
" SAP has been engaged in a systematic program of unfair , unlawful , and deceptive business practices that continues to this day , " the complaint claims .
" Through its illegitimate and illegal business practices , SAP has taken Oracle 's Software and Support Materials and apparently used them to insinuate itself into Oracle 's customer base , and to attempt to convert these customers to SAP software applications . "
A SAP spokeswoman did n't return calls seeking comment .
Oracle said the theft originated at Tomorrow Now , a Texas - based SAP subsidiary that provides technical support for titles in Oracle 's PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards product lines .
Although the unauthorized access was made by users purporting to be employees at Honeywell , Merck and other Oracle customers , IP addresses showed the users were connected to SAP 's network .
Oracle first grew suspicious in November , when it started seeing an unusually high number of downloads for materials relating to PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards products .
They quickly spotted anomalies .
For instance , one customer account suddenly downloaded an average of 1,800 items per day over a four - day stretch , compared with normal downloads of about 20 per month .
In many cases , accounts engaged in wholesale downloading of materials that had nothing to do with the products the real customer had licensed , Oracle claimed .
The credentials SAP allegedly used all came from Oracle customers who were , or were closing to becoming , new customers of Tomorrow Now .
Oracle 's complaint did n't explain how SAP employees gained the credentials . ®

Mr ....
I ’m not proud of it ( well maybe just a little ) , but I once created an insane build process once .
If Pat ( who maintained the build after me ) posts in my comments , he ’ll tell you about it .
Take a stew of a proprietary microcomputer flavor of Fortran written in the 70s by a programmer most assuredly clad in polyester , churn it through a Visual Basic 6.0 preprocessor that spits out Fortran 90 code , all the while correcting memory bound issues , mix it together by compiling it with a custom NAnt fortran compiler task , and voila ! , 20 or so compiled Win32 fortran dlls .
At this point , the process compiled and sprinkled in some C# code .
I ’m not sure that build process will ever run on another machine other than the one it runs on .
To create a sane build process , you need a sane development environment .
I ’m sure there are many important principles of a sound build process , but I have just one big one to impart for now .
The build must be location independent !
I ca n’t stress enough how important this principle is .
I should be able to walk into your office ( assuming you ’d let me ) and perform the following steps to get a fully working build on my machine .
Set up my computer
Hook it up to your source control system
Set the working folder to any old directory , say J:\IBetThisFolderIsNotOnYourMachine\NorThisOne
Get latest on a solution and open it up in VS.
NET ( or whichever IDE )
Compile it
If that does n’t work because you have hard coded file paths , then FOO on you !
But let ’s not stop there , I should then be able to run your unit tests ( what ?
You do n’t have unit tests ?
A hex and octal on your code ! ) and they should all pass on my machine ( assuming they pass on any machine ) .
But wait , I ’m not done mucking around your office .
Next , I should be able to head to your build server , copy the folder that serves as the root of your build process ( or better yet , your CruiseControl .
NET root ) to any folder on my machine , and run your NAnt ( or MSBuild ) script , and have the system compile correctly and pass all unit tests .
How do you do it ?
At first , it takes a bit of practice to get to this point .
For example , there should not be a single hard - coded path in your code , nor in your build scripts .
Find every way to get them out of there .
Here ’s a few tips for tricky situations you may run into .
NUnit/MbUnit configuration file
UPDATE : This section was rewritten due to changes in Visual Studio .
NET 2005
In VisualStudio .NET 2005 , you can include an App.config file in the root of any class library project .
Compiling the project will automatically copy and rename the file appropriately ( AssemblyName.dll.config ) into the output directory .
NUnit and MbUnit will use the settings in this file to run the tests .
Make good use of this .
Testing With External Resource Files
Suppose your unit tests rely on some external files for testing ( like an xml or html file to parse ) .
If you store these files with the code , you ca n’t be guaranteed that your unit test will find them when running on a build server ( since the directory structure may be quite different ) .
You also do n’t want to put these files within bin / debug for the reasons mentioned above .
Instead , follow Patrick Cauldwell ’s lead and embed the files as resources .
Now , your unit test can just unpack the file it needs into a known relative location when it runs , achieving location independence .
Limitations
Of course , there are limitations to location independence .
You ’re allowed a few assumptions .
For example , in the scenario above where I stomp into your office and take your source code , you can assume that I ’m running on the same platform you are and have a source control client and IDE installed .
Try to reduce these assumptions as much as possible , but we have to agree on some basic axioms .
I ’m working on a new build process right now , and I hope to make this one a sane one .
Maybe I ’ll post examples later when I get done .
We ’ll see .
NBC Exec : Think Of The Poor Corn Farmers Hurt By Movie Piracy

NBC / Universal 's general counsel Rick Cotton must just be trying to push his anti-piracy comments to absurd levels to see just how much he can get away with .
We 'd already written about his completely unsupportable statements on how law enforcement needs to spend less on traditional crime and focus more on piracy and counterfeiting .
We also covered the highly problematic suggestion he made to the FCC that it force ISPs to monitor their traffic for any unauthorized material ( complete with more bogus stats ) .
However , as more people dig through that FCC filing there are some amazing quotes that really suggest that Cotton and NBC / Universal have no connection to reality with these pleas .
Public Knowledge picks up on NBC 's showy concern for the American farmer
There aresorts of problems with this statement .
As Public Knowledge points out , first off , movie theaters are doing great this year , suggesting the big " threat " of piracy had a lot less to do with its troubles than the fact that it just did n't have that many compelling movies the past few years .
Also , corn farmers are doing quite well ( and people still eat popcorn at home while watching pirated movies ) .
Of course , that does n't really matter .
What 's key here is that if Cotton and NBC actually believe this logic , then they do n't deserve to be in business .
By the very same reasoning , I could say " If all movies were pirated , then everyone would have that additional money they did n't spend on movies to spend on things like fancy dinners .
Restaurants would be more crowded .
Farmers would make more money by being able to sell more profitable food at higher prices . "
See how easy it is ?
It 's also completely bogus , but it 's just as accurate as Cotton 's statement on the corn farmers .
To suggest that the ripple effects do n't ripple in other directions is n't just misleading , it 's dangerously wrong .
Of course , knowing how the entertainment industry works , next thing you know , they 'll be demanding a cut of the profits corn farmers make , since , after all they 're " profiting off the backs of the movie industry " without paying the industry for the benefit .

BBC News , Vanuatu
Britain's Duke of Edinburgh may be planning a quiet birthday celebration at home this weekend , but there will be feasting and flag - waving in an isolated jungle village in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu , where he is worshipped as a god .
The islanders associate Prince Philip with a mountain spirit
The Land Cruiser ground up the rough dirt track , pitching and rolling like a boat .
The trail was so severely eroded that it was more like a river bed , with miniature canyons gouged out by the monsoon rains .
I had been drawn to this poor excuse for a road by a story so unlikely that it sounded barely credible .
It was one I had wanted to investigate for years .
Legend had it that there was a clutch of villages on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu which - as bizarre as it may seem - worshipped Prince Philip as a god .
How and why they had chosen the Duke of Edinburgh , I had no idea .
I fully expected the story to be either false , or wildly exaggerated .
Distant adoration
After an hour 's drive we pulled into a jungle clearing shaded by giant banyan trees .
A short walk led to the village of Yaohnanen , a collection of sagging thatched huts , banana trees and snotty - nosed little kids .
With the help of my driver - cum - interpreter , Lui , I was introduced to the chief of the village .
Jack Naiva was a bright - eyed old man of about 80 , with grey hair and a faded sarong wrapped around his wiry body .
I felt deeply foolish telling him I had come to his village to ask if he worshipped the Queen 's husband .
I wondered if it was all some sort of elaborate joke .
Jack Naiva , chief of the village , has an official portrait of the Prince
They were all official portraits of the Prince .
The first , in black and white , looked like it was taken in the early 1960s .
The second was dated 1980 and showed the Prince holding a traditional pig- killing club - a present from the islanders .
The most recent was from seven years ago .
They had all been sent from London with the discreet permission of Prince Philip , who is apparently well aware that he is the subject of such distant adoration .
Ancient legend
Chief Jack squatted on the ground as he told me how the Prince Philip cult had come about .
It seems that it emerged some time in the 1960s , when Vanuatu was an Anglo - French colony known as the New Hebrides .
For centuries , perhaps millennia , villagers had believed in an ancient story about the son of a mountain spirit venturing across the seas to look for a powerful woman to marry .
They believed that unlike them , this spirit had pale skin .
Somehow the legend gradually became associated with Prince Philip , who had indeed married a rich and powerful lady .
Villagers would have seen his portrait - and that of the Queen - in government outposts and police stations run by British colonial officials .
Their beliefs were bolstered in 1974 , when the Queen and Prince Philip made an official visit to the New Hebrides .
Here was their ancestral spirit , resplendent in a white naval officer 's uniform , come back to show off his bride .
" He 's a god , not a man , " the chief told me emphatically , pointing at the portraits .
Response to colonialism
None of the cult followers can read or write .
Prince Philip gave permission for portraits to be sent from London
They told me - somewhat amazingly - that it was only this year that they learnt the date of the Prince 's birthday - 10 June .
As Philip turns 86 and they are planning to mark the occasion with a feast and ceremonial drinking of kava , an intoxicating brew made from the roots of a pepper tree which makes your mouth go numb .
They have even acquired a large Union flag which they are going to run up a bamboo flag pole .
It is easy to see all this as so much South Seas mumbo jumbo .
But that would be a grave mistake , anthropologists told me .
Millennial movements like this were a highly sophisticated response by islanders in the South Pacific to the arrival of colonialism and Christianity .
By combining the fundamentals of their ancient beliefs with new elements gleaned from their contact with the West , they were able to preserve their culture .
There is , of course , a delicious irony in all this .
Prince Philip , after all , is a man who has a reputation for making politically incorrect gaffes , often about foreigners .
He once advised British students not to stay too long in China for fear of becoming " slitty - eyed " .
And he asked a group of stunned aborigines if they still threw spears at each other .
The villagers of Tanna may live a life far removed from the splendour of Buckingham Palace and Balmoral in far away Britain .
But they are as firm in their beliefs as Prince Philip is in his .
I suspect that if they were ever to meet , they would get along rather well .

So I recently stumbled across Jester , which is a mutation testing tool .
Mutation testing is really a way of testing your tests .
The basic idea is :
Ensure your tests work on the code under test .
Generate a set of mutant pieces of code , which are copies of the original code with some small changes , or mutations .
For each mutant , run you test cases .
If one of these tests does n't fail then you are missing test case .
So in testing your code you should first aim for complete coverage , that is ensure that your test cases exercise each line of code .
Once you get here , then mutation testing can help you find other holes in your test cases .
So the interesting thing here is what mutation operations ( or mutagens ) , you should do on the original code .
Jester provides only some very simple mutations , ( at least according to this paper ) :
modify literals
Change true to false ( and vice versa )
Change if ( to if ( true ||
Change if ( to if ( flase &&
Unfortunately it seems that such an approach is , well , way too simplistic , at least according Jeff Offutt , who has published papers in the area .
Basically , any rudimentary testing finds these changes , and does n't really find the holes in your test suite .
A paper on Mothra , a mutation system for FORTRAN , describes a large number of different mutation operations .
( As a coincident , my friend has a bug tracking system called Mothra . )
Anyway , so while Jester has a python port , I did n't quite like its approach ( especially since I needed to install Java , which I did n't really feel like doing ) .
So I decided to explore how this could be done in Python .
So the first set of mutation I wanted to play with is changing some constants to different values .
E.g : change 3 to ( 1 or 2 ) .
So this turns out to be reasonably easy to do in python .
I took functions as the unit of test I wanted to play with .
So , Python makes it easy to introspect function .
You can get a list of conants on a function like so : function.func_code.co_consts .
Now , you can't actually modify this , but what you can do is make a new copy of the method with a different set of constants .
This is conveniant because in mutation testing we want to create mutants .
So :
def f_new_consts (f , newconsts ) : " " " Return a copy of function f , but change its constants to newconsts . " " " co = f.func_code codeobj = type(co )(co.co_argcount , co.co_nlocals , co.co_stacksize , co.co_flags , co.co_code , tuple ( newconsts ) , co.co_names , co.co_varnames , co.co_filename , co.co_name , co.co_firstlineno , co.co_lnotab , co.co_freevars , co.co_cellvars ) new_function = type(f ) ( codeobj , f.func_globals , f.func_name , f.func_defaults , f.func_closure ) return new_function
So that is the basic mechanism I 'm using for creating mutant function with different constants .
The other mutants I wanted to make where those where I change comparison operators .
E.g : changing < to <= or >.
This is a bit trickier , it means getting down and dirty with the python byte code , or at least this is my preferred approach .
I guess you could also do syntactic changes and recompile .
Anyway , you can get a string representation of a function 's bytecode like so : function.func_code.co_code .
To do something useful with this you really want convert it to a list of integers , which is easy as so : [ ord ( x ) for x in function.func_code.co_code ] .
So far , so good , what you need to be able to do next is iterate through the different bytecode , this is a little tricky as they can be either 1 or 3 bytes long .
A loop like so :
from opcode import opname , HAVE_ARGUMENT
i = 0 opcodes = [ ord ( x ) for x in co.co_code ] while i < len( opcodes ) : print opname [ opcode ] i += 1 if opcode >= HAVE_ARGUMENT : i+= 2
will iterate through the opcodes and printing each one .
Basically all bytecodes larger than the constant HAVE_ARGUMENT , are three bytes long .
From here it is possible to find all the COMPARE_OP byte codes .
The first argument byte specifies the type of compare operations , these can be decoded using the opcode.
cmp_op tuple .
So , at this point I have some basic proof - of - concept code for creating some very simple mutants .
The next step is to try and integrate this with my unit testing and coverage testing framework , and then my code will never have bugs in it again !
Ebocha , Nigeria — Justice Eta , 14 months old , held out his tiny thumb .
An ink spot certified that he had been immunized against polio and measles , thanks to a vaccination drive supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
But polio is not the only threat Justice faces .
Almost since birth , he has had respiratory trouble .
His neighbors call it “ the cough . ”
People blame fumes and soot spewing from flames that tower 300 feet into the air over a nearby oil plant .
It is owned by the Italian petroleum giant Eni , whose investors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Justice squirmed in his mother ’s arms .
His face was beaded with sweat caused either by illness or by heat from the flames that illuminate Ebocha day and night .
Ebocha means “ city of lights . ”
The makeshift clinic at a church where Justice Eta was vaccinated and the flares spewing over Ebocha represent a head - on conflict for the Gates Foundation .
In a contradiction between its grants and its endowment holdings , a Times investigation has found , the foundation reaps vast financial gains every year from investments that contravene its good works .
In Ebocha , where Justice lives , Dr. Elekwachi
Okey , a local physician , says hundreds of flares at oil plants in the Niger Delta have caused an epidemic of bronchitis in adults , and asthma and blurred vision in children .
No definitive studies have documented the health effects , but many of the 250 toxic chemicals in the fumes and soot have long been linked to respiratory disease and cancer .
“ We ’re all smokers here , ” Okey said , “ but not with cigarettes . ”
The oil plants in the region surrounding Ebocha find it cheaper to burn nearly 1 billion cubic feet of gas each day and contribute to global warming than to sell it .
They deny the flaring causes sickness .
Under pressure from activists , however , Nigeria ’s high court set a deadline to end flaring by May 2007 .
The gases would be injected back underground , or trucked and piped out for sale .
But authorities expect the flares to burn for years beyond the deadline .
The Gates Foundation has poured $ 218 million into polio and measles immunization and research worldwide , including in the Niger Delta .
At the same time that the foundation is funding inoculations to protect health , The Times found , it has invested $ 423 million in Eni , Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Total of France — the companies responsible for most of the flares blanketing the delta with pollution , beyond anything permitted in the United States or Europe .
Indeed , local leaders blame oil development for fostering some of the very afflictions that the foundation combats .
Oil workers , for example , and soldiers protecting them are a magnet for prostitution , contributing to a surge in HIV and teenage pregnancy , both targets in the Gates Foundation ’s efforts to ease the ills of society , especially among the poor .
Oil bore holes fill with stagnant water , which is ideal for mosquitoes that spread malaria , one of the diseases the foundation is fighting .
Investigators for Dr. Nonyenim Solomon Enyidah , health commissioner for Rivers State , where Ebocha is located , cite an oil spill clogging rivers as a cause of cholera , another scourge the foundation is battling .
The rivers , Enyidah said , “ became breeding grounds for all kinds of waterborne diseases . ”
The bright , sooty gas flares — which contain toxic byproducts such as benzene , mercury and chromium — lower immunity , Enyidah said , and make children such as Justice Eta more susceptible to polio and measles — the diseases that the Gates Foundation has helped to inoculate him against .
Investing for profit
Like most philanthropies , the Gates Foundation gives away at least 5 % of its worth every year , to avoid paying most taxes .
In 2005 , it granted nearly $ 1.4 billion .
It awards grants mainly in support of global health initiatives , for efforts to improve public education in the United States , and for social welfare programs in the Pacific Northwest .
It invests the other 95 % of its worth .
This endowment is managed by Bill Gates Investments , which handles Gates ’ personal fortune .
Monica Harrington , a senior policy officer at the foundation , said the investment managers had one goal : returns “ that will allow for the continued funding of foundation programs and grant making . ”
Bill and Melinda Gates require the managers to keep a highly diversified portfolio , but make no specific directives .
By comparing these investments with information from for - profit services that analyze corporate behavior for mutual funds , pension managers , government agencies and other foundations , The Times found that the Gates Foundation has holdings in many companies that have failed tests of social responsibility because of environmental lapses , employment discrimination , disregard for worker rights , or unethical practices .
One of these investment rating services , Calvert Group Ltd. , for example , endorses 52 of the largest 100 U.S. companies based on market capitalization , but flags the other 48 for transgressions against social responsibility .
Microsoft Corp. , which Bill Gates leads as board chairman , is rated highly for its overall business practices , despite its history of antitrust problems .
In addition , The Times found the Gates Foundation endowment had major holdings in :
 Companies ranked among the worst U.S. and Canadian polluters , including ConocoPhillips , Dow Chemical Co. and Tyco International Ltd .
 Many of the world ’s other major polluters , including companies that own an oil refinery and one that owns a paper mill , which a study shows sicken children while the foundation tries to save their parents from AIDS .
 Pharmaceutical companies that price drugs beyond the reach of AIDS patients the foundation is trying to treat .
Using the most recent data available , a Times tally showed that hundreds of Gates Foundation investments — totaling at least $ 8.7 billion , or 41 % of its assets , not including U.S. and foreign government securities — have been in companies that countered the foundation ’s charitable goals or socially concerned philosophy .
This is “ the dirty secret ” of many large philanthropies , said Paul Hawken , an expert on socially beneficial investing who directs the Natural Capital Institute , an investment research group .
“ Foundations donate to groups trying to heal the future , ” Hawken said in an interview , “ but with their investments , they steal from the future . ”
Moreover , investing in destructive or unethical companies is not what is most harmful , said Hawken and other experts , including Douglas Bauer , senior vice president of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors , a nonprofit group that assists foundations on policy and ethical issues .
Worse , they said , is investing purely for profit , without attempting to improve a company ’s way of operating .
Such blind - eye investing , they noted , rewards bad behavior .
At the Gates Foundation , blind - eye investing has been enforced by a firewall it has erected between its grant - making side and its investing side .
The goals of the former are not allowed to interfere with the investments of the latter .
The foundation recently announced a plan to institutionalize that firewall by moving its assets into a separate organization , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust .
Its two trustees will be Bill and Melinda Gates .
The trust will invest to increase the endowment , while the foundation gives grants .
“ We ’ve been operating under these principles for many years , ” said Harrington , the foundation policy officer .
“ But having an official separation makes it even more clear . ”
With the exception of tobacco companies , asset managers do not avoid investments in firms whose activities conflict with the foundation ’s mission to do good .
“ Because we want to maintain a focus on the programmatic work , ” Harrington said in a written response to Times questions , “ we have made it a policy to not comment on individual investment holdings . ”
Finally , the foundation does not invest any portion of its endowment in companies specifically because they advance its philanthropic mission .
Much of the rest of philanthropy , however , is beginning to address contradictions between making grants to improve the world and making investments that harm it .
According to recent surveys , many foundations , including some of the nation ’s largest , have adopted at least basic policies to invest in ways that support their missions .
Major foundations that make social justice , corporate governance and environmental stewardship key considerations in their investment strategies include the Ford Foundation , worth $ 11.6 billion , the nation ’s second - largest private philanthropy ; the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation ; the Rockefeller Foundation ; and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation .
Moreover , nearly one - third of foundations participate directly in shareholder initiatives , voting their proxies to influence corporate behavior .
A few have become shareholder activists .
In recent years , for instance , the Nathan Cummings Foundation , with an endowment of $ 481 million , has sponsored proxies to force corporations to address environmental sustainability and political transparency .
Harrington said the Gates Foundation ’s investment managers vote proxies , but declined to give any specifics .
The foundation would not make its chief investment manager , Michael Larson , available for an interview .
In May , Harrington told the Chronicle of Philanthropy that the Gates Foundation did not get involved in proxy issues .
At the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation , on the other hand , Michael J. Smith , its chief investment officer , said voting proxies to improve corporate behavior had become a fiduciary necessity .
“ Companies that have good governance are generally well - managed , ” he said , “ and have a good record of profitability . ”
Even the relatively tiny Needmor Fund , with a $ 27 - million endowment , screens its investments to bar companies with poor environmental records , antagonism to worker rights or tolerance for repressive governments .
Leadership , however , is open to the Gates Foundation .
It has unique power to move the debate , said Bauer , of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors .
If Gates adopted mission - related investing , Bauer said in an interview , the shift in the world of philanthropy would be “ seismic . ”
The foundation did not respond to written questions about whether it might change its investment policies .
Life in ‘ Cancer Valley ’
Dube had volunteered for tests of a vaginal gel that researchers hope will be shown to protect against HIV .
The tests are part of a study conducted by the New York - based Population Council , and funded by a $ 20 - million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Dube ’s boyfriend wo n’t use condoms .
She hoped the tests would show she could use the microbicidal gel , called Carraguard , and stop worrying about AIDS .
Research into prophylactics such as Carraguard can fight AIDS by empowering women , Bill Gates told the International AIDS Conference in Toronto in August .
“ Whether the woman is a faithful married mother of small children , or a sex worker trying to scrape out a living in a slum " he said , “ a woman should never need her partner ’s permission to save her own life . ”
Two days before Gates spoke , Kyrone Smith was born only a few kilometers from the Isipingo clinic .
At the same time the Gates Foundation was trying to help Dube , it owned a stake in companies that appeared to be hurting Kyrone .
At six weeks , his lungs began to fail .
Kyrone struggled to cry , but he was so weak that no sound came out — just husky , labored breaths .
His mother , Renee Smith , 26 , rushed him to a hospital , where he was given oxygen .
She feared it would be the first of many hospital visits .
Smith knew from experience .
“ My son Teiago was in and out of hospital since the age of 3 , ” she said .
“ He could n’t breathe nicely .
There are so many children in this area who have the same problems . ”
Two of the area ’s worst industrial polluters — a Mondi paper mill and a giant Sapref oil refinery — squat among the homes near Isipingo like sleepy grey dragons , exhaling chemical vapors day and night .
The Sapref plant , which has had two dozen significant spills , flares , pipeline ruptures and explosions since 1998 , and the Mondi plant together pump thousands of tons of putrid - smelling chemicals into the air annually , according to their own monitoring .
In 2002 , a study found that more than half of the children at a school in nearby Merebank suffered asthma — one of the highest rates in scientific literature .
A second study , published last year , found serious respiratory problems throughout the region :
More than half of children aged 2 to 5 had asthma , largely attributed to sulfur dioxide and other industrial pollutants .
Much of it was produced by companies in which the Gates Foundation was invested .
Asthma was not the only danger .
Isipingo is in what environmental activists call “ Cancer Valley . ”
Emissions of benzene , dioxins and other carcinogens were “ among the highest levels found in any comparable location the world , ” said Stuart Batterman at the University of Michigan , a coauthor of both studies .
The Gates Foundation is a major shareholder in the companies that own both of the polluting plants .
As of September , the foundation held $ 295 million worth of stock in BP , a co-owner of Sapref .
As of 2005 , it held $ 35 million worth of stock in Royal Dutch Shell , Sapref ’s other owner .
The foundation also held a $ 39 - million investment in Anglo American , which owns the Mondi paper mill .
The foundation has held large investments in all three companies since at least 2002 .
Since then , the worth of BP shares has shot up by about 83 % , Royal Dutch Shell shares by 77 % and Anglo American shares about 255 % .
Dividends have padded the foundation ’s assets by additional millions of dollars .
The foundation has gotten much more in financial gains from its investments in the polluters than it has given to the Durban microbicide study to fight AIDS .
Sapref said it had cut sulfur dioxide emissions by two - thirds since 1997 and spent more than $ 64 million over 11 years on environmental initiatives .
It said lead in its gasoline and sulfur in its diesel fuel were reduced a year ago .
Plant officials said : “ Sapref does not accept any responsibility for any health issues in South Durban . ”
Mondi said that its Merebank paper mill had cut “ chemical oxygen demand , ” a key pollutant , in 2005 , and that it was cutting its sulfur dioxide emissions .
But by the company ’s own estimate , the mill still releases about three times the combined amount of sulfur dioxide produced by Mondi plants in five other nations , and the other plants operate at nearly six times the capacity .
Merebank uses a coal - fired power plant , while the others burn cleaner fuel .
Just as the Gates Foundation investments in Mondi , BP and Royal Dutch Shell have been very profitable , so too have its holdings in the top 100 polluters in the United States , as rated by the University of Massachusetts , and the top 50 polluters in Canada , as rated by the trade publication Corporate Knights , using methods based on those developed by the university .
According to the foundation ’s 2005 figures , it held a $ 1.4 - billion stake in 69 of those firms .
They included blue chips , such as Chevron Corp. and Ford Motor Co. , as well as lesser - known companies such as Lyondell Chemical Co. and Ameren Corp .
At the same time , the foundation held a $ 2.9 - billion stake in firms ranked by the investment rating services as among the worst environmental stewards , including Dominion Resources Inc. and El Paso Corp .
Without double - counting companies flagged by both the University of Massachusetts and the rating services , the combination totals an investment of about $ 3.3 billion .
The Gates Foundation did not respond to written questions about its investments in companies that were high polluters or those rated as poor environmental stewards .
Drugs out of reach
Felix has a pressing , private reason to get the ice :
He needs it to keep his medicine from melting .
Two years ago , Felix ’s wife died from AIDS , and he learned he was HIV - positive .
He told his six children , now 16 to 24 years old , but no one else .
He was afraid of the stigma of HIV .
He agreed to be interviewed only if he was identified by his first name alone .
“ I thought the world had come to an end for me , ” Felix said .
“ Everyone believes that once you have it , you ’re a living ghost . ”
He took antiretroviral drugs and felt better .
But his treatment was interrupted frequently because he could not afford the cost : $ 62 a month .
His pension as a former staff sergeant was $ 115 a month , and the money came sporadically .
Worse , his body soon stopped responding to the drugs .
His kidneys began to fail , and his count of immune cells crucial to fight off infections plummeted .
In May , Felix began taking Kaletra , a second - line AIDS drug — needed when the first round of treatments fail .
His health rebounded , but it came at a cost .
Gel capsules of Kaletra melt in Nigeria ’s sweltering climate , where temperatures often top 100 degrees .
Felix kept his Kaletra in a small chest filled with ice .
Each day , he had to go get more ice .
And each day , he had to take Kaletra precisely at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m .
These things made it difficult for him to work , even at odd jobs .
A new version of Kaletra does not require refrigeration .
But his physician , Dr. T.M. Balogun , who helps run the AIDS program at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital , told him not to get his hopes up .
The hospital is helped by the Nigerian government , which gets money from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
The fund has been awarded $ 651 million by the Gates Foundation .
Yet the hospital does not offer the new Kaletra .
It is too expensive .
In August , private pharmacists said they could sell it for $ 246 a month .
But that was far out of Felix ’s reach .
Kaletra is made by Abbott Laboratories .
As of this September , the Gates Foundation held $ 169 million in Abbott stock .
In 2005 , the foundation held nearly $ 1.5 billion worth of stock in drug companies whose practices have been widely criticized as restricting the flow of key medicines to poor people in developing nations .
On average , shares in those companies have increased in value about 54 % since 2002 .
Investments in Abbott and other drug makers probably have gained the foundation hundreds of millions of dollars .
Drug makers say they need price protection for research and development .
“ Our global needs and global systems are in conflict , ” Miles White , Abbott ’s chief executive , wrote in the Financial Times last year .
“ This threatens to harm one goal , innovation , in the name of another , access to medicine . ”
In 1994 , however , the drug makers , with other research - intensive businesses , lobbied hard and successfully for the international Agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights , which made it harder to move from costly brand - name drugs to cheap generics .
The agreement protected new - drug monopolies for 20 years or more .
This meant no low - priced generic for Kaletra .
The pact locked in Abbott as its sole supplier , and Abbott set prices for the world .
Under pressure from activists , Abbott and other companies cut prices for key AIDS drugs in poorer nations .
In Guatemala and Thailand , the new Kaletra costs $ 2,200 per patient per year , plus taxes and fees — a fraction of the more than $ 8,000 it costs in the United States .
In poorer Nigeria , the official price was $ 500 a year .
But this was still too costly for most patients , including Felix .
The industry ’s approach “ has the effect of making medicines available only to a narrow spectrum of a rich elite in a developing country , ” said Brook Baker , an intellectual property expert at Northeastern University .
He called it “ pharmaceutical apartheid . ”
Drug companies say critics overlook billions of dollars ’ worth of drugs they donate to developing nations .
Abbott says it has given AIDS drugs to 25,000 patients , along with millions of test kits , and has underwritten a major project to improve AIDS services in Tanzania .
In emergencies , critics welcome donated drugs .
The problem , they say , is that donations scare away generic suppliers .
Donations , said Ellen ‘t Hoen , who directs a drug- access program for Doctors Without Borders , “ remove the prospect of any stable supply . ”
And when the free drugs are gone , patients die .
Most medicines are reliably profitable .
In the most recent quarter , Abbott posted a gross profit margin of 59 % of sales , and recently paid its 331st consecutive quarterly dividend .
A congressional analysis shows that during the first six months of 2006 , the 10 largest drug companies earned $ 39.8 billion in profits .
The Gates Foundation ’s top priority is stopping AIDS , Bill Gates told the International AIDS Conference in August .
Since its inception , the foundation has donated more than $ 2 billion to fight the disease .
The foundation did not respond to written questions about the problems of patients who cannot obtain needed AIDS drugs due to pharmaceutical company policies .
Meanwhile , the foundation holds its grant recipients to a far higher standard than the drug companies on which it bets large portions of its endowment .
Its grant form says it expects recipients “ to exercise their intellectual property rights in a manner consistent with the stated goals of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to promote the availability of inventions for public benefit in developing countries at reasonable cost . ”
Some critics say the foundation ’s failure to use its own investments “ to promote public benefit in developing countries at reasonable cost ” might trace back to the source of most of its money — Microsoft — which Bill Gates serves as chairman .
Microsoft monopolies in computer operating systems and business software depend upon the same intellectual - property and trade - law approaches favored by drug companies .
“ The Gates Foundation is in a position to change the dynamic , to make sure that drugs get first to the places they are most needed , ” said Daniel Berman , deputy director in South Africa for Doctors Without Borders .
“ But it conflicts with the interests of Microsoft . ”
In response to written questions , Harrington , the Gates Foundation policy officer , said the foundation tried to guarantee that grantee discoveries made in partnership with for - profit companies trickled down to people in developing nations .
“ The foundation ’s goal is to help ensure that new scientific knowledge is broadly shared and that lifesaving health advances are created and made available and affordable to those most in need , ” she said .
“ We also recognize that private industry needs adequate incentives to develop new drugs . ”
The foundation ’s pharmaceutical company investments , Harrington said , “ are completely separate from what ’s being done on the programmatic side to help spur the development and delivery of drugs / vaccines . ”

Ethics - based investing
Some foundation trustees shun ethical investments out of concern about inferior returns .
But several studies conducted over the last decade by financial analysts have eased that worry .
Despite some exceptions , many mutual funds , for instance , that consider the social and environmental impact of their investments compete well against standard funds .
In the 12 months that ended in November , several funds that consider the impact of their investments upon social welfare — including the New Alternatives Fund , the Parnassus Fixed - Income Fund and the Catholic Equity Fund I — performed in the top ranks of standard mutual funds in the same categories , according to SRI World Group .
Broad indexes of stocks selected because of their companies ’ social concerns also have tended to keep pace with standard indexes .
The Domini 400 Social Index is modeled on the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index , a widely used measure of market performance .
While results from the two indexes tend to leapfrog each other over short periods , from 1990 through November the Domini index has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 6 % .
From its inception about 18 months ago through November , KLD Research & Analytics ’ Global Climate 100 Index — made up of companies selected for their efforts to reduce climate change — rose 22.03 % .
In the same period , by comparison , the MSCI World Index , which measures general corporate performance in the U.S. and 22 other major developed nations , rose 20.73 % .
“ After controlling for investment style , ” said economists at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who studied U.S. , U.K. and German mutual funds , “ we find little evidence of significant differences in risk - adjusted returns between ethical and conventional funds .

About this series
This series is based on more than 90 interviews and hundreds of documents , including thousands of pages of Gates Foundation grant descriptions and policies , evaluation reports , tax forms , filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through September 2006 and lists of endowment holdings from 2002 through 2005 .
Information was used from four leading services that provide guidance for investors regarding corporate performance : Calvert Group Ltd. , Innovest Strategic Value Advisors , KLD Research & Analytics Inc. and Oekom Research .
None of the companies was directly involved in The Times ’ assessment of the Gates Foundation portfolio ; they have taken no position on The Times ’ conclusions .
The research groups consider companies in context and weigh their efforts to improve .
The Times tally of Gates investments in companies that contradict its goals included only those firms that were ranked among the worst by the investment rating services .
Companies among the 100 highest - polluting in the United States were derived from rankings by the University of Massachusetts Political Economy Research Institute .
These rankings consider total air pollution released , toxicity of pollutants and the number of people at risk of exposure .
The top 50 polluters in Canada were rated by the trade publication Corporate Knights , based largely on the University of Massachusetts approach .
The Times used several studies that reviewed or evaluated actions of the pharmaceutical industry regarding intellectual property rights , patents and drug pricing in developing nations .
A preliminary list of relevant companies was drawn up using studies or evaluations conducted by Innovest , KLD , Oekom , the nonprofit medical group Doctors Without Borders , and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility , a coalition of 275 faith - based institutional investors that includes religious groups , pension funds , endowments , hospital corporations and colleges .
The list was refined and validated in interviews with experts and through a review of more than 40 technical papers and analyses , including studies by the World Bank and the World Health Organization .
Those sources were supplemented with reports and announcements from the pharmaceutical companies and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , a leading trade group .
Companies in the sub - prime industry were compiled from National Mortgage News and Inside Mortgage Finance , leading trade publications .
Information about proxies was gathered from the EthVest database , sponsored by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility .
The data were supplemented by interviews with officials from various foundations .
The overall figures in this series may significantly understate the volume of Gates Foundation investments that tend to conflict with its charitable goals .
The Gates Foundation did not provide details for about $ 4.3 billion of investments it characterizes as loans .

Most people just have a spare tire or a can of fix - a - flat and an auto club card when they hit the road .
But as we all know , they do things bigger in Texas , so when some guy from Texas goes for a drive around Rome , he brings along a spare stretch armored limo !
As President George Bush and his entourage approached the US Embassy in Rome this weekend , his custom Cadillac DTS limo decided to pack it in .
. After attempting to restart , Bush ultimately got out and walked through the embassy gates , later using the backup limo for the rest of his appointments .
The video after the jump shows the crowd 's reaction to Bush 's limo breaking down , which was comprised mostly of laughter when the driver attempted to restart the car without success .
Nevertheless , the President was cheered when he ultimately exited his stage coach and began to hoof it .

Members of the Basiji Force are known for attacking reformist politicians and pro-democracy meetings .
President Ahmadinejad was a member of the force , but the Supreme Court judges who issued the ruling are not considered to be specifically affiliated with it .

Iran ’s Islamic penal code , which is a parallel system to its civic code , says murder charges can be dropped if the accused can prove the killing was carried out because the victim was morally corrupt .
This is true even if the killer identified the victim mistakenly as corrupt .
In that case , the law requires “ blood money ” to be paid to the family .
Every year in Iran , a senior cleric determines the amount of blood money required in such cases .
This year it is $ 40,000 if the victim is a Muslim man , and half that for a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim .
In a long interview with the Iranian Student News Agency , a Supreme Court judge , Mohammad Sadegh Al - e - Eshagh , who did not take part in this case , sought Wednesday to discourage vigilante killings , saying those carried out without a court order should be punished .
At the same time , he laid out examples of moral corruption that do permit bloodshed , including armed banditry , adultery by a wife and insults to the Prophet Muhammad .
“ The roots of the problems are in our laws , ” said Mohammad Seifzadeh , a lawyer and a member of the Association for Defenders of Human Rights in Tehran .
“ Such cases happen as long as we have laws that allow the killer to decide whether the victim is corrupt or not .
Ironically , such laws show that the establishment is not capable of bringing justice , and so it leaves it to ordinary people to do it . ”
The ruling stems from a case in 2002 in Kerman that began after the accused watched a tape by a senior cleric who ruled that Muslims could kill a morally corrupt person if the law failed to confront that person .
CREW Chief on Fitzgerald and the Missing Emails
A couple of weeks before I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges , then - White House Counsel Harriet Miers was told that an internal White House probe determined that millions of administration emails dating back to 2003 were lost .
Miers immediately informed Patrick Fitzgerald , the special prosecutor appointed to investigate whether administration officials knowingly leaked the identity of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson , about the administration 's lost emails , a government watchdog group has claimed , but Miers may not have told Fitzgerald the extent of the White House 's email problem .
During a wide - ranging interview with Truthout on Monday , Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , and CREW 's Chief Counsel Anne Weismann said they believe Miers did not fully inform Fitzgerald about the millions of emails the White House lost between 2003 and 2005 .
As a result , the CREW attorneys said it 's likely that Fitzgerald did not obtain all of the evidence related to the leak investigation - particularly emails sent during that time period by Karl Rove that may further implicate the White House political adviser in the Plame Wilson leak .
The latest revelation by CREW provides new insight into how Fitzgerald first became aware that some emails related to the leak investigation were not turned over to FBI investigators in the fall of 2003 , which the special prosecutor disclosed in a court filing in January 2006 .
" We assume this is what [ Fitzgerald ] was referring to [ in his court filing ] , but we do not know how deep the briefing given to him by Miers was , " Sloan said .
In a story first reported by Truthout last year , Fitzgerald revealed that his investigative team " learned that not all email of the Office of the Vice President and the Executive Office of the President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system , " according to the January 2006 court filing .
Less than two weeks after Fitzgerald revealed that emails from the White House were missing , 250 pages of emails from President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney 's offices were turned over to investigators working for the special prosecutor - more than two years after the investigation had begun .
The White House offered no official explanation concerning the circumstances regarding the sudden reappearance of the emails it turned over to Fitzgerald on February 6 , 2006 .
At the time , a White House spokeswoman would only say that staffers " discovered " the batch of documents during a search .
In October of 2005 , the White House Office of Administration discovered that White House emails had not been archived in accordance with the Presidential Records Act , according to Sloan .
The Office of Administration briefed Miers about the lost emails and Miers is said to have immediately informed Fitzgerald 's staff about the issue due to the fact that Fitzgerald had subpoenaed White House emails sent in 2003 .
However , according to Sloan , Fitzgerald 's staff was briefed before a complete audit of the email records could be taken .
The Office of Administration audit concluded that more than five million emails had been lost .
Sloan , who said her organization had obtained information about the extent of the emails the White House lost from two sources - one a former Bush administration official - believes this " suggests that Fitzgerald might not have gotten the complete story . "
In late January 2004 , Fitzgerald suspected that Rove had either hidden or destroyed an important document tying him to the leak , as well as the effort to discredit Plame 's husband , Ambassador Joseph Wilson , who had been a vocal critic of the Iraq war and accused the Bush administration of twisting pre-war Iraq intelligence .
The document that Fitzgerald believed Rove had either hidden or destroyed was an email Rove sent to Stephen Hadley , then - deputy national security adviser , in early July 2003 .
The email proved Rove had a conversation with Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper about issues related to the CIA leak .
Rove did not disclose that conversation when he was first interviewed by the FBI three months after he had emailed Hadley .
Curiously , the email Rove sent to Hadley did not show up during a search ordered by then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales in September 2003 .
Gonzales enjoined all White House staff members to turn over any communication pertaining to Plame Wilson and her husband .
Gonzales 's directive came twelve hours after senior White House officials had been told of the pending investigation .
" It looks like Karl Rove may well have destroyed evidence that implicated him in the White House 's orchestrated efforts to leak Valerie Plame Wilson 's covert identity to the press in retaliation against her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , " Sloan said last week .
" Special Counsel Fitzgerald should immediately reopen his investigation into whether Rove took part in the leak , as well as whether he obstructed justice in the ensuing leak investigation . "
In light of the revelations Thursday that thousands of emails Rove sent over a four - year period via an email account maintained by the Republican National Committee may have been destroyed , questions as to why an email Rove sent to Hadley was not initially found in the 10,000 pages of documents and emails turned over to the special counsel has resurfaced .
Additionally , there are also questions about the veracity of statements Rove and his attorney , Robert Luskin , made to Fitzgerald more than two years ago regarding why that email to Hadley was n't found .
On April 12 , CREW published a report entitled , " WITHOUT A TRACE : The Missing White House Emails and Violations of the Presidential Records Act , " outlining the widespread failures by the White House to retain its emails .
In its report , CREW said that " although [ then - ]
White House counsel [ Harriet Miers ] was provided a detailed briefing of this analysis , and a plan of action to recover the missing email was developed , the plan has never been executed . "
During a press briefing on Monday , White House Spokeswoman Dana Perino said the administration is " aware that there could have been some emails that were not automatically archived because of a technical issue . "
" We have talked with the Office of Administration about that , and we 're looking into those details , " Perino said .
" But given the complex nature of this issue , it might take us a little while to identify those .
We do , however , know that most - all of those emails should be available on backup tapes . "
Last week , CREW sent a letter to Fitzgerald urging him to reopen his investigation in light of revelations that thousands of emails Rove sent via an email account maintained by the Republican National Committee had been lost .
CREW serves as legal counsel to Joseph and Valerie Wilson in their civil suit against Rove , Vice President Dick Cheney , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby and Richard Armitage .
Libby was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice earlier this year for his role in the leak of Plame 's identity .
Fitzgerald has not responded to CREW 's letter , Sloan said .
Weismann , chief counsel for CREW , said the fact that Rove and other White House officials have sent emails through their Republican National Committee ( RNC ) accounts raises new questions about the integrity of Fitzgerald 's investigation .
" Rove admitted to using the RNC servers for 95 % of his correspondence , " Weismann said .
" Was Fitzgerald aware of this prior to closing the case ?
Did [ Fitzgerald ] know emails were being deleted from the RNC server ? "
Until 2004 , the RNC deleted emails from its server after 30 days .
However , administration officials with RNC accounts could still independently access and delete email from the RNC server .
The RNC said Rove was blocked from deleting emails from his RNC account during the CIA leak investigation .
Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee , has been investigating the use of unofficial email accounts by Bush administration officials .
On Thursday , Waxman 's staff met behind closed doors with RNC Counsel Rob Kelner to discuss the issue .
In a letter to Gonzales on Thursday , Waxman said that the RNC has email archives dating back to 2004 , but " has apparently destroyed all email records from White House officials from 2001 , 2002 and 2003 . "
According to Waxman 's letter , the RNC had special email procedures for Rove .
According to Kelner , the RNC does not have any archived emails prior to 2005 for Rove .
This , despite the reports that Rove uses his RNC account for the majority of his correspondence .
Waxman said that Kelner " did not give any explanation for the emails missing from Mr. Rove 's account , but he did acknowledge that one possible explanation is that Mr. Rove personally deleted his emails from the RNC server . "
Sloan and Weismann said CREW has no direct evidence proving that Rove intentionally withheld emails from Fitzgerald 's probe .
But the CREW attorneys doubt that Rove and the White House has been forthcoming about Rove 's involvement in the Plame Wilson leak in light of the fact that millions of emails during the height of the leak have not been recovered .
Moreover , Sloan said it 's difficult to determine whether Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , has been forthcoming with Fitzgerald about the changing stories that Rove and Luskin told the special prosecutor regarding Rove 's role in the Plame Wilson leak and the discovery of the email Rove sent to Hadley .
" He is a well - known lawyer and I would give him the benefit of the doubt , but there is no way to know if he was telling the truth or not at this point , " Sloan said .

It was almost 10 years ago that I organized a kerneltrap.org interview with our at - that - time kernel team leader Andrey Savochkin , which was published on April 18 , 2006 .
As years go by , kerneltrap.org is no more , Andrey moved on to got a PhD in Economics and is now an Assistant Professor , while OpenVZ is still here .
Read on for this great piece of memorabilia .
Andrey Savochkin leads the development of the kernel portion of OpenVZ , an operating system - level server virtualization solution .
In this interview , Andrey offers a thorough explanation of what virtualization is and how it works .
He also discusses the differences between hardware - level and operating system - level virtualization , going on to compare OpenVZ to VServer , Xen and User Mode Linux .
Andrey is now working to get OpenVZ merged into the mainline Linux kernel explaining , " virtualization makes the next step in the direction of better utilization of hardware and better management , the step that is comparable with the step between single - user and multi-user systems . "
The complete OpenVZ patchset weighs in at around 70,000 lines , approximately 2MB , but has been broken into smaller logical pieces to aid in discussion and to help with merging .
Jeremy Andrews :
Please share a little about yourself and your background ...
Andrey Savochkin : I live in Moscow , Russia , and work for SWsoft .
My two major interests in life are mathematics and computers , and I was unable to decide for a long time which one I preferred .
I studied in Moscow State University which has a quite strong mathematical school , and got M.Sc. degree in 1995 and Ph.D. degree in 1999 .
The final decision between mathematics and computers came at the time of my postgraduate study , and my Ph.D. thesis was completely in the computer science area , exploring some security aspects of operating systems and software intended to be used on computers with Internet access .
Jeremy Andrews :
What is your involvement with the OpenVZ project ?
As a teenager , Omar became entranced by jihadist ideology .
He moved on to the cause of Kashmir , and was then piqued by 9/11 and the Iraq war , things that inspired and angered other Britons with Pakistani roots .
But he in the end turned to attacking Britain , where he was born and raised .

On a previous visit , he took up the cause of Kashmir .
Credit ... Metropolitan Police
Asked on the witness stand his reaction to 9/11 , Mr. Khyam did not disguise his delight .
“ I was happy , ” he recalled in his south England accent .
“ America was , and still is , the greatest enemy of Islam .
I was happy that America had been hit because of what it represented against the Muslims , but obviously 3,000 people died , so there were mixed feelings . ”
Mr. Khyam testified that his parents migrated to Britain from Pakistan in the 1970s , before his birth .
He came from a family , he said , with a proud heritage of service , first in the British Army in Pakistan , then in the army of the newly independent Pakistan , and also in the intelligence services .
His parents were not particularly religious , he said , a pattern typical among Pakistani immigrants to Britain where the new generation , often turned off by what they see as the loose morals of binge drinking and broken marriages , has proven to be more devout than their elders .
At the age of 10 , his father , a successful businessman with a textile factory in Karachi , left his mother and moved to Belgium , leaving behind Omar , the eldest , and two small children .
His mother ’s English was poor .
Quickly , Omar became the man of the household , organizing the finances , and bossing his siblings .
Instead of enrolling in the local school where most of the students were South Asian , he attended a mostly white , government - run school , and led a middle - class British life .
He did relatively well in his final school exams and enrolled in college but , distracted by his larger cause , never followed through on his studies or sought steady employment .
Protecting the Great Barrier Reef from the impacts of climate change , natural disasters and rising human pressures will be a key test of Australia ’s ability to keep our natural environment healthy and resilient .
That ’s the message from Professor Malcolm McCulloch of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies ( CoECRS ) to this week ’s gathering of the International Council on Monuments and Sites ( ICOMOS ) , in Cairns .
“ If Australia ca n’t save the GBR , then no - one anywhere in the world can save their coral reefs , ” Professor McCulloch warns .
“ We know the threats posed by coral bleaching , ocean acidification , rapid sea level rise and increased coastal erosion .
It ’s about what we can do in the way we manage the reef and look after it that will mitigate those threats .
“ We have to make our corals as healthy and resilient as possible so they can withstand these stresses . ”
Preserving Australian and World Heritage sites from dangers posed by climate change , natural disasters and conflict will be the focus of discussion at the ICOMOS conference being held at James Cook University campus in Cairns , North Queensland , this week ( July 19 - 21 ) .
“ People often do n’t realise how important heritage is to them .
We reference ourselves against it and from it we develop the values that define us , ” says conference convenor , Dr Susan McIntyre - Tamwoy of CoECRS .
“ These sites should be appreciated , researched and documented while we have them - after they are gone it will be too late . ”
The global impacts of natural disasters , climate change , globalisation and conflict are recognised as real risks by governments worldwide .
However , their impact on the world ’s natural and cultural heritage sites has not been well considered .
“ We have n’t come to grips with the risks of climate change and the things that might be damaged or lost with an increase in sea levels , ” says Dr McIntyre - Tamwoy . ”
We have to ask ourselves how those changes will affect our way of life . ”
Another speaker , Dr John Hurd , director of conservation for the Global Heritage Fund , will explore how climate change is affecting the human heritage in the deserts : “ Deserts are normally great places for preserving things , but recent heavy floods have totally destroyed ancient archaeological sites . ”
The deserts are changing – and are especially vulnerable to the increased rainfall expected in some areas under climate change , he says .
The ICOMOS conference will focus on developing strategies and awareness for the management and mitigation of the risks facing heritage sites .
The conference includes speakers and representatives from the heritage profession , industry , government and research institutes from Australia , Europe , USA , Asia and the Pacific Islands .
A public forum on heritage and climate change will be held during the conference to allow members of the public to engage in the debate over heritage conservation in the face of climate change .

A man who authorities say appeared to be driving while using his laptop computer died Monday when his car crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with a Hummer .
California Highway Patrol officers found the victim ’s computer still running and plugged into the cigarette lighter of his 1991 Honda Accord .
The 28 - year - old victim was a computer tutor in Chico , Calif .
The Sutter County coroner ’s office was withholding his identity until his family could be notified .
“ The screen itself shattered from the impact , so we ca n’t be sure if he was working on it or not , but we think from the way it was found that he might have been working , ” said Sgt. John Pettigrew , a CHP spokesman .
“ It ’s a straight road right there , and it does n’t look like he fell asleep or anything else . ”

The couple in the Hummer escaped the 8:30 a.m. collision with bumps and bruises , Pettigrew said .
The crash , near the intersection of California highways 99 and 113 about 30 miles north of the capital , totaled both vehicles .
It closed a section of Highway 99 south of Yuba City for about two hours .

単純な活用例をいくつか紹介します。以下は i386 の Debian GNU / Linux ( sid ) のシステムで実験しました。gdb は 6.4 より前のバージョンではうまく動かない例があります。
% ps x | grep firefox 3616 ?
Rl 19:40 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin - a firefox % gdb -q -p 3616 ( gdb ) p chdir ( " / " ) [ Switching to Thread - 1221168480 ( LWP 3616 ) ] $ 1 = 0 ( gdb ) detach Detaching from program : /usr / lib / firefox / firefox - bin , process 3616 ( gdb )
この例は gdb - p で attach したターゲットプロセス内で chdir ( 2 ) システムコールを呼び出しています。デーモンや
X クライアントといったバックグラウンドプロセスがマウントポイントの下にいるおかげで、device is busy で umount できないといった状況で有用です 。
ファイル操作も比較的簡単に行うことができます。まず cat を起動しておき、別のシェルでは以下のように gdb を起動して cat プロセスをいじってみます 。
% gdb -q - p $ ( pidof cat ) ( gdb ) p write ( 1 , " hoge " , 4 ) $ 1 = 4 ( gdb ) p open ( " / etc / passwd " , 0 ) ← 0 は O_RDONLY です $ 2 = 3 ( gdb ) p dup2 ( 3 , 0 ) $ 3 = 0 ( gdb ) c Continuing .
Program exited normally .
( gdb )
cat プロセスが hoge という文字列と / etc / passwd ファイルの内容を出力していれば成功です。根性があればソケットを使って新たに
TCP コネクションを張ることも可能でしょう 。
execlp ( 2 ) を呼んで、途中から別のコマンドにしてしまうこともできます。
( gdb ) p execlp ( " ls " , " ls " , " / " , 0 ) Program exited normally .
The program being debugged stopped while in a function called from GDB .
When the function ( execlp ) is done executing , GDB will silently stop ( instead of continuing to evaluate the expression containing the function call ) .
( gdb )
" ls / " が実行されたと思います。最後のメッセージは、gdb
が想定した場所に制御が戻ってこなかったことを警告しています。
この他にもたとえば、ターゲットプロセスが libdl をリンクしているプログラムなら、dlopen(3 ) を呼んで共有オブジェクトをリンクして使うことができます。しかし libdl がリンクされていなかった場合 dlopen ( ) は使えず、gdb にもリンカの機能はないので、代わりに livepatch のようなリンカ機能を備えたプログラムに頼ることになるでしょう。
なお上記用例はターゲットプロセスの状態によっては期待どおりに動作しないことがままあります。個人的には live patching はまともに使うには難易度が高すぎる無謀なテクニックだと思っていますが、たとえばバグって暴走したネットワークデーモンプロセスのファイル記述子を閉じることなく ( コネクションを維持したまま ) 、新しいプロセスに引き継ぐような用途 ( live executing ? ) であれば、成功確率は高くそれなりに実用になるかもしれません。

" The earth is the cradle of humankind , but one cannot live in the cradle forever . "
- Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , 1895
Chhattisgarh is waging an all - out war against Naxalites - by local tribals , ? backed ’ by an unusual alliance of the BJP govt and the Opposition Congress .
VIVEK DESHPANDE travels to the battlefield deep in the forests of south Bastar Salva Judum poro poro , Naxalwad Addi Addi ( Salva Judum up , Naxalism down ) .
Dhol Ke Wende Dholakar , Pondi Ke Roma Kal
( We will die , but only after we kill them )
An army of over 3,000 tribals led by a bearded man called K Madhukarrao is marching briskly towards the tribal hamlet of Farsegad in the Bijapur police district of southern Bastar .
Brandishing bows , arrows and rifles , they march as heavily armed guards of paramilitary forces provide a safety cordon .
The seven - hour ?? victory ’’ march , which began at Sapimarka village about 20 km away , comes to an end after ?? winning ’’ a battle against an enemy they were accused of supporting till the previous day .
Sapimarka has been successfully ?? annexed . ’’
Welcome to the land of Salva Judum in the dense forests of Bastar .
The government says it ’s a peace movement to free the tribals from the clutches of Naxalites .
The Naxalites say Judum means hunting and Salva means group and it ’s a group hunting of innocent tribals supporting the ??
people ’s movement . ’’
But what began in June , 2005 as a small protest against Naxalites at Karkeli village near Farsegad has now turned into a frenzy in South Bastar , once the ? cherished zone of the Left - wing extremists .
The government - sponsored and Opposition - supported campaign called Salva Judum has turned the entire tribal belt from Gidam to Bijapur and Bhopalpatnam in the revenue district of Dantewada into a battleground - police and paramilitary forces are swarming the region .
Boards of Salva Judum have come up all along the roads .
Hundreds of villages have been vacated since June , 2005 and scores of ?? relief camps ’’ have been set up for the tribals brought into the Salva Judum fold .
Barricades have been erected at all vantage points for screening of vehicles and individuals .
But that has n’t stopped the Naxalite attacks - in fact , they have been striking back with vengeance .
Several tribals have been killed by Naxalites and thousands have deserted their villages and paddy fields fearing retaliation .
Konda Madhukarrao , a 32 - year old non-tribal teacher from Kutru village , who spearheads the movement , says : ??
People were tired of Naxalites .
For long , the Naxalites have used the poor tribals as their weapons and have prevented all kinds of developmental activities .
Those opposing would get killed in the name of being police informers .
We all thought enough was enough and we must end their reign of terror . ’’
Led by him , the villagers approached Dantewada MLA Mahendra Karma , who had run two anti-Naxalite campaigns in the early and mid-90s .
Karma , leader of the Congress and Leader of the Opposition in Chhattisgarh Assembly who has lost at least four of his relatives in the Naxalite violence , seized the chance .
Taking Chief Minister Raman
Singh into confidence , he took over the leadership of what he calls ?? aar paar ki ladaai ’’ ( all - out war ) on Naxalites .
??
We have been marching to deep interior villages calling for support against Naxalites .
People are voluntarily joining in huge numbers .
Those not falling in line are being handed over to the police , ’’ says Madhukarrao .
Hundreds of tribal boys and girls are now being appointed as Special Police Officers ( SPOs ) at the Salva Judum camps , with the promise of Rs 1,500 per month as salary .
They are being trained in gun-handling and anti-insurgency operations .
??
People have been mutely supporting the so - called people ’s movement of Naxalites , who have entirely destroyed the traditional socio-cultural , economic and administrative fabric of the tribal society at the point of gun .
We are trying to channelise that frustration through Salva Judum , ’’ says Karma .
What ’s happening in the camps is n’t any different , but Karma calls it ?? sacrifice for the people ’s movement against Naxalite violence . ’’
CM Raman Singh says , ??
People have come together against the terror of RDX and AK - 47s . ’’
The Leftists have accused the government of starting a civil war in Bastar .
The CPI ( Maoists ) literature cite Salva Judum as another proof of state repression and term the relief camps as ?? concentration camps . ’’
At a ?? relief camp ’’ in Farsegad , 50 km from Bijapur on the Kutru - Sendra road , Pandri and Narendra Benja , siblings in their mid-teens , share a 10 ft by 10ft tent with five others .
They came here about four months ago along with a Salva Judum procession , leaving behind their parents .
Try asking them if they are happy , they keep quiet .
At the Cherpal camp on the Bijapur - Gangalur road , Sukku Korsa Munga stares blankly as if in a state of shock .
He has come from a village three km away with his family , but has nothing to eat .
??
We have n’t got the promised rice .
I am fetching it from my village where I now fear to go , ’’ he says .
??
He is among those who were not ready to join Judum .
Some of the villages are very stubborn , ’’ says Parsul Chandrayya , the local Judum president .
There are about 4,000 tribal boys and 400 girls doing the security duties as SPOs in the 16 camps in Dantewada district .
Every morning and evening , they have to line up for a training drill .
They are being trained in gunfight .
They are taken on a foot patrol around the camps and have to retaliate in case of a Naxalite attack .
They also have to go out into the jungles to protect the Salva Judum march from the Naxalites .
Apart from the regular state police , there are around 9,000 paramilitary personnel from Central and State Reserve Police , Chhattisgarh Armed battalion and Nagaland Armed Police giving them cover .
The NSG too also arrived last week .
But the tribals , by virtue of their knowledge of the deceptive terrain , have to be a part of most of the anti-insurgency operations undertaken by the police .
So , it is not surprising they are falling to Naxalite bullets .
At Gangalur village on January 29 , Naxalites posing as Judum workers first cleverly mingled with the processionists .
At midnight , along with their 500 - odd supporters , they laid a siege to the police station and massacred eight tribal activists of Salva Judum , four of them SPOs .
No one has the count of Judum supporters killed by the Naxalites since June , but the figures run into hundreds , locals say .
??
The government is just pulling it on .
There are not many who have joined it willingly and the police are using tribals as pawns against the Naxalites , ’’ says an activist .
??
Of course , the Naxalites are getting paid back on the same coin but the fact is the poor tribal pays the price in both cases . ’’
Salva Judum leaders , however , are emphatic in calling it a popular uprising against Naxalism .
Says Karma : ??
Some of our people had strayed out of the mainstream .
We are trying to bring them back . ’’
Shankar Nag and Mohan Mandavi from Farsegad say Naxalites are the enemies of humanity .
??
They have made our life miserable .
They must be dealt with sternly , ’’ they said .
Many are happy that they have got a gun and a police job for Rs 1,500 a month , but not all have yet got their money .
The biggest question is how long can the camps be sustained ?
??
Till the battle is won , ’’ says Karma .
But with the paddy season just three months away , the inmates will need to go back to their villages .
??
Yes , they will have to , but providing them security is our top priority , ’’ Singh says .
No other anguish is quite like that of the procrastinator .
He knows that the job has to get done , that putting it off just makes it harder , that the worry is worse than the work .
And yet he can't ... quite ... get ... started .
Procrastination seems built into human nature – the ancient Roman orator Cicero fretted about it , as did the Greek historian Thucydides .
Today , 95 per cent of people say that they sometimes procrastinate .
The real problem , though , is the 20 per cent of us who qualify as chronic procrastinators .
These are people who procrastinate so routinely that their work , finances or personal relationships suffer because of it .
At its worst , procrastination is a form of self - destructive behaviour , like drug addiction or chronic gambling .
Like them , its origins are mysterious , and its treatment difficult .
Now a new analysis of the psychological literature by a University of Calgary psychologist could help untangle what makes so many of us put off until tomorrow what we really should do today .
Piers Steel has just published a mammoth review of the scientific literature on procrastination in the journal Psychological Bulletin , and his conclusions are at odds with some conventional ideas .
" Some of them are dead wrong , " Steel says .
His research contradicts one major theory , which is that procrastinators suffer from anxiety and so have a harder time facing a difficult task .
Steel looked at the literature and found that statistically there 's very little correlation between anxiety and a tendency to procrastinate .
The same with the flattering idea that procrastinators are also perfectionists , people who care so much about doing it right that they can't bear to get started .
Again , Steel found no correlation .
What he did find is that procrastinators are less confident that they can handle a given task .
They 're also more impulsive and less conscientious overall .
" Whether you believe you can or you believe you can't , you 're right , " Steel says .
" Some of these old wives ' tales bear out .
People who believe they can are less likely to procrastinate . "
Steel 's paper is unlikely to be the final word on procrastination .
But it 's important because it 's the best attempt so far to analyze hundreds of psychological studies that have been conducted over a period of decades .
Part of the problem of procrastination is defining it in the first place .
We all have dozens of things we could be doing at any particular moment , and some of them have to be put off .
Prioritizing turns into procrastination when we know the job needs to be done , we know we 'll be worse off if we do n't do it , we intend to do it – and we still do n't do it .
It is profoundly irrational behaviour , and its very irrationality makes it tough for procrastinators and psychologists alike to understand .
Samuel Johnson , the prolific 18th - century writer and lexicographer , admitted to procrastinating himself , and described the remorse familiar to any procrastinator : " I could not forbear to reproach myself for having so long neglected what was unavoidably to be done , and of which every moment 's idleness increased the difficulty . "
But he also puzzled over what made people procrastinate when it was so clearly against their best interests .
" The folly of allowing ourselves to delay what we know cannot be finally escaped is one of the general weaknesses , " he concluded .
Steel thinks procrastination is probably an even bigger problem today .
We have more readily available distractions , like the Internet and computer games .
( Steel says he 's had problems with computer games himself . )
And many jobs are becoming more self - structured , which means it 's increasingly up to us to impose our own work goals and deadlines .
The harm caused by procrastination can be immense .
Steel points to a study by the tax - preparation firm H&R Block that says putting off doing their taxes costs U.S. citizens an average of $ 400 each because of errors due to the last - minute rush .
Even more irrationally , 70 per cent of patients suffering from glaucoma do n't get around to using their eye drops regularly , which could potentially result in blindness .
Fifty per cent of heart attack patients do n't manage to make the lifestyle changes that could save their lives .

" On the one hand , it 's easy to trivialize procrastination .
We joke about it , " says Timothy A. Pychyl , a psychologist at Carleton University who studies procrastination .
" But procrastination is self - defeating .
It 's a breakdown in volitional action .
I have an intention and I 'm not following through on it .
You 're not able to follow through on what you want to do . "
Over the years , psychologists have come up with a lot of ideas about what makes people procrastinate .
In addition to anxiety and perfectionism , some suggested that procrastinators were self - sabotaging , hostile and rebellious , or depressed .
But for Steel , procrastination can be explained by an insight borrowed from behavioural economics called hyperbolic discounting .
This is the tendency to value near - term rewards more than long - term ones .
For instance , some people will choose a payoff of $ 50 today over $ 100 tomorrow .
Steel combined hyperbolic discounting with a theory of motivation called expectancy theory , and came up with something he calls temporal motivational theory ( TMT ) .
It boils down to this :
Utility = E x V / Gamma D
Utility is the desirability of getting something done .
E is expectancy , or confidence .
V is the value of the job , and includes not only its importance but also its unpleasantness .
Gamma stands for how prone a person is to delay doing things .
And D means delay , or how far away the consequences of doing , or not doing , the task are .
The bigger the top number compared to the bottom , the less likely a task will be put off .
So if you expect to do well at a job ( E ) , and it 's a pleasant thing to do ( V ) , and you 're not prone to being delayed by distractions ( Gamma ) , and it has to be done right away ( D ) , you 're not likely to procrastinate .
If you expect to fail at a difficult task and you 're easily distracted and it does n't have to be done for quite awhile , you 're going to procrastinate .
" It 's a little bit unsettling that human nature can be reduced to an equation , " Steel says .
" But you can show that pretty much every major view of behaviour can be reduced to that . "
Perhaps not surprisingly , other procrastination experts do n't think it 's quite that simple .
" It makes an important contribution by summing it up , " says Pychyl .
" It does n't mean that he 's captured the whole phenomenon .
There are elements we still do n't understand about these self - defeating behaviours . "
Pychyl thinks it 's still too early to rule out anxiety , perfectionism , depression or other causes that have been suggested for procrastination .
William J. Knaus , a psychologist and author of Do It Now ! , a procrastination self - help book , says it 's a complex behaviour that 's far from being understood .
But he insists procrastinators can change .
" It 's a challenge , " he says , " but it 's doable .
We have enough of the tools now so that anyone who is serious about making strides and improvements can do so . "
Was given this newsworthy item from a Student for Ron Paul ( that ’s an actual organization , btw ) today :
I just spoke with a friend who knows the people who work in the Michigan GOP office .
He said the office “ ca n’t handle the volume ” and “ do n’t know what to do ” .
Saul Anuzis ’s blackberry is flooded with messages , his voicemail is already full , and Ron Paul supporters are starting to find new phone numbers to reach him .
They are totally freaked out .
He told me “ they decided to stop answering the phones for the rest of the day because right when they hung up with one Ron Paul supporter the phone started to ring with the next .
They could n’t get any work done ” .
And “ Saul has turned off his blackberry because he could n’t handle the overload ” .
He kept telling me how surprised they were at the amount of people calling and emailing .
They did n’t know what was going on or who was behind it all .
Total shock .
Let ’s not let this one die .
More phone calls and messages tomorrow .
Keep the discussion going at the Facebook group .

In a very interesting analysis last month , the former chief of staff of the Russian Army , Gen. Leonid Ivashov , predicted a U.S. nuclear strike on Iran by this April .
" Within weeks from now , " he wrote , " we will see the informational warfare machine start working .
The public opinion is already under pressure .
There will be a growing anti-Iranian militaristic hysteria , new information leaks , disinformation , etc . "
I 'm afraid this has the ring of truth .
Then you have Gen. Oded Tira , chief artillery officer of the Israeli Defense Forces declaring last month that " an American strike on Iran is essential " for the very existence of the Jewish State .
Suggesting that " President Bush lacks the political power to attack Iran , " he urgently appealed to the resurgent Democratic Party to work towards that Israeli goal .
" As an American strike in Iran is essential for our existence , " he declared , " we must help him pave the way by lobbying the Democratic Party ( which is conducting itself foolishly ) and US newspaper editors .
We need to do this in order to turn the Iranian issue to a bipartisan one and unrelated to the Iraq failure . "
Tira specifically urged the Israel Lobby in the U.S. to " turn to Hilary Clinton and other potential presidential candidates in the Democratic Party so that they support immediate action by Bush against Iran . "
The Lobby seems to be doing a great job at that , Tira 's criticisms about Democrats ' " foolishness " notwithstanding .
All the Democratic presidential frontrunners have assured AIPAC or Israeli audiences that they 're at least as hawkish on Iran as the unpopular Bush .
Meanwhile the Israeli allegation that Iran poses an " existential " threat to itself , made by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before the U.S. Congress last year , has insinuated its way into American official discourse .
Referring to the vaguely defined " war on terror " in general , Cheney recently told Fox News , " This is an existential conflict .
It is the kind of conflict that 's going to drive our policy and our government for the next 20 or 30 or 40 years . "
His daughter Elizabeth ( Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and the VP 's liaison with the spooky new " Office of Iranian Affairs " ) wrote in a Washington Post op - ed last month , " America faces an existential threat We will have to fight these terrorists to the death somewhere , sometime .
We ca n't negotiate with them or ' solve ' their jihad . "
The administration , still led by neocons clustered around Cheney , has embraced the Israeli rhetoric of paranoiac prophesy .
It has decided to attack the Islamic Republic , to end its existence , for the self - defense of Israel and America .
To gain support it must sow fear and must demonize Iran , ratcheting up the rhetoric week by week .
The " informational war machine " to which Ivashov alludes has been shoveling out disinformation faster than the public can digest , no doubt on the assumption that rumors even if later disproved can usefully damage reputations and set up targets for attack .
The Straussian neoconservatives who tirelessly campaigned to foist their Noble Lies about Iraq on the American people up to the Iraq attack in March 2003 might not much care if the lies they tell now about Iran are exposed down the road .
What they want is regime change soon and therefore , a compelling casus belli or two .
During the lead up to the Iraq War , the main charge against Baghdad ( skeptically received at the UN ) was that it possessed weapons of mass destruction threatening the whole world including New York City , which President Bush , Condoleezza Rice and other administration officials warned could result in a mushroom cloud over the Big Apple .
Bush and Cheney intimated to certain audiences that Iraq posed a particular threat to Israel , but in general this issue was downplayed , probably because the administration wanted to avoid the accusation that it was going to war " for Israel " as opposed to America or the mythic but impressive - sounding " international community . "
This time it 's different .
Although Israel attacked and destroyed Iraq 's French - built Osiraq nuclear rector in 1981 ( in an illegal action then condemned by the Reagan administration and virtually all other governments , although Cheney and his neocons find inspiration in it today ) , and although the Israeli government enthusiastically greeted the invasion of Iraq , it did n't overtly campaign for the war .
But now it is feverishly beating the drums for a U.S. war on Iran .
And as Cheney has pointedly noted , if the U.S. does n't attack Iran , " Israel might do it without being asked . "
Most likely it will , if it happens , be a joint effort .
Notice how the case against Iran articulated in Israel forms the bulk of the Bush administration 's brief .
It runs something like this .
Iran is a radical Islamist theocratic state that supports terrorists , including Lebanon 's Shiite Hizbollah ( which follows the teachings of Ayatollah Khomeini ) , and various Palestinian organizations .
It is large , powerful , and hostile to Israel , the only democracy in the Middle East .
The Iranian regime is anti-Semitic ; President Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust and calls for Israel to be " wiped off the map . "
Iran is concealing the existence of an illegal nuclear weapons program , a program that threatens the existence of the Jewish state .
Therefore it is guilty of " planning to commit genocide " --- just like that universally acknowledged incarnation of evil , Nazi Germany .
To this alarmist case , the U.S. propaganda mill adds the charges that Iran harbors al - Qaeda members ; provides improvised explosive device ( IED ) components to " insurgents " in Iraq , who use them to kill Americans ; and generally " meddles " in Iraq .
( One should ask how those occupying a country , against the will of its people , 6000 miles from U.S. shores can talk about a neighboring country sharing a 600 mile border with Iraq , a common Shiite religious faith and 3000 years of incessant interaction can complain about Iranian " meddling " with a straight face .
Especially when they cherish their own right to meddle in Latin America whenever it pleases them . )
But these flimsy charges have n't been at the top of the list .
The main issue , as in the Iraq case , is the WMD one , and specifically the future prospect of an Iranian nuclear attack on Israel producing a second Holocaust .
From the ( often Israeli - American dual national ) neocons ' point of view , what can you do as an encore after terrifying Americans with the vision of mushroom clouds over New York ?
What image has the terrifying power of that one ?
Why , genocide of course !
The conscious , evil , extermination of a whole people --- in this case a people regarded by many American evangelical Christians as God 's Chosen People , whose miraculous reestablishment of a state in the twentieth century fulfilled biblical prophecy and whose state indeed augurs the yearned - for Second Coming of Christ .
This genocide issue looks like the ideal issue to get the American people on board a massive , likely nuclear , assault on Iran .
In December , following lots of discussion in Israel on this issue , outgoing U.S. UN Ambassador John Bolton called on the UN International Court of Criminal Justice to charge Ahmadinejad with " inciting genocide . "
" It 's time to take action , " Bolton told a Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations symposium .
" We 're being given early warning , unambiguously , on what his intentions are . "
There was apparently no doubt in Bolton 's mind that Iran wants to kill all Israelis .
( For the record , Bolton has in the past asserted confidently that Cuba 's widely admired pharmaceutical research projects are actually a front for the development of biological weapons .
The State Department itself , embarrassed and acknowledging no evidence for this claim , had to shut him up . )
Also last December , former Israeli Prime Minister and Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu summoned seventy foreign diplomats in Israel to a meeting to pressure them to join Israel in efforts to stop Iran 's nuclear program .
According to a report in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz , the meeting was " the first event in an international public relations campaign .
It will include a proposal to file a complaint in the International Court of Justice against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for war crimes , and his plans to commit genocide will be presented . "
" We must cry Gevalt before the entire world , " declared Netanyahu .
( Gevalt : a Yiddish expression of shock or dismay . )
" In 1938 , Hitler did n't say he wanted to destroy [ the Jews ] ; Ahmadinejad is saying clearly that this is his intention , and we are n't even shouting .
At least call it a crime against humanity .
We must make the world see that the issue here is a program for genocide . "
But Netanyahu ( like Gen. Tira ) is probably much more concerned about American public opinion than that of " the world . "
He knows that the average American hearing the official Israeli case , ill - equipped to challenge its vilifying assumptions , might actually be inclined to embrace it .
Ignorance and fear are excellent allies here , and should be countered with some rational presentation of historical fact , the neocon propagandists ' great enemy .
Most Americans do not suspect , for example , that Hizbollah ( which Israel tried in vain to destroy last summer ) is a popular political party in Lebanon , where it represents the Shiite population and is respected for the efficient social services it provides .
It emerged as a resistance movement among the Shiites in the south after the Israeli invasion of 1982 .
( Initially , many Shiites had actually welcomed the Israelis , since they were targeting the PLO at a time of considerable conflict between Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese .
But the occupying troops were deeply hated , and resistance mounted . )
Most Americans do n't know that in the last parliamentary election Hizbollah and its allies won 27 % of the total seats .
It had ministers in the Lebanese cabinet before withdrawing them recently in protest of the U.S. - backed prime minister 's policies .
It has radio and television stations .
Hizbollah is widely credited with forcing the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 , and can attract hundreds of thousands , even a million protesters to demonstrate in a country of 3.8 million .
It has forged an alliance with General Michel Aoun , a Christian military leader who once fought against Syrian forces and now heads a mainly Christian political party .
Netanyahu knows that few Americans think about these things when they hear him describe Hizbollah as a " terrorist organization . "
Nor do most Americans know much about the Palestinian organizations that Iran supports with office space , funds , or weapons .
They 've probably heard of Hamas , but have no idea whether it 's Shiite - based ( and thus connected to Iran religiously ) , or Sunni and less influenced ideologically by Iran .
( It is Sunni . )
They may not realize that Hamas grew up in opposition to the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( once categorized as a " terrorist " organization by the U.S. but later recognized by Israel --- and funded by the U.S. and other countries --- in the form of the " Palestinian Authority " ) and are widely seen as more honest , capable and pious than the PLO politicians widely associated with corruption , inefficiency and secularism .
They may not realize that Hamas handily won the last Palestinian elections , which were fair and fairly reflected the sentiments of the Palestinian people .
They may not sense a contradiction between President Bush 's rhetoric about " democracy in the Middle East " and his government 's refusal to accept a democratically elected government in Palestine .
They may not know that Hamas called and maintained a ceasefire with Israel for 16 months before June 2006 ( when Israeli artillery shells killed seven Palestinians , including three children , at a family picnic on a crowded Gaza beach ) .
And they certainly know little of the histories of other Iran - backed Palestinian organizations .
That makes them easy targets for anti-Muslim disinformation campaigns in general .
Most Americans are sheltered from news reports about Palestinian life under Israeli occupation , or in the vast prison - camp of Gaza .
They are conditioned to perceive Arab and Muslim hostility to Israel as a reflection of anti-Semitism and religious animosity and intolerance , rather than understandable reaction to the historical experience of Palestinian displacement and abuse , repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon , continued construction of illegal Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank , annexation of the Golan Heights , etc .
They are inclined to believe that Israel , as a " democracy , " is America 's natural ally in the Middle East , while many American Christians are convinced that its very existence is in fulfillment of biblical prophesy .
Netanyahu understands all this , basking in the glow of the evangelicals ' adulation and perhaps marveling at their gullibility .
The American media has repeated ad infinitum the report that Ahmadinejad has called for Israel to be wiped off the map .
This matter - of - fact acceptance of the validity of the quote has been a huge boon to the vilifying warmongers .
The Persian - language statement , which has now been analyzed and translated by several western scholars , in fact makes no reference to any map at all .
http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/jonathan_steele/2006/06/post_155.html
What Ahmadinejad said , quoting Ayatollah Khomeini ( who died in 1989 ) was that " the occupation of Jerusalem " will be " erased from the page of time . "
The statement is a bit vague and in poetic language but makes no reference to a map at all , to say nothing of genocide .
Yet Bolton and Netanyahu want us to read it as a clear intention that Ahmadinejad wants to destroy all Jews !
Ahmadinejad used the quote in a speech noting that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , the Soviet Union itself , and the regime of Saddam Hussein all ended in time , as he maintained the Israeli occupation of one of Islam 's holiest cities would too .
It 's true that the Iranian president has made provocative statements questioning the occurrence of the Holocaust .
But his political powers are limited , he does not control foreign policy , and he faces substantial criticism from other members of the Iranian power elite .
Mohammad Khatami , Ahmadinejad 's predecessor as president from 1997 to 2005 and still an influential player in the Iranian power structure , has pointedly distanced himself from Ahmadinejad 's comment , telling an Arab audience that the Holocaust was " an historical fact . "
But then , he 's an internationally respected proponent of the " dialogue of civilizations " who while in power sought better relations with the U.S. , only to be rebuffed .
Anyway Americans do n't hear much about differences among Iranian leaders ; we 're encouraged to see them all as threatening and vile .
When in February 2003 Secretary Colin Powell 's lieutenant Richard Armitage matter - of - factly called Iran a " democracy , " Cheney 's neocons were all over him .
Americans are n't supposed to know that Iran has hotly contested elections , even though all candidates for office must be approved by the Guardian Council of six jurists elected by the Majlis ( Parliament ) and six clerics chosen by the Supreme Leader , who is himself elected by a parliamentary body of 86 people .
( Basically , the democratic process is constrained by repressive religious oversight .
But that happens elsewhere too .
Note that Israeli " democracy " is predicated on the idea that any Jew from anywhere arriving in Israel gets citizenship and voting rights .
Israeli Arabs have these rights too , but they do not exist among the four million strong Palestinian exile community denied their right of return . )
But back to the big issue , the putative nuclear weapons program that might someday destroy Israel .
The U.S. press refers routinely to " Iran 's nuclear weapons program " as though it obviously had one , while most Americans do n't know that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , actually issued a fatwa against the production , stockpiling or use of nuclear weapons in 2005 .
Most know that Iran is enriching uranium , but probably do n't know that all countries have the right to enrich uranium , and that countries without nuclear weapons programs ( like Japan , Germany , the Netheralnds , Brazil ) have enriched it without American protest .
Signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty are in fact guaranteed the right to do so , so long as they renounce nuclear weapons development and submit to IAEA inspection --- as Iran has done .
( Indeed , Iran has submitted to unprecedentedly intrusive UN inspections . )
Meanwhile , countries that have n't signed the treaty ( like India , Pakistan , and Israel , non-signatories that have nuclear weapons ) are n't legally bound to its terms at all !
Americans might ask :
Why do these three countries enjoy such close relations with the U.S. despite their defiance of the nonproliferation regimen the U.S. demands Iran respect ?
( North Korea was a signatory but withdrew from the Treaty in 2003 in the face of unremitting U.S. hostility and tested nuclear weapons in 2006 . )
Most Americans probably do n't know that Mohamed ElBaradei , Nobel Peace Prize laureate and head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , a man who understands the science , keeps saying there is no evidence that Iran 's enrichment program is related to a military program .
True , he declared , after a meeting with Condi Rice in March 2006 ( in which she agreed to lift U.S. efforts to fire him as IAEA head ) , that the IAEA was " not at this point in time in a position to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran . "
The Bush administration has used that convoluted double - negative statement , and the September 2005 IAEA statement on Iran , to justify its preparations for war .
According to that statement Iran 's " many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its NPT Safeguards Agreement [ voluntarily signed by Iran in 2003 ] constitute non-compliance " with the Non-Proliferation Treaty , while the " history of concealment of Iran 's nuclear activities " and " resulting absence of confidence that Iran 's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes have given rise to questions that are within the competence of the Security Council . "
Most Americans do n't realize that this statement was actually opposed by 13 of the 35 voting countries ( including Russia , China , Pakistan , Brazil , Mexico , Nigeria , Venezuela and South Africa ) but backed by NATO country representatives voting as a bloc .
( This was used to produce UNSC Resolution 1737 , which having affirmed the right of Non-Proliferation Treaty signatories " to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination , " contradictorily " decides " that " Iran shall without further delay suspendall [ uranium ] enrichment - related and reprocessing activities . " )
Misled by politicians ( including AIPAC heroine Hilary Clinton ) and poorly served by the mainstream news media , many Americans just might swallow the accusation that Iran is planning genocide , in league with Hizbollah and Hamas .
Some might believe that a nuclear Iran would somehow threaten the Homeland , perhaps by sharing nuclear arms with terrorist groups .
More might believe that Iran is at least developing nuclear weapons , following Dick Cheney 's reasoning that Iran with all its oil can only be pursuing a nuclear program with weapons in mind .
( They might not know that in the 1970s , U.S. administrations and corporations such as General Electric were encouraging Iran to develop a peaceful nuclear program !
But that was when Iran was under the Shah , a U.S. client toppled in the most mass - based genuine revolutionary upheaval in the modern history of Islamic countries in 1979 . )
But there is in fact no reason to suppose that Iran plans to attack any country .
It has not , for the record , in modern times although it was itself attacked by Iraq ( supported by the U.S. ) from 1980 to 1988 .
The closest it came to invading a neighboring country came in 1998 , when following the killing of seven Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan , Tehran mobilized against the Taliban regime .
( In 2001 it cooperated with Washington to topple that regime and replace it with one rooted in the Northern Alliance forces . )
In August 2006 Ahmadinejad stated that Iran was not a threat to any country , " not even to the Zionist regime . "
French President Jacques Chirac recently acknowledged , in an unguarded honest moment , that even if Iran had a few nuclear weapons it would still be " not very dangerous . "
It is ludicrous to depict the Iranian regime as a menace to the United States , which has half the world 's total military budget , troops based in 120 countries , and bases surrounding ( and threatening ) Iran in Afghanistan and Iraq .
As former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson has revealed , the State Department received an Iranian offer in mid-2003 to end support for Palestinian militant groups , cooperate with the U.S. in stabilizing Iraq and settling the Israeli - Arab dispute , and make its nuclear program more transparent .
In return Iran asked for an end for U.S. support for the Mujahadeen Khalq Iranian militant group based in Iraq , withdrawal of trade sanctions and an end to U.S. hostility .
Welcomed by Powell , the overture was contemptuously rejected by Cheney 's office - much as overtures from Iraq and Syria had been summarily rejected earlier by officials saying , " We do n't negotiate with evil , we defeat it . "
Is it not obvious that any strike against Israel or the U.S. from Iran would result in unacceptable consequences for the Islamic Republic ?
Is it not obvious that Netanyahu 's sensationalistic genocide charge is part of a general propaganda campaign intended to pave the way for an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation ?
In Israel itself , supposedly marked for annihilation , the putative Iranian threat is hyped by some , downplayed by others .
Efraim Halevy , former head of the dreaded spy agency Mossad , recently dismissed the notion that Iran poses " an existential threat to Israel . "
" Israel is indestructible today , " he declared .
" It 's not so simple just to think you
can have a device on your hand and you will able to hurl it on to a certain location and wipe out a nation Israel has known of this threat [ from Iran ] for more than a decade - and - a half and has watched this threat grow ­ you must assume that Israel was not sitting on its hands ... or [ waiting ] for someone else to do the job " Can Iran destroy Israel ?
" I do n't think this is doable in pure operational terms . "
So enjoy what Ha'aretz called the " international public relations campaign , " the general the " informational warfare machine " as it heats up .
Expect to be told more and more in the coming weeks that Iran is not only killing U.S. troops in Iraq , but threatening your very existence .
Imagine the boldest of Straussian " Noble Lies " screaming from your TV screens for weeks .
Iran 's fanatical leaders , we 'll be told , want a caliphate stretching from Spain to Indonesia .
They want mushroom clouds over New York .
They want genocide --- indeed they 're already planning genocide .
And so ( as Bush and Hilary both declare ) " nothing is off the table " when it comes to " dealing " with the Islamic Republic .
Gevalt !
Netanyahu cries .
" Gevalt ! " one should reply to the warmongers , and ask :
How have these shameless disinformation artists fooled so many people about this Iran ' threat ' ?
How has a discredited administration brought us so close to another crime against peace as defined by the Nuremburg Principles and United Nations Charter ?
How has the Iran attack lobby acquired such political clout in this country ?
How have shrewd political manipulators even been able in any respectable forum to connect opposition to the slaughter of Iranians with anti-Semitism ?
How did the 9 - 11 attacks of receding memory propel this country into such an era of madness ?
How can the Democrats swept to power in a wave of antiwar revulsion sit on the fence or actively assist as the administration plans to use its own ( real , existing ) nuclear weapons on Iran ?
Gevalt indeed !
Ivashov doubts that " the world 's protests can stop the U.S. " and suggests that " the revenues of [ the U.S. ] military - industrial complex " is what " matters to Americans . "
I can only hope we prove him wrong , mobilizing to end the Iraq War , to impeach the war criminals in power , and to stop the attacks on Iran and Syria before they start .

In the U.S. being on time is the rule .
In other places , such as Latin America punctuality is rare .
Why ?
Social psychologists have ascribed the differences to deep cultural facts , religion , and “ national personalities . ”
One theory , for example , has it that the changing of the seasons in more northern latitudes induces a greater respect for time – plant a little late or early and frost will wipe out your crop .
In Punctuality : A Cultural Trait as Equilibrium game theorists Kaushik Basu and Jorgen Weibull make a simple but important point .
If I think you are going to be late then it ’s costly for me to be on time so I will choose to be late .
But if I choose to be late then it makes sense for you to choose to be late also .
Indeed , if I think that you think that I might be late then I will be late !
In other words , lateness is a Nash equilibrium of a game .
Punctuality is also an equilibrium .
If you are going to be on time it make sense for me to be on time also ( especially if you can punish me for not being on time . )
Which equilibrium is played can be as arbitrary as the forces that determine which side of the road we drive on .
Basu and Weibull write :
A social scientist who neglects the strategic aspect may be tempted to believe that if two societies exhibit sharply different behaviors , then they must have innate differences , such as different preferences or different religious outlooks on life or different genes .
What we have just seen is that none of this is necessary .
Some of the ‘ cultural ’ differences that we observe across societies could simply be manifestations of different equilibria in otherwise identical societies .
If the theory is correct then it should be possible , with a one - time push , to change an entire people from tardy to punctual virtually overnight in much the same way that Sweden switched to driving on the right - hand side of the road ( precisely at 5 am , by the way , on Sunday morning , September 3 , 1967 ) .
The theory is currently being tested in Ecuador , a country where , according to some estimates , habitual lateness costs 4.3 percent of GDP !
Thus a national campaign is aiming to change the equilibrium .
Hundreds of institutions ranging from local councils to airlines have signed up to a promise to keep to time .
Stragglers are barred from entering meetings .
Hotel - style door signs have appeared in offices and schools .
On one side , they say “ Come in : You ’re on time ” and on the other “ Do not enter : the meeting began on time . ”
A local newspaper is publishing a daily list of public officials who turn up late to events .
In related news , physicists are now measuring time in attoseconds , one quintillionth ( 10E - 18 ) of a second .
For many that come briefly into contact with Extreme Programming , it seems that XP calls for the death of software design .
Not just is much design activity ridiculed as " Big Up Front Design " , but such design techniques as the UML , flexible frameworks , and even patterns are de-emphasized or downright ignored .
In fact XP involves a lot of design , but does it in a different way than established software processes .
XP has rejuvenated the notion of evolutionary design with practices that allow evolution to become a viable design strategy .
It also provides new challenges and skills as designers need to learn how to do a simple design , how to use refactoring to keep a design clean , and how to use patterns in an evolutionary style .
Extreme Programming ( XP ) challenges many of the common assumptions about software development .
Of these one of the most controversial is its rejection of significant effort in up - front design , in favor of a more evolutionary approach .
To its detractors this is a return to " code and fix " development - usually derided as hacking .
To its fans it is often seen as a rejection of design techniques ( such as the UML ) , principles and patterns .
Do n't worry about design , if you listen to your code a good design will appear .
I find myself at the center of this argument .
Much of my career has involved graphical design languages - the Unified Modeling Language ( UML ) and its forerunners - and in patterns .
Indeed I 've written books on both the UML and patterns .
Does my embrace of XP mean I recant all of what I 've written on these subjects , cleansing my mind of all such counter - revolutionary notions ?
Well I 'm not going to expect that I can leave you dangling on the hook of dramatic tension .
The short answer is no .
The long answer is the rest of this paper .
Planned and Evolutionary Design
For this paper I 'm going to describe two styles how design is done in software development .
Perhaps the most common is evolutionary design .
Essentially evolutionary design means that the design of the system grows as the system is implemented .
Design is part of the programming processes and as the program evolves the design changes .
In its common usage , evolutionary design is a disaster .
The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad - hoc tactical decisions , each of which makes the code harder to alter .
In many ways you might argue this is no design , certainly it usually leads to a poor design .
As Kent puts it , design is there to enable you to keep changing the software easily in the long term .
As design deteriorates , so does your ability to make changes effectively .
You have the state of software entropy , over time the design gets worse and worse .
Not only does this make the software harder to change , it also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely kill .
This is the " code and fix " nightmare , where the bugs become exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on .
Planned Design is a counter to this , and contains a notion born from other branches of engineering .
If you want to build a doghouse , you can just get some wood together and get a rough shape .
However if you want to build a skyscraper , you can't work that way - it'll just collapse before you even get half way up .
So you begin with engineering drawings , done in an engineering office like the one my wife works at in downtown Boston .
As she does the design she figures out all the issues , partly by mathematical analysis , but mostly by using building codes .
Building codes are rules about how you design structures based on experience of what works ( and some underlying math ) .
Once the design is done , then her engineering company can hand the design off to another company that builds it .
Planned design in software should work the same way .
Designers think out the big issues in advance .
They do n't need to write code because they are n't building the software , they are designing it .
So they can use a design technique like the UML that gets away from some of the details of programming and allows the designers to work at a more abstract level .
Once the design is done they can hand it off to a separate group ( or even a separate company ) to build .
Since the designers are thinking on a larger scale , they can avoid the series of tactical decisions that lead to software entropy .
The programmers can follow the direction of the design and , providing they follow the design , have a well built system
Now the planned design approach has been around since the 70s , and lots of people have used it .
It is better in many ways than code and fix evolutionary design .
But it has some faults .
The first fault is that it 's impossible to think through all the issues that you need to deal with when you are programming .
So it 's inevitable that when programming you will find things that question the design .
However if the designers are done , moved onto another project , what happens ?
The programmers start coding around the design and entropy sets in .
Even if the designer is n't gone , it takes time to sort out the design issues , change the drawings , and then alter the code .
There 's usually a quicker fix and time pressure .
Hence entropy ( again ) .
Furthermore there 's often a cultural problem .
Designers are made designers due to skill and experience , but they are so busy working on designs they do n't get much time to code any more .
However the tools and materials of software development change at a rapid rate .
When you no longer code not just can you miss out on changes that occur with this technological flux , you also lose the respect of those who do code .
This tension between builders and designers happens in building too , but it 's more intense in software .
It 's intense because there is a key difference .
In building there is a clearer division in skills between those who design and those who build , but in software that 's less the case .
Any programmer working in high design environments needs to be very skilled .
Skilled enough to question the designer 's designs , especially when the designer is less knowledgeable about the day to day realities of the development platform .
Now these issues could be fixed .
Maybe we can deal with the human tension .
Maybe we can get designers skillful enough to deal with most issues and have a process disciplined enough to change the drawings .
There 's still another problem : changing requirements .
Changing requirements are the number one big issue that causes headaches in software projects that I run into .
One way to deal with changing requirements is to build flexibility into the design so that you can easily change it as the requirements change .
However this requires insight into what kind of changes you expect .
A design can be planned to deal with areas of volatility , but while that will help for foreseen requirements changes , it wo n't help ( and can hurt ) for unforeseen changes .
So you have to understand the requirements well enough to separate the volatile areas , and my observation is that this is very hard .
Now some of these requirements problems are due to not understanding requirements clearly enough .
So a lot of people focus on requirements engineering processes to get better requirements in the hope that this will prevent the need to change the design later on .
But even this direction is one that may not lead to a cure .
Many unforeseen requirements changes occur due to changes in the business .
Those can't be prevented , however careful your requirements engineering process .
So all this makes planned design sound impossible .
Certainly they are big challenges .
But I 'm not inclined to claim that planned design is worse than evolutionary design as it is most commonly practiced in a " code and fix " manner .
Indeed I prefer planned design to " code and fix " .
However I 'm aware of the problems of planned design and am seeking a new direction .
The Enabling Practices of XP XP is controversial for many reasons , but one of the key red flags in XP is that it advocates evolutionary design rather than planned design .
As we know , evolutionary design can't possibly work due to ad hoc design decisions and software entropy .
At the core of understanding this argument is the software change curve .
The change curve says that as the project runs , it becomes exponentially more expensive to make changes .
The change curve is usually expressed in terms of phases " a change made in analysis for $ 1 would cost thousands to fix in production " .
This is ironic as most projects still work in an ad - hoc process that does n't have an analysis phase , but the exponentiation is still there .
The exponential change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work .
It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation .
The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work .
This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP .
This is part of the coupling of the XP practices : specifically you can't do those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing those things that enable the flattening .
This is a common source of the controversy over XP .
Many people criticize the exploitation without understanding the enabling .
Often the criticisms stem from critics ' own experience where they did n't do the enabling practices that allow the exploiting practices to work .
As a result they got burned and when they see XP they remember the fire .
There are many parts to the enabling practices .
At the core are the practices of Testing , and Continuous Integration .
Without the safety provided by testing the rest of XP would be impossible .
Continuous Integration is necessary to keep the team in sync , so that you can make a change and not be worried about integrating it with other people .
Together these practices can have a big effect on the change curve .
I was reminded of this again here at ThoughtWorks .
Introducing testing and continuous integration had a marked improvement on the development effort .
Certainly enough to seriously question the XP assertion that you need all the practices to get a big improvement .
Refactoring has a similar effect .
People who refactor their code in the disciplined manner suggested by XP find a significant difference in their effectiveness compared to doing looser , more ad - hoc restructuring .
That was certainly my experience once Kent had taught me to refactor properly .
After all , only such a strong change would have motivated me to write a whole book about it .
Jim Highsmith , in his excellent summary of XP , uses the analogy of a set of scales .
In one tray is planned design , the other is refactoring .
In more traditional approaches planned design dominates because the assumption is that you can't change your mind later .
As the cost of change lowers then you can do more of your design later as refactoring .
Planned design does not go away completely , but there is now a balance of two design approaches to work with .
For me it feels like that before refactoring I was doing all my design one - handed .
These enabling practices of continuous integration , testing , and refactoring , provide a new environment that makes evolutionary design plausible .
However one thing we have n't yet figured out is where the balance point is .
I 'm sure that , despite the outside impression , XP is n't just test , code , and refactor .
There is room for designing before coding .
Some of this is before there is any coding , most of it occurs in the iterations before coding for a particular task .
But there is a new balance between up - front design and refactoring .
The Value of Simplicity Two of the greatest rallying cries in XP are the slogans " Do the Simplest Thing that Could Possibly Work " and " You Are n't Going to Need It " ( known as YAGNI ) .
Both are manifestations of the XP practice of Simple Design .
The way YAGNI is usually described , it says that you should n't add any code today which will only be used by feature that is needed tomorrow .
On the face of it this sounds simple .
The issue comes with such things as frameworks , reusable components , and flexible design .
Such things are complicated to build .
You pay an extra up - front cost to build them , in the expectation that you will gain back that cost later .
This idea of building flexibility up - front is seen as a key part of effective software design .
However XP 's advice is that you not build flexible components and frameworks for the first case that needs that functionality .
Let these structures grow as they are needed .
If I want a Money class today that handles addition but not multiplication then I build only addition into the Money class .
Even if I 'm sure I 'll need multiplication in the next iteration , and understand how to do it easily , and think it 'll be really quick to do , I 'll still leave it till that next iteration .
One reason for this is economic .
If I have to do any work that 's only used for a feature that 's needed tomorrow , that means I lose effort from features that need to be done for this iteration .
The release plan says what needs to be worked on now , working on other things in the future is contrary to the developers agreement with the customer .
There is a risk that this iteration 's stories might not get done .
Even if this iteration 's stories are not at risk it 's up to the customer to decide what extra work should be done - and that might still not involve multiplication .
This economic disincentive is compounded by the chance that we may not get it right .
However certain we may be about how this function works , we can still get it wrong - especially since we do n't have detailed requirements yet .
Working on the wrong solution early is even more wasteful than working on the right solution early .
And the XPerts generally believe that we are much more likely to be wrong than right ( and I agree with that sentiment . )
The second reason for simple design is that a complex design is more difficult to understand than a simple design .
Therefore any modification of the system is made harder by added complexity .
This adds a cost during the period between when the more complicated design was added and when it was needed .
Now this advice strikes a lot of people as nonsense , and they are right to think that .
Right providing that you imagine the usual development world where the enabling practices of XP are n't in place .
However when the balance between planned and evolutionary design alters , then YAGNI becomes good practice ( and only then ) .
So to summarize .
You do n't want to spend effort adding new capability that wo n't be needed until a future iteration .
And even if the cost is zero , you still do n't want to add it because it increases the cost of modification even if it costs nothing to put in .
However you can only sensibly behave this way when you are using XP , or a similar technique that lowers the cost of change .
What on Earth is Simplicity Anyway
So we want our code to be as simple as possible .
That does n't sound like that 's too hard to argue for , after all who wants to be complicated ?
But of course this begs the question " what is simple ? "
In XPE Kent gives four criteria for a simple system .
In order ( most important first ) : Runs all the Tests
No duplication
Reveals all the intention
Fewest number of classes or methods Running all the tests is a pretty simple criterion .
No duplication is also pretty straightforward , although a lot of developers need guidance on how to achieve it .
The tricky one has to do with revealing the intention .
What exactly does that mean ?
The basic value here is clarity of code .
XP places a high value on code that is easily read .
In XP " clever code " is a term of abuse .
But some people 's intention revealing code is another 's cleverness .
In his XP 2000 paper , Josh Kerievsky points out a good example of this .
He looks at possibly the most public XP code of all - JUnit .
JUnit uses decorators to add optional functionality to test cases , such things as concurrency synchronization and batch set up code .
By separating out this code into decorators it allows the general code to be clearer than it otherwise would be .
But you have to ask yourself if the resulting code is really simple .
For me it is , but then I 'm familiar with the Decorator pattern .
But for many that are n't it 's quite complicated .
Similarly JUnit uses pluggable methods which I 've noticed most people initially find anything but clear .
So might we conclude that JUnit 's design is simpler for experienced designers but more complicated for less experienced people ?
I think that the focus on eliminating duplication , both with XP 's " Once and Only Once " and the Pragmatic Programmer 's DRY ( Do n't Repeat Yourself ) is one of those obvious and wonderfully powerful pieces of good advice .
Just following that alone can take you a long way .
But it is n't everything , and simplicity is still a complicated thing to find .
Recently I was involved in doing something that may well be over - designed .
It got refactored and some of the flexibility was removed .
But as one of the developers said " it 's easier to refactor over - design than it is to refactor no design . "
It 's best to be a little simpler than you need to be , but it is n't a disaster to be a little more complex .
The best advice I heard on all this came from Uncle Bob ( Robert Martin ) .
His advice was not to get too hung up about what the simplest design is .
After all you can , should , and will refactor it later .
In the end the willingness to refactor is much more important than knowing what the simplest thing is right away .
Does Refactoring Violate YAGNI ?
This topic came up on the XP mailing list recently , and it 's worth bringing out as we look at the role of design in XP .
Basically the question starts with the point that refactoring takes time but does not add function .
Since the point of YAGNI is that you are supposed to design for the present not for the future , is this a violation ?
The point of YAGNI is that you do n't add complexity that is n't needed for the current stories .
This is part of the practice of simple design .
Refactoring is needed to keep the design as simple as you can , so you should refactor whenever you realize you can make things simpler .
Simple design both exploits XP practices and is also an enabling practice .
Only if you have testing , continuous integration , and refactoring can you practice simple design effectively .
But at the same time keeping the design simple is essential to keeping the change curve flat .
Any unneeded complexity makes a system harder to change in all directions except the one you anticipate with the complex flexibility you put in .
However people are n't good at anticipating , so it 's best to strive for simplicity .
However people wo n't get the simplest thing first time , so you need to refactor in order get closer to the goal .
Patterns and XP
The JUnit example leads me inevitably into bringing up patterns .
The relationship between patterns and XP is interesting , and it's a common question .
Joshua Kerievsky argues that patterns are under - emphasized in XP and he makes the argument eloquently , so I do n't want to repeat that .
But it 's worth bearing in mind that for many people patterns seem in conflict to XP .
The essence of this argument is that patterns are often over -used .
The world is full of the legendary programmer , fresh off his first reading of GOF who includes sixteen patterns in 32 lines of code .
I remember one evening , fueled by a very nice single malt , running through with Kent a paper to be called " Not Design Patterns : 23 cheap tricks "
We were thinking of such things as use an if statement rather than a strategy .
The joke had a point , patterns are often overused , but that does n't make them a bad idea .
The question is how you use them .
One theory of this is that the forces of simple design will lead you into the patterns .
Many refactorings do this explicitly , but even without them by following the rules of simple design you will come up with the patterns even if you do n't know them already .
This may be true , but is it really the best way of doing it ?
Surely it 's better if you know roughly where you 're going and have a book that can help you through the issues instead of having to invent it all yourself .
I certainly still reach for GOF whenever I feel a pattern coming on .
For me effective design argues that we need to know the price of a pattern is worth paying - that 's its own skill .
Similarly , as Joshua suggests , we need to be more familiar about how to ease into a pattern gradually .
In this regard XP treats the way we use patterns differently to the way some people use them , but certainly does n't remove their value .
But reading some of the mailing lists I get the distinct sense that many people see XP as discouraging patterns , despite the irony that most of the proponents of XP were leaders of the patterns movement too .
Is this because they have seen beyond patterns , or because patterns are so embedded in their thinking that they no longer realize it ?
I do n't know the answers for others , but for me patterns are still vitally important .
XP may be a process for development , but patterns are a backbone of design knowledge , knowledge that is valuable whatever your process may be .
Different processes may use patterns in different ways .
XP emphasizes both not using a pattern until it 's needed and evolving your way into a pattern via a simple implementation .
But patterns are still a key piece of knowledge to acquire .
My advice to XPers using patterns would be Invest time in learning about patterns
Concentrate on when to apply the pattern ( not too early )
Concentrate on how to implement the pattern in its simplest form first , then add complexity later .
If you put a pattern in , and later realize that it is n't pulling its weight - do n't be afraid to take it out again .
I think XP should emphasize learning about patterns more .
I 'm not sure how I would fit that into XP 's practices , but I 'm sure Kent can come up with a way .
Growing an Architecture
What do we mean by a software architecture ?
To me the term architecture conveys a notion of the core elements of the system , the pieces that are difficult to change .
A foundation on which the rest must be built .
What role does an architecture play when you are using evolutionary design ?
Again XPs critics state that XP ignores architecture , that XP 's route is to go to code fast and trust that refactoring that will solve all design issues .
Interestingly they are right , and that may well be weakness .
Certainly the most aggressive XPers - Kent Beck , Ron Jeffries , and Bob Martin - are putting more and more energy into avoiding any up front architectural design .
Do n't put in a database until you really know you 'll need it .
Work with files first and refactor the database in during a later iteration .
My colleague Neal Ford has delved deeper into the techniques for evolutionary design in a fifteen article series for IBM developerWorks .
He 's also delved into video with a workshop on agile engineering practices for O'Reilly .
I 'm known for being a cowardly XPer , and as such I have to disagree .
I think there is a role for a broad starting point architecture .
Such things as stating early on how to layer the application , how you 'll interact with the database ( if you need one ) , what approach to use to handle the web server .
Essentially I think many of these areas are patterns that we 've learned over the years .
As your knowledge of patterns grows , you should have a reasonable first take at how to use them .
However the key difference is that these early architectural decisions are n't expected to be set in stone , or rather the team knows that they may err in their early decisions , and should have the courage to fix them .
Others have told the story of one project that , close to deployment , decided it did n't need EJB anymore and removed it from their system .
It was a sizeable refactoring , it was done late , but the enabling practices made it not just possible , but worthwhile .
How would this have worked the other way round .
If you decided not to use EJB , would it be harder to add it later ?
Should you thus never start with EJB until you have tried things without and found it lacking ?
That 's a question that involves many factors .
Certainly working without a complex component increases simplicity and makes things go faster .
However sometimes it 's easier to rip out something like that than it is to put it in .
So my advice is to begin by assessing what the likely architecture is .
If you see a large amount of data with multiple users , go ahead and use a database from day 1 .
If you see complex business logic , put in a domain model .
However in deference to the gods of YAGNI , when in doubt err on the side of simplicity .
Also be ready to simplify your architecture as soon as you see that part of the architecture is n't adding anything .
UML and XP
Of all the questions I get about my involvement with XP one of the biggest revolves around my association with the UML .
Are n't the two incompatible ?
There are a number of points of incompatibility .
Certainly XP de-emphasizes diagrams to a great extent .
Although the official position is along the lines of " use them if they are useful " , there is a strong subtext of " real XPers do n't do diagrams " .
This is reinforced by the fact that people like Kent are n't at all comfortable with diagrams , indeed I 've never seen Kent voluntarily draw a software diagram in any fixed notation I think the issue comes from two separate causes .
One is the fact that some people find software diagrams helpful and some people do n't .
The danger is that those who do think that those who do n't should do and vice - versa .
Instead we should just accept that some people will use diagrams and some wo n't .
The other issue is that software diagrams tend to get associated with a heavyweight process .
Such processes spend a lot of time drawing diagrams that do n't help and can actually cause harm .
So I think that people should be advised how to use diagrams well and avoid the traps , rather than the " only if you must ( wimp ) " message that usually comes out of the XPerts .
So here 's my advice for using diagrams well .
First keep in mind what you 're drawing the diagrams for .
The primary value is communication .
Effective communication means selecting important things and neglecting the less important .
This selectivity is the key to using the UML well .
Do n't draw every class - only the important ones .
For each class , do n't show every attribute and operation - only the important ones .
Do n't draw sequence diagrams for all use cases and scenarios - only ... you get the picture .
A common problem with the common use of diagrams is that people try to make them comprehensive .
The code is the best source of comprehensive information , as the code is the easiest thing to keep in sync with the code .
For diagrams comprehensiveness is the enemy of comprehensibility .
A common use of diagrams is to explore a design before you start coding it .
Often you get the impression that such activity is illegal in XP , but that 's not true .
Many people say that when you have a sticky task it 's worth getting together to have a quick design session first .
However when you do such sessions : keep them short
do n't try to address all the details ( just the important ones )
treat the resulting design as a sketch , not as a final design
The last point is worth expanding .
When you do some up - front design , you 'll inevitably find that some aspects of the design are wrong , and you only discover this when coding .
That 's not a problem providing that you then change the design .
The trouble comes when people think the design is done , and then do n't take the knowledge they gained through the coding and run it back into the design .
Changing the design does n't necessarily mean changing the diagrams .
It 's perfectly reasonable to draw diagrams that help you understand the design and then throw the diagrams away .
Drawing them helped , and that is enough to make them worthwhile .
They do n't have to become permanent artifacts .
The best UML diagrams are not artifacts .
A lot of XPers use CRC cards .
That 's not in conflict with UML .
I use a mix of CRC and UML all the time , using whichever technique is most useful for the job at hand .
Another use of UML diagrams is on - going documentation .
In its usual form this is a model residing on a case tool .
The idea is that keeping this documentation helps people work on the system .
In practice it often does n't help at all .
it takes too long to keep the diagrams up to date , so they fall out of sync with the code
they are hidden in a CASE tool or a thick binder , so nobody looks at them So the advice for on - going documentation runs from these observed problems :
Only use diagrams that you can keep up to date without noticeable pain
Put the diagrams where everyone can easily see them .
I like to post them on a wall .
Encourage people to edit the wall copy with a pen for simple changes .
Pay attention to whether people are using them , if not throw them away .
The last aspect of using UML is for documentation in a handover situation , such as when one group hands over to another .
Here the XP point is that producing documentation is a user story like any other , and thus its business value is determined by the customer .
Again the UML is useful here , providing the diagrams are selective to help communication .
Remember that the code is the repository of detailed information , the diagrams act to summarize and highlight important issues .
On Metaphor Okay I might as well say it publicly - I still have n't got the hang of this metaphor thing .
I saw it work , and work well on the C3 project , but it does n't mean I have any idea how to do it , let alone how to explain how to do it .
The XP practice of Metaphor is built on Ward Cunninghams 's approach of a system of names .
The point is that you come up with a well known set of names that acts as a vocabulary to talk about the domain .
This system of names plays into the way you name the classes and methods in the system I 've built a system of names by building a conceptual model of the domain .
I 've done this with the domain experts using UML or its predecessors .
I 've found you have to be careful doing this .
You need to keep to a minimal simple set of notation , and you have to guard against letting any technical issues creeping into the model .
But if you do this I 've found that you can use this to build a vocabulary of the domain that the domain experts can understand and use to communicate with developers .
The model does n't match the class designs perfectly , but it 's enough to give a common vocabulary to the whole domain .
Now I do n't see any reason why this vocabulary can't be a metaphorical one , such as the C3 metaphor that turned payroll into a factory assembly line .
But I also do n't see why basing your system of names on the vocabulary of the domain is such a bad idea either .
Nor am I inclined to abandon a technique that works well for me in getting the system of names .
Often people criticize XP on the basis that you do need at least some outline design of a system .
XPers often respond with the answer " that 's the metaphor " .
But I still do n't think I 've seen metaphor explained in a convincing manner .
This is a real gap in XP , and one that the XPers need to sort out .
Do you wanna be an Architect when you grow up ?
For much of the last decade , the term " software architect " has become popular .
It 's a term that is difficult personally for me to use .
My wife is a structural engineer .
The relationship between engineers and architects is ... interesting .
My favorite was " architects are good for the three B's : bulbs , bushes , birds " .
The notion is that architects come up with all these pretty drawings , but it 's the engineers who have to ensure that they actually can stand up .
As a result I 've avoided the term software architect , after all if my own wife can't treat me with professional respect what chance do I stand with anyone else ?
In software , the term architect means many things .
( In software any term means many things . )
In general , however it conveys a certain gravitas , as in " I 'm not just a mere programmer - I 'm an architect " .
This may translate into " I 'm an architect now - I 'm too important to do any programming " .
The question then becomes one of whether separating yourself from the mundane programming effort is something you should do when you want to exercise technical leadership .
This question generates an enormous amount of emotion .
I 've seen people get very angry at the thought that they do n't have a role any more as architects .
" There is no place in XP for experienced architects " is often the cry I hear .
Much as in the role of design itself , I do n't think it 's the case that XP does not value experience or good design skills .
Indeed many of the proponents of XP - Kent Beck , Bob Martin , and of course Ward Cunningham - are those from whom I have learned much about what design is about .
However it does mean that their role changes from what a lot of people see as a role of technical leadership .
As an example , I 'll cite one of our technical leaders at ThoughtWorks : Dave Rice .
Dave has been through a few life - cycles and has assumed the unofficial mantle of technical lead on a fifty person project .
His role as leader means spending a lot of time with all the programmers .
He 'll work with a programmer when they need help , he looks around to see who needs help .
A significant sign is where he sits .
As a long term ThoughtWorker , he could pretty well have any office he liked .
He shared one for a while with Cara , the release manager .
However in the last few months he moved out into the open bays where the programmers work ( using the open " war room " style that XP favors . )
This is important to him because this way he sees what 's going on , and is available to lend a hand wherever it 's needed .
Those who know XP will realize that I 'm describing the explicit XP role of Coach .
Indeed one of the several games with words that XP makes is that it calls the leading technical figure the " Coach " .
The meaning is clear : in XP technical leadership is shown by teaching the programmers and helping them make decisions .
It 's one that requires good people skills as well as good technical skills .
Jack Bolles at XP 2000 commented that there is little room now for the lone master .
Collaboration and teaching are keys to success .
At a conference dinner , Dave and I talked with a vocal opponent of XP .
As we discussed what we did , the similarities in our approach were quite marked .
We all liked adaptive , iterative development .
Testing was important .
So we were puzzled at the vehemence of his opposition .
Then came his statement , along the lines of " the last thing I want is my programmers refactoring and monkeying around with the design " .
Now all was clear .
The conceptual gulf was further explicated by Dave saying to me afterwards " if he does n't trust his programmers why does he hire them ? " .
In XP the most important thing the experienced developer can do is pass on as many skills as he can to the more junior developers .
Instead of an architect who makes all the important decisions , you have a coach that teaches developers to make important decisions .
As Ward Cunningham pointed out , by that he amplifies his skills , and adds more to a project than any lone hero can .
Reversibility
At XP 2002 Enrico Zaninotto gave a fascinating talk that discussed the tie-ins between agile methods and lean manufacturing .
His view was that one of the key aspects of both approaches was that they tackled complexity by reducing the irreversibility in the process .
In this view one of the main source of complexity is the irreversibility of decisions .
If you can easily change your decisions , this means it 's less important to get them right - which makes your life much simpler .
The consequence for evolutionary design is that designers need to think about how they can avoid irreversibility in their decisions .
Rather than trying to get the right decision now , look for a way to either put off the decision until later ( when you 'll have more information ) or make the decision in such a way that you 'll be able to reverse it later on without too much difficulty .
This determination to support reversibility is one of the reasons that agile methods put a lot of emphases on source code control systems , and of putting everything into such a system .
While this does not guarantee reversibility , particularly for longed - lived decisions , it does provide a foundation that gives confidence to a team , even if it 's rarely used .
Designing for reversibility also implies a process that makes errors show up quickly .
One of the values of iterative development is that the rapid iterations allow customers to see a system as it grows , and if a mistake is made in requirements it can be spotted and fixed before the cost of fixing becomes prohibitive .
This same rapid spotting is also important for design .
This means that you have to set things up so that potential problem areas are rapidly tested to see what issues arrive .
It also means it 's worth doing experiments to see how hard future changes can be , even if you do n't actually make the real change now - effectively doing a throw - away prototype on a branch of the system .
Several teams have reporting trying out a future change early in prototype mode to see how hard it would be .
The Will to Design While I 've concentrated a lot of technical practices in this article , one thing that 's too easy to leave out is the human aspect .
In order to work , evolutionary design needs a force that drives it to converge .
This force can only come from people - somebody on the team has to have the determination to ensure that the design quality stays high .
This will does not have to come from everyone ( although it 's nice if it does ) , usually just one or two people on the team take on the responsibility of keeping the design whole .
This is one of the tasks that usually falls under the term ' architect ' .
This responsibility means keeping a constant eye on the code base , looking to see if any areas of it are getting messy , and then taking rapid action to correct the problem before it gets out of control .
The keeper of the design does n't have to be the one who fixes it - but they do have to ensure that it gets fixed by somebody .
A lack of will to design seems to be a major reason why evolutionary design can fail .
Even if people are familiar with the things I 've talked about in this article , without that will design wo n't take place .
Things that are difficult to refactor in Can we use refactoring to deal with all design decisions , or are there some issues that are so pervasive that they are difficult to add in later ?
At the moment , the XP orthodoxy is that all things are easy to add when you need them , so YAGNI always applies .
I wonder if there are exceptions .
A good example of something that is controversial to add later is internationalization .
Is this something which is such a pain to add later that you should start with it right away ?
I could readily imagine that there are some things that would fall into this category .
However the reality is that we still have very little data .
If you have to add something , like internationalization , in later you 're very conscious of the effort it takes to do so .
You 're less conscious of the effort it would actually have taken , week after week , to put it in and maintain it before it was actually needed .
Also you 're less conscious of the fact that you may well have got it wrong , and thus needed to do some refactoring anyway .
Part of the justification of YAGNI is that many of these potential needs end up not being needed , or at least not in the way you 'd expect .
By not doing them , you 'll save a good deal of effort .
Although there will be effort required to refactor the simple solution into what you actually need , this refactoring is likely to be less work than building all the questionable features .
Another issue to bear in mind in this is whether you really know how to do it .
If you 've done internationalization several times , then you 'll know the patterns you need to employ .
As such you 're more likely to get it right .
Adding anticipatory structures is probably better if you 're in that position , than if you 're new to the problem .
So my advice would be that if you do know how to do it , you 're in a position to judge the costs of doing it now to doing it later .
However if you 've not done it before , not just are you not able to assess the costs well enough , you 're also less likely to do it well .
In which case you should add it later .
If you do add it then , and find it painful , you 'll probably be better off than you would have been had you added it early .
Your team is more experienced , you know the domain better , and you understand the requirements better .
Often in this position you look back at how easy it would have been with 20 /20 hindsight .
It may have been much harder to add it earlier than you think .
When we began our journey into evolutionary design at ThoughtWorks we ran right into the question of whether it was possible to design a database in an evolutionary fashion .
Thanks to the efforts of Pramod Sadalage , we discovered that it clearly could be , and that knowledge has stood us in good stead ever since .
For more information you can read the article where we introduced these techniques to the world on my site .
This also ties into the question about the ordering of stories .
In Planning XP , Kent and I openly indicated our disagreement .
Kent is in favor of letting business value be the only factor in driving the ordering of the stories .
After initial disagreement Ron Jeffries now agrees with this .
I 'm still unsure .
I believe it is a balance between business value and technical risk .
This would drive me to provide at least some internationalization early to mitigate this risk .
However this is only true if internationalization was needed for the first release .
Getting to a release as fast as possible is vitally important .
Any additional complexity is worth doing after that first release if it is n't needed for the first release .
The power of shipped , running code is enormous .
It focuses customer attention , grows credibility , and is a massive source of learning .
Do everything you can to bring that date closer .
Even if it is more effort to add something after the first release , it is better to release sooner .
With any new technique it 's natural that its advocates are unsure of its boundary conditions .
Most XPers have been told that evolutionary design is impossible for a certain problem , only to discover that it is indeed possible .
That conquering of ' impossible ' situations leads to a confidence that all such situations can be overcome .
Of course you can't make such a generalization , but until the XP community hits the boundaries and fails , we can never be sure where these boundaries lie , and it's right to try and push beyond the potential boundaries that others may see .
( A recent article by Jim Shore discusses some situations , including internationalization , where potential boundaries turned out not to be barriers after all . )
Is Design Happening ?
One of the difficulties of evolutionary design is that it 's very hard to tell if design is actually happening .
The danger of intermingling design with programming is that programming can happen without design - this is the situation where Evolutionary Design diverges and fails .
If you 're in the development team , then you sense whether design is happening by the quality of the code base .
If the code base is getting more complex and difficult to work with , there is n't enough design getting done .
But sadly this is a subjective viewpoint .
We do n't have reliable metrics that can give us an objective view on design quality .
If this lack of visibility is hard for technical people , it 's far more alarming for non-technical members of a team .
If you 're a manager or customer how can you tell if the software is well designed ?
It matters to you because poorly designed software will be more expensive to modify in the future .
There 's no easy answer to this , but here are a few hints .
Listen to the technical people .
If they are complaining about the difficulty of making changes , then take such complaints seriously and give them time to fix things .
Keep an eye on how much code is being thrown away .
A project that does healthy refactoring will be steadily deleting bad code .
If nothing 's getting deleted then it 's almost certainly a sign that there is n't enough refactoring going on - which will lead to design degradation .
However like any metric this can be abused , the opinion of good technical people trumps any metric , despite its subjectivity .
Apple vs. Microsoft in the Enterprise compared the companies ' very different approaches in delivering a single , specific new product .
The market power of a single product can be greatly enhanced when integrated into a collection of products on a platform .
This creates more value for users , and is a major reason why the world went Windows .
Of course , there were also some dirtier bits , too .
Platform Death Match introduced the difficulty of launching a new platform and the work involved in maintaining one .
This series looks at the historical march of computing platforms , to sort out why winners won and why losers lost .
While the computing environment is always changing , the same basic rules are in effect today , and will shape the future developments between Mac OS X Leopard and Windows Vista .
Previous articles :
1990 - 1995 : Why the World Went Windows
The reason Apple 's Macintosh survived into the 90's -- escaping the fate of a variety of other unique platforms that were slaughtered by commodity PCs - - was largely because of the tight integration Apple could provide between its hardware and software .
Apple was n't primarily selling RAM chips , a processor , and an OS ; instead , Apple was offering a richly engineered and consistent experience .
Smaller competitors , from Commodore to Atari , could n't match the enormous development efforts Apple was investing in its platform .
Microsoft employed the same principle of integration in its software offerings .
Rather than seeking to build an integrated computer solution like Apple , Microsoft assembled a series of integrated software platforms that created networks of added value for users .
Divide and Conquer
Essentially , Microsoft made plans to deliver software , the most valuable asset in Apple 's integrated platform , on commodity PC hardware .
That put the risk of operational logistics on manufacturers , and allowed Microsoft to deal with a variety of hardware vendors .
If one vendor 's operations failed , another competitor would emerge to take its place .
When IBM , Microsoft 's original hardware partner , failed to deliver what the market wanted , Compaq jumped to replace it .
Later , other competitors such as Dell emerged ; each contributed towards creating a healthy , diverse PC hardware market .
That allowed Microsoft to focus on software development and strategies to expand the PC market .
PC Proliferation
Microsoft aggressively sold the Windows PC as a replacement to mainframes , terminals and workstations , installing the PC in entirely new markets that displaced older generations of hardware .
That was a market Apple had absolutely no interest in entering ;
Apple wanted to sell elegant , high margin hardware solutions for an existing market of sophisticated , creatively inclined users ; Microsoft , in contrast , targeted new ways to push its software products into any and every possible direction .
Microsoft used the slogan " Windows Everywhere " as it planned an invasion to put its software in office copy machines , handheld computers , and various embedded applications , from cars to cash registers to ATMs .
While many of Microsoft 's ventures failed to materialize , the company did create a huge new market for PCs , which increasingly replaced a range of existing computer systems , including mainframes , minis , dumb terminals , and Unix workstations .
Avoiding Direct Comparisons
By establishing Windows on commodity hardware and using high volume software sales to finance software operating system development , Microsoft could continue development of Windows while avoiding direct comparison to either the richer user environment of Apple 's Mac or to the superior operating system technology offered by Unix workstation vendors .
Instead , Microsoft forced Apple and other vendors to compete in the hardware game against its PC partners .
This isolated Windows from direct competition with other software platforms .
At the same time , Microsoft signed exclusive bundling agreements with its hardware vendors for Windows software , creating the Windows Price Paradox , a curious situation that enabled the Microsoft to keep its software prices high while forcing other DOS alternatives for the PC to compete at market prices against a product that appeared to be free .
Why pay $ 200 for OS / 2 when PCs came with Windows already ?
Fraud Marketing
Even in retrospect , it is difficult to be fair in evaluating how much of Microsoft 's success came from brilliant execution of savvy marketing , how much was based on the greater incompetence of its competitors , and how much resulted merely from a series of fortunate events .
However , we do know that significant parts of Microsoft 's competitive efforts were merely fraudulent illusions .
Microsoft used FUD , a practice made famous by IBM a generation prior , to cast suspicion over existing products in the marketplace in order to destroy their sales .
FUD is sometimes confused with criticism ; however , the real point of FUD is not negative press in general .
FUD is a false negative , designed to create alarm and panic when none is warranted , with the sole purpose of delaying existing sales until a competing product can be delivered , or until the competitive threat is killed .
FUD is fraud .
FUD is often paired with Vaporware , the placeholder promise of a future product which is described with impressive sounding features that never seem to materialize .
Vaporware is sometimes equated with unreleased products ; however , the real point of Vaporware is not positive remarks about a future product in general .
Vaporware is a false positive , designed to create an illusion of competition when none will ever actually exist , with the sole purpose of delaying existing sales until a competing product can be created , or until the competitive threat is killed .
Vaporware is fraud .
Between the false negative of FUD and the false positive of Vaporware , Microsoft was able to artfully control markets and defeat competitors who were seeking to sell real products , often without any doing any development work at all .
Microsoft used industry analysts as pawns to spread fraudulent information in order to game the market and prevent real competition .
Lazy analysts were happy to play along .
It gave them simple and obvious ideas to repeat and allowed them to look like informed visionaries without actually do any critical thinking .
The Means to an End
Microsoft was found guilty of manipulating the PC operating system market in the US DOJ 's monopoly case .
Much of the public evidence collected in the case was not even considered by the court , because the DOJ attempted to present specific charges that only concerned the market for PC operating systems .
However , while Microsoft 's anti-competitive behavior is no secret , it is also true that the company did actually earn much of its success .
It did so by simply planning out effective strategies and working diligently to execute them .
In many cases , while Microsoft may have played dirty , the failure of its competitors was often due to incompetence on their part , not simply due to Microsoft 's heavy handed hardball with a thick coat of Vaseline .
The next installment will present how Microsoft established a series of integrated products that all contributed toward a successful platform , and will compare how Apple is using the same strategies today .
This Series
Four years ago , Juan Garcia did something stupid :
He groped a 14 - year - old girl , the daughter of a friend .
The 30 - something Texan was jailed for six months , given five years probation and required to post a large sign in front of his house that reads : " DANGER : REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER LIVES HERE . "
Garcia ( not his real name ) says he has gotten used to people driving by his house howling obscenities .
He has also grown accustomed to neighborhood kids stealing his sign and planting it on other people 's lawns as a joke .
What really bugs him , he says , is his permanent inclusion in the Texas ' online sex offender registry , where anyone in the world can download his name , mug shot , what he was convicted of , and home address .
Instead of getting a fresh start after leaving jail , the site has started to haunt him .
Recently a co-worker at the construction company where he works sidled up to him to ask about his " dirty little secret " after seeing his name on the website .
" I was shocked , I was embarrassed and wanted to quit my job , " said Garcia .
" Now every time I see two people talking at work I wonder if they 're talking about me .
I 'm just waiting to see what happens when the supervisor finds out . "
Tough beans , you may say ; he screwed up .
But is it fair for sex offenders to be branded with virtual scarlet letters -– often for life – after they 've served their jail time ?
This issue is at the crux of a flurry of lawsuits charging that online sex offender registries are unfair and even unconstitutional .
The Internet sex offender databases were created following the passage of Megan 's Law , which requires states to alert neighbors when a violent sex offender moves into their community .
The law is named after Megan Kanka , a 7 - year - old New Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a twice - convicted child molester who moved into a house across the street from the Kanka family without their knowledge .
Today , 32 states , as well as dozens of local governments have posted the mandated registries on the Internet so parents and schools can check for sex offenders in their midst and protect their children accordingly .
The recent court challenges argue that the online lists violate three constitutional rights : the right to privacy , the right to due process and the right not to be punished after ( Ex Post Facto ) completing a sentence for a crime .
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear two challenges brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against online sex offender registries in Alaska ( arguing unfair punishment ) and Connecticut ( arguing due process ) later this year .
The group 's lawsuits have already altered the data included in registries in some cases and shut them down altogether in others .
" People have been run out of town because of these registries , " said Ed Barocas , Legal Director of New Jersey ACLU , who successfully argued that disclosure of offenders ' addresses online violated their privacy rights .
The state 's online registry now divulges offenders by county , not by street address .
" Just here in New Jersey , individuals have lost their jobs , people have come to their homes to beat them up and harass them , " he said .
" Our concern is not that this information is being disclosed but rather the scope of the disclosure .
It is the worldwide access that is constitutionally suspect . "
And then there are the cases where innocent people are attacked because the online registry information is incorrect .
Sex offenders are required by law to notify the police when they move , but sometimes fail to do so , with disastrous consequences .
An address error in the Texas Internet database caused a gang of gung - ho moralizers to attack a retarded Dallas man who happened to live at a home previously occupied by a sex offender who did n't bother to update his record .
Activists on both sides of the issue hope the High Court 's rulings on the matter will clear up a lot of confusion .
" The sites are needed , they provide information that is public record to begin with , " said Maureen Kanka , Megan Kanka 's mother and the co-founder of the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation .
" The rights of children should always take precedence over the rights of offenders . "
And in cases where the offenders are children themselves , Kanka believes they also should be included in the virtual lineup .
Take Chevy Lee Driggars , a 15 - year - old who was 13 when he was convicted of indecent sexual contact with an 11 - year - old girl .
Some people might argue that children would better benefit from counseling rather than public humiliation , but the state of Texas is no softie .
" If you commit a sex crime in Texas , you 're considered an adult , " said Tela Mange , a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety .
Some 2,000 of the state 's 35,000 sex offenders are juveniles , she said .
For Garcia , he hopes his record will be taken off - line altogether .
" I am not a dangerous man .
I made a stupid mistake , and I 've paid for it , " he said .

Though socialism has long claimed to be for the poor , it has probably done more damage , on net balance , to the poor than to the rich .
After all , the rich have enough money to leave the country if they think the socialists will do them any serious harm .
Some of our own rich have already had their money leave the country , to be sheltered from the higher taxes that limousine liberals say we should all pay .
Meanwhile , the liberal media give them kudos for their selfless advocacy of higher taxes on higher - income people , forgetting these are not taxes on wealth .
Most people in the upper - income brackets are not rich and have no wealth sheltered offshore .
They are typically working people who have finally reached their peak earning years after many years of far more modest incomes — and now see much of what they have worked for siphoned off by politicians , to the accompaniment of lofty rhetoric .
The rich have learned to adapt socialist policies to their own benefit .
For example , the city of Riviera Beach , Fla. , plans to demolish a working - class neighborhood under its power of eminent domain , to prepare the way for a marina for yachts , luxury condominiums and an upscale shopping district .
What will the city of Riviera Beach get out of all this ?
More taxes from higher - income people , enabling local politicians to spend more money on programs to attract votes .
Meanwhile the rich get rid of lower - income folks without having to pay them the value of their homes and businesses that will be demolished .
As in so many other cases , eminent domain is socialism for the rich .
Theoretically , those whose homes and businesses are demolished will get the “ just compensation ” to which the Constitution says they are entitled .
In reality , just announcing plans to demolish the homes in an area will immediately demolish part of their market value .
Even if homeowners are compensated for whatever value remains when their homes are actually demolished — which can be years later — they have still been had .
For businesses , compensating them for the value of their physical assets — which may or may not include ownership of the place where their businesses are located — does nothing to compensate them for the often much larger value of the clientele they have built up over the years who are now scattered to the winds by neighborhood demolition .
This game does n’t work the same way in rich neighborhoods .
Not only can the rich hire big - bucks lawyers to fight city hall , why would city hall want to get rid of upscale taxpayers , who are often also big donors to political campaigns ?
A very different form of socialism for the rich protects their communities from even the dangers of a free market .
A whole array of laws and policies prevents outsiders from buying up property near them , even when these outsiders are ready to pay prices determined by supply and demand , rather than by eminent domain .
For example , the “ open space ” laws that have spread across the country to protect upscale communities represent one of the biggest collectivizations of land since the days of Josef Stalin .
Upscale residents say they have a right to protect “ our community . ”
But not even the rich own the whole community .
They own what they paid for — their own individual property .
But they get the government to collectivize the often vastly larger surrounding property , to keep the unwashed masses from settling near them and spoiling their views .
Moreover , they wrap themselves in the mantle of idealism while doing this and denounce the “ selfishness ” of those who would stoop to building homes or apartments to house others , just to make money .
“ Developer ” is a cuss word to those who wax indignant in their righteous zeal to keep other people out .
Why ca n’t these money - grubbing developers just inherit money , like so many of the upscale idealists ?
Meanwhile , that working - class neighborhood in Riviera Beach is being defended legally by the Institute for Justice , one of the few “ public interest ” organizations that deserve the name .

Security and Liberty

The senseless and horrific killings last week on the campus of Virginia Tech University reinforced an uneasy feeling many Americans experienced after September 11th : namely , that government cannot protect us .
No matter how many laws we pass , no matter how many police or federal agents we put on the streets , a determined individual or group still can cause great harm .
Perhaps the only good that can come from these terrible killings is a reinforced understanding that we as individuals are responsible for our safety and the safety of our families .
Although Virginia does allow individuals to carry concealed weapons if they first obtain a permit , college campuses within the state are specifically exempted .
Virginia
Tech , like all Virginia colleges , is therefore a gun- free zone , at least for private individuals .
And as we witnessed , it did n’t matter how many guns the police had .
Only private individuals on the scene could have prevented or lessened this tragedy .
Prohibiting guns on campus made the Virginia
Tech students less safe , not more .
The Virginia Tech tragedy may not lead directly to more gun control , but I fear it will lead to more people control .
Thanks to our media and many government officials , Americans have become conditioned to view the state as our protector and the solution to every problem .
Whenever something terrible happens , especially when it becomes a national news story , people reflexively demand that government do something .
This impulse almost always leads to bad laws and the loss of liberty .
It is completely at odds with the best American traditions of self - reliance and rugged individualism .
Do we really want to live in a world of police checkpoints , surveillance cameras , and metal detectors ?
Do we really believe government can provide total security ?
Do we want to involuntarily commit every disaffected , disturbed , or alienated person who fantasizes about violence ?
Or can we accept that liberty is more important than the illusion of state - provided security ?
I fear that Congress will use this terrible event to push for more government - mandated mental health programs .
The therapeutic nanny state only encourages individuals to view themselves as victims , and reject personal responsibility for their actions .
Certainly there are legitimate organic mental illnesses , but it is the role of doctors and families , not the government , to diagnose and treat such illnesses .
Freedom is not defined by safety .
Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference .
Government cannot create a world without risks , nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place .
Only a totalitarian society would even claim absolute safety as a worthy ideal , because it would require total state control over its citizens ’ lives .
Liberty has meaning only if we still believe in it when terrible things happen and a false government security blanket beckons .

Email validation is one of the most common forms of data validation and one of the most incorrectly validated .
We are not going to share yet another semi-complete regular expression string to validate emails and we�re not going to compare the benefits of client side vs. server side email validation .
Instead we �re going to look at a real solution .
When sending out email newsletters , or site notifications we often find that many of the addresses are bounced back at us .
Maybe at one time these were valid email addresses , but their owners have closed accounts , or simply stopped using them for so long that they have been removed .
The best solution to this problem is to validate these addresses before sending an email .
We �re not talking about simple syntax validation as all of your emails probably pass syntax validation .
We want to know if that mailbox is open for business .
In order to do that a request has to be sent to the SMTP server querying for the mailbox .
This method of validation is much more effective than syntax validation and much more automated than taking bounced emails off your list by hand .
There are a few methods out there for doing this and it is a fairly complicated process .
One of the easiest methods to use is a email validation service .
We have one setup here at BestCoding Practices for you .
The service accepts either a GET or POST operation with a comma separated list of up to 10 email addresses called �email� and a validation level called �level� .
The validation levels are �syntax � which is there only for fun .
�domain� level validation checks that the domain referenced from the email address exists .
�smtp� level validation checks that the domain referenced has an SMTP service running on it .
Finally the cream of the crop , �mailbox � validation checks that the SMTP service has a mailbox for the specific email address you �re using .
An example of using the service from PHP would look like this ( please replace the ( at ) string with an actual @ ) :
Code : <?
php
$ validEmail = array ( ) ;
$ XMLurl = " http://www.bestcodingpractices.com/email_verification/e-verify.asp?email=editor ( at ) bestcodingpractices.com , not ( at ) bestcodingpractices.com&level=mailbox " ;
$ XMLDOC = new DOMDocument ( ) ;
$ XMLDOC->preserveWhiteSpace = false ;
if ( $ XMLDOC -> load ( $ XMLurl ) )
{
$ XMLpath = new DOMXPath ( $ XMLDOC ) ;
$ mailNodes = $ XMLpath - > query ( ' / validation ' ) -> item ( 0 ) ;
foreach ( $ mailNodes -> childNodes as $ mail )
{
$ validEmail [ $ mail->getAttribute ( ' address ' ) ] = $ mail->getElementsByTagName( " success " ) ->item(0 ) ->nodeValue ;
}
unset ( $ XMLpath ) ;
}
print_r ( $ validEmail ) ;
?>
This code will check the 2 email addresses �editor ( at) bestcodingpractices.com � and not(at)bestcodingpractices.com .
Not surprisingly �not( at)bestcodingpractices.com � is NOT at bestcodingpractices.com while EDITOR is .
From ASP your code would look more like ( again notice the ( at ) needs replaced with @ ) :
Code : <%
Dim objXml , objTemp , node , url
url = " http://www.bestcodingpractices.com/email_verification/e-verify.asp?email=editor ( at ) bestcodingpractices.com , not ( at ) bestcodingpractices.com&level=mailbox "
Set objXml = Server.CreateObject ( " Msxml2.DOMDocument.3.0 " )
objXml.async = False
objXml.loadXML( getURL( url ) )
If objXML.parseError.errorCode <> 0
Then
response.write objXML.parseError.reason & " < br / > " & objXML.parseError.errorCode
response.write " < br / > Please try your request again . < br / > " & url
response.end
End If
set objTemp = objXML.SelectNodes ( " validation/email[success=1 ] " )
response.write " Valid Email Addresses : < br / > "
for each node in objTemp
response.write " < b > " & node .
Attributes.getNamedItem(" address " ) .
Text & " </b><br/ > "
response.write " Syntax : " & node.selectSingleNode(" syntax " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" Domain : " & node.selectSingleNode(" domain " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" SMTP : " & node.selectSingleNode( " smtp " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" Mailbox : " & node.selectSingleNode(" mailbox " ) . text & " < br / > "
next
set objTemp = objXML.SelectNodes ( " validation/email[success=0 ] " )
response.write " < p > "
response.write " Invalid Email Addresses : < br / > "
for each node in objTemp
response.write " < b > " & node .
Attributes.getNamedItem(" address " ) .
Text & " </b><br/ > "
response.write " Syntax : " & node.selectSingleNode(" syntax " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" Domain : " & node.selectSingleNode(" domain " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" SMTP : " & node.selectSingleNode( " smtp " ) . text & " < br / > " &_
" Mailbox : " & node.selectSingleNode(" mailbox " ) . text & " < br / > "
next
set objTemp = nothing
set objXML = nothing
Function getURL ( url )
On Error Resume Next
Set http = Server.CreateObject ( " MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.3.0 " )
http.open " GET " , url , true
http.send
If http.readyState <> 4 then
http.waitForResponse 10
End If
If Err. Number = 0 AND http .
Status = 200 then
getURL=http.responsetext
else
getURL= " "
end if
set http = nothing
End Function
%>
Either example is going to return this response from the service :
Code : < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< validation >
< email address=" editor(at) bestcodingpractices.com " >
< syntax>1</syntax >
< domain>1</domain >
< smtp>1</smtp >
< mailbox >1</mailbox >
< success >1</success >
</email >
< email address = " not( at) bestcodingpractices.com " >
< syntax>1</syntax >
< domain>1</domain >
< smtp>1</smtp >
< mailbox>0</mailbox >
< success>0</success >
</email >
</validation >
Each email sent will return a validation result for each level of validation conducted .
Each successive level of validation is inclusive of the ones before it .
If a level of validation is not reached the XML will contain an empty tag for that level .
For instance the same request with only domain level validation would return the following results :
Code : < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< validation >
< email address=" editor(at) bestcodingpractices.com " >
< syntax>1</syntax >
< domain>1</domain >
< smtp />
< mailbox />
< success >1</success >
</email >
< email address = " not( at) bestcodingpractices.com " >
< syntax>1</syntax >
< domain>1</domain >
< smtp />
< mailbox />
< success >1</success >
</email >
</validation >
Notice the SMTP and Mailbox nodes are empty because no check was done .
Also the Success node is now positive for both tests because even the spurious email address �not( at)bestcodingpractices.com � does pass domain level validation and would also pass SMTP validation .
Only when all checks are accomplished do we find that this is not a valid email .
When in a production environment you may need to take time into consideration .
Each SMTP server will have its own response time and validating 10 emails with slow SMTP servers could take more time than you are able to commit .
In cases like this it would obviously be better to send fewer emails or use a lower level of validation .
Please feel free to use this service from your site .
You can validate emails one at a time , or up to 10 emails at a time .
We are planning on leaving free access to this service if we are able .
If you are interested in the service and have any special requirements or have any trouble implementing this on your site please contact us at support ( at ) beachbumsoftware.com
Sorry ... the service has been taken down for the time being .
We had to move servers and it 's causing trouble .
We 'll get it back up and running as soon as possible .

Hi Travis , you service is amazing ...
Congratulations !!!
I like to have e-verify .asp code .
Is this posible ?
I need to modify it for second level addresses , like : info@etmoreno.com.ar for example .
Best regards
etmoreno BeachBum 2006-09-07 # 50
Thanks for using the service .
The online service does not have any problem handling next level email addresses so I tested your email address and found that the SMTP server was taking a long time to respond so I upped the timeout on the demo to 45 seconds .
That should be plenty of time for a server to respond .
You did give me a good idea for an upgrade to the service though .
I will add a timeout value that will cause the service to return an " unavailable " response object so your code can deal with that as it wants to .
The address could be put on a " Check again " list or something .
I 'll make a note here when that is accomplished .
Thanks
Travis jeffc 2007-04-25 # 59 Hi Travis ,
Thank you for the email validator -- I 'm always amazed at the effort that folks are willing to put into making the web an easier place to work , and your validator is a great example .
I wanted to point out a problem that we 've run into using the validator .
It started last night , after we 'd successfully used it for some testing .
We 're getting an error : " error ' 8007000e ' /email_verification/e-verify.asp , line 68 " , in response to :
http://www.bestcodingpractices.com/email_verification/e-verify.asp?email=editor@bestcodingpractices.com&level=mailbox
Jeff BeachBum 2007-05 -04 # 60
Hey Jeff ,
Thanks for using the tool .
I 'm sorry you were getting errors but I can't seem to reproduce them .
I tried the link you posted and it is working .
I ran the whole thing through some tests , that why it took me so long to write back and I can't find a problem .
If it happens again let us know .
In fact if anyone has a problem with this tool please email us right away at editor ( at) bestcodingpractices.com
Thanks hapadilo 2007 - 09 - 23 # 64 hi Travis ,
there is a minor error with the result returned by the service .
it returns invalid xml when email is empty and that causes xml parsing errors .
when email value is empty < email / > is printed at the end instead of a closing tag < / email > .
everything else seems ok , thanks for the great service .
Carlos BeachBum 2007-09 - 24 # 65
Thanks Hapadilo ,
I 've fixed it on the live service so you should not have any more trouble with that .

Hey Steve ,
The url you posted worked fine for me .
Can you give a little more information about what you 're doing ?
Are you consuming the service from ASP , PHP , .NET ?
Or were you just testing the above URL in your browser ?
Alex 2008-03-24 #75 2008-03-24 # 75 Hi !
I 'm trying the script off my website , ( I 've got a page I 'm working on under test ) and I get the exact same error as Anonymous above .
The script worked fine and correctly first time , but all subsequent instances of trying , with valid or invalid addresses yield the same result :-(
I 'm working in ASP if that helps ?
Thanks for any info - your site and script it otherwise excellent , and is just what I 'm after for the occasional email address I get !
BeachBum 2008 -03 - 26 # 78
Thanks Alex ,
It sounds like you , and anonymous are both getting a blank response back which would be the case if the call has a timeout .
How many email addresses were you sending for validation ?
The timeout is currently set for 30 seconds , we do n't want it too much longer than that or it will start dragging down our servers .
Try sending just 1 email for testing , if that is n't the problem then please send me your code and I 'll take a look .

Hi , Beachbum !
I was just sending the one address for checking - and each occasion I try , I get a correct response the first time , then the error as indicated above on the second and subsequent attempt .
If I wait a few hours , and go again , I get 1 correct response , then errors after . :-(
Just tried it again , same outcome .
I 'll send you my code via email - I do n't think there 's anything amiss , but I 'm not an expert !
Thanks !

Frank Rich : Earth to GOP , the Gipper is dead RAW STORY
Published : Saturday May 12 , 2007 Print This Email
This " While 10 white , middle - aged Republicans spoke glowingly at the recent debate about the lasting legacy of of former president Ronald Reagan , their party continues to crumble under the weight of the Bush Administration , " Frank Rich writes this week in his Sunday New York Times column .
" Much as the Republicans hope that the Gipper can still be a panacea for all their political ills , so they want to believe that if only President Bush would just go away and take his rock - bottom approval rating and equally unpopular war with him , all of their problems would be solved , " writes Rich .
" But it could be argued that the Iraq fiasco , disastrous to American interests as it is , actually masks the magnitude of the destruction this presidency has visited both on the country in general and the GOP in particular . "
" By my rough , conservative calculation -- feel free to add -- there have been corruption , incompetence , and contracting or cronyism scandals in these Cabinet departments : Defense , Education , Justice , Interior , Homeland Security , Veterans Affairs , Health and Human Services , and Housing and Urban Development . "
In his column , Rich looks back on the optimism with which Bush and Karl Rove into the White House , noting that his fellow Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that " We may say a final , welcome goodbye to the wedge issues that have divided Americans by race , ethnicity and religious conviction . "
Tracing the continuing decline of the Republican party , Rich points out that " the pressing matters that the public cares passionately about -- Iraq , health care , the environment and energy independence -- belong for now to the Democrats . "
Exerpts from Rich 's column : # Wrongdoing of this magnitude does not happen by accident , but it is not necessarily instigated by a Watergate - style criminal conspiracy .
When corruption is this pervasive , it can also be a by - product of a governing philosophy .
That 's the case here .
That Bush - Rove style of governance , the common denominator of all the administration scandals , is the Frankenstein creature that stalks the GOP as it faces 2008 .
It has become the Republican brand and will remain so , even after this president goes , until courageous Republicans disown it and eradicate it .
We 've certainly come a long way from that 2000 Philadelphia convention , with its dream of forging an inclusive , long - lasting GOP majority .
Instead of break dancers and a black Republican congressman ( there are none now ) , we 've had YouTube classics like Rove 's impersonation of a rapper at a Washington journalists ' banquet and George Allen 's " macaca " meltdown .
Simultaneously , the once - reliable evangelical base is starting to drift as some of its leaders join the battle against global warming and others recognize that they 've been played for fools on " family values " by the GOP establishment that covered up for Mark Foley .

~ Ellison at his swearing in ceremony ( reuters )
Exclusive for ImpeachforPeace.org by Mikael Rudolph
Four members of ImpeachforPeace.org met with the Honorable Representative Keith Ellison ( D - MN 5th ) in his Minneapolis offices Saturday morning , April 22nd to discuss the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Early in the meeting , Ellison made clear that his opinion has n’t changed since he introduced a Resolution for the impeachment of President Bush as a Minnesota State Legislator by saying : “ Impeachment should be on the table ” .
In Washington D.C. attending sessions of Congress during the week , Ellison regularly travels home to be with his wife Kim and four children each weekend , taking some time to meet with his constituents as well .
~ from the Ellison Campaign Website
Running a bit late , Ellison explained that he had just gotten a haircut because he “ wanted to look good for our meeting ” , turning his head side to side to show off his barber ’s work .
One member of IFP quipped : “ It was well worth the wait ” .
As everyone settled into their chairs and the laughter subsided , the mood quickly grew more serious as the topic of Ellison ’s vote for the Veterans ’ Health & Iraq War Accountability Supplemental was discussed , which some in the local and national peace movement felt was a betrayal of Ellison ’s commitment to seeking an immediate end to the Iraq War .
A sharply critical letter from an IFP member not present was read and a framed graphic called “ The Impeachment Casualty Candle ” was set up on the table as a reminder to everyone present of the ultimate price already paid by so many of our troops and the high stakes still facing many American families , not to mention Iraqi families :
~ Graphic courtesy Sgt. Daniel Fearn , “ The Impeachment Grunt ”
( IFP website reader ’s responses to his vote on the ‘ Supplemental ’ can be found in the comments following this article of March 27th , 2007 : War Critic Rep. Ellison ( D - MN ) Explains ‘ Yes ’ Vote on War Funding Supplemental )
Ellison heard the criticism and handled it well , acknowledging and empathizing with the frustrations and anger of those who want the war over and our troops home immediately yet he made it clear that many in the Peace Movement had communicated to him that they understood and supported the strategy of confronting and isolating what even the President ’s own Intelligence Agencies have identified as failed Iraq policies by passing a bill with a plan to end the war at some point .
Ellison called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) who had gathered just enough of a consensus among fellow House Democrats to pass the measure , “ a remarkable leader ” who is quickly proving herself to be a gifted “ cat herder ” of the various caucuses in the Democratic Party .
The topic quickly shifted to impeachment , with Rep. Ellison affirming that he is “ with the impeachment movement ” , yet making clear that in order for him to consider supporting impeachment hearings , the charges spoken into the Congressional Record must be strongly grounded in verifiable facts and evidence as well as understood by and backed by the majority of the American people .
Not eager to be assailed by the radical right ’s bevy of partisan media shills as “ the poster child for loonie leftists ” , Ellison said that the most important thing he and his fellow members of Congress need from constituents is that they “ keep the drumbeat up ” for impeachment .
Ellison named fellow Representative Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) as “ a good friend ” , saying “ we talk every day ” during the week in Washington .
With Kucinich reputedly poised to introduce Articles of Impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney this week , Ellison was measured in his commitment to join Kucinich .
He made clear that he was supportive of the idea , but not if it only becomes a symbolic gesture .
Ellison is only interested in seeing impeachment proceedings actually becoming a reality .
Stressing that he had not yet seen what specific charges Kucinich is intending to bring up against the Vice President , Ellison , formerly a criminal defense attorney , seemed as committed to guaranteeing the habeas corpus for Cheney that the Vice President regularly denies others .
Looking at his blackberry , Ellison said “ maybe I ’ll give Dennis a call this weekend ” .
Noting that he has an activist ’s heart , when asked what efforts and strategies in support of impeachment might be most effective , Ellison suggested sending John Nichol ’s book The Genius of Impeachment , which he had read and appreciated , to members of Congress , starting with those on the House Judiciary Committee .
ImpeachforPeace.org is listed in Nichol ’s book among the resources in Appendix 3 , page 209 .
Five filled out and signed Do - It - Yourself Impeachment Memorials were given to the Representative .
Ellison had not heard of the DIY Impeachment and he was very interested in hearing that the Jefferson ’s Manual , which is an integral part of the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives , allows for the initiation of articles of impeachment by an individual citizen .
The following Democratic HJC members were identified by Ellison as pivotal “ swing ” votes who may need a strong and clear message from their constituents and other citizens in order to support any impeachment push :
Hon. Jerrold Nadler
(D) New York , 8th
Hon. Howard L. Berman
(D) California , 28th
Hon. Zoe Lofgren
(D) California , 16th
Hon. Linda T. SÃ¡nchez
(D) California , 39th
The 71 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as the 73 Out of Iraq Caucus members are among those more likely to be ready to join Kucinich ’ desire to get to the bottom of Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Cheney ’s true motivations for pushing for the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Cheney ’s wishes can be traced back at least as far as 1998 when he was a co-signer of the Project for a New American Century ’s document : Rebuilding America ’s Defenses .
Many Democrats are in both caucuses , including Rep. Ellison .
The Lies and False Intelligence Leading up to the Invasion of Iraq in March of 2003 will most likely be at the crux of Kucinich ’ charges , because there is ample evidence as laid out in the linked article by IFP ’s Jodin Morey , but also because the country has grown increasingly unsupportive of President Bush , and distrustful of the reasons we were given as justification for going into Iraq .
As low as Bush ’s approval rating has plummeted , Mr. Cheney ’s support from the American public has wallowed even deeper .
Asked about the possibility of impeachment actually occuring , Ellison immediately replied “ yes , it can work ” , but noted that by August all eyes will be looking forward to the next election cycle and by then the window of opportunity for justice and accountability for the Bush Administration may have passed .
He made clear that the public must be informed enough to see impeachment as warranted and necessary , but then act on that knowledge by communicating their desires for accountability through impeachment to Congress .
This must take place to such a degree that Speaker Pelosi and others have no choice but to honor the wishes of our nation ’s citizens and to allow impeachment to go forward .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) of whom Ellison also expressed great respect , was named as being a pivotal figure in deciding whether the numerous investigations of the Bush Administration , now totalling over a hundred , were collectively revealing enough evidence to warrant the initiation of impeachment hearings .
Any efforts to inform Rep. Waxman that impeachment is warranted and desired by the American people was encouraged .
Representative Ellison generously gave more than twice the time alloted by his schedulers , but then had to leave to attend an afternoon event one of his children was involved in .
As he drove east on Plymouth Avenue past the IFP members chatting in the parking lot , he beeped the horn on his economy car and waved , eyes remaining forward on the road .
Two stickers were affixed to the rear bumper , one an AM950 Air America Radio red , white and blue emblem .
The other was green but none of those standing in the parking lot were able to positively identify it as it faded into the distance .
The consensus from the group ?
Probably ‘ a Wellstone ’.

As early as July of 1999 I was pontificating on email lists about the virtues of style sheets .
Some things never change .
Article Continues Below
What has changed is how I think about CSS , and the underlying structure of ( X ) HTML to which it is applied .
For example , I find that most pages on the web contain a menu of links in a navigation area .
These are often marked up as a string of links , often in separate DIVs or paragraphs .
Structurally , however , they are a list of links , and should be marked up as such .
Of course the reason that we do n’t mark them up in that way is that we do n’t want a bullet in front of every link in our navigation area .
In a previous article I outlined several techniques for using CSS to layout a web page .
One of those techniques involved manipulating a list to display horizontally rather than vertically .
In this article , I ’ll demonstrate how to use CSS to bring unwieldy lists under control .
It ’s time for you to tell lists how to behave , instead of letting them run wild on your web page .
Setting the stage #section2
For purposes of this article , I am using unordered lists .
The same CSS can be applied , with similar results , to ordered lists as well .
Unless otherwise defined , all of the examples in this article use the following code for the lists .
< ul > < li>
Item 1</li > < li> Item 2</li > < li> Item 3</li > < li> Item 4</li > < li >
Item 5 we 'll make a bit longer so that it will wrap </ li > </ul >
Each list is simply placed inside a different DIV , and the CSS is written so that the list ’s behavior is determined by the DIV it is in .
Each DIV has a base rule :
# base { border : 1 px solid # 000 ; margin : 2em ; width : 10 em ; padding : 5 px ; }
Without any additional styles applied , the list is rendered in this way in the base DIV :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
Sometimes the default indent of a list is too much for the design you are working on .
But simply changing the margin or the padding of the UL does n’t work for all browsers .
To make the list flush left , e.g. , you need to change both the margin and the padding .
This is because Internet Explorer and Opera opted to create the indent with the left margin , while Mozilla / Netscape use padding .
For more on this see the DevEdge article Consistent List Indentation .
In the following example both the margin - left and padding - left of the UL in the DIV are set to zero :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
Note that the markers lie outside of the DIV .
If the containing box were the BODY of the HTML document , the markers might be rendered outside of the browser window , in effect vanishing .
If you want the markers to line up inside the DIV , but along its left side , set either the left padding or margin to one em :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
Maybe you ’ve had a project that required a custom bullet .
If so you might have marked it up in a table with one column containing the GIF image bullets aligned top and right , and the other column containing the content of what should have been LIs .
With CSS it is possible to use an image as a bullet .
If the browser does n’t support this part of CSS ( or does n’t do images ) , the default bullet will be used ( or you can specify a different HTML bullet if you wish ) .
The rule looks something like this :
ul { list - style - image : url( bullet.gif ) ; }
And the browser renders it :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
To specify an HTML bullet to use if the browser does n’t support this part of CSS , add :
list - style - type : disc ;
to your rule .
Depending on the image that you choose you may find that it does n’t align itself with the list items the way that you intend .
In that case you may choose to have the image be placed within the list item block ( rather than outside the block ) .
Adding the following :
list - style - position : inside ;
to your rule will make that change .
These three declarations can be combined into a single , shorthand declaration as illustrated in the following rule :
ul { list - style : disc url ( bullet.gif ) inside ; }
which is the equivalent of :
ul { list - style - type : disc ; list - style - image : url( bullet.gif ) ; list - style - position : inside ; }
This is what it looks like in the web page :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
There may be times when you have a list , but you do n’t want any bullets , or you want to use some other character in place of the bullet .
Again , CSS provides a straightforward solution .
Simply add list - style : none ; to your rule and force the LIs to display with hanging indents .
The rule will look something like this :
ul { list - style : none ; margin - left : 0 ; padding - left : 1em ; text - indent : - 1em ; }
Either the padding or the margin needs to be set to zero , with the other one set to 1em .
Depending on the “ bullet ” that you choose , you may need to modify this value .
The negative text - indent causes the first line to be moved to the left by that amount , creating a hanging indent .
The HTML will contain our standard UL , but with whatever character or HTML entity that you want to use in place of the bullet preceding the content of the list item .
In our case we ’ll be using » , the right double angle quote : ».
» Item 1
» Item 2
» Item 3
» Item 4
» Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
I should point out that Netscape6/7 / Mozilla ( and other Gecko - based browsers ) and Opera can create generated content via the CSS2 : before pseudo - element .
We can take advantage of this to automatically generate the » character ( or any other character ) for the bullets .
This allows us to leave the content of the UL alone .
If you are using Opera or a Gecko - based browser , the following CSS will create the same list as above , but using the standard UL with no extra content :
# custom - gen ul li:before { content : " \0 BB \020 " ; }
The content property may contain strings , URIs and more , including special characters .
When using these characters , like » , it is necessary to encode them as their escaped HEX equivalents .
For the right double angle quote , we use \0 BB ( the other character , \020 , is a space ) .
The final result ( remember , the character will only be visible in Opera or Mozilla / Netscape ) :
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
Truly inline lists #section5
Who says a list needs to be vertically aligned with bullets hanging off the left side of each item ?
Perhaps you want the structure of an ordered list of links , but visually you want it to look like a vertical navigation bar on the web page .
Or maybe you want your list of links to align themselves horizontally across the top of your page .
This applies to more than just lists of links .
There are times when you might need to list several items in the midst of a paragraph , maybe a list of books that you want to read .
Structurally it makes sense to mark this up as a list , but presentationally you might not want break the flow of the paragraph .
CSS to the rescue again !
Since this list will not be separate and unto itself , I wo n’t put it into the base DIV that the previous lists have inhabited .
This time the markup will be a paragraph , followed by the same list , followed by another paragraph .
I hear you crying , “ FOUL !
I thought you were going to put a list inside of a paragraph , not between two paragraphs . ”
To which I reply , “ Well , yes .
But ( X ) HTML does not allow a list to appear inside of a paragraph .
However , with the help of our style sheet , that is how it will look in the web page . ”
Here ’s what the styles look like :
#inline - list { border : 1 px solid # 000 ; margin : 2em ; width : 80 % ; padding : 5 px ; font - family : Verdana , sans - serif ; }#inline - list p { display : inline ; }#inline - list ul , #inline - list li { display : inline ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; color : # 339 ; font - weight : bold ; }
The markup consists of a < div id =“ inline - list ” > .
This DIV contains a paragraph followed by our standard UL , and a followup paragraph .
The UL list has been modified so that each list item has a comma after it , with the last item followed by a period .
The results are below ( list appears bold and blue ) :
A bit of text before the list appears .
Perhaps the context is something about a husband getting a call from his wife to pick up a few things on the way home from work .
It does n’t really matter , for our purposes we just need some preceding text before the list : Item 1 ,
Item 2 ,
Item 3 ,
Item 4 ,
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap .
And then there is the text that follows the list in the paragraph .
One or two sentences is sufficient for the example .
As in the custom bullet example above , we could use CSS to automatically generate the commas and period that follow each list item .
If all you had to worry about were Opera and Gecko powered browsers , that is .
This time the styles would look like :
# inline - list - gen ul li:after { content : " , " ; } #inline - list - gen ul li.last : after { content : " . " ; }
Here we use the : after pseudo - element to add a comma after each list item , and a period after a list item with class = “ last ” , resulting in the following ( remember , it will only be visible in Opera or Mozilla / Netscape ) :
A bit of text before the list appears .
Perhaps the context is something about a husband getting a call from his wife to pick up a few things on the way home from work .
It does n’t really matter , for our purposes we just need some preceding text before the list : Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
Item 5 we ’ll make a bit longer so that it will wrap
And then there is the text that follows the list in the paragraph .
One or two sentences is sufficient for the example .
As I mentioned previously , the menus of links that appear on nearly every site should really be marked up as lists , since that is what they are .
Since we usually do n’t want the default list style to apply to these links , we can use CSS to change the way they appear on the page .
As we saw above , lists can be forced to display horizontally ( inline ) rather than stacked vertically ( the default behavior ) .
When you do this the bullet goes away and you have many choices about how to separate the list items .
These examples of horizontal lists will all use the same base DIV with the following styles :
#h- contain { padding : 5 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; margin - bottom : 25 px ; }
The next two examples use the same UL as in the previous examples , but without the final list item with its extra text .
They also include an additional class that sets apart one of the LIs in the list .
A pipe character , | , is often used to differentiate between choices .
It is an obvious separating character , and can be emulated by adding borders to list items :
# pipe ul { margin - left : 0 ; padding - left : 0 ; display : inline ; } # pipe ul li { margin - left : 0 ; padding : 3 px 15 px ; border - left : 1 px solid # 000 ; list - style : none ; display : inline ; } # pipe ul li.first { margin - left : 0 ; border - left : none ; list - style : none ; display : inline ; }
Here we add class= “ first ” to the first LI so that it does not end up with a border on its left side .
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
You can modify these styles to create a tabbed navigation effect :
#tabs ul { margin - left : 0 ; padding - left : 0 ; display : inline ; } #tabs ul li { margin - left : 0 ; margin - bottom : 0 ; padding : 2 px 15 px 5 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; list - style : none ; display : inline ; } #tabs ul li.here { border - bottom : 1 px solid # ffc ; list - style : none ; display : inline ; }
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4
In this example adding class = “ here ” to an LI creates a bottom border that matches the background color to indicate that the tab refers to the current page .
Note :
This technique was first proffered by Randal Rust , and then riffed on by many on the css-discuss email list
Breadcrumb trails #section8
Another list of links that typically has a horizontal orientation on a web page is what has become known as breadcrumbing .
Breadcrumbs show you where you are in the hierarchy of a site , starting with the home page and drilling down to the current section or page .
If you really want to make the markup meaningful , you would want to create a series of nested lists , since each new section is part of the section before it :
< div id =" bread " > < ul > < li class = " first " > Home < ul > < li > » Products < ul > < li > » Computers < ul > < li > » Software </ li > </ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li> </ul > </div >
creates the following :
Home » Products » Computers » Software
Adding the following rules to the style sheet for the page :
# bread { color : #ccc ; background - color : #006 ; padding : 3 px ; margin - bottom : 25 px ; }#bread ul { margin - left : 0 ; padding - left : 0 ; display : inline ; border : none ; } #bread ul li { margin - left : 0 ; padding - left : 2 px ; border : none ; list - style : none ; display : inline ; }
creates this :
Home » Products » Computers » Software
Again , we can generate the » character ( or any other character you might want to use as a separator ) with the : before pseudo - element , combined with a class = “ first ” so that the first LI does n’t generate a separator :
# bread - gen ul li:before { content : " \020 \020 \020 \0 BB \020 " ; color : # ff9 ; } #bread - gen ul li.first : before { content : " " ; }
And the end result :
Home Products Computers Software
In the Real World#section9
I ’d like to end with a real world application of some of the techniques that have been discussed here .
We ’ll use a standard UL containing links to create a dynamic menu with hover effects .
In order to obtain the hover effects we ’ll let the UL provide the structure , and the anchor styles will provide most of the visual effects .
This menu of links is actually a solution to a question posed by Michael Efford on the css-discuss list .
Michael had created this exact effect using a table , images , and JavaScript .
He asked the list if it could be done with CSS .
I took the challenge , and with the help of several other members who tracked down some browser specific issues , we came up with a style sheet that works on this markup :
< div id =" button " > < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Hidden Cameras</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > CCTV Cameras</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Employee Theft </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Helpful Hints </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
F.A.Q</a></li> < li ><a href= " # " > About Us </a></ li > < li >< a href= " # " > Contact Us</a></li> </ul > </div >
Let ’s look at the style sheet rule by rule , and I ’ll explain why each rule is constructed the way that it is .
# button { width : 12 em ; border - right : 1 px solid # 000 ; padding : 0 0 1em 0 ; margin- bottom : 1em ; font - family : ' Trebuchet MS ' , ' Lucida Grande ' , Verdana , Lucida , Geneva , Helvetica , Arial , sans - serif ; background - color : # 90 bade ; color : # 333 ; }
The first rule is for the #button DIV .
It defines the space that the menu will occupy , and provides a context for the menu so that we can define the way the list and links will behave inside the DIV .
I chose to make the menu fluid , based on the browser ’s font size preferences , so ( almost ) all units are in ems .
This includes the width of the menu .
The solid black border on the right was based on the original design from Michael .
The bottom padding is there to extend the DIV down beyond the menu of links so that you can see the background of the DIV .
Again , this follows the original design .
The bottom margin is to separate the DIV from what follows it .
The colors came from the original design .
# button ul { list - style : none ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border : none ; } #button li { border - bottom : 1 px solid # 90 bade ; margin : 0 ; }
Next I defined what the list will look like .
Since all the list items were to be links , and the rollover functionality would be built into the CSS for the links , I essentially removed all styling from the lists .
I did add a single pixel border on the bottom of each link that matched the background of the #button DIV , to work as the separator .
In the original design , this was an image .
# button li a { display : block ; padding : 5 px 5 px 5 px 0.5 em ; border - left : 10 px solid # 1958b7 ; border - right : 10 px solid # 508 f c4 ; background - color : # 2175 bc ; color : # fff ; text - decoration : none ; width : 100 % ; } html > body # button li a { width : auto ; } #button li a : hover { border - left : 10 px solid # 1c64d1 ; border - right : 10 px solid # 5 ba3e0 ; background - color : # 2586d7 ; color : # fff ; }
Finally , I defined the links .
The original design has 10 pixel borders on the right and left .
These borders , along with the background , change color on the rollover .
This is a relatively simple thing to control with the : hover pseudo - class in CSS , so I put this style into the anchor styles .
There is one workaround in this part of the style sheet .
To make the links active for the full width of the DIV , I made them display : block ; .
This works for everything but IE / Windows .
If you give the block an explicit width of 100 % , then IE / Windows plays along .
But doing this creates problems with IE5 / Mac and Netscape / Mozilla .
So I used the child selector “ > ” to redefine the width to auto .
Since IE / Windows does n’t understand child selectors , it ignores the rule .
IE5 / Mac , Opera and Netscape / Mozilla follow the rule , and everyone is happy .
The rule for the : hover pseudo - class creates the color changes on the backgrounds and borders when the links are moused over .
The style and list markup ( about 1 K worth ) replaced about 5 K of JavaScript and TABLE markup , not to mention another 8 K or so of images for the rollover effects .
It also made the markup more readable , and easier to update , since you no longer need to create new images if a link name changes .
Now you simply modify some text .
You can view the final result in the context of the site on the Asset Surveillance web site .
Tip of the Iceberg#section10
Believe it or not , we have just scratched the surface of what can be done to modify lists with style sheets .
I wo n’t claim that all of the techniques presented here are the most practical CSS that you ’ll come across , but I do hope they make you think about how using CSS can release you to use more structured markup .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Good , old - fashioned diet and exercise might keep you young by reducing the action of insulin in the brain , researchers reported on Thursday .

Good , old - fashioned diet and exercise might keep you young by reducing the action of insulin in the brain , researchers reported on Thursday .

They created mutant mice that over - ate , got fat and even had symptoms of diabetes , and yet lived 18 percent longer than normal lab mice .
The secret : they lacked a certain key gene that affects insulin , the hormone that regulates glucose .
The genetic engineering mimicked the effects of eating less and exercising , the researchers report in the journal Science .
“ This study provides a new explanation of why it ’s good to exercise and not eat too much , ” said Dr. Morris White , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Children ’s Hospital in Boston who led the study .
The findings also raise questions about how desirable it is to use insulin to treat type 2 diabetes , said the researchers .
Doctors know that people who exercise regularly live longer on average .
Researchers have also learned that putting animals on a strict diet makes them live longer , although this has not yet been shown to work in people .
So White ’s team sought to see if the two effects were linked .
They looked at insulin , because both fasting and exercise make cells more insulin- sensitive , meaning they respond more efficiently to the effects of insulin .
They looked at the entire insulin pathway -- a series of actions in the cell that control the body ’s use of insulin .
White ’s team engineered mice that had no working copies of one of the genes involved in this pathway , called insulin receptor substrate 2 , or Irs2 .
BEST USE OF INSULIN
Mice with no copies of Irs2 had defective brains and diabetes .
But mice with one working copy lived 18 percent longer than normal mice .
“ What ’s more , the animals lived longer even though they had characteristics that should shorten their lives such as being overweight and having higher insulin levels in the blood , ” White said in a statement .
They were also more active than normal mice , and after eating , their brains had higher levels of a compound called superoxide dismutase , an antioxidant that protects cells from damage .
“ Diet , exercise and lower weight keep your peripheral tissues sensitive to insulin , ” White said .
That means the body needs to make less insulin .
“ Since insulin turns on Irs2 in the brain , that means lower Irs2 activity , which we ’ve linked to longer life span in the mouse , ” he said .
One obvious question is whether drugs can mimic the effects of having less Irs2 , perhaps by interfering with its action .
The researchers note that people who live to be 100 or more often have reduced insulin levels and their cells show better insulin sensitivity .
New diabetes drugs that increase insulin sensitivity may help , too , White said .
But , he added : “ The easiest way to keep insulin levels low in the brain is old - fashioned diet and exercise . ”

A pair of spy satellites launched on June 15 atop an Atlas V rocket were placed into the wrong orbit , according to Aviation Week & Space Technology .
The top secret satellites separated safely from the malfunctioning booster , however , and have enough rocket propellant to continue their mission , an official said on background .
The U.S. Air Force , which managed the Atlas V launch , and the NRO have begun an official investigation into the launch and malfunction .
The $ 83 million Atlas V used in the launch is a model 401 with no solid rocket boosters .
" The Atlas V people have a lot of explaining to do , " the official said on background .
The flight was the first NRO secret mission for the new Atlas V Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle .
In Europe , the rapid conversion of fields that once grew wheat or barley to biofuel crops like rapeseed is already leading to shortages of the ingredients for making pasta and brewing beer , suppliers say .
That could translate into higher prices in supermarkets .
“ New and increasing demand for bioenergy production has put high pressure on the whole world grain market , ” said Claudia Conti , a spokesman for Barilla , one of the largest Italian pasta makers .
“ Not only German beer producers , but Mexican tortilla makers have see the cost of their main raw material growing quickly to historical highs . ”
Some experts are more worried about the potential impact to low - income consumers .
In the developing world , the shift to more lucrative biofuel crops destined for richer countries could create serious hunger and damage the environment if wild land is converted to biofuel cultivation , the agriculture panel concluded .
But officials at the European Commission say they are pursuing a measured course that will prevent some of the price and supply problems seen in American markets .
In a recent speech , Mariann Fischer Boel , the European agriculture and rural development commissioner , said that the 10 percent target was “ not a shot in the dark , ” but was carefully chosen to encourage a level of growth for the biofuel industry that would not produce undue hardship for Europe ’s poor .
She calculated that this approach would push up would raw material prices for cereal by 3 percent to 6 percent by 2020 , while prices for oilseed might rise 5 percent to 18 percent .
But food prices on the shelves would barely change , she said .
Yet even as the European program begins to harvest biofuels in greater volume , homegrown production is still far short of what is needed to reach the 10 percent goal : Europe ’s farmers produced an estimated 2.9 billion liters , or 768 million gallons , of biofuel in 2004 , far shy of the 3.4 billion gallons generated in the United States in the period .
In 2005 , biofuel accounted for around 1 percent of Europe ’s fuel , according to European statistics , with almost all of that in Germany and Sweden .
The biofuel share in Italy was 0.51 percent , and in Britain , 0.18 percent .

The day before Apple Inc. is to report quarterly earnings , the company 's stock price slipped by about 3 percent after partner AT&T Inc. revealed that it had activated only 146,000 iPhones in the first two days the device was for sale .
As of midday Tuesday , Apple 's share price was down US $ 3.97 , or 2.76 percent , to $ 139.73 .
In its second fiscal quarter , which ended June 30 , AT&T said it had activated 146,000 iPhones .
The Apple smart phone went on sale Friday , June 29 .
That number differs dramatically from estimates posted by financial analysts the week after the iPhone debut .
Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst Gene Munster , for example , pegged sales at 500,000 units during the opening three - day weekend , more than triple what AT&T said had been activated .
Other analysts have more recently said that Apple probably sold 450,000 to 500,000 iPhones in the quarter that ended June 30 .
AT&T characterized sales of the iPhone as " robust " and said that store traffic remained at historically high levels into July .
More than 40 percent of the first wave of iPhones were sold to new AT&T subscribers , the company added .
Although some iPhone buyers reported major delays in activating their new phones over the debut weekend , most were able to switch on almost immediately .
Still , some analysts continued to speculate that the activation muck - up could explain the difference between the number AT&T reported and the more - optimistic sales estimates .
" While some have suggested disappointment with the iPhone number , we note that there were significant activation problems for the first couple of days postlaunch , which may have held the number down artificially through quarter - end , " Christopher King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. , told Forbes.com Tuesday .
Apple will release its third - quarter earnings report on Wednesday at 5 p.m.
Eastern time , and it will presumably spell out its own iPhone sales figures at that time .

THE Finns like a laugh .
Famous for an annual wife - carrying competition , for regular success at the world air - guitar championship and record - breaking hurling of rubber boots and mobile phones , Finland can now claim another accolade : its citizens are reportedly the world 's keenest pranksters .
Celebrated for a full week at the beginning of April in the capital , Helsinki , and for weeks at a time in rural areas , the traditional “ spring joke ” in Finland has been raised to a national art form .
This long involved young men trying to catch the eye of women , typically by donning fancy dress ( in the cold war a favourite was the garb of Soviet border guards ) or through good - natured abduction — often in combination .
More recently motorists have learned to watch for fake road - safety signs , which frequently cause springtime gridlock and collisions .
Diplomats are increasingly wary of water - bomb attacks at functions — one thin - lipped European ambassador lodged a protest after being drenched in 2005 .
Even political leaders indulge .
In 2003 the government apologised after stating that Finland wanted Sweden expelled from the European Union during a row about pickled herring .
But Finland 's enthusiasm is not unique .
Dr Is Poli -Savon , an anthropologist at the Paris - based Fairpooll Foundation , says that in many countries fooling is seen as a celebration of the end of winter .
“ In modern societies it serves as a rare chance for semi- subversive behaviour within safely defined parameters ” , he says .
Polls conducted by his team of researchers suggest that , despite suspicions to the contrary , many different cultures do share a common sense of humour .
A surprising number of German adults take part in April Fooling , along with many French ( see chart ) who mark “ poisson d'avril ” by sticking paper fish on each others ' backs .
Most Iranian jokers choose April 3rd , the 13th day of the Persian calendar , for mild joking .
But not absolutely everyone sees the funny side .
Adults in Equatorial Guinea , an oil - rich speck of a country in west Africa , are reportedly the least inclined to find anything to chuckle about .
Fooling by anyone over the age of 13 years recently became a criminal offence , with exceptions only for the president and his extended family .
1 in 8 Iraqis dies before fifth birthday / In Baghdad 's poorest area , hospital lacks basic supplies , staff

Baghdad -- Hanna Yousef
Tamer watches hopelessly as her year - old daughter , Mahdi , writhes on pink sheets in a crowded ward of the Ibn Al - Baladi Pediatric Hospital in the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City .
The feeble child cries and looks around the bustling room through hollowed eyes .
Her body is wasted from malnutrition and dehydration .
But with the hospital lacking basic medication and intravenous fluids , doctors and nurses can't do much to help Mahdi .
And while precious drugs are available in pharmacies , the little girl 's family can't afford them .
Tamer , 27 , lost another daughter , Roqia , in 2005 when the 2 - year - old died of the same disorders .
" Unfortunately , this is becoming common , " said Saad Mehdi , 35 , a pediatrician at Ibn Al - Baladi .
The mortality rate among Iraqi children younger than 5 rose 150 percent between 1990 and 2005 , according to a report released this month by the U.S. humanitarian aid group Save the Children .
In its most startling terms , the group estimates that 1 in 8 never makes it to his or her fifth birthday .
The report also said inadequate prenatal care has caused more birth defects and deaths , and that Iraq faced a grave humanitarian crisis even before the latest war .
But most physicians here agree the 4 - year - old conflict has had an unmistakable impact .
Iraq 's child - mortality crisis is distressingly visible in Sadr City , a sprawling and embattled Shiite slum of 2 million residents in east Baghdad , home to many of the country 's poorest people .
Pediatricians at Ibn Al - Baladi said leaking sewage and the lack of potable water has contributed to a startling increase in water - borne diseases , such as typhoid , which can place children at risk for circulatory failure , infections and possibly death if not properly treated .
Shortages of medicines , equipment and doctors have only made things worse , hospital officials said .
The 34 pediatricians at Ibn Al - Baladi cope daily with hundreds of cases , often without antibiotics , intravenous drips , cardiopulmonary monitoring equipment , CT scans or MRI machines .
On a recent morning , the corridors of Ibn Al - Baladi were bustling with adults frantically shuttling children in their arms , while others lugged bags packed with blankets and clothes , and flagons filled with hot tea .
In one hallway , a group of women clad in traditional black abayas sat on the floor feeding bottles to infants .
The hospital 's wards were crammed with children like year - old Tahar Nahdi , who was suffering from a severe chest infection .
The boy lay pale and unconscious on his back while his mother , Hassna Rhani , 35 , swatted flies from her son 's face .
Ali Kareem , 25 , a nurse attending Tahar , who has been ill for the past three months , said the hospital has no antibiotics to fight the little boy 's infection and no intravenous fluids to alleviate his dehydration .
Rhani said that for the past five weeks , her family has been unable to afford the $ 5 necessary to buy Tahar four daily doses of antibiotics that are available in pharmacies outside the hospital .
" The majority of the families that come here can't afford the medications , " Kareem said .
On the other side of the room , 4 - month - old Doha Ahmed , anemic and malnourished , fidgeted in the arms of her grandmother , Sabira Ali .
Doha has spent more than 13 days in the hospital during the past month , but her health continues to decline , Ali said .
Doha 's mother , who was home caring for her four other children , already lost a child two years ago under similar circumstances , Ali said .
In Sadr City , the lack of prenatal care has become more significant since Ibn Al - Baladi was forced to close its obstetrics wing more than a year ago after it was damaged in fighting .
Reconstruction is moving slowly , according to the hospital 's assistant director , Salam Mosan Bohan .
For now , everything takes place in the main hospital .
Earlier this month , inside a wing of Ibn Al - Baladi 's second floor , small incubators were filled with premature newborns , along with those suffering from birth defects .
Some were clinging to life .
Taif Saif was one of the fortunate few .
The 7 - day - old infant wrestled with a piece of gauze wrapped around his eyes as protection from the glow of a fluorescent light -- treatment for jaundice that he has had since birth due to anemia .
Pediatrician Manam Husham says
Taif 's blood disorder was easily detectable through standard prenatal testing .
And while his ailment is curable , he is still vulnerable to neurological disorders .
" We have many cases like this , " Husham said .
" It 's become normal . "
The frustrations , after a while , are easy to sense among the doctors at Ibn Al - Baladi .
" We have to deal with it , " Husham said , referring to the harsh conditions in Sadr City and Ibn Al - Baladi .
" We 're trying to save as many lives as possible . "
Health - care crisis for young Iraqis
According to a report by Save the Children , a U.S. humanitarian group , the rate of mortality among children younger than 5 in Iraq rose by 150 percent between 1990 and 2005 .
The report 's key points :
-- In 2005 , 122,000 Iraqi children died before age 5 , or 125 per 1,000 .
In contrast , 36 per 1,000 died before age 5 in Iran ; 15 per 1,000 in Syria ; and 7 per 1,000 in the United States .
-- 46 percent of children younger than 5 suffering from diarrhea are not given oral rehydration treatment .
-- 24 percent of children younger than 5 with suspected pneumonia are not seen by a health care provider .
-- 12 percent of children younger than 5 are moderately or severely underweight .
-- 21 percent of Iraqi children suffer from severely or moderately stunted growth .
-- Only 35 percent of children are fully immunized .
-- 28 percent of births are not attended by a skilled health professional .
-- Iraq 's infant mortality rate has increased by some 37 percent in the past four years .

President Bush does n’t know what to do with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Maybe he ’s afraid she ’ll accomplish something he ’s failed to do .
He berates her for visiting Syria but mostly ignores the Republicans who ’ve also been there .
Pelosi is the highest - ranking U.S. official to visit Syria in four years , but that ’s because the president refuses to talk to a regime he despises .
Instead , he has tried ferociously to isolate a country he believes supports terrorism .
The president is right that Syria helps groups we consider terrorists .
But he ’s wrong to think that isolating a key player in the Middle East will result in “ regime change . ”
In politics as in nature , a vacuum seeks to be filled .
In the Middle East , the vacuum is the administration ’s unwillingness to lead the search for solutions to tough problems .
So , both Republican and Democratic members of Congress , seeing the vacuum , have rushed in .
While the president is correct that it ’s his prerogative to set foreign policy , his failures have encouraged other politicians to step into the breach .
He should not be surprised that Congress is seeking a bigger foreign policy role .
The American public is thoroughly disillusioned with the Iraq war .
Most Americans just want out , no matter what the consequences in the region .
While this may not be the wisest course , it ’s no surprise that presidential hopefuls and other ambitious elected officials , whether Republicans or Democrats , see an opportunity to carve out a policy position that most Americans like but that is in opposition to this president .
And , given that the president is a lame duck , both Republican and Democratic members of Congress see opportunities to make names for themselves by trying to address some of the world ’s most difficult problems , notably Iraq , the Middle East in general , and the enormous antagonism towards the U.S. around the world .
They do n’t feel the need to include an unpopular president in their plans .
What ’s unfortunate about the scenario playing out in Washington now is the apparent inability of this president to see how to serve his own interests .
To continue his intense partisanship when faced with a Democratic Congress makes no sense .
This is a time for him to do what he claims to have done as governor of Texas – reach out in a bipartisan manner to accomplish his goals .
That ’s what he pledged as candidate Bush in 2000 .
It is far from what he has tried to do as president .
Looking at the bigger picture , the foreign policy independence of Congress is troubling .
We ca n’t have 535 different foreign policies , nor 535 elected politicians trying to resolve huge international problems on behalf of the United States .
But that ’s not a strictly partisan problem .
If the president resents Congress ’ intrusion into his sphere , he needs to apply his rhetoric evenly , chastising Republicans who ignore his will as much as Democrats .
This he has failed to do .
It ’s time for the president to really reach out to Congress and find ways to work together on the foreign - policy problems he has failed or been unwilling to solve .
As others battle to succeed him , Bush will become increasingly irrelevant , even a liability , unless he can gain a position as a leader and problem solver .
And , if he ca n’t bring his own party to heel , he certainly should n’t expect to curtail the efforts of the party he has scorned for the last six years .
It ’s the way our system of government and politics works – if the elected leader can’t do the job , someone else will try to do it .

The US Dollar : On the Edge of the Abyss By Sam Kirtley
Jul 17 2007 9:42 AM www.gold-prices.biz
We are literally about half a point from seeing the US Dollar break its single most important support level .
Here , eighty is the magic number , watch the USD fall below 80 and you have witnessed the beginning of the end of the dollar and the dawn of a terrific run in gold prices that will take the yellow metal to an all time high in a surprisingly short period of time .
Over the last year , as the chart below demonstrates , we have watched the dying dollar make lower lows and lower highs .
The USD occasionally makes a pathetic attempt to break its 200 dma , but that has only happened a couple of times over the last year .
Indeed , the USD has not been above its 200 day moving average since the 50dma crashed down through the 200dma in early April 2006 .
The USD has fallen over two points in the last fortnight or so , and this rate of decline will continue if it breaks the support level at 80 .
When the USD was testing this support at the beginning of 2005 , it went on a terrific run to 92.63 but somehow we do not think that the dollar will be able to pull another rabbit out the hat as it did then .
More and more investors are coming around to the fact that the USD is dead and people do not want to hold this rapidly devaluing paper anymore .
When the USD breaks 80 , the whole world will see a big sell signal and this influx of people dumping dollars will send the greenback down into the abyss and its anyone ’s guess how far it can fall , but it will fall …a lot .
However there is one fan of the USD , a fan that will try and keep the dollar up or at least “ manage� ? its invertible collapse .
That of course is the US Government .
Armed with Ben Bernanke ’s Plunge Protection Team , you can bet you bottom dollar ( although shortly it might not be worth much ) that they will do everything possible to make sure their currency does not have a full blown crash .
They would rather that USD gradually floated down in a way that would benefit US exporters .
Trying to manipulate the market is a dangerous game , as no person , company or government is bigger than the market and eventually the market will fight back and win .
In fact the more an entity tries to suppress something , whether this be the financial market or something as simple as an idea , the more drastically the suppressed force will fight back .
Therefore all the Plunge Protection Team are doing by trying to prop up the dollar or the stock market is delaying the invertible and making the backlash reaction all the more dramatic .
You can try to push the bad times back , but this will just make the bad times worse when they eventually come around .
It is crucial to remember that the United States on America is not the only government with an interest in which way the dollar goes .
With their hands on over $ 1.2 trillion dollar bills , the Chinese Government must also be watching the USD like hawks having lost $ 100 billion of value in less than a year .
The government in China is very concerned at keeping “ social unrest� ?
at a minimum so how do you think the Chinese people will react if the USD continues declining further and further down bringing their foreign currency reserves closer and closer to worthlessness .
China must be looking to transfer their dollars into something that retains its value or perhaps even increases in value , after all is n’t that what investments are supposed to do ?
China will look to get out of dollars and into anything that is n’t falling as fast as the USD .
The private equity group Blackstone , made the biggest US IPO of the year recently and Beijing swiftly swooped in and bought a 9.9 % stake in the company , using $ 3 billion of its foreign exchange reserves .
It is likely that we will see more examples like this of China buying companies , commodities and whatever they can to get out of the dollar .
Gold and silver bullion or the mining companies in the precious metals industry are obvious candidates for a piece of China ’s USD pie as they move up and as the greenback moves down so they are the most logical hedge against a declining dollar .
If China and other countries holding large USD reserves shift even a small proportion of their dollars into the precious metals , it will have massive effect on gold prices and silver prices .
Governments aside , individuals around the world will be looking to trade any dollars they have for a piece of gold or some gold stocks rapidly increasing in value .
So do we think the USD will break 80 in the next few days ?
No .
The PPT will probably buy it back up a couple of points but then it will drift down again to test the eighty level and will probably break it in the coming months .
However now is the time to buy gold and silver and gold stocks and silver stocks .

Nasa will review its security procedures following the siege
Police , who had surrounded the scene and entered when they heard a gunshot , also found a second hostage , a woman , who was alive but tied up with tape .
Police Capt Dwayne Ready said officers were called to the scene at about 1340 ( 1840 GMT ) after a man was seen with a gun and two shots were heard .
Nasa named the gunman as Bill Phillips , a contract engineer at the site .
The hostages were named as David Beverly and Fran Crenshaw , though the names were not confirmed by police .
Nasa spokesman Doug Peterson said the agency would review its security procedures following the siege .
" Any organisation would take a good , hard look at the kind of review process we have with people , " he said .
Agency officials said mission operations were not interrupted by the incident .
Two found dead
Capt Ready said police were making contact with the suspect when they heard a shot .
" Believing that the suspect may have shot himself the decision was made to make entry , " he said .
Employees watched the drama on television as they were locked down
" As our Swat team members made entry they did indeed determine that the suspect shot himself one time to the head .
" Also , on the same floor there was one ... hostage that was shot - we believe that may have occurred in the early minutes of this whole ordeal . "
The slain male hostage had been shot in the chest .
The female hostage was found unharmed nearly four hours after the stand - off began .
School secured
A Nasa contractor , Jacobs Engineering , earlier told the BBC that one of its employees was involved in the incident .
After the gunman was reported , Building 44 , housing communications equipment and engineering offices , was evacuated and an email was sent to staff across the sprawling complex telling them to remain inside their buildings .
A second email was later sent telling employees they could go home whenever they wished .
Nasa employee Michael Zolensky , who studies cosmic dust , told Associated Press news agency that workers at the complex were watching television news reports of the drama as it unfolded .
The Houston police department told the BBC they sent a helicopter , a canine unit and a special weapons team to the space centre .
Negotiators were also on the scene and a bomb squad was sent as a standard precaution .
The Johnson Space Center contains Nasa 's mission control , which oversees the agency 's space flights .
An intermediate school near the building was also secured for several hours .
The stand - off came less than a week after a gunman killed 32 students and teaching staff at Virginia Tech university before killing himself .
There has been a rash of security alerts across the US , which is also marking the eighth anniversary of the Columbine school massacre in which 15 people died .

Microsoft Outlook is a wonderful application that is not only used as an email client , but can also be used as an efficient tool for managing data such as : B. to store contacts , schedule appointments , manage notes , RSS feeds , newspapers , etc .
All data related to Outlook is stored in a reliable file called PST , which changes every time you open MS Outlook or add something .
However , in various cases , your Outlook PST file may get corrupted and thus prevent access to all your items from MS Outlook .
In such cases , you will see various error messages .
0x800ccc05 is one of the common Outlook error messages .
This error message can be caused by two main reasons .
One is the server is down and the other is due to corrupted PST files .
You can fix the first problem by checking your internet connection .
Causes of error 0x800CCC05
Users face an error where Outlook cannot establish a secure connection to the mail server .
The root cause of the error is a network firewall that breaks the connection between Outlook and the mail server .
How to fix an Outlook 0x800CCC05 error that cannot connect to the server :
Disable Windows Firewall
Another thing MS Outlook can block is Windows Firewall .
Therefore , disabling the firewall is another possible solution to Outlook error 0x800CCC05 .
Here ’s how to configure Windows Firewall settings in Windows 10 .
Press the Cortana button on the taskbar to open this app .
Enter the keyword “ Windows Firewall ” in the Cortana search box , and then select to open Windows Defender Firewall .
Click Turn Windows Firewall on or off to open the options .
From there , select both options to disable Windows Defender Firewall and click OK .
You can also check if Outlook is allowed through Windows Firewall by clicking Allow an application or feature through Windows Defender Firewall .
Click the Change Settings button and scroll to Outlook in the list of allowed applications .
Check both Outlook boxes if they are not checked .
Then press the OK button to confirm the new setting .
After completing the above steps , it is recommended to check if the problem has been resolved .
If the error persists , you should activate the firewall immediately to protect Outlook from virus or spyware attacks .
Run Outlook in safe mode .
Assuming that all of the above methods can correct this error , it is very likely that one of the existing superstructures is criminal .
Therefore , you should learn about this reason .
Close Outlook and go to the Start menu .
In the search box , type Outlook .exe / safe and press Enter to start Outlook in safe mode .
Start Outlook in safe mode
Then go to File > Options > Settings >
Go .
In the next dialog box , delete one add - on at a time and restart Outlook as normal to check if the add - on is affected .
Delete Outlook add -ons
Disable Anti Virus Programs
Programs such as Antivirus ( Norton and Mcafee ) and Firewall provide a high level of security to protect our computer and other objects from virus and malware attacks .
In most cases , antivirus programs make it difficult to send and receive emails in MS Outlook ( as Norton found this more annoying for Outlook 2010 ) .
Set the level of protection for your firewall settings as supported for this factor ( so that the firewall can allow these files to access the Internet ) .
Conclusion
All methods are safe to use given the severity of the problem .
Hope these methods help you fix Outlook error 0x800CCC05 .
Sometimes these problems are also caused by errors in the Internet and Exchange Server connections .
So keep these simple things in mind before taking any serious action .

Update
As of this morning , 17,000 nurses are volunteering at the SiCKO opening night , and pledging to help us reach our million nurse goal .
Here ’s how SiCKO is changing our country :
The healthcare movement finally is a mass , on - the - ground movement Not since the days of Act Up have we actually had a critical mass of healthcare activists on the ground , working for change .
Now we do : tens of thousands of activists talking to hundreds of thousands of people .
Powerful .
Caregivers finally have a voice .
For years , groups such as the American Medical Association purported to be the voice of caregivers .
Unfortunately , they have been all too willing to throw patient interests under the bus so they can line their own pockets .
Now with the rise of the nurses ’ movement , allied with PNHP docs , we finally have healthcare providers taking their patient advocacy to the streets ... and the statehouse .
The media finally has to cover the issue of guaranteeing healthcare — and force political leaders to do the same .
Take a look at some examples below here .
And now to the SiCKO / Guaranteed Healthcare Update
* The Nation notes the nurse uprising and , like us , wonders what happens after SiCKO .
( In the same issue , Liza Featherstone looks at the movement by nurses for guaranteeing healthcare on the single - payer model , despite those looking to compromise with the insurance industry .}
* Clarence Page at the Chicago Tribune lays out the new conventional wisdom :
America 's got a terrific health care system , as long as you do n't get sick .
That much , at least , seems to be conceded even by lobbyists for the nation 's health insurance industry .
* Last night Bill O’Reilly was in the unenviable position of debating a kids ’ cancer nurse .
The point is — when was the last time O’Reilly did a segment on whether we should move to guaranteed healthcare on the single - payer model ?
( And ended up kind of having to agree ... )
* Coverage like this Washington Post story reminds us about what ’s really happening out there :
As for government - funded health insurance , it would be enlightening if those who so reflexively assert that the public has already rejected it would just ask — well — the public .
In a May CNN poll , 64 percent said they thought the government should " provide a national health insurance program for all Americans , even if this would require higher taxes . "
* Health Insurance companies are running scared .
The natural next question is , what now ?
How do we extend the impact of SiCKO ?
At a minimum level , nurses will continue to put pressure on politicians to answer one question : are you with patients — or insurance companies ?
At the same time , we are on the verge of announcing a strategy to pressure health insurance corporations themselves .
But what else ?
It ’s a movement in development .
Your thoughts are needed .
First nanobot soccer competition
( Nanowerk News ) Imagine a mechanical Pelé or David Beckham six times smaller than an amoeba playing with a soccer ball  no wider than a human hair on a field that can fit on a grain of rice .
Purely science fiction ?
Not anymore .
The U.S. Department of Commerces National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) invites the media to witness the first nanoscale soccer games at the 2007 RoboCup in Atlanta , Ga. , on July 7 - 8 , 2007 .
RoboCup is an annual international competition designed to foster innovations and advances in artificial intelligence and intelligent robotics by using the game of soccer as a testing ground .
NIST hopes that a competition between the smallest robots in RoboCup history will show the feasibility and accessibility of technologies for fabricating MicroElectroMechanical Systems ( MEMS ) , tiny mechanical devices that are built onto semiconductor chips and are measured in micrometers ( millionth of a meter ) .
The 2007 RoboCup features six competition leagues : Four - Legged , Humanoid , Middle Size , Small Size , Simulation and Rescue Robot .
RoboCup and NIST are jointly organizing this years nanosoccer competition as a demonstration event with plans for it to become the Nanogram League in 2008 .
Five teams are entered in the Nanogram Demonstration Competition : two from Carnegie Mellon University ( Pittsburgh , Pa. ) , and one each from the U.S. Naval Academy ( Annapolis , Md. ) , the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( Zurich , Switzerland ) and Simon Fraser University ( Burnaby , British Columbia , Canada ) .
The soccer nanobots ( nanoscale robots ) operate under an optical microscope , are controlled by remote electronics using visual feedback and are viewed on a monitor .
While they are a few tens of micrometers to a few hundred micrometers long , the robots are considered nanoscale because their masses range from a few nanograms to a few hundred nanograms .
To win the competition , a nanobot must be fast , agile and capable of manipulating objects .
These abilities will be tested in three events : a two - millimeter dash in which each nanobot seeks the best time for a goal - to - goal sprint across the playing field ; a slalom drill where the path between goals is blocked by " defenders " ( polymer posts ) and a ball handling drill that requires robots to dribble  as many nanoballs ( microdisks with the diameter of a human hair ) as possible into the goal within a 3 - minute period .
When : Saturday and Sunday , July 7 - 8 , 2007 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time
Day 1 : Teams will each run three trials of the two - millimeter dash and slalom .
Day 2 : Teams will each run three trials of the ball handling drill .
Where : Technology Square Research Building , Room 113C
Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta , Ga .
Registration : Media must register for credentials at www.georgiarobotics.com/robocup/press-register.html.
50 - foot ' Mission Accomplished ? ' banner unfurled in front of White House on anniversary Josh Catone
Published : Monday April 30 , 2007 Print This Email This
At an event held in front of the White House grounds today , Americans United for Change and Americans Against Escalation in Iraq unfurled a version of the infamous " Mission Accomplished " banner , with one notable difference :
Theirs ended with a question mark .
The " Mission Accomplished ? " protest comes in advance of tomorrow 's fourth anniversary of the speech President George Bush made on May 1 , 2003 on the USS Abraham Lincoln to declare major combat operations in Iraq complete .
" In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed , " Bush proclaimed during that 2003 speech , below a banner that read " Mission Accomplished . "
LATEST ON RAW STORY : ALLEGED CLIENT OF DC MADAM SAYS HIS ESCORT ' WAS COLD FISH ' But Brad Woodhouse of Americans United for Change disagrees .
" Four years after President Bush said the war was over , four years after he stood before the banner ' Mission Accomplished ' on the USS Abraham Lincoln and four years into a tortured and failed policy in Iraq  US forces are still caught in the crosshairs of a civil war with no end in sight . "
Woodhouse and other speakers at the rally outside the White House called on Bush to sign the Iraq spending bill that he is expected to veto tomorrow .
The demonstration concluded with a chorus of " sign the bill , sign the bill , " from the assembled protesters .
Also today , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) released a PDF file denouncing the " Mission Accomplished " speech Bush made 4 years ago .
In it , Hoyer breaks down Bush 's speech and rebuts various points with updated facts to show why he thinks the " mission clearly has not been accomplished . "
Photos from the " Mission Accomplished ? " demonstration are below , along with a video .

When the announcements were finished and Gore finally walked onto the stage at GWU ’s Lisner Auditorium , he was given a very long and very enthusiastic standing ovation .
Gore smiled and modestly motioned us to sit .
Gore covered the thesis of his book — That , thanks to television and the decline of the written word , America ’s arena of democratic debate has shrunk to one - way conversations begun and framed by the elite — very thoroughly .
He talked extensively on the decline of the importance of reason and fact in political discussions .
In a move that could be taken as a comment on potential primary competitors , Gore said that he does n’t blame those who say " If I knew then what I know now ... " regard the Iraq
War for their lack of foresight , but he does wonder why they did n’t ask the right questions or look at the obvious facts when they could have made a difference .
Then Gore did something that surprised me quite a bit :
He threw out applause lines .
He listed down all the top mistakes made by the Bush administration that fly in the face of reason ( paraphrase ) :
The warrentless wiretapping , that was a mistake !
* applause *
The media holding on to information about the wiretapping , that was a mistake !
* applause *
Having Congress pass a law that retroactively legalized illegal wiretapping , that was a mistake !
* applause *
Censoring information about the climate crisis , that was a mistake !
* applause *
It was like a section of a stump speech .
Gore was working the crowd , and doing a wonderful job !
After his speech , Gore did a little Q&A .
The first question was about America ’s drastic wealth discrepancy between the richest and the rest .
Gore said that it would be impossible to tackle such a problem until we change the frame of debate .
To illustrate his point , Gore said ( paraphrase ) :
Say we have two proposals that are made and given equal time in a healthy , democratic debate .
The first proposal , idea A , would spend government money and ensure that every America has basis healthcare coverage , including the millions of Americans who are currently left out of the private system .
This would not only help the public welfare and not only save millions in productivity and medical bills , but it would help the private sector who are suffering from international competition , as American companies are pressured to give private health insurance to their employees .
Businesses would save money and people would live longer .
The second proposal , proposal B , says that we should repeal what ’s left of the Estate Tax for the tiniest 1 % sliver of the wealthiest Americans .
In a reasonable democratic arena , these ideas would be given equal time and we ’d choose one over the other .
Which would we choose ?
Healthcare for all , or tax cuts for zillionaires ?
Gee , I wonder ...
* Wry look , audience laughter *
However , for some reason proposal B has gotten so much more attention due to who controls the media and who controls debate in DC .
We ca n’t address discrepancies in wealth until we can change the discussion to give these proposals an equal footing .
After the Q&A , the audience lined up to get our books signed .
I finally decided on what I would say to Gore as he signed by book .
As my copy was slid in front of Gore , I shook his hand and said :
" Sir , I was in Dirksen for your testimony to the Senate .
You were wonderful .
You ’re one of my greatest heroes . "
Gore seemed to be taken aback .
He looked at me and said ,
" Thank you .
That ’s very kind of you to say .
That means a lot to me . "
I then said to him :
" Please , at least think about running for President . "
Gore smiled and replied ,
" Thank you .
I am . "
I smiled and trotted off the stage .
Al Gore continues to impress me and continues to fine tune his rhetoric to take tiny steps towards a run .
If you saw him on Olbermann tonight , you saw that as Gore once again refused to rule out a run .
But from what I gathered tonight as I spoke to him , Al Gore is thinking about running for President .
Trips to Chacaltaya were a favourite - this picture was taken in 1990
A favourite outing of ours was to pile into our sturdy old jeep , wind our way up a track that only just clung to the mountainside , and finally arrive at the foot of a majestic glacier called Chacaltaya .
Family photos from the time show sunburnt , smiling faces against a backdrop of a long , snow - covered glacier .
Chacaltaya was famous then for being the world 's highest ski run at 5,300 metres ( 17,400 feet ) .
I remember seeing exhausted but exhilarated skiers crashed out on the floor of a nearby ski lodge , gasping for breath .
Dryly - written articles in scientific journals have traced the rapid demise of the glacier as a result of rising air temperatures .
Reading them is like picking your way through a long obituary .
Chacaltaya could be as much as 18,000 years old , but it has lost 80 % of its area in the last 20 years .
It has become an icon of the effects of global warming , and a laboratory for predicting what is to befall other Andean glaciers .
Monitoring
Retracing the journey in 2007 turned out to be somewhat unexpected .
The day we chose to return was perfect for climate change sceptics .
A recent heavy snowfall had left the top of the track impassable by jeep , so we had to walk through deep snow .
We keep having to revise downwards our projections of when Chacaltaya is going to disappear completely
Edson Ramirez
" Days like this are completely misleading , " said Edson Ramirez , a 37 - year - old quietly - spoken Bolivian , who is his country 's leading expert on glaciers .
" It 's the wet season now .
The snow will melt quickly and run off the glacier . "
Sure enough , a few days later I received by e-mail a photo taken by members of Mr Ramirez 's team on 1 March of what was left of the glacier .
All that could be seen of what was once a 500 - metre long glacier are just two separate areas of ice .
Even on the day of our visit , you could see the clear outline of the two patches of glacier under the snow , measuring about 60 by 20 metres .
Not far away stood a forlorn ski lift , not used since 1998 .
" We keep having to revise downwards our projections of when Chacaltaya is going to disappear completely , " said Mr Ramirez , who has been monitoring the glacier since 1995 .
" Not long ago we thought it was going to be 2015 , now we think it could be this year or next . "
Impact feared
Mr Ramirez is not alone in stressing the dramatic acceleration of the glacial melt since the 1980s .
Tuni Condoriri provides drinking water to El Alto and parts of La Paz ( Photo : Edson Ramirez 's team )
Back down in La Paz , the head of the national climate change programme , Oscar Paz , said : " These glaciers are our water stores .
One of our great concerns is the future of our drinking water supplies . "
Chacaltaya may be a symbol of what is happening to small Andean glaciers , but it does not provide the water to La Paz and neighbouring El Alto , home to nearly two million people .
For that you have to travel about an hour down more bone - jarring tracks to the spectacular range of mountains called Tuni Condoriri , named after their appearance like a condor hunched ready to pounce .
A reservoir under the range provides about 80 % of the drinking water to El Alto and large parts of La Paz .
Bolivian and international glaciologists are shifting their attention here , in part because of fears over the impact of glacial melt on Bolivia 's long - term development .
Various measurements show the area of the 15 original glaciers in the range has reduced by more than a third from 1983 to 2006 .
Five glaciers may have already disappeared completely .
' Hurt '
The glaciers are particularly important during the dry seasons as they slowly release water .
" We do n't know exactly how much of the water supply comes from glacial melt but it could be as much as 60 % , " says Mr Ramirez .
Most worrying is when the glaciers completely disappear , which Mr Ramirez puts in the range of 2025 to 2050 .
Even now Bolivia has a pressing need for more water .
The arrival of several thousand migrants from rural areas to El Alto every year means demand for water will increase as the supply remains the same .
Mr Ramirez 's model predicts that as early as 2009 there will more demand than water available in the reservoirs .
Many agree that the long - term drop in water from glacial melt exacerbates the urgent necessity to capture more of the precipitations during the wet season , probably by building dams .
Mr Paz clearly thinks it wrong that desperately poor countries like Bolivia should have to pay the cost of adapting to global warming when they are not to blame .
In the meantime , Mr Ramirez and the team I travelled with were coping with the imminent loss of Chacaltaya by resorting to graveyard humour .
" Maybe we should put the last bit of the glacier in a freezer for posterity , " they said .
But there was no doubt about their sorrow .
" It really hurts , " they agreed .
" We have had the privilege of seeing their beauty .
The next generations will not . "
WHITE TIGER TRUTH
There are alligators in the New York sewer system , black cats are bad luck , tiger bone wine increases virility , and white tigers are a “ species ” that should be bred in captivity to “ preserve ” them .
It is not easy , and takes a long time , to dispel widely held public misperceptions .
Further , there is always a tendency to place value on anything that is rare .
That rarity can be equated with beauty .
Often we hear people talk about how beautiful white tigers are .
All tigers are beautiful .
But , when you think about it , are white tigers more beautiful than the wonderfully colored orange tigers ?
Wi thout getting into detailed genetics , white tigers are the result of a recessive gene .
If two golden tigers that have that gene mate , sometimes a white cub will be born .
If one or both of the mating tigers are white , the odds improve .
People often confuse Siberian , or Amur , tigers with white tigers because we think of snow when we think of Siberia .
Originally all white tigers were Bengal tigers in India .
But , there is a connection to the Siberian tiger .
Cross breeding Bengal tigers with Siberian tigers is believed to increase the odds of producing white cubs .
The result of that cross breeding is “ generic ” tigers , i.e. tigers who are not of pure subspecies and therefore have no conservation value .
All of the tigers in roadside zoos are generic tigers , including all white tigers , largely as a result of the effort to breed white tigers .
Over the centuries in India there were reports of white tigers .
There is no evidence we have seen that these were very common .
The last one reported seen in the wild was killed in 1958 .
The fact that none have been seen since suggests that they either have trouble surviving , perhaps because of the lack of camouflage , or that they are born very , very infrequently , or both .
The captive population began with the capture of one white cub , Mohan , whose mother and siblings were killed in order to capture him , in 1951 .
Mohan was bred to an orange tiger and all of the offspring were orange .
Mohan was then bred to one of his own orange daughters .
That produced white cubs , one of whom was brought to the United States and became the foundation of the breeding here .
So the origin of the white tigers here was already a function of inbreeding Mohan to his own daughter .
The breeding began in volume at one large zoo , then with Seigfried & Roy beginning in the early 1980s .
Their rarity created value , reportedly tens of thousands of dollars each back then .
That , and their popularity , incentivized roadside zoos and private breeders to try to create white tigers .
Many white tigers are born with defects .
One of the most common defects particularly seen in white tigers is being cross-eyed .
Our Sapphire is cross eyed , as are some of the other tigers pictured here .
One of the roadside zoo owners who promotes breeding of white tigers published a photo of himself riding around in his luxury car with cross eyed cub .
Our Zabu was missing her upper lip .
The most deformed white tiger we know of was Kenny , who came to Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas from a private breeder at 20 months old in 2000 .
No one knows if others are born with such severe defects because there is no tracking of cubs born at roadside zoos to know if they are destroyed at birth if they are born with such defects .
In 2011 the Association of Zoos & Aquariums ( AZA ) , the accrediting body for the major zoos , issued a White Paper documenting the reasons that breeding to foster a recessive gene like this was contrary to the principles of conservation and should not be done by their zoos .
One roadside zoo advocate of white tiger breeding , himself a very clever marketer , argues online that AZA only did this to “ protect AZA market share ” from non-AZA zoos .
Given that the public is drawn to white tigers based on misconceptions , this argument is ridiculous .
The roadside zoos that make an enormous amount of money charging the public to view , pet , or swim with white tiger cubs like to point to a thesis submitted by an undergraduate college student at Texas A&M University published in 2013 .
The study seems to conclude that white tigers are not significantly more inbred than golden tigers .
But the handful of genetic samples used in the study ( 14 to 20 ) came primarily from a few sanctuaries ( including Big Cat Rescue ) , some roadside zoos , a circus , and a private breeder .
Given that many of the orange tigers would have been the result of inbreeding to create white tigers , is it any surprise that these orange tigers tested as inbred as the white ones ?
Often on our tours when visitors spot one of our white tigers ( formerly Zabu , now Sapphire ) there is oohing and ahing with excitement that stems from the common misconception , attributed largely to master marketers Siegfried and Roy , that these rare tigers need to be bred and “ preserved . ”
We use that opportunity to educate visitors about the history of inbreeding and point to Sapphire ’s severely crossed eyes as an example .
If enough people learn not to patronize places that breed white tigers , there will no incentive to keep up the inbreeding used to create them .
Thanks for anything you can do to help us spread the word .
All White Tigers Are Inbred and Are Not Purebred
The ONLY way to produce a tiger or lion with a white coat is through inbreeding brother to sister or father to daughter ; generation after generation after generation .
The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats .
In June 2011 the board of directors for the American Zoological Association ( AZA ) formalized their 2008 ban on the breeding of white tigers , white lions or king cheetahs by their member zoos .
Their report said , “ Breeding practices that increase the physical expression of single rare alleles ( i.e. , rare genetic traits ) through intentional inbreeding , for example intentional breeding to achieve rare color - morphs such as white tigers , deer , and alligators , has been clearly linked with various abnormal , debilitating , and , at times , lethal , external and internal conditions and characteristics , which are outlined in this paper . ”
This change in policy came more than 12 years after Big Cat Rescue first released Dr. Laughlin ’s expose below .
The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain , thus all white tigers are cross eyed , even if their eyes look normal .
They also often suffer from club feet , cleft palates , spinal deformities and defective organs .
The white coat is a double recessive gene so most of the cubs born through this inbreeding have normal coloring but they too suffer the same defects and are referred to in the trade as “ throw away tigers . ”
As such , they are often killed at birth because only the white tigers are the big money makers .
And because none of these cats are purebred ( they are all crosses between Bengal tigers and Siberian tigers ) , they serve no conservation purpose .
The American Zoological Association ( AZA ) recognizes that these cats should not be bred and admonishes AZA accredited zoos not to breed any more of them .
The leader of the tiger Species Survival Plan states openly that the only reason people breed white tigers is because people will pay to see white tigers .
You can end the misery by just Saying NO to any place that breeds or exploits white tigers .

The White Tiger Fraud
Did you know the only way to produce a white tiger is through severe inbreeding of brother to sister , father to daughter and mother to son ?
Did you know that there is no such species as a Royal White Bengal Tiger ?
If you did n’t know that , do n’t feel bad , you were deceived just like millions of others .
Read on to learn the truth about white tigers , white lions , tabby tigers and other genetic aberrations .
Print the White Tiger Fact Sheet Brochure
Over the years many people have asked us to take white tigers off their hands , but in every case it was only so they could breed more babies to use , so we declined .
For years we have railed against supporting facilities that breed and exhibit white tigers because of the abuse involved in producing them .
White Tigers can ONLY exist in captivity by continual inbreeding , such as father to daughter , brother to sister , mother to son and so forth .
The white lions and golden tabby tigers are merely a product of this practice of inbreeding for white coats as well and are not being bred for any sort of conservation program either .
ALL white tigers are cross eyed , whether it shows or not , because the gene that causes the white coat always causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain .
That is why white tigers are such a favorite of the tiger - tamer - wanabees ; they are far more dependent upon their masters .
( See genetics and time line of the inbreeding below )
The myth of the Rare White Bengal Tiger was an illusion meant to deceive the public into thinking that these cats were endangered and being preserved for future generations .
The truth of the matter is that they are n’t even pure Bengal tigers , but rather are all the offspring of an original Siberian / Bengal cross breeding .
The inbreeding results in many defects , early deaths , still births and , as could be expected , the cats are not very bright which is why they are preferred for entertainment purposes .
To quote from Dr. Ron Tilson , Conservation Director of the Minnesota Zoo and manager of the world renown Tiger Species Survival Plan , “ The white tiger controversy among zoos is a small part ethics and a large part economics .
The tiger Species Survival Plan has condemned breeding white tigers because of their mixed ancestry , most have been hybridized with other subspecies and are of unknown lineage , and because they serve no conservation purpose .
Owners of white tigers say they are popular exhibit animals and increase zoo attendance and revenues as well .
The same rationalization can be applied to the selective propagation of white lions , king cheetahs and other phenotypically aberrant animals . ”
“ White tigers are an aberration artificially bred and proliferated
by some zoos , private breeders and a few circuses who do so for
economic rather than conservation reasons . ”
“ However , there is an unspoken issue that shames the very integrity of zoos , their alleged conservation programs and their message to the visiting public .
To produce white tigers or any other phenotypic curiosity , directors of zoos and other facilities must continuously inbreed father to daughter and father to granddaughter and so on .
At issue is a contradiction of fundamental genetic principles upon which all Species Survival Plans for endangered species in captivity are based .
White tigers are an aberration artificially bred and proliferated by some zoos , private breeders and a few circuses who do so for economic rather than conservation reasons . ”
As for breeding tigers of any color , Ron Tilson says , “ For private owners to say , ‘ We ’re saving tigers , ’ is a lie , ” Tilson says .
“ They are not saving tigers ; they ’re breeding them for profit . ”
Tilson says the exotic animal market is a multimillion dollar industry , ranking just below the illegal drug trade and just above the illegal gun market .
Tilson says tigers are the most charismatic animal on earth .
Their appeal is universal .
“ They are the alpha predator who used to kill and eat us , ” he says .
“ We can not help but be in awe of their power and grace .
Tigers represent everything fine and decent and powerful .
Everything those people would like to be .
It ’s all an ego trip — big guns , big trucks , and big tigers . ”
… most have such profound birth defects , such as immune deficiency ,
scoliosis of the spine ( distorted spine ) , cleft palates , mental impairments and grotesquely crossed eyes that bulge from their skull …
Consider this :
Only 1 in 4 tiger cubs from a white tiger bred to an orange tiger carrying the white gene are born white , and 80 % of those die from birth defects associated with the inbreeding necessary to cause a white coat .
Of those surviving , most have such profound birth defects , such as immune deficiency , scoliosis of the spine ( distorted spine ) , cleft palates , mental impairments and grotesquely crossed eyes that bulge from their skull that only a small percentage are suitable for display .
Due to these birth defects , white tigers often die an early death .
According to some tiger trainers , only 1 in 30 of those white cats will consistently perform .
The number of tigers that have to be produced and disposed of in order to fill the public ’s desire to see white tigers on display is staggering .
Big Cat Rescue has never taken in a white tiger before because we did not want to enable people to dispose of their “ defective ” cats and cause so much more suffering and abuse by having an easy dumping ground for the cats who did n’t serve them .
Even though Zabu is black and white , the decision of whether or not to rescue her was not .
When Zabu and Cameron ’s plight came to our attention we had to think long and hard about whether or not we would have a white tiger on our tour .
We did n’t want to be perceived as using a white tiger to draw visitors .
Many times on our tours we tell guests about the fraud that has been promoted to the public about white tigers and talk about all of our golden tigers who ended up unwanted and abandoned at our door because they were the wrong color .
Now we were considering turning away a white tiger because she was the wrong color .
In her case the facility was being shut down and by rescuing her we were not enabling the owner to breed more and we were keeping a cat of prime breeding age from falling into the hands of people who would breed her to death .
Every year we have to turn away hundreds of big cats .
Please do not support those who breed these majestic animals for a life of cruel confinement .
No animal , especially a tiger , belongs in a cage .

Zoo Vet on the White Tiger Fraud
by Dan Laughlin , DVM , Ph.D .
I would like to take this opportunity to offer a very relevant fact regarding all the white tigers that are currently in the U.S.
About twenty - five years ago I fully researched and documented the accurate genealogy and origin of the white tiger in the U.S.
That research revealed that there were and are two separate origins of white tigers .
The one that has received all the attention is the Indian or Bengal tiger bloodline which originated in India and entered the U.S. via a breeding loan to the National Zoo .
One of the Indian origin tigers carrying the recessive gene for the white color was the mother of the second litter of white tigers born at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1976 .
The original litter of white tigers born at Cincinnati in 1974 and all subsequent Indian origin bloodline white tigers soon died out in the U.S. without leaving any pure Indian origin Bengal white tigers in the U.S .
What is not known , because I have never published my research definitively showing the true origin of the white tiger in the U.S. , is that there is a second and separate origin of the white tiger which occurred spontaneously in two separate private collections in this country when both owners inbred brothers to sisters that were all offspring of two litters resulting from crossing a pure Siberian male and a Bengal female at a small zoo in South Dakota .
Of the twelve live cubs born to the Siberian male and Bengal female at that small zoo , one of the private individuals purchased a litter of two cubs , a brother and sister , and the other individual purchased another litter of five cubs , brothers and sisters , through an animal dealer .
Both individuals inbred their brothers and sisters and spontaneously had white tiger cubs born .
One white male crossbred tiger , half - Siberian and half - Bengal , was placed on loan to the Cincinnati Zoo where he was crossed with a white carrier female Bengal tiger on loan from the National Zoo .
That hybrid crossing in 1976 of the two separate white tiger origin bloodlines produced a litter of four white tiger cubs and one normal colored white carrier cub .
“ the Zoo proceeded to repeatedly inbreed … the white male to his white female sister …
Thus , every white tiger ever born at the Cincinnati Zoo is part Siberian tiger and part Bengal tiger …
It is those offspring which have been disseminated throughout the U.S. ”
The Cincinnati Zoo then returned both parents and three of the cubs to the two exhibitors that had placed their adults there on loan and then the Zoo proceeded to repeatedly inbreed back and forth the white male to his white female sister that the Zoo had retained ownership of for themselves .
Thus , every white tiger ever born at the Cincinnati Zoo was and is part Siberian tiger and part Bengal tiger to a greater or lesser degree .
It is those offspring which have been disseminated throughout the U.S.
One of the individuals who owned the litter of five brothers and sisters representing the American crossbred white tiger bloodline has continued to inbreed his tigers for over the past twenty - five years even though his neonate mortality rate has often exceeded eighty per cent and his tigers are severely defective and unfit .
By pure chance and against overwhelming odds , when the two separate bloodlines , the Indian and American , were crossed for the first and only time at the Cincinnati Zoo , the offspring were fairly thrifty and of normal birth weight .
Interestingly , anyone with even cursory experience with and knowledge of the five remaining and endangered subspecies of tigers should be able to simply look at the white tigers throughout the U.S. and clearly see the phenotypic Siberian characteristics present in the cats .
Some weigh up to seven hundred pounds and most clearly resemble and exhibit Siberian tiger physical characteristics .
The only conceivable legitimate reason for exhibiting a white tiger would be for educational purposes to clearly and unequivocally illustrate to the public the process of natural selection and how , when a deleterious recessive genetic mutation randomly occurs that is disadvantageous for the survival of the animal , such as white color in a tropical jungle environment , the animal does not survive to pass on that genetic mutation or disadvantageous characteristic to its offspring .
This was the normal course of natural selection and evolution of the tiger until a young white tiger male was captured in 1951 , raised and then inbred to one of his daughters by a Maharajah in India who had captured him .
Then , in the early 1970 ’s , the recessive genetic mutation for the white color was present in both the male Siberian tiger and the female Bengal tiger that was exhibited and bred at the small zoo in South Dakota resulting in the origin of the American white tiger bloodline .
To quote from Dr. Ron Tilson , Conservation Director of the Minnesota Zoo , “ The white tiger controversy among zoos is a small part ethics and a large part economics .
The tiger Species Survival Plan has condemned breeding white tigers because of their mixed ancestry , most have been hybridized with other subspecies and are of unknown lineage , and because they serve no conservation purpose .
Owners of white tigers say they are popular exhibit animals and increase zoo attendance and revenues as well .
The same rationalization can be applied to the selective propagation of white lions , king cheetahs , and other phenotypically aberrant animals . ”
“ However , there is an unspoken issue that shames the very integrity of zoos , their alleged conservation programs and their message to the visiting public .
To produce white tigers or any other phenotypic curiosity , directors of zoos and other facilities must continuously inbreed father to daughter and father to granddaughter and so on .
At issue is a contradiction of fundamental genetic principles upon which all Species Survival Plans for endangered species in captivity are based .
White tigers are an aberration artificially bred and proliferated by some zoos , private breeders and a few circuses who do so for economic rather than conservation reasons . ”
“ …every white tiger in the U.S. is not only the result of repeated inbreeding of genetically defective animals but , even worse , is a hybrid or crossbred animal . ”
Dr. Tilson made these comments before I informed him that all the white tigers in the U.S. are crossbred or hybrid animals , part Siberian and part Bengal .
So , in conclusion , every white tiger in the U.S. is not only the result of repeated inbreeding of genetically defective animals but , even worse , is a hybrid or crossbred animal .
Thus , anyone involved in breeding and / or exhibiting white tigers is doing a great disservice to honest conservation and preservation efforts to save the five remaining and endangered subspecies of tigers barely clinging to survival in their rapidly diminishing natural habitats .
“ anyone involved in breeding and / or exhibiting white tigers is doing a great disservice to … conservation … efforts to save the 5 … species of tigers … ”
The genealogical misrepresentation , repeated inbreeding , exhibition and sale , for $ 60,000 each , of white tigers by the Cincinnati Zoo initiated the greatest conservation deception of the American public in history .
That deception continues through today .
In my view , exhibiting and breeding white tigers is the very antithesis of conservation , is dishonest and unethical and is tantamount to catering to the public ’s desire to see genetic aberrations rather than educating the public regarding the incredible process of natural selection , how the unbelievable diversity of life has evolved on our planet throughout the past 50 million years and the crucial need for us to preserve natural habitats and stop the destruction of our global ecosystem if we desire to save any threatened or endangered species from extinction .
This white tiger is not living on Easy Street !

Note : Dr. Laughlin is widely recognized internationally for his expertise in the care and management of zoological animals , especially zoological cats and elephants .
He has an international consulting practice limited to zoological animals and when he completed his research into the accurate genealogy of the white tiger he had well over 250 tigers in his practice alone .
He also completed a landmark four - year study in the 1970 ’s determining the efficacy , dosage , and safety of a modified - live trivalent FVRC - P vaccine for use on zoological cats .
That study included 224 zoological cats representing 19 different species and the results of that vaccination study have saved the lives of thousands of captive zoological cats .
Dr. Laughlin has graciously agreed to be a Consultant for the care and management of our extensive collection of zoological cats at “ Big Cat Rescue . ”
Genetics of the White Tiger
White Tigers can ONLY exist in captivity by continual inbreeding , such as father to daughter , brother to sister , mother to son and so forth .
This is because the white color is the result of a double recessive allele ( gene ) and thus the white color can only be produced by inbreeding one tiger carrying the recessive gene for the white color to another tiger carrying the same recessive gene .
Before the five remaining species of tigers were pushed to the brink of extinction by the activities of humans , the random occurrence of one normal colored tiger carrying the recessive gene for the white color breeding to another normal colored tiger also carrying the recessive gene for white color , thus producing one or possibly two cubs possessing the double allele for the white color and consequently being born white , occurred about once in every 10,000 births .
That statistical approximation is based upon recorded observations in the wild of white cubs .
It should be noted that the first recorded observation of a white cub was made in the mid-fifteenth century and the only wild observations of white cubs have been in Bengal tigers .
Because the white coloration is so disadvantageous to survival there is no recorded evidence of a white cub ever living long enough in the wild to become an adult .
That is why white tigers ONLY exist in captivity and then ONLY as the result of continual , destructive and unethical inbreeding .
Thus , the concept of the “ Royal Rare White Bengal Tiger ” is a myth and likely the most deceptive misconception and most destructive conservation fraud ever perpetrated on the American public .
The truth is that all the white tigers currently in the United States are not even Bengal tigers but are worthless hybrids or crossbreds originating from normal colored offspring born to a pure Siberian male tiger and a pure Bengal female tiger that were kept together during the 1960 ’s at the Sioux Falls , S.D. Zoo .
Unknown to the Zoo at that time or to the two private exhibitors who purchased cubs from two litters born at the Zoo , all the normal colored cubs carried the recessive gene for the white color because either or both their Siberian father or their Bengal mother was a or were random carriers of the recessive mutant gene .
Thus when the two private exhibitors that purchased litter mates from the Sioux Falls Zoo unethically bred brother to sister , the recessive mutant genes were paired , producing one or two white tigers .
“ … private exhibitors have experienced neonatal mortality rates in excess of 80 % because the recessive gene for the white color is a deleterious mutation … ”
Both private exhibitors have experienced neonatal mortality rates in excess of 80 % because the recessive gene for the white color is a deleterious mutation and thus is co-linked to numerous other deleterious and often fatal characteristics such as immune deficiency , strabismus ( crossed eyes ) , scoliosis of the spine ( distorted spine ) , cleft palates , mental impairments and early death .
The genetics of all recessive genes works like this :
If we assign , say a capital “ N ” to represent normal color in a tiger and a small “ w ” to represent white color ( because the white color is recessive and the orange color is dominant ) , then a normal colored orange tiger would be represented as “ NN ” and a normal colored orange tiger carrying the recessive gene for the white color would be represented as “ Nw . ”
So , if we bred a normal colored orange tiger to a normal colored orange tiger carrying the recessive gene for the white color , we would represent that cross as “ NN ” x “ Nw ” and the offspring would be represented as half “ NN ” and half “ Nw ” .
In other words , one - half of the cubs would be normal orange color non-carriers and one - half would be normal color orange carriers of the recessive white gene .
Then , if the two normal color orange carriers of the white gene were bred to each other ( brother to sister ) the genetic representation would be : “ Nw ” x “ Nw ” and the offspring would be something like this : one - fourth “ NN ” , one - half “ Nw ” and one - fourth “ ww ” .
In other words , one out of four cubs , statistically , would be a normal orange colored non-carrier cub ( “ NN ” ) , one - half of the cubs would be normal orange colored carriers of the recessive white gene ( 2 “ Nw ” ) and one cub would be a double allele carrier of the white recessive gene ( “ ww ” ) and thus be colored white .
But , when you cross a white male to a white female ( “ ww ” x “ ww ” ) you can only have all white cubs born ( “ ww ” ) and that is what The Cincinnati Zoo and individuals such as Siegfried and Roy have been doing for at least the past fifteen generations , always breeding for large size , thus unknowingly emphasizing the Siberian phenotypic or physical characteristics deriving from “ Kubla , ” the pure Siberian male at the Sioux Falls , S.D. Zoo .
Inbreeding Time Line
Chronology of the white Bengal tiger up until the death of Mohan :
1820 : A white tiger was displayed at Exeter Change .
1915 : White tiger cub captured by Maharajah Gulab Singh of Rewa .
Upon its death , it was gifted to King George V as a sign of India ’s loyalty to the crown .
25th May 1951 : A forest laborer reported sighting a white tiger cub .
26th May 1951 : The cub ’s mother and two of its three siblings were shot and killed .
27th May 1951 : Maharaja Martand Singh captured Mohan .
30th May 1951 : The cub escapes and a large party goes out to recapture it .
26th February 1952 : A normal colored tigress named Begum is captured .
10th April 1955 : Begum produced a litter of a male and two female cubs .
All were orange , as were all the cubs in her subsequent two litters .
December 1957 : Mohan was mated with Radha , his four - year - old daughter from the second litter with Begum .
20th October 1958 : Radha produced an all - white litter of a male and three female cubs .
They were christened Raja , Rani , Sukeshi , and Mohini .
Subsequently :
The male and one female ( Raja and Rani ) were gifted to the National Zoological Gardens in New Delhi .
Mohini was transported to Washington D.C .
Sukeshi was kept for mating with Mohan and remained with him until he was withdrawn from breeding .
She was then housed with her son in hopes they would breed but he showed no interest in mating with her and after six years without success , she too was transferred to the National Zoological Gardens in New Delhi where she died on the 2nd February 1975 .
May 1964 : Raja and Rani were mated .
Rani gave birth to two white cubs , a male and a female .
She mauled both and the female died .
The male , ‘ Tippu ’ lost his tail and was hand - raised with great difficulty .
August 1965 : Two white cubs born to Rani .
Both died due to neglect .
19th December 1965 : Three white cubs are born to Rani .
They were left in her care for just over a month , at which point she lost interest and they were hand - raised .
The female dies at the age of 17 - months and one male dies on the 17th April 1967 during shipping to the United States .
Breeding of Rani continued and she produced a total of 20 white cubs .
19th December 1969 : Mohan died aged 19 years 7 months .
All captive white tigers descend from Mohan , which explains why they are so genetically inbred .
Please !
Never pay to see or touch a white tiger .

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials emphatically denied that charge , saying that the arrests had been planned since April .
( The identity - card program , believed to be the first of its kind in the nation , was first suggested by Mr. DeStefano in 2005 . )
The details of the arrests are still somewhat unclear .
Federal officials said that they were “ targeting fugitives , ” not conducting a widespread sweep .
Twenty nine men and two women — most of them from Mexico , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Guinea and Ecuador — were arrested .
City officials said on Thursday that of the 16 arrest warrants the federal agents had , only four were executed , meaning that most of the 31 arrested were swept up in what they called a dragnet , and that 12 people the federal officials were looking for remained at large .

Lawyers and advocates for immigrants who interviewed several relatives of those who were arrested said that in most cases , the immigration officials knocked on their doors and demanded to speak with every adult in the house , then asked for identification .
In several instances , they said , the agents separated the men from the women and asked which of the women had children .
Those who did were left behind , while those who did not were taken into custody , the advocates said .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have conducted hundreds of similar sweeps in the last year .
In 2006 , a spokesman said , they deported more than 221,000 illegal immigrants , many of them after proceedings that began with such arrests .
Last fall , an operation in Danbury led to the arrest of 11 men who worked at a local factory .
Immigration advocates in Connecticut were fond of referring to Danbury and New Haven as two poles on the spectrum — the same immigrants who were shunned in the former were welcomed in the latter .

EUROPAS GRÖSSTE ZEITUNG WIRD FUNFZIG - EIN ANLASS ZUM FEIERN ?
FÜNF SCHICKSALE , DIE DAGEGEN SPRECHEN .
GUDRUN STAEB , 46 , FRÜHERE LEBENSGEFÄHRTIN VON RAIMUND HARMSTORF .
ER ERHÄNGTE SICH AM 3 .
MAI 1998 , EINEN TAG , NACHDEM BILD BERICHTET HATTE : » SEEWOLF RAIMUND HARMSTORF IN DER PSYCHIATRIE « .
Der Freitagabend bevor sich Raimund das Leben nahm , war seit langer Zeit mal wieder ein schöner Abend für uns .
Ich hatte eingekauft , das Haus beheizt , einfach alles wieder ein bisschen in Gang gebracht .
Am nächsten Tag wollten wir über das Wochenende an den Bodensee fahren .
Um ein bisschen Abstand zu gewinnen und uns anzuschauen , was wir liebten : Wasser und Segelschiffe .
Wir hatten den Monat davor beide in Kliniken verbracht .
Am 5 . April war ich wegen eines äußerst schmerzhaften und komplizierten Bandscheibenvorfalls in das Krankenhaus eingewiesen worden ; am nächsten Morgen wurde Raimund mit einer Medikamentenvergiftung eingeliefert .
Er hatte Parkinson und seine größte Angst war , dass es jemand bemerken würde .
Denn der Seewolf durfte kein Parkinson haben .
Der musste mit einer
Hand eine rohe Kartoffel zerdrücken können .
Deshalb nahm er Medikamente , die Parkinson - Symptome , wie das Zittern , unterdrückten .
Und er nahm wahrscheinlich viel zu viel - immer , wenn er dachte , er würde mit Menschen zusammentreffen , selbst bevor er einkaufen wollte .
Das ging seit vielen Monaten so und Raimunds ganzes Wesen hatte sich verändert .
Er war gehetzt und getrieben .
Erst nachdem er in die Klinik eingeliefert worden war , erfuhr ich von den Nebenwirkungen der Medikamente : Angstzustände , Wahnvorstellungen , Psychosen .
Deshalb ist er , auch als die akute Vergiftung schon ausgestanden war , freiwillig in klinisch - psychiatrischer Behandlung geblieben .
Nach vier
Wochen ging es ihm wesentlich besser und er durfte das Krankenhaus für ein Wochenende verlassen .
Ich bin am selben Tag aus der Klinik entlassen worden und habe ihn abgeholt .
Wir sind nach Hause gefahren , haben uns vor den Kamin gesetzt und viel geredet .
Irgendwie schien er nach den Monaten , in denen er von seiner Angst , entdeckt zu werden , fast besessen war , wie erlöst .
Er hatte sein Gleichgewicht wieder ein wenig gefunden und ich schöpfte Hoffnung , dass wir diese wirklich schwierige Zeit ausgestanden hätten .
Doch ich irrte mich .
Am nächsten Morgen klingelte es . Ich war gerade im Badezimmer , also machte Raimund die Tür auf .
Kurze Zeit später kam er die Treppe nach oben gerannt , total außer sich , und hielt mir die Kopie der ersten Bild - Seite entgegen : » Seewolf Raimund Harmstorf in der Psychiatrie « .
Auf einer anderen Seite , ebenfalls kopiert , kam dann ein kurzer Abriss seines Lebens , zusammengeschrumpft auf Unfälle und persönliche Niederlagen .
» Mit aufgeschnittenem Handgelenk aufgegriffen « , stand da und noch ein paar Sachen , die einfach gelogen waren .
Ein Reporter von der Bunten hatte diese Kopien gebracht - warum Kopien , weiß ich auch nicht - , aber Raimund sagte nur : » Das kann doch nicht wahr sein , das muss ein schlechter Scherz sein . «
Es klingelte noch einmal ; diesmal machte ich auf .
Wieder stand dieser Mensch vor der Tür , mit der Bild unterm Arm , und er sagte : » Herr Harmstorf hat mir nicht geglaubt .
Deshalb hier das Original . «
Das Telefon klingelte jetzt ununterbrochen , Journalisten riefen an , um mit Raimund zu sprechen .
Er riss den Stecker aus der Wand , dann steckte er ihn wieder rein , weil vielleicht ein Freund oder Bekannter anrufen würde .
Ich weiß noch , wie er zu einem sagte : » Das ist doch mein Todesurteil . «
Raimund hatte die Vorhänge runtergelassen , denn auch vor der Tür standen mittlerweile die Reporter .
Das war wie eine Belagerung , der absolute Wahnsinn .
Und wir waren damit allein , in die Klinik konnte Raimund auch nicht mehr .
Zu viele Journalisten , hatte sein Arzt gewarnt .
Um etwas Normales zu tun , habe ich abends angefangen , etwas zu kochen .
Spargel mit Kartoffeln .
Nach ein paar Minuten kam Raimund in die Küche gehetzt : » Jetzt bringen sie die Bild - Geschichte auf RTL « , rief er .
Er fragte mich dann » Ist das mein Leben ?
Habe ich denn nie Theater gespielt und Filme gedreht ? «
Wir sind dann ziemlich früh ins Bett gegangen und von dem , was in der Nacht passiert ist , habe ich nichts mitbekommen .
Denn wir haben uns wie immer Ohropax in die Ohren getan .
Ich habe außerdem noch ein ziemlich starkes Schmerzmittel genommen , weil mir die Bandscheibe unheimlich wehtat .
Ich weiß nur noch , dass ich vor dem Einschlafen seine Hand genommen habe .
Als ich dann am nächsten Morgen so gegen sechs aufgewacht bin , war der Platz neben mir leer .
Leer und kalt .
MAIK HAUKE , 22 .
IM NOVEMBER 2000 SCHRIEB B/LD , IM SÄCHSISCHEN SEBNiTZ SEI EIN KLEINER JUNGE VON NEONAZIS ERMORDET WORDEN .
HAUKE WAR EINER DER VERMEINTLICHEN TÄTER .
» Jetzt endlich kann Josephs Tod gesühnt werden « , stand in dem Artikel .
Daneben war mein Foto und der Satz : » Hager , Bürstenhaarschnitt : Maik H. - unter Mordverdacht verhaftet « .
Da kamen dann fünf Mithäftlinge und sagten : » Das bist du doch . «
Die wollten mir ans Leder .
Dazu muss man wissen , dass es auch im Gefängnis eine Hackordnung gibt .
Kindermörder sind da das Allerletzte .
Ich hatte auf dem Foto zwar einen Balken vor den Augen , aber man konnte mich schon erkennen .
Ich hab dann versucht , mich rauszureden : Ich bin hier wegen Körperverletzung , komme gar nicht aus Sebnitz und so .
Das haben die mir aber nicht geglaubt ; einmal hing ein Foto von dem kleinen Joseph an meiner
Tür , dann wieder riefen sie beim Hofgang » Kindermörder « , » Drecksau « .
Ich mein , man glaubt immer , im Gefängnis kann einem nichts passieren , aber ich muss sagen , ich hatte richtig Angst .
Manchmal hab ich wirklich gedacht : » Ich will nicht mehr . «
Nach fünf Tagen war dann klar , dass die Bild Mist geschrieben hat , und eigentlich sollte ich entlassen werden .
Die Polizei meinte aber , es ist besser , wenn ich noch eine Nacht in Schutzhaft bin .
Die Situation in Sebnitz war durch die Berichte so aufgeheizt , dass ich mich da nicht blicken lassen sollte .
Erst am nächsten
Tag wurde in einer Pressekonferenz gesagt , dass wir unschuldig sind .
Als ich dann meine Mutter wieder gesehen habe , habe ich 'nen unheimlichen Schreck bekommen .
Die war völlig fertig , da ging gar nichts mehr .
Ich hab sie bloß noch in den Arm genommen und selber eine Runde geflennt .
Jetzt will man mir 55 Euro für die Haft zahlen , als Entschädigung .
Das war 's dann .
Die Bild hat sich nicht mal bei mir entschuldigt .
ULLA JELPKE , 51 , PDS - BUNDESTAGSABGEORDNETE .
MISSBRAUCH UND EIN BABY - » IN BILD ERZÄHLT SIE ALLES « , HlESS ES 1991 .
DABEI WOLLTE ULLA JELPKE GAR NICHTS ERZÄHLEN .
Noch immer kommen Leute auf mich zu und fragen , was das damals eigentlich sollte .
Zum Beispiel Burkhard Hirsch von der FDP , mit dem ich gemeinsam im Innenausschuss des Bundestags saß .
Vor einiger Zeit haben wir nach einer
Sitzung noch über irgendetwas geredet , da fragte er ganz unvermittelt : » Was war das eigentlich mit der Bild - Zeitung ? «
Jahre später !
Da wurde mir klar :
Das wirst du nie wieder los .
Wahrscheinlich war mein Fehler , überhaupt mit dem Bild - Reporter zu sprechen .
Aber ich dachte , es wäre die einzige Chance , die Veröffentlichung meiner Geschichte zu verhindern .
Ich hatte einer befreundeten Journalistin für einen Artikel in der Brigitte von meiner Tochter erzählt , die bei ihren Adoptiveltern lebt .
Ganz am Rande wurde auch erwähnt , dass sie von meinem Stiefvater stammt , der mich missbraucht hatte .
Ich hoffte damals , die Adoptiveltern meiner Tochter würden den Artikel lesen und vielleicht Kontakt zu mir aufnehmen - was auch geschah .
Ich habe heute zu meiner Tochter und ihren Eltern ein richtig gutes Verhältnis .
Die Bild witterte aber eine große Geschichte und bedrängte die Adoptiveltern und Verwandte von mir , den Namen meines Stiefvaters und andere Details zu nennen .
Adoption , Missbrauch und eine Abgeordnete - die wollten das richtig ausschlachten .
Auch bei mir meldeten sich ständig Bild - Reporter und versuchten , mich in Gespräche zu verwickeln .
Ich habe dann selber bei der Bild in Hamburg angerufen und den damaligen Chefredakteur Hans - Hermann Tiedje gebeten , von der Veröffentlichung der Geschichte abzusehen .
Sogar mit juristischen Schritten habe ich ihrn gedroht .
Trotzdem war ich mir fast sicher , dass die den Artikel bringen würden .
Also bat ich einen Freund in Hamburg , nachts die Bild am Bahnhof zu kaufen .
» Abgeordnete vom Vater missbraucht .
Baby .
In Bild erzählt sie alles « , stand da auf Seite eins .
Es ging nur noch um den Missbrauch , die Fakten waren größtenteils falsch , zusammengeklaubt aus dem Brigitte - Artikel und Zitaten , die ich nicht freigegeben hatte , teilweise waren sie auch einfach erfunden .
Und bei all dem wurde der Eindruck erweckt , ich hätte mich der Bild - Zeitung freiwillig offenbart .
Es war widerlich .
Aber das Schlimmste war , als ich am nächsten Morgen in den Innenausschuss kam .
Da saßen die Kollegen aus allen Parteien , lasen Bild oder guckten mich schweigend an .
JÜRGEN TRITTIN , 47 .
» WAS MACHTE MINISUR TRITTIN AUF DIESER GEWALT - DEMO ? « , FRAGTE BILD IM JANUAR 2001 .
Es war an einem Montag .
Ich weiß nicht mehr , ob ich im Auto oder in meinem Büro saß , als ich das Foto in Bild gesehen habe .
Ich war fassungslos , dachte mir , das kann doch wohl nicht wahr sein .
Eine Zeitung macht mit einer so plumpen Fälschung auf .
Das Originalbild war in Farbe schon Sonntag vorab in einem Nachrichtenmagazin zu sehen gewesen .
Bild jedoch gab das Foto in Schwarz - Weiß , schlecht gerastert und an den Rändern stark beschnitten wieder .
Jeder Schüler , der sich halbwegs mit Bildbearbeitung auskennt , hätte das besser gekonnt .
Und weil da nichts mehr richtig zu erkennen war , drängten die Bild - Redakteure ihren Lesern mit den einmontierten Hinweisen auf , was sie sehen sollten :
So wurde aus einem Handschuh ein Bolzenschneider und aus einem Tau ein Schlagstock .
Ich war ja schon einiges gewöhnt von Bild .
Zum Beispiel hatte sie mal behauptet , ich hätte mit meinem Dienstwagen einen Stau verursacht , nur weil ich am Straßenrand Croissants kaufen wollte .
Aber dieses verfälschte Foto mit dem angeblichen Schlagstock und dem Bolzenschneider , das schlug alles .
Dass eine Zeitung versucht , ein Mitglied der Bundesregierung mit einem verfälschten Foto in Misskredit zu bringen - das hatte es in Deutschland noch nicht gegeben .
Ich wurde von Bild als Sympathisant von Gewalttätern dargestellt , dabei hatte ich 1994 auf dieser Demonstration in Göttingen , wo das Foto entstanden war , versucht , zwischen Polizei und Demonstranten zu vermitteln .
Das hat später selbst der Göttinger Polizeichef bestätigt .
Von meinen Parteikollegen waren die meisten über diese Berichterstattung entsetzt .
Selbst diejenigen , die die Proteste gegen die Bild - Zeitung in den 68em bewusst erlebt hatten , hätten nicht gedacht , dass Bild so weit gehen würde .
Ich habe mich dann mit Chefredakteur Kai Diekmann verbinden lassen und der hat wohl erkannt , dass Bild hier zu weit gegangen war .
Jedenfalls machte er einen Rückzieher und hat sich bei mir entschuldigt .
Was Bild da gemacht hat , war Teil einer Kampagne , mit der das Blatt zu Beginn des Jahres 2001 versuchte , mich und andere Minister wegen einer angeblich gewalttätigen Vergangenheit zum Rücktritt zu bewegen .
Offenbar wollte Bild auf die Politik übertragen , was sonst nur bei der Fußball - Nationalmannschaft klappt , nämlich die Mannschaftsaufstellung zu beeinflussen .

GEBURTSTAG VON BILD IST AUCH FÜR IHN EIN JUBILÄUM : VOR 25 JAHREN SCHLICH ER SICH ALS HANS ESSER IN DIE BILD - REDAKTION HANNOVER EIN .
Verglichen mit Drogen war Bild in den Siebzigern das Allerhärteste : Heroin .
Mittlerweile ist das Blatt wie ein Ersatzstoff beim Entzug , sozusagen wie im Methadonprogramm .
Daran habe ich bestimmt auch einen Anteil , selbst der Bundesgerichtshof hat mir attestiert , bei Bild » Fehlentwicklungen des Journalismus « aufgedeckt zu haben .
Das macht mich nicht besonders stolz , aber es ist eine gewisse Genugtuung .
Denn die Bild - Geschichte hat mir zeitweise auch ziemlich zugesetzt .
In den Jahren nach dem Erscheinen meiner Bücher gab es kaum einen Monat , in dem der Springer - Verlag nicht irgendeinen Prozess gegen mich geführt hat .
Die wollten mich mürbe machen .
Dafür haben sie alle Register gezogen : Mein Telefon wurde abgehört , man hat mich als Untergrundkommunist diffamiert , ein Bild - Schreiber hat aus Dossiers des Bundesnachrichtendienstes ein ganzes Buch über mich verfasst .
Das wurde dann in einer hohen Auflage kostenlos an Journalisten , Richter , Staatsanwälte und Polizeistationen verteilt .
Zusätzlich hat Bild Detektive auf mich angesetzt .
Einer hat sich meine Freundschaft erschlichen , um mich auszuhorchen .
In einem anderen Fall war es eine Frau , die sie mir angedient haben .
Nicht gerade mein Typ , aber auch nicht unattraktiv , sie gab vor , dass sie für die BBC arbeite .
Erst kurz bevor es ernst wurde , habe ich über Umwege erfahren , dass sie einen Auftraggeber hat : Bild .
Wer jetzt denkt , das ist doch alles ganz spannend - Detekteien , schöne Frauen - , dem kann ich nur sagen :
Wenn man nicht mehr weiß , wem man trauen kann - das ist ein Scheißgefühl .
Aber andere , die von Bild im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes gerufmordet worden waren und sich nicht wehren konnten , so wie ich , haben sich deshalb das Leben genommen .
Ich habe zahlreiche Abschiedsbriefe , die das beweisen .
Heute ist Bild etwas milder geworden und viele , auch staatstragende Politiker , haben sich mit dem Blatt arrangiert .
Denken
Sie nur an die Filmbiografie von Axel Springer , Der Verleger - eine völlig verkitschte und teilweise verlogene Darstellung , die an Heldenfilme aus der DDR erinnert .
Oder nehrnen sie die Wochenzeitung Die Zeit : Das Blatt hatte sich Anfang 2001 in einem Dossier mit den neuen Köpfen im Springer - Konzern kritisch auseinander gesetzt ; anschließend schreibt der Zeit - Verleger dem Springer - Chef einen Brief , in dem er sich dafür entschuldigt .
Da wächst einiges zusammen , was eigentlich nicht zusammengehört .
Bild , BamS und Glotze , sagt der Bundeskanzler Schröder , seien seine wichtigsten Medien , und lässt dort nebst Gattin die rechten Sprüche gegen Ausländer und Sexualstraftäter los .
Da ist es auch kein Wunder , dass er einen früheren Bild - Mann , Bela Anda , zu seinem Sprecher ernennt .
Stoiber hat mit ihm gleichgezogen und den ehemaligen Chefredakteur von Bild am Sonntag zu seinem Wahlkampfmanager gemacht .
Dass Bild aber trotzdem noch Zähne hat , lässt sich ja gerade jetzt im Vorwahlkampf beobachten : Jeder vermeintliche Fehler eines rot-grünen Ministers wird auf der ersten Seite ausgeweidet .
Gleichzeitig wird Stoiber als das » weißblaue Kraftwerk « gefeiert , und Leute , die gegen ihn demonstrieren , werden pauschal als Chaoten abgestempelt .
In Wahlkampfzeiten kann man sich bei Bild darauf verlassen , dass stets der rechte Kandidat favorisiert wird .

Al rondklikkend op de iPhone website viel me op dat de telefoon ook een stuk kleiner is geworden , sinds de introductie eind vorig jaar .
Maar helaas , er blijkt enkel wat - misleidend - geshopped te zijn .
Wanneer we de nieuwe iPhone persfoto's koppelen aan de originele , blijkt dat ze gewoon een grotere hand hebben gebruikt , waardoor de telefoon automatisch kleiner lijkt .
UPDATE 23/6 : Welcome Boing Boing readers !
Apple has since removed the signup page with the new photo and just redirects to the generic iPhone page .

This microprocessor cross section shows empty space in between the chip´s wiring .
Wires are usually insulated with a glass - like material .
IBM has integrated self - assembly techniques , long confined to laboratories , with its manufacturing lines to create a test version of its latest microprocessors that use vacuum gaps to insulate the miles of nano - scale wire that connect hundreds of millions of transistors .
The breakthrough reduces electrical interference , raises processor performance , and lowers energy consumption .

In nature a phenomenon called " self assembly " is a delicate process that forms seashells , creates the enamel on teeth and transforms water into complex snowflakes .
IBM Research has , for the first time ever , applied " self assembly " to create computer chips that are faster and smaller than ever before .
IBM has figured out how to control and perfect the self assembly process to create trillions of tiny , nano - sized holes across a chip , which speed electrons that flow across wires inside the chip and reducing the power consumed by 15 percent .
These chips will go into our everyday electronics such as cell phones , computers and gaming consoles , an advance that is set to drive the equivalent of two generations of Moore 's Law .
IBM today announced the first - ever application of a breakthrough self - assembling nanotechnology to conventional chip manufacturing , borrowing a process from nature to build the next generation computer chips .
The natural pattern - creating process that forms seashells , snowflakes , and enamel on teeth has been harnessed by IBM to form trillions of holes to create insulating vacuums around the miles of nano - scale wires packed next to each other inside each computer chip .
In chips running in IBM labs using the technique , the researchers have proven that the electrical signals on the chips can flow 35 percent faster , or the chips can consume 15 percent less energy compared to the most advanced chips using conventional techniques .
The IBM patented self - assembly process moves a nanotechnology manufacturing method that had shown promise in laboratories into a commercial manufacturing environment for the first time , providing the equivalent of two generations of Moore 's Law wiring performance improvementsin a single step , using conventional manufacturing techniques .
This new form of insulation , commonly referred to as “ airgaps ” by scientists , is a misnomer , as the gaps are actually a vacuum , absent of air .
The technique deployed by IBM causes a vacuum to form between the copper wires on a computer chip , allowing electrical signals to flow faster , while consuming less electrical power .
The self - assembly process enables the nano - scale patterning required to form the gaps ; this patterning is considerably smaller than current lithographic techniques can achieve .
A vacuum is believed to be the ultimate insulator for what is known as wiring capacitance , which occurs when two conductors , in this case adjacent wires on a chip , sap or siphon electrical energy from one another , generating undesirable heat and slowing the speed at which data can move through a chip .
Until now , chip designers often were forced to fight capacitance issues by pushing ever more power through chips creating , in the process , a range of other problems .
They have also used insulators with better insulating capability , but these insulators have become tenuously fragile as chip features get smaller and smaller , and their insulating properties do not compare to those of a vacuum .
The self - assembly process already has been integrated with IBM 's state - of - the - art manufacturing line in East Fishkill , New York and is expected to be fully incorporated in IBM ’s manufacturing lines and used in chips in 2009 .
The chips will be used in IBM 's server product lines and thereafter for chips IBM builds for other companies .
" This is the first time anyone has proven the ability to synthesize mass quantities of these self - assembled polymers and integrate them into an existing manufacturing process with great yield results , " said Dan Edelstein , IBM Fellow and chief scientist of the self - assembly airgap project .
" By moving self assembly from the lab to the fab , we are able to make chips that are smaller , faster and consume less power than existing materials and design architectures allow . "
Edelstein led the IBM team that invented the technique to use copper wiring in computer chips instead of aluminum , now a standard method for producing chips , ushering in a decade of chip innovations from the IBM labs that transformed how chips were built and used across many industries and applications .
The Secret of Self Assembly
The secret of IBM 's breakthrough lies in how the IBM scientists ’ moved the self - assembly process from the laboratory to a production manufacturing environment in a way that can potentially yield millions of chips with consistent , high performance results .
Today , chips are manufactured with copper wiring surrounded by an insulator , which involves using a mask to create circuit patterns by beaming light through the mask and later chemically removing the parts that are not needed .
The new technique to make airgaps by self - assembly skips the masking and light - etching process .
Instead IBM scientists discovered the right mix of compounds , which they pour onto a silicon wafer with the wired chip patterns , then bake it .
This patented process provides the right environment for the compounds to assemble in a directed manner , creating trillions of uniform , nano - scale holes across an entire 300 millimeter wafer .
These holes are just 20 nanometers in diameter , up to five times smaller than would be possible using today ’s most advanced lithography technique .
Once the holes are formed , the carbon silicate glass is removed , creating a vacuum between the wires -- known as the airgap -- allowing the electrical signals to either flow 35 percent faster , or to consume 15 percent less energy .
Self assembly is a concept scientists have been studying at IBM and in labs around the world as a potential technique to create materials useful for building computer chips .
The concept occurs in nature every day , it is how enamel is formed on our teeth , the process that creates seashells and is what transforms water into complex snowflakes .
The major difference is , while the processes that occur in nature are all unique , IBM has been able to direct the self - assembly process to form trillions of holes that are all similar .
This new technology can be incorporated into any standard CMOS manufacturing line , without disruption or new tooling .
The self assembly process was jointly invented between IBM ’s Almaden Research Center in San Jose , California and the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown , New York .

MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG of New York insisted yet again last week that he did not intend to run for president in 2008 , even as he left the Republican Party to become an independent .
Then , on Friday , he tweaked his language somewhat , simply saying , “ I ’m not going to be president . ”
Which opens the door to a Swiftian modest proposal , one that might appeal to any billionaire independent presidential candidate who knows the art of a deal : Rather than try to win the White House outright — a long shot — an independent candidate could instead try for a king - making ( or queen - making ) bloc of votes in the Electoral College .
In doing so , a moneyed candidate like Mr. Bloomberg could advance his post - partisan national agenda — and gain a great deal of power — by introducing coalition politics to America ’s system of government , through a power - sharing plan that catapults either the Republican or Democratic nominee to the presidency .
Here ’s how it might work :
With the nation divided into red and blue as it has been in the last two presidential elections , all a rich , self - financed candidate would have to do is win a big state ( or two ) to ensure having a king - making bloc of electoral votes : say , Florida ( the decisive state in 2000 ) , or Ohio ( 2004 ) , or maybe New York ( Mr. Bloomberg ’s home state ) , or California ( that of his friend , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ) .
Mr. Bloomberg spent $ 84 million in 2005 to win re-election as mayor .
In 2008 , a wealthy candidate could spend five times that ( or 10 times , as some Bloomberg associates suggest he might do ) to run for president .
Under this hypothetical scenario , the money would support a targeted advertising campaign to sell an Electoral College strategy to voters .
( You would n’t even need to get on the ballot throughout the country . )

Here ’s a weird study that sometimes gets a mention in ethical discussions about psychology , and it ’s not hard to see why .
Middlemist , Knowles & Matter ( 1976 ) designed an experiment to test how the speed and flow of men ’s urination in a public lavatory was affected by invasions of personal space .
Piss pilot
To gather some preliminary data on men ’s toilet habits , a pilot study stationed an observer in a public toilet at a US university .
He was instructed to look like he was grooming himself in the mirror , but was actually keeping a record of which urinals men stood at and their patterns of urination .
Timing them on his wristwatch , our intrepid toilet researcher measured the onset delay in micturation along with persistence of flow .
If you ’re wondering how our correspondent measured these , it was by sound – which must have been no mean feat when there was multiple micturation in progress .
Sure enough the pilot study revealed men prefer not to stand next to each other in the urinals , and the closer other men are to each other , the longer it takes for them to begin urinating , and the shorter the persistence of their stream .
And now for the periscope …
Middlemist et al. were not satisfied with this observational data , however , and decided to carry out a proper experiment .
For this they required a more complicated setup , and a little covert action .
They forced unknowing urinators to spend their pennies in one ( out of three ) urinals that was closest to a single stall .
A confederate ( who was in on the experiment ) then either stood directly next to the various experimental subjects , one urinal away , or was not present at all .
Hidden in the stall was our urine measurement officer ( grad students get all the best jobs ) .
Chief amongst his weapons was a specially designed periscope hidden in a stack of books so that the stream of urine could be directly observed .
The experimental version of the pilot study confirmed earlier findings .
With no one present , unselfconscious urinators ’ average onset was 4.8 seconds , with a confederate present one urinal away , mildly self - conscious urinators ’ average micturation onset was pushed up to 6.2 seconds .
Finally with the confederate in the next urinal , it was 8.4 seconds before our bashful toilet - goer ’s blessed relief began .
Urination and personality ?
Rather than being left with the feeling , as you may be , that this was not only distasteful but also a bit of a waste of time , the psychologist in me comes out .
I ’m wondering about personality correlates and personal space .
For example , is neuroticism positively correlated with increasing micturation onset , while extroversion is negatively correlated ?
The problem is then you ’ve got to get urinators to fill in a personality measure on the way out , which will expose all the periscope business , which in turn may lead on to a variety of uncomfortable conversations .
Perhaps we ’ll just leave this one as it is .

Boeing Garners More 747-800 Orders September 12 , 2006
Posted by Andrew in Boeing
The freight carrier Atlas Air announced today that it had signed a deal with Boeing to purchase twelve Boeing 747-800 freighter aircraft .
Analysts valued the deal at $ 3.4 billion in list prices ; but the carrier likely negiotated discounts with the aerospace giant as Air Atlas is one of the first airlines to place an order for the 747-800 .
Air Atlas expects to receive delivery of its first aircraft by 2010 , with the final aircraft in this order delivered by the end of 2011 .
Air Atlas CEO William Flynn praised the plane , which is still under development , saying that “ with its increased capacity , greater range at equivalent payloads , and lower operating costs , the 747- 8 F gives our customers a cutting - edge aircraft to meet this growth in global air cargo demand .
We are very pleased at our customers ’ enthusiasm for this next - generation freighter , and we look forward to putting it into service for them . ”
The selection of the newest generation of 747 aircraft was a a natural choice for the carrier , as Air Atlas currently operates the world ’s largest fleet of freight 747 aircraft .
The Boeing 747-800 aircraft , which comes in two iterations – passenger and freighter , owes its increased efficency primarily to “ General Electric ’s new GEnx engines , which deliver greater fuel efficiency , engine durability , weight reduction and lower overall operating costs than today ’s engines . ”
With this order , Boeing has sold thirty 747-800 aircraft .
All of the purchased aircraft have been the freighter variant , leaving Boeing to ponder , will the 747-800 passenger version become as popular as its predecessors ?

Zimbardo ’s famous ‘ Stanford Prison Experiment ‘ is often cited as an example of where circumstances influence average people to take up abusive roles .
In a recent article in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , psychologists Thomas Carnahan and Sam McFarland tested the idea that the people who volunteer for this sort of study were truly ‘ average ’ and found that they had character traits that could encourage abuse .
To recruit participants , the researchers used the newspaper advert from the original Stanford Prison Experiment , as well as another advert that was identical , except for the mention of ‘ prison life ’ .
They found that volunteers who responded to the advert that mentioned ‘ prison life ’ scored significantly higher on measures of the abuse - related dispositions of aggressiveness , authoritarianism , Machiavellianism , narcissism , and social dominance and lower on empathy and altruism .
This suggests that circumstances may not be the only factor in influencing the sort of behaviour seen in the original study , as some people may have particular attitudes that could make abuse more likely when the circumstances allow for it .
There is further commentary and analysis of the research over at the ever - excellent CrimePsychBlog .

Litigation is always a risky endeavor .
One can never be entirely sure how a judge will interpret case law and rule , and should the case proceed to trial , juries are even harder to read .
Filing over a thousand lawsuits , therefore , is even riskier .
Should a handful of rulings go the wrong way , it could jeopardize the numerous other cases currently in the system .
This is a dilemma faced by the RIAA in its war against suspected file sharers .
The hundreds of cases filed have all proceeded along the same lines , with which most of us are all too familiar .
The music industry 's exit strategy from cases it deems undesirable to pursue — due to mistaken identity , poor likelihood of winning , or other factors — has been just as consistent .
The record labels file for a dismissal without prejudice and everybody goes their own ways , footing their own legal bills , and no one is officially cleared of wrong - doing .
Recent events may be casting a shadow over the wisdom of the RIAA 's strategy .
A new tactic
One such event is yesterday 's news from the world of file - sharing litigation .
Faced with the prospect of having to pay attorneys ' fees in cases it has no interest in pursuing , the RIAA appears to be trying a new tactic .
In the case of Warner Bros. v. Tallie Stubbs , the record labels have said that they " now covenant not to pursue claims against Defendant " for copyright infringement and that the defendant 's counterclaim should be dismissed .
Tallie Stubbs was sued by the RIAA last year after the trade group 's investigators traced a Kazaa shared folder back to her with the help of an ISP .
After what it described as " further investigation , " the record labels apparently concluded that they had either misidentified her or did n't have sufficient evidence to proceed with the case , and decided to move for dismissal without prejudice .
When contacted by Ars and asked the reasons behind the dismissal , the RIAA declined to comment .
But Stubbs wanted something more than a mere dismissal : complete exoneration .
She filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that she had not infringed on the record labels ' copyrights .
Earlier this month , Judge Vicki Miles - LaGrange split the difference .
She granted the plaintiffs ' motion to dismiss without prejudice while denying their motion to dismiss the counterclaim , ruling that " there are independent bases for subject matter jurisdiction over Defendant 's declaratory judgment counterclaim . "
In other words , the defendant can seek to have her name cleared of any wrongdoing , regardless of the plaintiff 's decision to dismiss .
By promising not to sue Stubbs again and keeping the dismissal without prejudice on the books , RIAA hopes to avoid the same fate it met in Capitol v. Foster ( Debbie Foster is being represented by the same attorney as Tallie Stubbs ) and faces in Elektra v. Santangelo : a ruling that the defendant is the prevailing party and therefore entitled to attorneys ' fees .
In Warner v. Stubbs , the labels are arguing that since they are promising never to sue her for infringement again , there is no need to continue the legal wrangling and the judge should therefore dismiss Stubbs ' counterclaim .
In other words , no harm , no foul .
Risky business
In choosing this course of action , the RIAA is taking a calculated risk .
Dismissing a case without prejudice while promising not to bring further legal action could be interpreted as the functional equivalent of a dismissal with prejudice .
As a result , the judge may very well decide to dismiss the case with prejudice after all .
She could also then dismiss Stubbs ' counterclaim , as a dismissal with prejudice would mean that she is the prevailing party and leave the labels vulnerable to an attorneys ' fees award .
Last week , we noted that the RIAA found itself in a difficult situation with Elektra v. Santangelo because the judge had ruled that Patti Santangelo was entitled to a shot at vindication , either via trial or a dismissal with prejudice .
If Judge Miles - LaGrange issues a ruling exonerating Tallie Stubbs of infringement , it would be a worrisome trend for the RIAA .
The music industry has become accustomed to having its way with those it accuses of file - sharing , quietly dropping cases it believes it can't win .
It looks as though the courts may be ready to stop the record labels from just walking away from litigation when it does n't like the direction it is taking and give defendants justice by fully exonerating them of any wrongdoing .
GATHERING reliable data on sex is notoriously tricky .
Two years ago Durex , a company that makes contraceptives , surveyed more than 300,000 people in 41 countries , asking them about their sexual habits .
The intriguing results suggest that Turks are the least faithful to their partners while Israelis are the least likely to stray .
On average , around the world , one - in - five people has affairs , with Americans ( deterred by the film Fatal Attraction ? ) and Britons slightly less likely to cheat and the French and the Nordics more likely to do so .
Of course , the survey may just as well be a measure of varying levels of honesty in the different countries .

Simon Willison linked to an article which argues :
Warnings cause us to lose our work , to mistrust our computers , and to blame ourselves .
A simple but foolproof design methodology solves the problem :
Never use a warning when you mean undo .
And when a user is deleting their work , you always mean undo .
The post spawned a discussion on undo techniques for Django .
I decided to implement one method and post the results here .
It only offers undo for deleting , and not for editing .
Other than that , I like it .
How it works
It ’s a pretty simple concept : add a trashed_at field to your model , with the default value of None .
When delete ( ) is called on an object , if trashed_at is None , set it to the current time but do n’t delete it .
If it ’s not None , actually delete it from the database .
Model
Here ’s what I did :
from datetime import datetime from django.db import models class SomeModel ( models .
Model ) : # ... other fields ... trashed_at = models .
DateTimeField ( blank = True , null = True ) objects = NonTrashManager ( ) trash = TrashManager ( ) def __str__ ( self ) : trashed = ( self .
trashed_at and ' trashed ' or ' not trashed ' ) return ' %d ( %s ) ' % ( self .
id , trashed ) def delete ( self , trash = True ) : if not self .
trashed_at and trash : self .
trashed_at = datetime . now ( ) self . save ( ) else : super ( SomeModel , self ) . delete ( ) def restore ( self , commit = True ) : self .
trashed_at =
None if commit : self . save ()
The custom managers are used to make it so SomeModel.objects and SomeModel.trash only query against the appropriate rows :
class NonTrashManager ( models .
Manager ) : '''
Query only objects which have not been trashed .
''' def get_query_set ( self ) : query_set = super ( NonTrashManager , self ) . get_query_set ( ) return query_set .
filter ( trashed_at__isnull = True ) class TrashManager ( models .
Manager ) : '''
Query only objects which have been trashed .
''' def get_query_set ( self ) : query_set = super ( TrashManager , self ) . get_query_set ( ) return query_set .
filter ( trashed_at__isnull = False )
Usage
Here are some examples :
# use the managers to see what 's what >>>

Here ’s a zip of the source code for my test .
It ai n’t perfect .
To keep it simple , I did n’t use AJAX for the deleting and undoing , but it would n’t be hard to add it yourself .
Pedophilia
Let me begin with a quote from a fatwa by the late and unlamented Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran .
" A man can marry a girl younger than nine years of age , even if the girl is still a baby being breastfed .
A man , however is prohibited from having intercourse with a girl younger than nine , other sexual acts such as foreplay , rubbing , kissing and sodomy is allowed .
A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime , but only an infraction , if the girl is not permanently damaged .
If the girl , however , is permanently damaged , the man must provide for her all her life .
But this girl will not count as one of the man 's four permanent wives .
He also is not permitted to marry the girl 's sister . "
You need not fear that your Muslim male baby - sitter will rape your 7 - year - old daughter .
If he is a good Muslim he will only sodomize her .
If he does force his penis into her tiny vagina he is obligated to pay for any surgical repairs that may be required .
If those repairs are deemed insufficient you may work out a financial settlement to compensate you for his trivial infraction .
No big deal .
Muslim boys will be Muslim boys .
And , after all , she is only a girl .
Other forms of sexual abuse inflicted on children by Muslim male family members include fondling of genitals , coercing a child to fondle the abuser 's genitals , masturbation with the child as either participant or observer , oral sex , anal or vaginal penetration by penis , finger or any other object .
Another technique used by Muslim men is called " thighing " .
The child 's legs are pressed together and the abuser inserts his penis between the thighs of the little boy or girl .
As this was how Mohammed had sex with his wife , Aisha , from the time she was six years old the practice , of course , was approved of by Ayatollah Khomeini who in his Little Green Book asserted “ It is not illegal for an adult male to ' thigh ' or enjoy a young girl who is still in the age of weaning ; meaning to place his penis between her thighs , and to kiss her . ”
Yes , indeed , you can be a good Muslim while copulating with the thighs of an infant .
An Arab woman vigorously denounces this vile practice in the following video clip from Bahrain TV .
Her denunciation of the " thighing " of infants and young girls comes towards the end of the interview .
This practice flourishes in Muslim countries where women are ruthlessly oppressed and normal sexual development systematically suppressed .
That would include the Arab world , Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Deny men wholesome and natural sexual outlets and they will find unwholesome and unnatural alternatives .
The Grand Ayatollah 's full ruling on marriage can be found here .
The institution of " temporary marriage " appears to be designed to facilitate prostitution .
A USA Today article tells the story .
Homosexuality
Islam has the effect of denying Muslim boys and girls the opportunity to develop their sexuality in a normal , wholesome fashion .
The public mixing of sexes is prohibited by Islam although it may be tolerated by the secular governments of most Muslim nations .
Denied the opportunity to have normal heterosexual experiences during adolescence and frequently the victims of sexual abuse by male relatives while they were growing up it is no wonder that Muslims are much more likely than infidels to find romance and sexual gratification in homosexual relationships .
The following excerpt from a piece published in a gay and lesbian publication gives one a notion of Muslim sexuality in Saudi Arabia .
" Ibrahim bin Abdullah bin Ghaith , the head of the religious police ( the Committee for the Prevention of Vice and the Promotion of Virtue ) acknowledged , in unusually tempered language , that there are gay Saudis , while also speaking of the need " to educate the young " about this " vice " .
But he denied media reports that gay and lesbian relationships were the norm in the strictly segregated schools and colleges , that homosexuality " is spreading " .
In an unprecedented two - page special investigation , the daily newspaper Okaz said lesbianism was " endemic " among schoolgirls .
It justified the article with a saying of the Prophet 's wife Ayeshathat " there should be no shyness in religion " .
The article told of lesbian sex in school lavatories , girls stigmatised after refusing the advances of their fellow students , and teachers complaining that none of the girls were willing to change their behaviour .
Mr Ghaith dismissed a suggestion that he should send his " enforcers " to investigate .
Armed with sticks , they routinely hunt down men and women in public they suspect may not be directly related .
" This perversion is found in all countries , " he told Okaz .
" The number [ of homosexuals ] here is small ... "
That assessment is contradicted by teachers and students who say that , in the absence of other outlets , a " gay " subculture has inevitably flourished among youth .
" A particularly beautiful boy always gets top marks in the exams because he 's some teacher 's favourite , " said Mohammed , an English teacher in a government high school in Riyadh .
" On the other hand , I know many older boys who deliberately flunked their final exams so they can stay ... with their younger sweethearts . "
Ahmed , 19 , a student at a private college in Jeddah , said there was no shame in having a boyfriend in his private high school .
Although he firmly rejected the label " gay " , he admitted that he now has a " special friend " in college , too .
" It 's those who do n't have a boy who are ashamed to admit it .
We introduce our boy to our friends as 'al walid hagi ' [ the boy who belongs to me ] .
At the beginning of term , we always check out the new boys to see which are the most ' helu ' [ sweet ] and think of ways to get to know them . "
Gay marriage is not the contemporary invention of decadent Western civilization .
The Egyptian city of Siwa has for centuries legitimized and celebrated marriages between Muslim men .
No other community has done more to suppress heterosexual behavior thereby making homosexuality the norm .
A gay cruising guide to Siwa provides both historical background and tips on finding gay sex partners in that city -- truly a no - brainer .
Gay marriage is also practiced in Afghanistan .
News reports documenting that fact and others about rampant Afghan homosexuality can be found here .
Paradoxical though it may be , Islam calls for the severe punishment of homosexuality while at the same time working diligently to make that forbidden practice more attractive .
An excellent analysis can be found here .
If you have a particular interest in the Islamic persecution of homosexuals al - bab.com is a good place to pursue it further .
As this form of barbarity is inflicted on Muslims by Muslims and is relatively rare I will not dwell on the matter much further .
The overwhelming majority of homosexuals who have been murdered by Muslims died because they were infidels .
Count the millions murdered and multiply by whatever percentage incidence of homosexuality you fancy .
You will get a very , very large number in return .
Bestiality
Is there a proper Muslim way to have sex with animals ?
Indeed , there is !
Guidelines for sex with animals can be found in the writings of Ayatollah Khomeini .
Two excerpts from his writings serve to clarify the matter .
" A man can have sex with sheep , cows and camels and so on .
However , he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm .
He should not sell the meat to the people in his own village ; however , selling the meat to the next door village should be fine . "
Do n't the buyers deserve a discount of some kind ?
Khomeini's " Tahrirolvasyleh " fourth volume , Darol Elm , Gom , Iran , 1990
" If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow , a ewe , or a camel , their urine and their excrement become impure , and even their milk may no longer be consumed .
The animal must then be killed and as quickly as possible and burned . "
What if it was really good and invites another lap or two ?
Must animals always be one - night stands ?

Ever since Apple ’s release of iTunes 4.9 with built - in support for podcasting , hundreds of thousands of people have discovered the wide range of free audio programs now available as podcasts .
While most will be content only to listen to podcasts , some – perhaps including you – may be ready to create their own radio - style programs .
After all , distribution through iTunes is now easy , and subscriptions are the only thing separating listeners from your thoughts and ideas .
Creating podcasts is n’t simple , but it ’s not too hard , either .
You ’ll need a small combination of hardware and software in order to create your own recordings , and in this iPod 101 tutorial Beginner ’s Guide to Podcast Creation , we ’ll walk through the different elements you need to create a simple podcast , from computer and microphone through to the finished product .
First Things First : The Plan
Amazingly enough , this first step is the one many podcasters skip : develop a plan .
Before you start recording , think about what you want to say , and organize your show accordingly .
Make notes , prepare your interviews ( if any ) , and try to improvise as little as possible .
While a completely spontaneous show can sound good if you ’ve got the knack , the best podcasters prepare their shows in advance and work hard to provide interesting content .
( See Seven Rules of Effective Podcasting ( offsite link ) for some tips on creating good podcasts that people will come back to listen to . )
There are thousands of podcasts available today , but it ’s easy to pass most of them up because they do n’t stand out – figure out your angle , and run with it !
Next Up : The Gear
You wo n’t need much hardware to record a podcast : typically , you ’ll start with a Mac or PC computer with a recent version of either Windows or Mac OS X ; Windows XP or Mac OS X 10.3 or later are recommended .
( You can also use Linux , but we ’ll only look at Mac and Windows software in this article . )
The only other hardware you ’ll need is a microphone .
The microphone is the most important element in the recording chain , other than your voice – the way listeners hear your voice is greatly affected by the quality of your mic .
Do n’t use an internal microphone in a computer , such as you ’ll find on laptops and some desktop computers .
These mics will pick up ambient sounds , such as the noise of the computer , as well as anything you move on your desk while recording .
Do n’t use a cheap mic that may have come with your computer either .
These mics are generally very low - quality and are designed for voice chats , not recording .
You do n’t need to spend a lot for a mic , however ; many podcasters use USB headsets that are designed for both voice chats and recording .
Logitech has an excellent line of USB headsets that range up to $ 50 in price , each with noise - cancelling microphones , which help filter out the ambient noise in your room or outside the windows .
If you prefer not to use a USB headset , you ’ll just need a microphone and a way to make sure your PC or Mac can record from it .
Most PCs have sound cards that are capable of recording audio through a microphone - in port ( often colored pink ) , but some PCs and many Macs do n’t have such a port .
Griffin Technology ’s $ 40 iMic solves this problem with a small silver disc that connects to your USB port and adds recording functionality .
An inexpensive microphone add - on from Griffin called the Lapel Mic ( $ 15 ) can then be used as a collar - mounted stereo microphone .
If you want to sound more professional , you ’ll want to look for a condenser microphone , which will require an external power source ( you do n’t simply plug it into your computer ) and result in more realistic sound .
Behringer ’s Studio Condenser Microphone C - 1 , at about $ 55 , is a good starting point .
You can spend hundreds of dollars for a professional mic , but only real pros need to go into that price range .
We used a simple , inexpensive solution to create our own first two podcasts : Griffin ’s iTalk ( $ 39.99 , iLounge rating : A- ) .
Because we wanted to create the first podcast actually made with an iPod , iTalk was the best microphone option we could find .
Belkin and DLO also make a few alternative products , which we review here for those interested in duplicating our efforts .
Recording Software
Recording your own voice is relatively simple , and there are a variety of PC and Mac programs that can do this .
One of the most popular programs among podcasters is Audacity , which can record , edit and post - process your audio .
It has several advantages : it is multi-platform ( Windows 98 and later , Mac OS 9 and X , and Linux ) , and it ’s free .
This open - source program has become the standard tool for podcasters who want to record their shows , edit their recordings , and combine other recordings ( such as intros , jingles or music , sometimes made with other programs ) to create finished shows .
Everything you record with Audacity appears on screen as sound waves that you can edit very much like a word processing program : as with a page full of words , you can zoom in and out to see more or less of the audio wave on screen at once , select portions with a cursor , and delete or format those portions as you desire .
Many podcasters delete their “ ums ” and “ you knows ” wherever they appear , and you can also use the cursor to snip out boring or screwed - up parts of your recording .
Audacity also has tools that reduce background noise and static , create echo effects , and increase or decrease the amplitude of your voice .
After each recording , save your file in WAV ( uncompressed ) format – it ’ll take up a bit of space on your hard drive , but it ’s the best format to guarantee you do n’t compromise on sound quality until you ’re ready .
Audacity has one major limitation for podcasters : while you can use Audacity to record yourself , you cannot use it to easily record interviews with people who are n’t in the same room ; Audacity only records directly from an input source such as a microphone .
Many podcasters use the free teleconferencing program
Skype to conduct their interviews of other people , and recording the interviews requires an additional piece of software .
Podcasters use the Windows program Virtual Audio Cable or the Mac program Audio Hijack Pro. Either of these programs traps
Skype ’s audio and saves it so that you can edit it in Audacity .
After you ’ve completed editing of your recordings and interviews , you can export your finished podcast in several formats , including MP3 , AIFF and WAV .
If you want to export your podcast as an MP3 file , you ’ll need to download the LAME MP3 encoder as a helper for Audacity .
But if you use AIFF or WAV , iTunes can handle the MP3 compression for you ; this latter option is probably best , because you ’ll have more flexibility in how you compress the file .
We use iTunes for compression , as discussed below .
Converting Your Podcast
Once you have everything recorded , it ’s time to get your podcast into a form that ’s easy to share .
A one - hour WAV file will take up about 600 MB ; listeners wo n’t download such large files , so you ’ll need to compress it into either MP3 or AAC format .
As you already know , iTunes has the ability to turn your CDs into MP3s – now you ’ll use the same feature to convert your podcast .
The first step is add your WAV file to your iTunes library .
Drag it from your desktop to the library window , or drag it to a playlist .
( One good way to work on files like this is to create a temporary “ Temp ” playlist , into which you drag files you do n’t plan to keep . )
Before converting your podcast , you should tag ( identify details for ) the file .
You can enter a name , artist , album , and comments .
Use these tags , because once listeners get a hold of your podcast , this is the only way they ’ll have to identify it .
Start by giving your podcast a name that is not too long ; enter your name as artist ( or your website ’s URL ) , and , in the Comments field , add anything that you ’d like listeners to be able to know .
Also , use any of the other fields you want , such as Year , Genre , etc. , to provide enough info about your podcast .
If you have a logo or photo , you can add it as “ album art ” in the Artwork tab .
Then it ’s time to choose your compression settings .
Open the iTunes preferences ( iTunes > Preferences on Mac OS X ; Edit > Preferences on Windows ) , then click the Importing tab .
The Import Using menu lets you select the format you convert your file to .
You ’ll want to choose either AAC or MP3 .
AAC will only play through iTunes and on iPods ; while some other software may support AAC , few other portable music players do , so your best choice is MP3 .
( If you do choose AAC , you can select Podcast from the settings menu to use a preset podcast bit rate setting . )
Select MP3 from the Import Using menu , then select Custom from the Setting menu .
Choose a bit rate of 64 kbps ; you could go lower or higher , but voice sounds good at that bit rate , and your files wo n’t be too large .
From the Sample Rate menu , select 22.050 kHz ; this is high enough for voice .
From the Channels menu , select Mono , unless your podcast is mostly music ; voice does not need stereo , and this keeps your files small .
Click OK .
Now , find your raw podcast file in your library or playlist , select it , then select Advanced > Convert Selection to [ format ] , where format is AAC or MP3 .
iTunes will compress your file using your settings , and the resulting file will appear in your library .
If you ’ve tagged your file before converting it , you ’ll find it in the genre you set , or by its title .
You can now right - click ( Windows ) or Control - click ( Mac ) the file , select Show Song File , and a window will open showing the converted file .
Publishing your Podcast
If you ’ve gotten to this stage , you might already know you have to set up a podcast “ feed ” URL on your website .
( If not , this article tells you all about podcasts and RSS feeds .
The basic idea is that you need to have a place where your podcast is stored for people to download it , and then create a web link that other people can use to find the file . )
Once you have the feed URL , load iTunes , go to the iTunes Music Store , click the Podcasts link in the left - hand column , and look for the Publish a Podcast link on the left of the Podcasts page .
Click that link , enter the URL for your podcast , then click Continue .
But at this point , there ’s a snag .
You ’ll have to sign in to your iTunes Music Store account .
While you can browse , subscribe to and download podcasts without an iTunes Music Store account , you cannot submit any unless you have an account in the store you want to add them to .
So , for example , someone in Australia who wants to add a podcast to the US iTunes Music Store will not be able to do so unless they have a US credit card and billing address .
If you do have an iTunes Music Store account , the rest is simple : iTunes automatically picks up any comments and descriptions you ’ve added to your RSS feed ; you cannot edit them once the podcast is added to iTunes .
To find out about the tags you can use , click the “ Learn more about podcasting on iTunes ” link when you are on the Publish podcasts to the Music Store page .
This will take you to a page with a FAQ , and a downloadable PDF file containing full specifications .
Apple also has a tutorial about creating podcasts using GarageBand , which is part of iLife ‘ 05 .
While GarageBand has some limits for creating podcasts – recordings are limited in time , for example – it is a good way for beginners to work with mixing and editing shows .

A 1997 readers ' poll conducted by Britain 's Channel 4 and the Waterstone 's bookstore chain voted J.R.R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings the " greatest book of the century . "
A 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers went even further , choosing it as the " greatest book of the millenium . "
And now , Peter Jackson 's dramatization of The Fellowship of the Ring confirms itself a widely announced blockbuster .
Some consider
The Lord of Rings a childish fable , but millions of people all over the world have found it an enjoyable and inspiring read .
Hardcore environmentalists have tried to enlist Mr. Tolkien among them , focusing on Tolkien 's candid love for nature , for example .
But if loving nature necessarily implies you are an environmentalist , people like Ludwig von Mises should also have been very sympathetic toward the Green movement .
Indeed , as Justin Raimondo points out , his point was n't to bash industry or capitalism ; it was to illustrate that evil is expansionist and projects itself even on the landscape .
Hence bad environmental aesthetics are a reflection of bad rulers , which is to say , the use of power .
And here we have the correct understanding of the theme of the novel : it is about the evils of power .
More precisely , the book aligns itself against power - - not " economic power " or " social power " , but specifically political power .
This is also the central theme of the classical liberal political tradition .
This has been explained in various occasions by Tolkien himself :
" You can make the Ring into an allegory of our own time , if you like : and allegory of the inevitable fate that waits for all attempts to defeat evil power by power " ( The Letters of J.R.R . Tolkien , 1995 , p. 121 . )
" Power is an ominous and sinister word in all these tales " ( p. 152 . )
" The story is cast in terms of a good side , and a bad side , beauty against ruthless ugliness , tyranny against kingship , moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power , and so on " ( pp. 178-179 . )
" In my story Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible .
He had gone the way of all tyrants : beginning well , at least on the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the ( economic ) well - being of other inhabitants of Earth .
But he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination , being in origin an immortal ( angelic ) spirit " ( p. 243 . )
" Of course my story is not an allegory of Atomic power , but of Power ( exerted for domination ) " ( p. 246 . )
So , we can say The Lord of the Rings fictionalize Edmund Burke 's motto : " In vain you tell me that Artificial Government is good , but that I fall out only with the Abuse .
The Thing , the Thing itself is the Abuse ! "
That 's what Tolkien is trying to convey and dramatize in a novel over 600,000 words long .
The Lord of the Rings is the epic journey to destroy the One Ring , which symbolizes power - and this is very clear when you understand that the Ring not only confers power but also imposes serfdom on the wearer .
The man who wears the Ring becomes a slave at the same time as he is made supremely powerful .
This is an allegory for what actually happens in our world every day : rulers , even well intentioned and idealistic ones , are ruled themselves at the same time .
They are ruled by consensus and by the spasmodic hunger to acquire yet more power than they already have .
This is why the state has never been limited , as the classical liberal thinkers had hoped it would be - because the people in charge of keeping the power of the state limited never do so .
Politicians and rulers generally , always want to become more important and more respected - more powerful , in short .
It does not matter what stirring words a politician uses to legitimize his actions ; he is inside a vicious circle he can't escape .
As Edmund Burke put it many years ago , " Ask of politicians the ends for which laws were originally designed , and they will answer that laws were designed as a protection for the poor and weak ( ...) but surely no pretence can be so ridiculous (... ) . "
( Edmund Burke , A Vindication of Natural Society , 1756 ) .
Tolkien was fond of that idea .
Indeed , he went one step further , saying , " My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ( philosophically understood , meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs ) - or to ' unconstitutional ' Monarchy .
I would arrest anybody who uses the word state ( in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants , a thing that has neither power , rights nor mind ) ; and after a chance of recantation , execute them if they remained obstinate ! "
( The Letters of J.R.R . Tolkien , 1995 , p. 63 . ; See NYT Review . )
In Tolkien 's vision , the power is always evil - a good power cannot even exist .
Since the very beginning , the good guys own the Ring .
Since it is the most powerful weapon in the world , many of them ask why it can't be used against Sauron , the Dark Lord .
Even though the Ring was forged by him and undoubtedly it is evil , yet it could help to pursue a good end , they suspect .
This is an extraordinary way to ask the question : could the means be subordinated to the ends ?
Can a good end be pursued by evil means ?
Tolkin answers that no , evil means can only bring to an evil end - no matter if the original intentions are good .
When Frodo offers him the Ring , the wise Gandalf cries :
" No !
With that power I should have power too great and terrible .
And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly !
Do not tempt me !
For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself .
Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity , pity for weakness and the desire of strenght to do good .
Do not tempt me !
I dare not take it , not even to keep it safe , unused " ( The Lord of the Rings , 2001 , p. 60 . )
Frodo also offers the Ring to Galadriel , queen of Elves .
She refuses it too .
Hear her words :
" I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer .
For many long years I had pondered what I might do , should the Great Ring come into my hands , and behold !
It was brought within my grasp .
The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways , whether Sauron himself stands or falls .
Would not have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his Ring , if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest ?
And now at last it comes .
You will give me the Ring freely !
In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen .
And I shall not be dark , but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night !
Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain !
Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning !
Stronger than the foundations of the earth .
All shall love me and despair !... I pass the test .
I will diminish , and go into the West , and remain Galadriel " ( pp. 356-357 . )
The reason why both Gandalf and Galadriel fear the power of the Ring is that they recognize that it was made to do bad , and therefore any good action made by it will turn into evil .
In the words of the Lord of Rivendell , Elrond ,
" We can not use the Ruling Ring .
That we now know too well .
It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone , and is altogether evil .
Its strength is too great for anyone to wield at will , save only those who have already a great power of their own .
But for them it holds an even deadlier peril .
The very desire of it corrupts the heart .
If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor , using his own arts , he would then set himself on Sauron 's throne , and yet another Dark Lord would appear .
And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed : as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise .
For nothing is evil in the beginning .
Even Sauron was not so .
I fear to take the Ring to hide it .
I will not take the Ring to wield it . " ( p. 261 . )
We can also affirm that Tolkien somehow had a clear perception regarding those myths that professor Hans - Hermann Hoppe has recently dismantled in his masterpiece Democracy : The God That Failed ( Transaction Publisher , 2001 ) .
Of them , according to Hoppe , " the first and most fundamental is the myth that the emergence of states out of a prior , non-statist order has caused subsequent economic and civilizational progress .
In fact , theory dictates that any progress must have occurred in spite - not because - of the institution of a state . "
Then , we have the myth , writes Hoppe :
[ that ] concerns the historic transition from absolute monarchies to democratic states .
(. ) is near - universal agreement that democracy represents an advance over monarchy and is the cause of economic and moral progress .
This interpretation is curious in light of the fact that democracy has been the fountainhead of every form of socialism : of ( European ) democratic socialism and ( American ) liberalism and neo-conservatism as well as of international ( Soviet ) socialism , ( Italian ) fascism , and national ( Nazi ) socialism .
More importantly , however , theory contradicts this interpretation ; whereas both monarchies and democracies are deficient as states , democracy is worse than monarchy " .
Mr. Tolkien wrote something very similar in a letter addressed to his son , Christopher :
" If we could get back to personal names , it would do a lot of good .
Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and the process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people .
If people were in the habit of referring to ' King George 's council , Winston and his gang ' , it would do a long way to clearing thought , and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy " ( The Letters of J.R.R . Tolkien , 1995 , p. 63 . )
No character in Lord of the Rings is " perfect " or " immaculate " .
Each one is a mixture of good and evil , and time after time he or she is called on to choose between a good and an evil action .
Nevertheless , " Good " and " Evil " do exist , and - even though people may doubt or may not correctly distinguish one from the other - the two sides are clearly separated .
This , of course , is the leading reason why the One Ring can only do bad - it's a constant temptation to one 's evil side .
Even the best man in the world would surrender it sooner or later .
Only from this perspective is it possible to see things with Tolkien 's realistic eyes .
He did recognize that people are good and bad , and some of them may freely choose evil and even find it pleasant .
This is the consequence of the Fall : human beings are not perfect , and therefore every means of dominion is evil in itself .
In fact , " The proper study of Man is anything but Man ; and the most improper job of any man , even saints ( who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on ) , is bossing other men .
Not one in a million is fit to it , and least of all those who seek the opportunity " ( The Letters of J.R.R . Tolkien , 1995 , p. 64 . )
One of the most controversial characters of The Lord of the Rings , Saruman , was a wise wizard before surrendering to the flatteries of absolute power ( which , in the words of Lord Acton , " corrupts absolutely " ) .
Trying to convince Gandalf to join him , he says :
" The Elder days are gone .
The Middle Days are passing .
The Younger Days are beginning .
The time of Elves is over , but our time is at hand : the world of Men , which We must rule .
But we must have power , power to order all things as we will , for that good which only the Wise can see ...
A new Power [ the evil Sauron's , the Ring maker ] is rising .
Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all .
There is no hope left in Elves or dying Nùmenor .
This then is one choice before you , before us .
We may join with the Power .
It would be wise , Gandalf .
There is hope that way .
Its victory is at hand ; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it .
As the Power grows , its proved friends will also grow ; and the Wise , such as you and I , may with patience come at last to direct its courses , to control it .
We can bide our time , we can keep our thoughts in our hearts , deploring maybe evils done by the way , but approving the high and ultimate purpose : Knowledge , Rule , Order , all things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish , hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends .
There need not be , there would not be any real change in our designs , only in our means . "
Gandalf answers , " I would not give it [ the One Ring ] , nay , neither news of it to you , now that I learn your mind .
You were head of the Council , but you have unmasked yourself at last .
Well , the choices are , it seems , to submit to Sauron , or to yourself .
I will take neither " ( The Lord of the Rings , 2001 , pp. 252-253 . )
As Tom Shippey points out ,
" What Saruman says encapsulates many of the things the modern world has learnt to dread most : the ditching of allies , the subordination of means to ends , the ' conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder ' .
But the way he puts it is significant too .
No other character in Middle Earth has Saruman 's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved , and none comes out with words as empty as ' deploring ' , ' ultimate ' , worst of all , ' real ' ...
None of them but Saruman pays any attention to expediency , practicability , Realpolitik , ' political realism ' " ( The Road to Middle Earth , 1992 , pp. 108-110 . )
One might object that the contemporary era implies a sort of " end of history , " because democracy is perceived as the " best form of government , " and provides the illusion that no government governs without the consent of the governed .
Tolkien would have not agreed .
Indeed , as he wrote , " I am not a ' democrat ' only because ' humility ' and equality are spiritual principles corrupted by the attempt to mechanize and formalize them , with the result that we get not universal smallness and humility , but universal greatness and pride , till some Orc gets hold of a ring of power -- and then we get and are getting slavery " ( The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien , 1995 , p. 246 ) .
How many FBI agents does it take to get to the center of a radical terrorist group ’s hideout by disabling the biometric door lock in order to plant bugs in the den ’s clock radio ?
Well , you would need ten plus George Clooney to rip off a casino , so of course the FBI ’s answer to terrorist hideout question is eleven .
And those agents need at least three days , according to FBI budget documents .
Then of course you need to add in the engineers who build the bugs and figure out how to get around alarm systems and biometric entry scanners .
At least that ’s the math the FBI told Congress in its 2008 budget request where the Tactical Operations Support Center asked for an extra $ 5 million , six new agents and a few more engineers .
That request , if granted by Congress , would be a significant jump for a group that had just 18 agents on the payroll in 2006 and 2007 and an annual budget just shy of $ 17 million .
Those agents spend close to 40 % of their work time on the road .
Almost 88 % of the cases that the legal burglars helped out with in 2006 involved intelligence gathering , rather than traditional prosecutions .
While that ’s a significant jump , more than 50 % of the group ’s work has dealt with national security investigations since 1998 .
The execution of covert entry / search operations usually requires the TOSC to physically deploy a team of approximately 11 agent personnel full time over a period of time ( usually at least 3 days ) to the target location .
During FY 2006 , TOSC operational SSAs spent an average of 97 days on travel status , which accounts for approximately 39 % of a 251 - day work year
How many black bag jobs did the FBI pull off in 2006 ?
Unknown .
But the legal cat burglars do say that they helped with 353 investigations in 2006 and figure they will be involved in more than 400 in 2008 .
And the break - ins are only getting harder to pull off , due to better security technology :
The successful execution of the surreptitious entry / search operations is dependent on continued aggressive applied scientific and engineering efforts directed at the emerging technologies in the security and countermeasures industries .
The requested increase in non-personnel funding would enhance TOSC ’s capacity to take a proactive approach to identifying the technologies emerging in the marketplace , as well as conduct the research and development necessary to produce the tools necessary to detect and defeat them . [… ]
TOSC also faces challenges that emanate from the convergence of technology within the security industry .
Traditional lines of separation ( alarms , locks , safes , access controls , biometrics , video , etc. ) within the industry have blurred with manufacturers integrating security functions and features .
There is nothing , however , in the budget request asking for new faux cable guy outfits .

Like them or loathe them reality TV shows are big business .
For the television companies they are a sure - fire way to boost the ratings and pull in the advertisers .
Reality TV series
The Apprentice continues to be a big hit on BBC
But in Italy , the state broadcaster Rai has taken an unprecedented decision to scrap them from next year .
It 's a decision winning popular support .
" Reality television is a dinosaur , " said Italy 's daily newspaper La Repubblica .
" After all the vulgarity , all the swearing , and the smut , its time is finally coming to an end . "
From now on the reality shows in Italy will only be found on the private Mediaset network of the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
But is this a moral crusade - or is it an astute decision based on viewing figures ?
La Repubblica points to poor ratings in recent series of Italy 's two most popular reality TV shows , Grande Fratello ( Big Brother ) on Mediaset and L'Isola dei Famosi ( Celebrity Island ) on Rai. Grande Fratello is said to have lost a million viewers last year .
Claudio Petruccioli , Rai's president , says his decision has been taken in line with Italy 's wider efforts to improve the quality of its programming .
Rai intends to redirect the money spent on reality TV into Italian film
L'Isola dei Famosi and Wild West are just two of the reality shows recently broadcast on Rai Due .
Wild West saw ordinary people train as cowboys in the backlands of Arizona .
Each week the contestants had to prove their cowboy skills by driving a herd of cattle over a mountain pass or winning a cowboy competition to stay in the game .
It ran for 10 weeks , but it was widely perceived to be a flop .
With the money Rai will save from commissioning shows like L'Isola dei Famosi , they will increase yearly spending on Italian - made films by 50 % .
" Reality TV shows put people into environments that are both unrealistic and coercive , " said Mr Petruccioli .
" And what inevitably results is unjustified and degrading behaviour .
I do n't believe they are the type of shows the majority of our viewers expect or want from a public service broadcaster . "
For the moment we believe it's a courageous choice for Rai
Claudio Petruccioli , president of Rai
Grande Fratello and L'Isola dei Famosi have attracted the biggest criticism in Italy in recent years .
Both shows were slapped with a 100,000 Euro fine in December for blasphemous language and swearing .
In last year 's Grande Fratello , the eccentric musician Guido Genovese was ejected from the house after using arguably the worst curse available in the Italian language ( an expression which literally translates as ' pig God ' ) .
The programme - makers apologised , though it did little to silence the howls of protest from religious groups and parents alike .
Many called for the programme to be taken off air immediately .
Rai's lack of interest in reality TV is in stark contrast to the broadcast philosophy of Silvio Berlusconi 's network .
On Mediaset 's three private channels there is a daily diet of reality TV , which remains popular among young Italians .
In recent weeks the company has been linked with negotiations to acquire a controlling interest in Dutch producer Endemol - the creator of the Big Brother franchise - at a time when Mediaset are trying to improve flagging advertising revenues .
The seventh series of Grande Fratello is currently on Mediaset
Two of the network 's most popular shows - Uno , due , tre ... stalla ( one , two , three ... stable ) a show in which farmers try to turn showgirls into cowgirls , and La pupa e il secchione ( The Beauty and the Geek ) have won big ratings in the past year .
Mediaset are planning a new series for both programmes and producer Fabrizio Rondolino , the man credited with the series ' success , says these shows are " just the beginning " .
' Scandalous '
" This is just the experimental stage , " he says .
" Shows like this are scandalous for a reason .
But soon reality TV will be considered a genre like all the others .
" There are some bad dramas , vulgar and stupid , but there are also some good ones .
The same is true of reality television .
You do n't ban all films because some films are pornographic ! "
There are some who argue reality TV still has its place on Rai .
They point to other state broadcasters like the BBC , happy to feature shows like The Apprentice , which continues to grow in popularity .
But Rai believes it can develop an exciting schedule next year without relying on reality TV shows .
" We are looking for better programmes , " said Signor Petruccioli .
" I am not saying that we will never go back to these shows - but for the moment we believe it's a courageous choice for Rai - one that will be supported by the viewing public , and one I fully support as president of the company . "
Compare and contrast the following .
The Society for Psychical Research – “ the first of its kind to examine allegedly paranormal phenomena in a scientific and unbiased way ” - was established in 1882 .
( Remember that date . )
Success was claimed in its first test of “ psi ” when the psychic powers of the Creery sisters and their servant girl were supposedly proven .
Of course , we now know the girls cheated ( they were secretly signaling to each other ) .
However , you ’ll be pleased to know that 124 years later the society is not defeated in its aims :
Today the Society continues with its aim of understanding events and abilities commonly described as ' psychic ' or ' paranormal ' by promoting and supporting important research in this area .
Yes , I guess they think that pretty soon they ’ll have good evidence that psychic powers exist and will be able to make some use of it – surely it ’s only a matter of time , right ?
Right .
That ’s what some people believe , anyway .
Around the same time – in the 1890s - Morse code began to be extensively used for radio communications .
Shortly after , on Christmas Eve 1906 , the world 's first radio voice broadcast was made .
The early ship bound Morse operators did n’t believe it when they first heard a human voice on their equipment , but it really was there and radio would soon be extensively used whether they believed in it or not .
In the early 20th century , J. B. Rhine coined the term " extrasensory perception " ( ESP ) to describe the apparent ability of some people to acquire information without the use of the known senses .
Using Zener cards , he claimed he had proven the existence of ESP , although it was later discovered that Rhine was leaving out negative results from his results on the basis that persons who disliked him guessed wrong to spite him .
To my knowledge , no practical use has ever been made of Rhine ’s work , although I ’m sure some people think that will change pretty soon .
As a young boy I learned the Russians had put a satellite into space .
It was called Sputnik and I remember my friend and I watching it with our naked eyes as it passed over our town at night .
You could listen to it on your radio too .
Soon after , Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space , and my friend and I played at being astronauts .
Not all that long afterwards ( in the grand scheme of “ long ” ) , we all saw pictures of the first Moon landings .
It did n’t matter if you believed it or not , space travel was real , and we could see it beamed back to us in real time .
In the 1950s S.G. Soal experimented on 160 psychically gifted people to see if they could determine through psychic means which one of five Zener cards had been turned over by a “ sender ” in another room .
After some data mining , Soal claimed he had proven the existence of psi , although it was later shown he had cheated .
Funnily enough , Soal ’s work did n’t add any new knowledge or provide any more utility compared with what Rhine had already found ( or more accurately , “ not found ” ) , and for some reason , forced choice Zener cards are not used in psi experiments any more .
Instead , more subjective tests requiring judging ( and therefore allowing more wiggle room ) are used .
Pretty soon , using this less rigorous method , we ’ll have the proof that psi is real and is of use .
Or so some believe .
Meanwhile scientists had invented color TV .
I remember it well – our next door neighbor , who was wealthier than us , got one of the first color TVs and we went to his house to watch a football match .
For the first time you could easily tell which team a player was with because each team ’s shirts were in different colors .
You had no choice about believing it or not – color TV worked and was a vast improvement over black and white .
As a teenager , I read that someone called Nostradamus had managed to predict the future 500 years ago .
Surely this was proof of psychic powers ?
But then I got hold of a book containing the entire Nostradamus Centuries and I realized Nostradamus ’ predictions were useless unless the thing being predicted had already taken place .
To me , that did n’t seem to be much use .
Believers in Nostradamus said I was closed minded , but I had examined the evidence and I just did n’t believe in Nostradamus or see any use in reading his predictions any more .
My ( older ) brother - in - law who worked “ in computers ” took me to his workplace .
He showed me the big stacks of punch cards that he had to feed into the massive computer ( it took up a huge room ) to make it work .
Apparently he ran the overnight batch jobs .
A few years later , someone developed a small computer that can sit on your desk , and even later a way of connecting all these computers in the world in what became known as the Internet .
I ’m writing this piece on a one of these small computers now , and you ’re reading this on one too , over the Internet .
It works whether you believe in it or not .
Someone called Rupert Sheldrake claimed he had proven that people can tell when somebody is staring at them .
When this was investigated by skeptics it was found that the sequences used in Sheldrake 's research were not properly randomized : when random sequences were used people can detect staring at no better than chance .
Believers still dispute this , and Sheldrake is on the verge of coming up with a use for this phenomenon pretty soon .
If you believe Sheldrake , anyway .
I remember when the first mobile phones appeared .
The first person I saw talking on one in the street looked ridiculous with the huge headset and battery back slung over his shoulder .
But now my cell phone is so small I do n’t even notice it is in my pocket .
And I have a tiny headset that fits in my ear and connects wirelessly to the cell phone in my pocket – I do n’t even have to hold the phone to my ear with my hand any more .
And I can dial just by saying the name of the person I ’m calling .
And it works whether I believe it or not .
( Most of the time , anyway . )
From 1975 through 1995 the US government funded investigations into remote viewing to the tune of $ 20 million , in what was known as the Stargate Project .
Despite all the time and money , nothing useful ever came from Stargate and the US government dropped it .
A private remote viewing organization calling itself PsiTech claims it purchased this ( useless ) “ technology ” from the government , and claims to this day to be able to perform remote viewing .
Their recent successes include divining the location of Elizabeth Smart ’s dead body .
Unfortunately for PsiTech but fortunately for Elizabeth ’s family , Elizabeth appeared some months later , quite alive .
This did n’t faze the President of PsiTech who emailed me bleating “ This is still a young technology ” .
Hey , tell that to the Society for Psychical Research , founded in 1882 .
Last year , scientists managed to decode a two - watt signal from a spacecraft on one of Saturn ’s Moons , a billion miles away .
Although the signal was never meant to be transmitted to Earth , it was received anyway and 100 % of the scientific data was extracted successfully .
That happened whether you believe it or not .
Meanwhile , I turn on the TV and I see a clown called John Edward asking a caller on Larry King if they know a J or a G - sounding name .
( Note – Edward asks the caller – would n’t a real psychic tell the caller this information ? )
The same Larry King also features on primetime worldwide TV a moron called James Van Praagh who actually says “ skeptics … use this thing about taking a test and proving it , the emphasis should be on them to prove it to us this is not real ” .
According to him this stuff , which is of no use at all anyway , is real unless we can prove it is n’t .
The next day Sylvia Browne tells listeners on the " Coast to Coast " radio show that the miners trapped in a West Virginia mine would be found alive .
That was just after the news broke they had been found alive but just before the revised news they were actually dead .
And people still believe this old phony .
Oh sure , Gary Schwartz claims to have validated John Edward and Allison DuBois , but Schwartz has n’t published his data and no one has been able to replicate it .
( The fact that he validated John Edward should be enough to tell you his research stinks . )
And even if it were true , no use has come from these bozos other than “ acknowledging ” and “ validating ” passed loved ones , whatever that means .
In 124 years , psi research has progressed to no more than a carnival guessing game act on TV .
But it ’s not just that the evidence for psi has not gotten any better over the last 124 years compared with advances in science , although that is notable .
The real lesson is that even if psi were real , in 124 years we still have n’t found an actual use for it – no psi communications devices , no accurate predictions of the future , no military use , nothing .
Compare that with the real world of science .
We started this post with Morse code , but now I can now access computers anywhere in the world from the color screen of my small cell phone .
And it all works whether you believe in it or not .
Where are the equivalent unambiguously real and useful psi applications ?
Oh I get it : they ’ll be here pretty soon .
My question is – how much longer do we have to wait for some use to be made of psi before we can all agree it does n’t exist ?
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Two German teenagers robbed a girl but accidentally left their own pictures behind for police on a discarded mobile phone .
After stealing a 15 - year - old ’s shoes , money and mobile phone , the two older girls gave her an old mobile phone , police in the western city of Bochum said on Wednesday .
But the two 17 - year - olds had forgotten the phone had their own photos , striking smiley poses , which police published online on Tuesday in an effort to find the culprits .
The two muggers turned themselves in almost simultaneously when the pictures appeared on the evening news .
“ One girl was brought down by her father after he saw her on the television , ” said police spokesman Frank Plewka .
“ Today the pictures were in the papers , so the father ’s phone has been ringing all day , because everyone recognized them . ”
Neither of the two had been in trouble with the law before .
Mohammad Isiktas , only 13 years old , is prepared to take on the Turkish state so he can legally use his Kurdish middle name .
He is still forbidden from having Demhat , which means " the time has come , " on his ID card .
His younger brother will also go to court , to use his Kurdish name , which means " freedom . "
While Turkey 's Kurds have seen some limited reforms , this family 's pending fight is emblematic of the legal limits the ethnic minority still face .
Application of new laws that permit limited use of Kurdish , such as ending the ban on Kurdish names and allowing 45 minutes of Kurdish TV broadcasts a day , are being challenged by zealous state prosecutors fearful that such minority rights will undermine the Turkish republic .
So change has come only fitfully to southeast Turkey , where separatist guerrillas of the Kurdistan Worker 's Party ( PKK ) and Turkish forces fought a vicious war throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" I want peace between Turkey and Kurds , between police and the PKK , " says Mohammad , his dress shirt buttoned to the neck .
" For that reason I want both names , Mohammad and Demhat , as a combination of these two : the [ Turkish ] police and [ Kurdish ] fighters . "
" In the past , because of high pressure , we were afraid of learning our own culture , " says Makbule Tanriverdi , the boys ' mother .
" But now we are more self - confident and brave because of that hard struggle period . "
Still , after five years of relative peace , expanding self - rule , and easing language restrictions , there has been a resurgence of PKK attacks and Turkish military action , which threatens to spill into northern Iraq and erase these modest changes .
The PKK is increasing attacks on Turkish soldiers and is blamed by officials for a string of bombings against civilians .
Public support is high for a military invasion against PKK bases in northern Iraq – the US and their Iraqi Kurdish allies are accused by Turks for giving the PKK safe haven .
The US and European Union labels the PKK a " terrorist " group for targeting civilians .
Turkey has backed up threats by boosting troop strength along the border .
But even as Kurds test the limits of EU - inspired legal reforms that grant more cultural rights , they say the renewed bloodshed stems from a lack of creativity on both sides .
The PKK , for example , did not disarm after the 1999 capture of its leader , Abdullah Ocalan , who vowed in court to " give up the armed struggle " and " dedicate my life to bringing Kurds and Turks together . "
Earlier this month , the imprisoned PKK leader warned that invading Iraq would spark a broader Turk - Kurd war and risk " losing all Turkey . "
For its part , the state ended a brutal state of emergency marked by extrajudicial killings , destruction of villages , and torture .
" They did not internalize those changes , so they were token moves , " says Osman Baydemir , the mayor of Diyarbakir .
Like local Kurdish officials across southeast Turkey , home to some 15 million ethnic Kurds , he is facing a number of legal cases .
Still , a Kurdish political party exists with many PKK sympathizers among its ranks , and some 30 members hope to be voted into Turkey 's parliament in July 22 elections .
Development and other economic projects have borne little fruit or not materialized , however , leading to 60 percent unemployment in this city alone , and feeding what Mr. Baydemir counts as the 29th Kurdish rebellion – the one launched by the PKK in 1984 .
" From the end of 2005 onwards , there has been a remarkable regression of cultural rights , " says Baydemir , whose broad desk is watched over by a portrait of Turkey 's founder , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk .
" Currently there is no trace of the positive atmosphere from 2000 to 2005 . "
The result is clear in the number of legal court cases brought against local officials and Kurds , who daily test the limits of the law .
The mayor and municipal council of Diyarbakir 's Sur district , in the old city , were recently sacked for voting to use Kurdish to spread information about local services ranging from tourism to trash cleanup .
Baydemir 's most recent case is prosecution for printing New Year cards in Turkish , English , and Kurdish .
Some non-Kurdish officials who received them sent them back .
The case was not brought because Kurdish is banned , the prosecutor explained , but because the letters X , W , and Q exist in Kurdish but not Turkish , so their use violates a law protecting Turkish letters .
The mayor responded , in court , that the prosecutor also must violate the law every day , when he logs into the Justice Ministry website , tapping the URL address that begins www .
" In the last four years , many new laws passed parliament and as a rule they are not bad – the same as in European countries , " says Tahir Elci , a human rights lawyer who spent time in detention in the 1990s .
" But in practice , the problems continue because prosecutors and judges have n't changed their minds . "
Broad Kurdish disillusion means more than 50 percent of Kurds believe the PKK " represents their rights , " estimates Mr. Elci , though only 10 to 20 percent support killings .
" Kurdish people are not happy with the violence – they want peace and do n't support these attacks , " says Elci .
" But also they are not happy with government policy , because the Kurdish problem is not solved ....
Kurds in Turkey do n't believe this state represents them , or belongs to them . "
Indeed , unity was the key message of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at an election rally in Diyarbakir on Sunday .
In this long - neglected region , Mr. Erdogan listed his Islamist Party 's achievements , including claims of opening 1,500 new classrooms already , and 500 more by the end of the year .
" What did we do in Diyarbakir ?
You 'll tell everyone what we did ! "
Erdogan told the chanting crowd .
" We just want to win your hearts and emotions .
We do n't want any hate or conflict . "
Still , Mr. Erdogan has sought to take a tough line against " terrorists " and says he would approve a military push into northern Iraq when " necessary . "
But he also says that 5,000 PKK activists inside Turkey – his numbers – should be dealt with before crossing into Iraq .
Turkish generals Wednesday repeated their call for a cross - border operation into Iraq , estimating that 2,800 to 3,100 guerrillas are based there .
" Turkey prefers security to democracy , [ and ] if you prefer security to democracy , then you will have a violent reaction , " says Ali Akinci , head of the Diyarbakir branch of Turkey 's Human Rights Association .
Turkish military operations have stepped up since 2004 and surged in the past six months , during which time 214 people died on both sides , says Mr. Akinci .
His predecessor was hit with 46 court cases from state prosecutors ; the office was shut down between 1997 and 2000 for saying that " a Kurdish nation exists in Turkey . "
A breaking point , observers here say , came during riots in Diyarbakir in March 2006 , when protestors at the funerals of PKK militants clashed in the streets with Turkish soldiers for several days .
A total of 10 people died in the gunfire , including a boy watching from a balcony ; the Human Rights Association is handling 350 cases of the 600 people arrested .
" The latest conflicts will increase nationalism [ on both sides ] and will make things worse than ever before , " says Sezgin Tanrikulu , chair of the bar association in Diyarbakir .
" Kurds are becoming more radical , and I believe their trust in the system is going to be weaker . "
A call by Turkey 's top general on June 8 for Turks to " show their reflex action en masse against these terrorist acts " amounts to a " declaration of internal war , " says Mr. Tanrikulu , winner in 1997 of the prestigious Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award .
PKK attacks also have some Kurds angry .
" Lots of people are shouting against them , ' Why are they using such violent methods ? ' " asks Tanrikulu .
" Especially operations against civilians .
People do n't support this . "
He is handling a string of cases at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , France , where decisions often go against Turkish authorities .
Locally , Tanrikulu is now defending Baydemir , the mayor , who has been charged with " aiding and abetting the terrorist organization PKK , " and faces 10 to 15 years in prison for trying to calm demonstrators during the riots last year with the words : " We share your pain deep in heart . "
" In Turkey , we have lived almost everything that could be lived ; war and torture .... " says the mayor .
" The war concept was consumed to its limits .
But there is only one way we have not tried : negotiations , peace , and talking .
" Dialogue and compromise are inevitable [ to end ] this conflict , " adds Baydemir .
" We need to show Turkey the path of reason .
But now there is an eclipse of reason . "
On December 18 , 2004 , Ascension Alverez - Tejeda and his girlfriend were stopped at a traffic light near La Pine Oregon , and when the light turned green , the car in front of them stalled .
Alverez - Tejeda stopped in time but a pickup truck behind him rear - ended him .
When he got out to look at his bumper , the police showed up and arrested the truck driver for drinking and driving .
The cops then convinced Alverez - Tejeda and his girlfriend to go to a nearby parking lot , ordered them out of their car and into in the back of the cop car for ' processing . '
While they were in the cruiser , a person jumped in their car and took off .
The cops ordered the pair out and set off in full pursuit up the road .
A few minutes later , the stolen car comes flying back down the road with the police cruiser in pursuit .
The pursuing officer returns alone with the woman 's purse , telling the duo that the carjacker thrown it out the car window and escaped .
The woman is so upset she hurls and the police put the distraught couple up in a motel .
But it was all a set up worthy of David Mamet .
DEA agents were tracking a drug gang and had bought drugs out of the car months earlier , though not when Alverez - Tejeda was there .
Using wiretaps and surveillance , the DEA learned that Alverez - Tejeda was using the leader 's car to transport illicit drugs .
The agents then decided to stage something , perhaps even a carjacking , in order to seize the drugs without tipping off the conspirators .
They never consulted a judge , but every person in the story , other than Alverez - Tejeda and his girlfriend , was a cop of some sort .
Once they got the car , the agents got a search warrant without telling the judge about the caper and seized cocaine and methamphetamines , as well as property belonging to Alverez - Tejeda and his girlfriend .
The government indicted Alverez - Tejeda but the district court in Washington found that the caper violated the Fourth Amendment , thus making the drugs inadmissable in court .
The government appealed .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court 's decision Friday , finding that this police escapade was legal since the cops had probable cause already to seize and search the car , thanks to the vehicle exception to the Fourth Amendment created by the courts during the War on Drugs .
Therefore , the court found , the police are allowed much latitude in how they seize the car and arrest the driver .
The tap was considered only a minimal use of force , and the fake chase was n't considered to have put any civilians lives in danger .
The government here certainly had important reasons for employing this unusual procedure in seizing the car .
First , the agents wanted to stop the drugs before they reached their ultimate destination – a patently important goal .
Second , they wanted to protect the anonymity of the ongoing investigation – another vital objective .
By contrast the lower court forcefully found that the government agents lied to , stole from and terrified these citizens during a warrantless search and seizure no court had approved :
[ L ] aw enforcement intentionally caused an accident and stole a car , along with Defendant ’s and Ms. Volerio - Perez ’s personal effects – all to effectuate an administrative seizure that could have been done with flashing lights and sirens .
In reading the facts of this case , one cannot help but be shocked and outraged by the manner in which the DEA agents chose to effectuate an administrative seizure . [...]
No inventory was filed .
No judicial determination was made of the need for a covert search .
No judicial determination was made of the period of time needed to delay notification .
No judicial review of the inventory was made .
All of the decisions normally made by the judiciary were made by the officers involved .
It is difficult to conclude that the authors of the Fourth Amendment contemplated such discretion be afforded to the Executive branch .
The intentional stopping , searching , and detention of people is a crime if committed by private citizens .
It is permissible conduct by law enforcement if done in connection with legitimate activities , such as an arrest .
In this case , as part of the administrative seizure , people were stopped , searched , and detained .
This is not usual in an administrative search . [... ]
Judge Raymond Fischer , one of the three appeals court judges that heard the case , agreed with his colleagues that the search was constitutional , but felt compelled to add this in his concurring opinion :
The staged collision , " theft " of the car ( and all of its contents ) , car chase and search of Alverez - Tejeda 's apparently innocent companion had the potential to spin out of control and exceed reasonable bounds .
Nonetheless , on the record before us I agree with my colleagues that the agents ' ruse stayed within bounds ( even if they pushed the envelope in some respects ) .
Although we do not sustain the district court 's thoughtful analysis , I do not thereby mean to endorse this police action as a model for future creative seizures .

WIRED Opinion
Making cubes out of business cards is easy , and will impress your friends !
What you will need
Everything you need is already at hand :
Six business cards , and
About five minutes .
In the figures here , the cards are pictured as having a white side and a gray side , and the cube ends up white on the outside .
You ’ll have to decide how you ’ll use your own cards to determine the look of your cube .
I ’ll describe white as the “ outside ” , and gray as the “ inside ” .
Creating the pieces
The first step is to fold the cards into pieces suitable for assembling into a cube :
Take two cards , and place them across each other , with the inside faces together .
Try to make the 90 - degree angle between them as accurate as possible , because each card serves as a guide for the folds in the other .
Getting the two cards to cross precisely in the center is not important , since the tab lengths can vary without affecting the final cube .
Fold the ends of the bottom card up over the top card .
Make the folds nice and crisp : the crisper the fold , the snugger the final cube will be .
Flip the pair over so that the bottom folded card becomes the top card .
Fold the other card ’s ends up .
Pull the two cards apart : you ’ve made two cube pieces .
If you ’ve made the folds tight , the pieces will be more “ closed up ” than shown here , that ’s good .
Do steps 1 through 5 two more times .
Now you have six cube pieces .
You are ready to begin assembly .
Assembling the pieces
Now that you have six cube pieces , you can assemble them into a cube .
This requires a little bit of dexterity , but is not as hard as it might seem .
At each step , make sure that the new card you ’re adding to the cube is hugging the existing cards with its folded tabs .
Again , the pictures show the tabs flared out a bit so you can see the structure , but if you have made sharp folds , the tabs will lie flat against the other cards , making a nice clean cube .
At the last step , you will need to carefully pry open the remaining tabs to get the last card in properly ( under the other cards ’ tabs , but with its tabs over its neighbors ) .
Another set of instructions
If you want more detailed illustrations , here ’s a tabblo I made of the process :
What next ?
Now that you ’ve made your cube , there are other things you can do :

Washington --
The Bush administration is quietly on track to nearly double the number of combat troops in Iraq this year , an analysis of Pentagon deployment orders showed Monday .
The little - noticed second surge , designed to reinforce U.S. troops in Iraq , is being executed by sending more combat brigades and extending tours of duty for troops already there .
The actions could boost the number of combat soldiers from 52,500 in early January to as many as 98,000 by the end of this year if the Pentagon overlaps arriving and departing combat brigades .
Separately , when additional support troops are included in this second troop increase , the total number of U.S. troops in Iraq could increase from 162,000 now to more than 200,000 -- a record - high number -- by the end of the year .
The numbers were arrived at by an analysis of deployment orders by Hearst Newspapers .
" It does n't surprise me that they 're not talking about it , " said retired Army Maj .
Gen. William Nash , a former U.S. commander of NATO troops in Bosnia , referring to the Bush administration .
" I think they would be very happy not to have any more attention paid to this . "
The first surge was prominently announced by President Bush in a nationally televised address on Jan. 10 , when he ordered five more combat brigades to join 15 brigades already in Iraq .
The buildup was designed to give commanders the 20 combat brigades Pentagon planners said were needed to provide security in Baghdad and western Anbar province .
Since then , the Pentagon has extended combat tours for units in Iraq from 12 months to 15 months and announced the deployment of additional brigades .
Taken together , the steps could put elements of as many as 28 combat brigades in Iraq by Christmas , according the deployment orders examined by Hearst Newspapers .
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Carl S. Ey said there was no effort by the Army to carry out " a secret surge " beyond the 20 combat brigades ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
" There is n't a second surge going on ; we 've got what we 've got , " Ey said .
" The idea that there are ever going to be more combat brigades in theater in the future than the secretary of defense has authorized is pure speculation . "
Ey attributed the increase in troops to " temporary increases that typically occur during the crossover period " as arriving combat brigades move into position to replace departing combat brigades .
He said that only elements of the eight additional combat brigades beyond the 20 already authorized would actually be in Iraq in December .
The U.S. Joint Forces Command , based in Norfolk , Va. , that tracks combat forces heading to and returning from Iraq , declined to discuss unit - by - unit deployments .
" Due to operational security , we cannot confirm or discuss military unit movements or schedules , " Navy Lt. Jereal Dorsey said in an e-mail .
The Pentagon has repeatedly extended unit tours in Iraq during the past four years to achieve temporary increases in combat power .
For example , three combat brigades were extended up to three months in November 2004 to boost the number of U.S. troops from 138,000 to 150,000 before , during and after the Jan. 30 , 2005 , Iraqi national elections .
Lawrence Korb , an assistant defense secretary for manpower during the Reagan administration , said the Pentagon deployment schedule enables the Bush administration to achieve quick increases in combat forces in the future by delaying units ' scheduled departures from Iraq and overlapping them with arriving replacement forces .
" The administration is giving itself the capability to increase the number of troops in Iraq , " Korb said .
" It remains to be seen whether they actually choose to do that . "
Nash said the capability could reflect an effort by the Bush administration to " get the number of troops into Iraq that we 've needed there all along . "
Over the holidays I had a chance to talk to some of my old compadres from the XML team at Microsoft and we got to talking about the JSON as an alternative to XML .
I concluded that there are a small number of key reasons that JSON is now more attractive than XML for kinds of data interchange that powers Web - based mashups and Web gadgets widgets .
This is the first in a series of posts on what these key reasons are .
The first " problem " that chosing JSON over XML as the output format for a Web service solves is that it works around security features built into modern browsers that prevent web pages from initiating certain classes of communication with web servers on domains other than the one hosting the page .
This " problem " is accurately described in the XML.com article Fixing AJAX : XMLHttpRequest Considered Harmful which is excerpted below
But the kind of AJAX examples that you do n't see very often ( are there any ? ) are ones that access third - party web services , such as those from Amazon , Yahoo , Google , and eBay .
That 's because all the newest web browsers impose a significant security restriction on the use of XMLHttpRequest .
That restriction is that you are n't allowed to make XMLHttpRequest s to any server except the server where your web page came from .
So , if your AJAX application is in the page http://www.yourserver.com/junk.html , then any XMLHttpRequest that comes from that page can only make a request to a web service using the domain www.yourserver.com .
Too bad -- your application is on www.yourserver.com , but their web service is on webservices.amazon.com ( for Amazon ) .
The XMLHttpRequest will either fail or pop up warnings , depending on the browser you 're using .
On Microsoft 's IE 5 and 6 , such requests are possible provided your browser security settings are low enough ( though most users will still see a security warning that they have to accept before the request will proceed ) .
On Firefox , Netscape , Safari , and the latest versions of Opera , the requests are denied .
On Firefox , Netscape , and other Mozilla browsers , you can get your XMLHttpRequest to work by digitally signing your script , but the digital signature is n't compatible with IE , Safari , or other web browsers .
This restriction is a significant annoyance for Web developers because it eliminates a number of compelling end user applications due to the limitations it imposes on developers .
However , there are a number of common workarounds which are also listed in the article
Solutions Worthy of Paranoia
There is hope , or rather , there are gruesome hacks , that can bring the splendor of seamless cross - browser XMLHttpRequest s to your developer palette .
The three methods currently in vogue are : Application proxies .
Write an application in your favorite programming language that sits on your server , responds to XMLHttpRequest s from users , makes the web service call , and sends the data back to users .
Apache proxy .
Adjust your Apache web server configuration so that XMLHttpRequest s can be invisibly re-routed from your server to the target web service domain .
Script tag hack with application proxy ( does n't use XMLHttpRequest at all ) .
Use the HTML script tag to make a request to an application proxy ( see # 1 above ) that returns your data wrapped in JavaScript .
This approach is also known as On - Demand JavaScript .
Although the first two approaches work , there are a number of problems with them .
The first is that it adds a requirement that the owner of the page also have Web master level access to a Web server and either tweak its configuration settings or be a savvy enough programmer to write an application to proxy requests between a user 's browser and the third part web service .
A second problem is that it significantly increases the cost and scalability impact of the page because the Web page author now has to create a connection to the third party Web service for each user viewing their page instead of the user 's browser making the connection .
This can lead to a bottleneck especially if the page becomes popular .
A final problem is that if the third party service requires authentication [ via cookies ] then there is no way to pass this information through the Web page author 's proxy due to browser security models .
The third approach avoids all of these problems without a significant cost to either the Web page author or the provider of the Web service .
An example of how this approach is utilized in practice is described in Simon Willison 's post JSON and Yahoo ! ’s JavaScript APIs where he writes
As of today , JSON is supported as an alternative output format for nearly all of Yahoo ! ’s Web Service APIs .
This is a Really Big Deal , because it makes Yahoo ! ’s APIs available to JavaScript running anywhere on the web without any of the normal problems caused by XMLHttpRequest ’s cross domain security policy .
Like JSON itself , the workaround is simple .
You can append two arguments to a Yahoo !
REST Web Service call : &output=json&callback=myFunction
The page returned by the service will look like this : myFunction ({ JSON data here } ) ;
You just need to define myFunction in your code and it will be called when the script is loaded .
To make cross - domain requests , just dynamically create your script tags using the DOM : var script = document.createElement (' script ' ) ;
script.type = ' text/javascript ';
script.src = '...' + ' &output=json&callback=myFunction ';
document.getElementsByTagName( ' head ' ) [ 0].appendChild( script ) ;
People who are security minded will likely be shocked that this technique involves
Web pages executing arbitrary code they retrieve from a third party site since this seems like a security flaw waiting to happen especially if the 3rd party site becomes compromised .
One might also wonder what 's the point of browsers restricting cross - domain HTTP requests if pages can load and run arbitrary Javascript code [ not just XML data ] from any domain .
However despite these concerns , it gets the job done with minimal cost to all parties involved and more often than not that is all that matters .
Postscript :
When reading articles like Tim Bray 's JSON and XML which primarily compares both data formats based on their physical qualities , it is good to keep the above information in mind since it explains a key reason JSON is popular on the Web today which turns out to be independent of any physical qualities of the data format .
DIGG THIS
President Bush has once again decreed that his personal pen is the highest law of the land .
In a statement issued on October 4 , 2006 , he announced that he would ignore many provisions of the Homeland Security appropriations act he signed earlier in the day .
His action vivifies that the rule of law now means little more than the enforcement of the secret thoughts of the commander in chief .
Bush ’s postsigning statement declared that he would interpret many sections of the new law in a manner consistent with the president ’s constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch .
In plain English , this means that many of the limits that Congress imposed on Bush ’s power — and that he accepted when he took the money Congress appropriated — are null and void .
Why ?
Because the president says so .
The new law declared that only the Homeland Security Department ’s privacy officer could alter or delay the department ’s mandatory report on how its actions and policies affected Americans ’ privacy .
Congress included this safeguard because of the Bush administration ’s long record of intruding into Americans ’ lives — from the Total Information Awareness system , to vacuuming up information on airline passengers , to stockpiling phone records of millions of citizens .
After he signed the bill , Bush announced that he is effectively entitled to edit the report as he pleases .
But his right to edit means that he is entitled to delete information and thereby prevent Congress from learning of how the feds continue to shred privacy .
Bush pulled the same trick in March after he inked a renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act , announcing that he would scorn notifying Congress on how the feds are using PATRIOT Act powers .
Bush declared that he would interpret the law in a manner consistent with the president ’s constitutional authority to … withhold information . 
Bush is apparently convinced that he is entitled to govern in secrecy , and any provision of a law to the contrary violates his imperial prerogatives .
George W. Bush has added more than 800 signing statements  to new laws since he took office .
Earlier presidents occasionally appended such comments to new statutes , but Bush is the first to use signing statements routinely to nullify key provisions of new laws .
The unitary executive doctrine assumes that all power rests in the president and that checks and balances are an archaic relic .
This is the same principle the Bush administration invoked to deny Congress everything from Iraqi war plans to the records of the Cheney Energy Task Force .
Bush has invoked the unitary executive doctrine almost 100 times since taking office , according to Miami University professor Christopher Kelley .
The American Bar Association recently declared that Bush ’s signing statements are contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers .
The Congressional Research Service reported last month that Bush is using such statements as part of his comprehensive strategy to … expand executive power . 
Apparently , the government is no longer obliged to obey any law that Bush does not personally approve .
At a June congressional hearing , Sen . Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) asked Justice Department lawyer Michelle Boardman for a list of all the laws that Bush has declared will no longer be enforced .
Boardman replied ,  I can not give you that list . 
How can we know which laws Bush approves of ?
It ’s a secret .
Bush ’s personal thoughts thus become the ultimate law of the land .
No one can know whether the government is violating the law because Bush has not publicly declared what the law is .
Americans may have to wait many years to learn what the rule of law meant in 2006 .
The truth may be suppressed until Bush ’s aides begin publishing their memoirs or until the Supreme Court has a change of mood and decides that the executive branch is not entitled to boundless secrecy .
So what is the meaning of limited government in the Bush era ?
Merely that the courts and Congress must be prohibited from limiting the president ’s power .
Bush ’s signing statements are building blocks for dictatorship .
The longer he builds , the darker America becomes .
The Best of James Bovard
When we made the decision to take on angel funding while Wufoo was still a few months away from launching , we decided that we were going to be pretty picky about who we wanted to work with .
Thanks to the opportunities that YCombinator provided us , we were fortunate enough to meet with a number of investors and find a really great match .
In regards to the investors we met , they were pretty much all good people and none of them were looking to screw us over .
That said , we used the following criteria to help us narrow down our search .
The Right Money
While all of the angels we met with had the money we were looking for , we realized that taking the same amount of money from two different people can come with very different strings attached .
Here are some of the areas that we took into consideration as far as money was concerned .
Minimal Hurdles
We were getting a little low on cash when we were looking for funding and we obviously preferred to have the money sooner , rather than later .
Our primary focus at the time was to finish our product and not spend that time in unnecessary meetings .
If an investor was willing to write a check after only a meeting or two , rather than after a demo , committee vote , multiple meetings , and a couple months of waiting , they scored major bonus points .
Interests Aligned
There are a number of angel and VC firms that actively seek out deals with companies looking for seed funding .
This is great , but our problem was that these professional organizations were usually looking to provide seed funding with the expectation that you would later take larger investments that they would also provide .
I do n’t really find anything wrong with this , but we were pretty sure that we did n’t want to go the VC route .
So we had a conflict of interest if our investors wanted us to take more funding , and we wanted to grow without more investment .
Financially Independent
We were extremely confident in our team and our idea , but we know from research and plenty of stories that any business can fail .
With the understanding that failure is possible , we definitely did not want to take 100 k from somebody who could n’t afford to lose it .
Part of why we wanted an investor with some serious assets , rather than through family , friends , or somebody who was barely an accredited investor is because we would have felt horrible if we were going to end up really hurting someone financially .
The other part is that we do n’t want our decisions to be emotionally charged by the thought of losing somebody ’s nest egg .
Personality
A good angel is n’t just some “ suitâ€  with a bunch of money , they ’re also going to be a member of your team .
Just as personality matters when you ’re hiring a new employee , it was very important that we got along with our investors at a personal level .
I ca n’t exactly put into words what type of personality we were looking for ( think about the personality it takes to build a site like Wufoo ) , but if we enjoyed going out to dinner or lunch ( and we had them take us out to BBQ and pizza , not fancy pants restaurants ) , they pretty much passed the test .
It was also important that we found somebody who could be blunt with us .
Many of our best decisions have been made after disagreements , and we wanted somebody who was n’t afraid to say what ’s on their mind .
Connections
As much as we hate to admit it , connections , rather than your IQ or demo , usually start relationships in Silicon Valley .
We learned the value of connections by attending YCombinator , and trust me , it ’s much easier to get some quality face time with lawyers , successful entrepreneurs , and VC ’s when you ’re introduced by someone that they already trust .
Whether you ’re looking for employees , partnerships , or even a buyout , try to find an investor that can provide those necessary connections .
Control
We did n’t really have any serious control issues since we were n’t giving up too much stock for 100k .
The only control related deal breaker that we ran into was the requirement that we take on some type of “ business guyâ€ in order to help us with the non-technical related decisions .
The reasons for us are pretty obvious .
Not only would the “ business guyâ€ make us part with more money and stock , but we honestly did n’t want to take on more employees until we need to .
We also hated the idea that anybody other than us would be making key decisions about how we were going to approach our company and product .
Freedom of Location
It seems that most angels and VC ’s require you to live in close proximity to their headquarters , or at least in a startup hub .
This was a problem for us , because we knew that we ’d have to move back to Tampa after YCombinator was over .
We did have plans to move back to California after we had launched , but for a number of reasons , we ’re still located in Tampa .
Knowing that we would have to leave for at least a few months , it was critical that our investors were alright with this .
Minimal Time Wasting
Running a company with a small team is incredibly hard work .
The three of us are responsible for creating new features , supporting our customers , and worrying about issues such as scaling , fraud , accounting , legal , and any number of other miscellaneous problems .
The last thing that we wanted to do was attend pointless meetings or write reports .
We ’re cool with talking on the phone , having dinner , or sharing our statistics , but one angel lost us when they wanted us to present a weekly progress report for their money .
Belief in the Idea
When we told people that we were building a form builder , their reaction was usually something like “ awesomeâ€  or “ I ’m not sure who would actually use that .â€ 
We know that form building is n’t exactly the sexiest idea in the world , but we ’re pretty passionate about it .
Our investor had to be truly excited about the space , and not someone who just liked our demo and had their own plans of what it could or should be .
National Intelligence Estimate lacks supporting evidence , possibly politicized , intelligence officials say Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Wednesday July 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Iran may be focus of Hezbollah spotlight Current and former intelligence officials say the Bush Administration 's National Intelligence Estimate regarding terrorist threats to the United States does not provide evidence to support its assertions and may have inflated the domestic threat posed by the Lebanese political and military group Hezbollah , perhaps because it receives financial support from Iran .
According to the report , Hezbollah  a Shi'a Muslim group with ties to Iran that has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States  may target the US domestically if the US poses a serious threat to Iran .
But sources say the allegations about Hezbollah were simply " thrown in . "
Speaking under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly , several intelligence officers asserted that the report was sloppy and lacked supporting evidence .
" The NIE seems fiddled [ with ] , " regarding Hezbollah , one high - ranking CIA official said .
" Whether it is or is n't is not really the point .
The point is that nobody is ready to believe it . "
" As regards to the Hezbollah ' threat , ' " the official added , " they just threw that in .
" Nobody in CIA talks to Hezbollah , and they 're living off their assessments from back in the 80s , which they really never got right anyway . "
An individual close to the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research told RAW STORY the document 's assertions are not backed up by empirical or external evidence even in the classified version .
In addition , this official explained , the information lacks context and does not prioritize threats .
Released last week , the NIE is a consensus view from all sixteen intelligence agencies and departments , compiled by the National Intelligence Council and signed off on by the agencies involved as well as by the Director for National Intelligence .
The document represents the " official " intelligence community view on any issue related to national security .
Intelligence officials would not confirm whether the classified version contained dissenting views .
However , several expressed concern that parts of the report may have been politicized .
" Perceived threat " or attack ?
Sources familiar with the classified document take issue with the general wording regarding what Hezbollah might " perceive " as " posing a direct threat to the group or Iran . "
Both in its classified and declassified form , sources say , the NIE does not offer support for the assertion of a " perceived threat " and does not mention the possible use of US military force against Iran , which the White House has mulled for several years .
In a conversation with RAW STORY Tuesday , spokeswoman for the Director of National Intelligence Vanee Vines said " the key judgments of the NIE speak for themselves . "
" It is a consensus view and a stand - alone document , " Vines added .
The main analysis of the report focuses on the rise and resurgence of Al Qaeda in Pakistan .
Most sources interviewed for this article agreed with the general assertion provided in the analysis  that Pakistan is harboring al Qaeda and has a record of support for terrorism .
However , there are concerns about the way the report has been compiled .
One former intelligence official says that the report is sloppy and that it would be " a mistake to read too much into it . "
During a July 17 press briefing , Edward Gistaro , key drafter of the NIE and the national intelligence expert for transnational threats at the National Intelligence Council , said that the reason for considering Hezbollah as a potential source of real domestic threats comes " partly out of what we saw last summer in Lebanon where Hezbollah publicly said that they saw a U.S. hand in the conflict there . "
But others  both current and former senior intelligence officials and case officers  find the threat of a domestic strike by Hezbollah very unlikely and question the reasoning behind including such a bold assertion in the NIE without context .
Former CIA case officer Robert Baer  a 20 - year intelligence professional with expertise in the Middle East on whose book See No Evil the award winning film Syriana was based  is skeptical that Hezbollah will launch domestic attacks on US soil .
" Hezbollah had all the opportunity and motivation to [ attack the U.S ] during the last 24 years , " Baer said in a conversation with RAW STORY last Friday .
" Why in god 's name would Hezbollah resort to terrorism against the west when it got what it wanted ? "
" You 'll know there 's a Hezbollah domestic threat when the FBI makes a serious arrest " in relation to a terrorist plot .
In addition , the US has posed a " real external threat " to Iran for some time .
Last year , RAW STORY revealed that the Bush Administration had begun using proxy groups to commit acts of terrorism within in Iran via a secretive Pentagon office authorized by the Office of the Vice President .
Once such group , the Mujahedeen-e Khalq ( MEK ) , has been responsible for acts of terror against Iranian targets and individuals all over the world .
" They are doing whatever they want , no oversight at all , " one intelligence source said at the time .
The response from Hezbollah to these " threats "  including a US naval build up near Iranian waters  has been rather quiet .
Which agency contributed what analysis to the report ?
All agencies claim to have contributed equally to the NIE , despite the fact that not all agencies have the same expertise or even the same scope of intelligence collection and analysis .
For example , the National Security Agency would likely have better source materials to back up assertions of cyber - terrorism than the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research .
RAW STORY asked the CIA to release a declassified raw version of their contribution to the NIE .
The agency , which has commented in the past , has not replied .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that there are no declassified versions of each agency 's raw report .
Is Hezbollah operating in the Americas ?
The NIE does not specifically discuss if or how Hezbollah assets are operating in the Americas .
But there have been allegations in the past of Hezbollah - affiliated individuals running " fund- raising " activities in the United States .
In 2000 , for example , a grand jury in Charlotte , North Carolina indicted 25 men for various non-violent crimes , including money laundering , racketeering and related fraud charges .
Investigators discovered a scheme whereby backers of Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeini planned to smuggle cigarettes from North Carolina , where taxes are lo , to be sold in Michigan , which has higher taxes .
There have been a number of such cases .
Most focus on raising money to support Hezbollah - linked activities in the Middle East .
Some , however , appear more closely related to organized crime than to any Middle Eastern agenda .
In a 2006 case , for example , an Israeli and a Lebanese were caught selling " Generation 3 " night vision goggles to an undercover FBI agent .
Although both pleaded guilty , an Israeli citizen working with a Lebanese national would suggest the motive was financial , not political .
Other profit - making scams and activities linked to Hezbollah have included drug trafficking , credit card fraud and counterfeit Viagra .
These activities , however , mostly take place in Canada , Mexico and South America .
None are known to have been violent , despite ample opportunity and " perceived " motive .
Professor of International Relations at Boston University Augustus Richard Norton , the author of a new book on Hezbollah titled Hezbollah : A Short Story , does not believe a Hezbollah - based attack on US soil is likely as long as the US does not attack Iran .
" The NIE language about the threat of an Hezbollah attack on the U.S. homeland basically states that it is conceivable that the group would attack in the US if the US attacked it or its sponsor , Iran , " Dr. Norton wrote in an email to RAW STORY over the weekend .
" In contrast , al - Qaeda is accurately depicted as aggressively seeking to bring terrorism home to Americans , " Norton added .
" We may conceive of many unwelcome events , but the question is how likely is this to happen ?
Following the language of the NIE , I would argue that so long as the US does not pose an existential threat to Hezbollah , or to Iran , the likelihood of an attack by Hezbollah on U.S. soil is low . "
Dr. Norton noted that , unlike Al Qaeda , Hezbollah is a group that does not act impulsively , focusing on the strategic rather than on the immediate .
" All in all , this is a rational group that does not flail blindly , and which clearly understands what a ladder of escalation implies , " he said .
" Personally , I will lose a lot more sleep worrying about what al - Qaeda might try to do in the USA than what Hezbollah might do under highly contingent circumstances .
We need to keep our eye on the ball and not get diverted by relatively unlikely scenarios . "
Is Intelligence politicized or just sloppy ?
US foreign policy and its approach to terrorism are based on political decisions , which then trickle down inadvertently , or in some cases surreptitiously , into intelligence analysis .
According to the US State Department , only five countries are listed as sponsors of terrorism : Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Sudan and Syria .
Countries such as Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Greece , and the Philippines  which have also supported terrorism  are not on the list .
According to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service , the CIA has no proof of Cuba sponsoring terrorism .
" We have no credible evidence , however , that the Cuban government has engaged in or directly supported international terrorist operations in the past decade , although our information is insufficient to say beyond a doubt that no collaboration has occurred , " the report says , citing a 2003 CIA statement .
The same report  while listing Iran , North Korea and Syria  puts priority on Pakistan , but provides sourcing and evidence for its assertions .
" In Pakistan , repeated assassination attempts on President Musharraf , allegations and admissions of nuclear assistance to North Korea , Iran , and Libya , and a continuous battle with terrorist elements within the country , have made Pakistan the most crucial node of the nexus of terrorism and WMD proliferation , " the report says .
Pakistan is not on the list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Moreover , Pakistan receives US funding and is considered an ally in the US - led war on terror , which thus far has targeted Iraq , Afghanistan and , covertly , Iran .
Sources familiar with the information contained in the NIE have described what appears to be a myriad of allegations with little evidence to back up specific claims , including the assertions that Al Qaeda has regrouped and that it has spawned a sub - group called Al Qaeda in Iraq .
While none claim the report is patently wrong , they take umbrage with the way the document was compiled .
During a Sunday television appearance , Department of Homeland Security Advisor to the President Frances Townsend claimed that , according to CIA Director General Hayden , nearly half of all of the sourcing in the classified version of the NIE came from interrogations .
" Look at the NIE , which you were just talking about , General Hayden tells me that nearly half of the references , what people might call footnotes in the NIE , came from detainee interrogation , " Townsend remarked .
" Nearly 100 people who have been through that program , only a third of them had had interrogation - enhanced techniques against them , and they generated 8500 terrorism intelligence reports . "
Detainee interrogations have been broadly criticized .
Information used at several military tribunals has been revealed as the product of finger - pointing by other detainees trying to curry favor with their US captors .
Is there a focus on terrorism funding ?
Sources interviewed for this article would not comment on whether Saudi Arabia was discussed or if terrorism funding was addressed in the classified version of the report .
One former high - ranking CIA official believes that the funding of terrorism should be seen as a priority target .
The official said , however , that instead of " following the money , " law enforcement and counter - terrorism efforts should be aimed at " following the heroin , " the single largest currency for the terrorist market .
According to the US Department of Justice , as of 2005 , Afghanistan was the leading supplier of heroin in the world .
Its rise to that position followed the US - Afghanistan War , after which the US largely abandoned Afghanistan to focus on Iraq .

Choir boys ' tough lesson
It 's become a familiar tale .
Choir boy commits childish prank or stupid mistake at school .
Administrators bound by zero tolerance policies throw the book at him .
Parents are outraged .
Choir boy is traumatized for life .
And so it was for three good , college - bound seniors at Langham Creek High School in northwest Houston .
All except the trauma .
What struck me as I interviewed the teens — two of them who committed their misdeeds on a choir field trip — was what they had learned from their ordeals .
Their last high school lesson came from the weeks they spent with the so - called bad kids of the Cy - Fair Alternative Learning Center .
" Did I want to see those kids ?
No , " said one of the choir boys , 17 - year - old Matt Borgardt .
" Am I glad I saw those kids ?
Yes . "
Automatic expulsion
Borgardt 's road to ALC began nearly a month ago , when he and Ryan DelaGarza , 18 - year - old all - state choir first chair , bought souvenir knives at a gift shop in South Padre .
They say they did n't know the butterfly knives , with 3 1/2 - inch blades , were legal to buy but illegal to possess .
They 'd bought knives before on a choir trip to Hawaii .
Instead of having the boys just return the $ 13 knives , school officials confiscated them and accused the boys of a level five offense , the highest level reserved for infractions such as rape , aggravated robbery and capital murder .
The offense triggered an automatic expulsion and removal to a strict alternative school run by Harris County juvenile justice .
The same fate was prescribed for 18 - year - old John McDaniel , who earlier this month brought a blunted sword to use as a prop for an English class skit .
School officials considered the sword a dangerous weapon and expelled him .
But the boys avoided the stricter facility .
They say a few understanding school staff members advised them to delay their appeals , which left them in limbo at a district - run alternative center until graduation .
Missing out
For the next three weeks , ( two weeks for McDaniel ) , the teens say they spent long days in " bridge class , " where they kept up with course work , listened to smooth jazz on the Internet , played cards and dominoes , made giant paper snowflakes and read Chronicle comics .
They missed senior rituals : scholarship banquets , senior breakfast , graduation rehearsal .
Routine ruled their days , which began by lining a hallway , pockets out , passing through a metal detector and being inspected for drugs and weapons .
Most kids wore uniforms of khakis and white T - shirts .
A color - coded disciplinary system rewarded good behavior with privileges , such as walking unescorted .
There seemed to be a lucrative black market and kids who refused simple rules , like tucking in shirts .
" Everybody in there is the toughest person you 've ever met , " McDaniel said .
Once , he said , he overheard a student ask a girl if she had " the stuff . "
He was anticipating a drug deal when the girl reached into her bra and pulled out a piece of gum and demanded $ 5 .
Kids told wild stories about how kids came to ALC .
An eighth - grader who claimed he hijacked a car .
A seventh - grader was obsessed with getting high .
One freshman said he'd beaten a kid with a chair after he called him an ethnic epithet .
The kid 's friends were mostly bad influences , the boys said .
He did a lot of drugs .
He seemed to have little support from his parents , who had recently kicked him out for coming home late .
" He told us the only thing that kept him out of trouble was sports , " Borgardt said .
So he and DelaGarza , both football players , encouraged the boy to pour himself into sports , instead of drugs .
" We got him to say he'd stop smoking weed , " DelaGarza said .
They hope he meant it .
" It 's sad because you see these kids just wasting their lives away , " DelaGarza said .
" You 're so used to this little protective life and you can see what life would be like if you did n't have those rules . "
It made them appreciate their nagging , overprotective parents whose warnings to them echo like second consciences .
" My dad bought me a cell phone when I was 15 , " said McDaniel .
" It was so that he could constantly call me and constantly bug me and it annoyed me so much .
I never really understood 'hey , the morals they 're teaching me are going to keep me out of ALC . ' "
The experience , Borgardt said , " made me want to go home and go hug and kiss my mother . "
I can't think of a better lesson for three kids headed to college .
Every year , good kids like these drink themselves to death at frat parties , play with drugs and sex like toys , because they think they 're invincible .
In a way , Langham High 's narrow - minded discipline policy gave these kids a precious graduation gift : their first taste of the real world .

Here we go again : another specious racial - profiling controversy .
Al Sharpton has announced his intention to sue the New York Police Department for allegedly racially profiling black New Yorkers , based on recently released data on police stop - and - frisks .
In fact , the data show that police are stopping blacks too seldom and whites too often .
But even if the numbers did n’t so completely undermine Sharpton ’s claim , the real scandal of his anti-police demagoguery would remain his refusal to acknowledge the black community ’s most pressing problem : sky - high crime rates .
As long as blacks commit crime in numbers wildly disproportionate to their representation in the population , police data are going to show higher involvement with blacks than with whites .
According to victims and witnesses , blacks committed 68.5 percent of all murders , rapes , robberies , and assaults in New York last year , though they are only 24 percent of the city ’s population .
Whites , who make up 34.5 percent of New Yorkers , committed 5.3 percent of those crimes .
Blacks are nearly 13 times more likely to commit violent crimes than whites .
In light of this massive disparity in crime rates , the police stop - and - frisk data are not just reasonable but inevitable .
Last year , 55 percent of police stops were of blacks — a proportion far below the 68.5 percent of violent crime that blacks commit — while 11 percent of stops were of whites , nearly double their 5.3 percent contribution to violent crime .
There are two reasons that the high black crime rate affects the chance that black men will be stopped in greater numbers than whites .
First , the NYPD focuses its resources where crime is highest , and that is in black neighborhoods .
In recent years , the NYPD has saturated high - crime areas with rookie cops , whose job is to intervene in crime early by stopping suspects .
( It is n’t just the NYPD that wants more cops in those neighborhoods ; their law - abiding minority residents constantly beg the department for more police protection . )
Second , because police officers are 13 times more likely to be searching for a black than for a white suspect for any given violent crime — based , again , on the victim ’s own identification of his assailant ( or , in the case of homicide , on that of witnesses ) — their rate of stopping blacks , as they search for suspects , will be far higher than that for whites .
So black men do face a higher chance of getting stopped in New York .
The blame for that does not rest with the police , however ; it rests with the criminal element within the black community that is terrorizing the hundreds of thousands of law - abiding minority New Yorkers .
If Sharpton really wanted to get the black stop rate down , he would be working day and night to bring the crime rate down .
He would be telling young men to stay in school and to marry the mothers of their children , so that boys do not grow up without fathers .
He would be demonizing criminals , not the police .
Until that happens , New Yorkers should regard his concern for the well - being of the black community with skepticism .
Where was this train heading ?
Possibly toward an open conversion to mainline conservatism and quick descent into cliché and demagoguery ( the path chosen by Paul Johnson , a somewhat similar British character of the previous generation ) .
But surely there was time for a few more intellectual adventures before retiring to an office at the Hoover Institution or some other nursing home of the mind .
One obvious possibility stood out :
Hitchens , known to be a fervid atheist , would find God and take up religion .
The only question was which flavor he would choose .
Embrace Islam ?
Too cute .
Complete the half - finished Jewish script ?
Become a Catholic , following the path well trodden by such British writers as Waugh and Greene ?
Or — most daring and original — would he embrace the old Church of England ( Episcopalianism in America ) and spend his declining years writing about the beauty of the hymns , the essential Britishness of village churchyards , the importance of protecting religion from the dangers of excessive faith , and so on ?
Well , ladies and gentlemen , Hitchens is either playing the contrarian at a very high level or possibly he is even sincere .
But just as he had us expecting minus X , he confounds us by reverting to X .
He has written , with tremendous brio and great wit , but also with an underlying genuine anger , an all - out attack on all aspects of religion .
Sometimes , instead of the word “ religion , ” he refers to it as “ god- worship , ” which , although virtually a tautology ( is n’t “ object of worship ” almost a definition of a god ? ) , makes the practice sound sinister and strange .
Hitchens is an old - fashioned village atheist , standing in the square trying to pick arguments with the good citizens on their way to church .
The book is full of logical flourishes and conundrums , many of them entertaining to the nonbeliever .
How could Christ have died for our sins , when supposedly he also did not die at all ?
Did the Jews not know that murder and adultery were wrong before they received the Ten Commandments , and if they did know , why was this such a wonderful gift ?
On a more somber note , how can the “ argument from design ” ( that only some kind of “ intelligence ” could have designed anything as perfect as a human being ) be reconciled with the religious practice of female genital mutilation , which posits that women , at least , as nature creates them , are not so perfect after all ?
Whether sallies like these give pause to the believer is a question I can’t answer .
Image Credit ... Mark Mahaney for The New York Times
And all the logical sallies do n’t exactly add up to a sustained argument , because Hitchens thinks a sustained argument should n’t even be necessary and yet would n’t be sufficient .
To him , it ’s blindingly obvious : the great religions all began at a time when we knew a tiny fraction of what we know today about the origins of Earth and human life .
It ’s understandable that early humans would develop stories about gods or God to salve their ignorance .
But people today have no such excuse .
If they continue to believe in the unbelievable , or say they do , they are morons or lunatics or liars .
“ The human wish to credit good things as miraculous and to charge bad things to another account is apparently universal , ” he remarks , unsympathetically .
Although Hitchens ’s title refers to God , his real energy is in the subtitle : “ religion poisons everything . ”
Disproving the existence of God ( at least to his own satisfaction and , frankly , to mine ) is just the beginning for Hitchens .
In fact , it sometimes seems as if existence is just one of the bones Hitchens wants to pick with God — and not even the most important .
If God would just leave the world alone , Hitchens would be glad to let him exist , quietly , in retirement somewhere .
Possibly the Hoover Institution .
Hitchens is attracted repeatedly to the principle of Occam ’s razor : that simple explanations are more likely to be correct than complicated ones .
( E.g. , Earth makes a circle around the Sun ; the Sun does n’t do a complex roller coaster ride around Earth . )
You might think that Occam ’s razor would favor religion ; the biblical creation story certainly seems simpler than evolution .
But Hitchens argues effectively again and again that attaching the religious myth to what we know from science to be true adds nothing but needless complication .

After just a couple years of practice , Google can claim to produce the best computer - generated language translations in the world - in languages their boffin creators do n't even understand .
Last summer , Google took top honors at a bake - off competition sponsored by the American agency NIST between machine - translation engines , besting IBM in English - Arabic and English - Chinese .
The crazy part is that no one on the Google team even understands those languages .... the automatic - translation engines they constructed triumphed by sheer brute - force statistical extrapolation rather than " understanding " .
I spoke with Franz Och , Google 's enthusiastic machine - translation guru , about this unusual new approach .
Sixty years of failure
Ever since the the Second World War there have been two competing approaches to automatic translation : expert rules vs. statistical deciphering .
Expert - rule buffs have tried to automate the grammar - school approach of diagramming sentences ( using modifiers , phrases , and clauses ) : for example , " I visited ( the house next to ( the park ) ) . "
But like other optimistic software efforts , the exact rules foundered on the ambiguities of real human languages .
( Think not ?
Try explaining this sentence : " Time flies like an arrow , but fruit flies like a banana . " )
The competing statistical approach began with cryptography : treat the second language as an unknown code , and use statistical cues to find a mathematical formula to decode it , like the Allies did with Hitler 's famous Enigma code .
While those early " decipering " efforts foundered on a lack of computing power , they have been resurrected in the " Statistical Machine Translation " approach used by Google , which eschews strict rules in favor of noticing the statistical correlations between " white house " and " casa blanca . "
Statistics deals with ambiguity better than rules do , it turns out .
Under Google 's hood
The Google approach is a lesson in practical software development : try things and see what sticks .
It has just a few major steps :
Google starts with lots and lots of paired - example texts , like formal documents from the United Nations , in which identical content is expertly translated into many different languages .
With these documents they can discover that " white house " tends to co-occur with " casa blanca , " so that the next time they have to translate a text containing " white house " they will tend to use " casa blanca " in the output .
They have even more untranslated text in each language , which lets them make models of " well - formed " sentence fragments ( for example , preferring " white house " to " house white " ) .
So the raw output from the first translation step can be further massaged into ( statistically ) nicer - sounding text .
Their key for improving the system - and winning competitions - is an automated performance metric , which assigns a translation quality number to each translation attempt .
More on this fatally weak link below .
This game needs loads of computational horsepower for learning and testing , and a software architecture which lets Google tweak code and parameters to improve upon its previous score .
So given these ingredients , Google 's machine - translation strategy should be familiar to any software engineer : load the statistics , translate the examples , evaluate the translations , twiddle the system parameters , and repeat .
What is clearly missing from this approach is any form of " understanding " .
The machine has no idea that " walk " is an action using " feet , " except when its statistics tell it the text strings " walk " and " feet " sometimes show up together .
Nor does it know the subtle differences between " to boycott " and " not to attend . "
Och emphasized that the system does not even represent nouns , verbs , modifiers , or any of the grammatical building blocks we think of as language .
In fact , he says , " linguists think our structures are weird " - but he demurred on actually describing them .
His machine contains only statistical correlations and relationships , no more or less than " what is in the data . "
Each word and phrase in the source votes for various phrases in the output , and the final result is a kind of tallying of those myriad votes .
Today is the ten - year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision striking down the Communications Decency Act — a landmark ruling for Internet freedom of speech .
Thanks to the decision , the Internet ( in the US ) now enjoys the same freedom of speech protections as print and remains more open than either television or radio .
On the tenth anniversary of the decision , let 's take a quick look back .
The Communications Decency
Act was passed in 1996 .
The goal was to protect children from harmful content on the Internet , which sounds great in theory but turns out to be terribly difficult to implement in practice .
Many groups believed that the CDA was overly vague and could restrict all sorts of legitimate speech between adults , and the ACLU took the lead in the legal challenge to the law .
The case worked its way up to the Supreme Court , where it became the first Internet - related case addressed by the Court .
Reno v. ACLU was decided on June 26 , 1997 , and it struck down major sections of the CDA .
The Court found that the law was imprecise ; regulating speech generally requires highly - specific controls , and the text of the law did not meet that standard .
The CDA did not define " indecent " and " patently offensive , " nor did it include the caveat that " patently offensive " material with some socially redeeming value would be allowed .
The justices found that filtering on the user end ( that is , by parents ) was a less - troubling method of filtering out unwanted Internet content .
But if radio and television can be regulated , why can't the same regulations apply to the Internet ?
The justices found that the two mediums are quite different ; spectrum for over - the - air radio and television signals is limited , for instance , and expensive to use ( setting up a large - scale transmitter in studio costs serious money ) , making " speech " over the airwaves available to only a privileged few .
By contrast , the Internet is so simple and inexpensive to use as a publishing medium that it deserves the same First Amendment protection as print .
The ruling was a strong statement of support for freedom of expression on the Internet at a time when the Web was just entering mainstream consciousness .
The EFF's David Sobel , a co-counsel in the case , said yesterday that " the Reno decision defined the First Amendment for the 21st century .
The Court wrote on a clean slate and established the fundamental principles that govern free speech issues in the electronic age . "
Congress attempted to craft a better bill soon after , passing the Child Online Protection
Act the following year , but it too was never enforced .
Tied up by the same legal challenges that derailed the CDA , COPA met the same fate as its predecessor earlier this year when a federal judge ruled that the bill was unconstitutional .

. : My dad asked my sister what she wanted for Christmas , and she sent him a list of television documentaries — Cosmos , The Blue Planet , and Life on Earth .
Yesterday , she tried watching the first episode of Life on Earth only to meet an unforeseen obstacle : all the DVDs were region 2 encoded .
The blame cannot be attributed to our father , for he had simply ordered the only version of Life on Earth available ( excluding this unrelated movie and these listings , which are actually just used copies of the region 2 sets ) , ignorant of any regional lockout mechanisms .
. : Ostensibly to retain regional market prices ; more efficiently time release dates ; restrict any material that may be illegal in other countries ; and / or avoid “ stepping on someone else ’s toes ” ( but not , curiously , to prevent piracy , as you ’d think ) , the BBC in their infinite wisdom decided to lockout Life on Earth from every market outside of Europe .
This makes sense if you do n’t think about it .
. : But , for the sake of this post , let ’s think about it .
What possible benefit is it to the BBC to market a box set that ’s viewable only to Europeans ?
We paid money for the set ( I do n’t know how much , but probably somewhere around $ 40 – $ 60 ) , so why ca n’t we watch what ’s in the box ?
Perhaps they wish to preserve some sort of price discrimination scheme , where a British version would cost $ 70 and the American version would cost only $ 40 .
It makes sense for them to want to prevent British people from simply importing the American version and pocketing the $ 30 in savings .
But here ’s the thing : they do n’t sell an American version .
. : Every other program by David Attenborough is available for sale in America : Life in the Undergrowth , The Life of Mammals , The Living Planet , The Life of Birds .
. : What possible reason is there for not selling Life on Earth in region 1 ?
We ’ve already excluded price discrimination as a moot point , since there ’s no difference in prices if there is only one price .
As for launching the set at different dates around the world — the damn thing was first broadcast in 1979 , for crap ’s sake .
This is n’t the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie with all the worldwide hype and anticipation that comes with it and all the potential marketing failures ; it ’s a freakin ’ documentary .
My sister ’s copy of The Blue Planet was distributed by BBC America and Warner Brothers .
It was first released in region 2 on Dec 3 , 2001 and later in region 1 on Aug 27 , 2002 .
Why they even waited that long , I do n’t know .
Life on Earth was released in region 2 on September 1 , 2003 , but the box we have has a 2005 copyright .
Apparently they ’re waiting a bit longer than they did with The Blue Planet , but I honestly do n’t know if they ever plan on releasing it here .
. : The third point , about restricting material that may be illegal in other countries , will receive only this curt , self - referential dismissal .
. : Now , the only possible explanation rests with the fourth point , about distributors wishing to avoid stepping on each others toes and whatnot .
BBC and BBC America / Warner Brothers obviously have different distribution rights .
But this seems to tie back in with price discrimination .
If BBC releases a $ 70 box set in Europe and BBC America releases a $ 40 version of the same set , then people will begin importing the BBC America version instead of the BBC version , which would cost somebody some where some money .
Again , this is understandable , and there ’s already a word for the motives behind setting up schemes to prevent such toe - stepping : greed .
It inconveniences the hell out of all consumers to have to deal with regional lockout .
The only benefits are to producers and distributors , who can jack up the price of two identical products in one region and sell the product for what it ’s actually worth in another region .
Want to prevent toe - stepping ?
Sell both box sets for $ 40 ( or the British equivalent ) .
. : As it is , my sister is left with an expensive DVD box set that she is unable to play .
Her only legal options at this point are to 1 . ) return the set for a refund 2 . ) buy a new DVD player that can handle multiple regions or 3 . ) move to Europe , where she ’ll also have to buy a new DVD player .
. : Option one clearly does n’t solve the problem .
Option two is unreasonable for a consumer who has already legally purchased the DVDs .
Option three is monumentally stupid and deserves no further comment .
There is , technically , a forth option ; however , thanks to myopic and ill - conceived laws , this perfectly feasible ( if not time - consuming ) option is illegal .
Here ’s what I could do to help my sister :
~ I could kill a good two hours ripping each DVD onto my hard drive , stripping the noxious region locks and removing the ineffective copy - protection .
It would take a bit longer , since my hard drive does n’t have enough space to hold all of them , but with more time I could cleverly shuffle each bit of data to make it all fit .
~ I could then burn the ripped DVD files on wholly new DVDs that would be playable anywhere .
. : That ’s it .
That ’s all I have to do , and my sister would be able to actually watch her legally purchased DVDs .
But my doing that would be considered illegal , not because I copied the DVDs — that would be fair use ; you ’re allowed to make private backups of your media — but because I would have to circumvent the ineffective encryption on the discs to make the copies .
It ’s all rather curious .
To wit , you ’re allowed to make private copies of your DVDs , but you ’re not allowed to break the anti-copying mechanisms while doing so .
Thanks , DMCA !
. : The irony of all this is that these copy restriction measures have done nothing to quell piracy .
Instead of my dad forking over $ 40 + for the whole box set that does n’t work , he could have downloaded all the episodes from here in a couple of days — probably the same amount of time it took to deliver the damn thing from overseas .
Instead of preventing piracy , which was already illegal , the DMCA has been used to buttress a ridiculously stupid business model that would have fallen along time ago without it .
This is n’t the difference between PAL and NTSC tapes , which were physical , technical differences .
A region 2 DVD rips to my computer just as easily as a region 1 DVD , and if I were n’t utterly chicken shit I ’d tell you if I actually did it .

One of the cool things about Firefox is it 's never ending ways to do things .
While this list will not make headlines , any Firefox list I find , always has one or two tips worth saving .
Here are five Firefox tips that I like because they are quick and do n't require any extensions or add - ons installation .
Firefox Tip # 1 – Bookmarks are great , but sometimes you may want to save a Web site link for the short term .
Instead of creating a Bookmark , just click and hold on the Web site favicon in the Address bar , then drag and drop to your Desktop creating an instant shortcut link to the site .
Next time you need to visit the site , click on the shortcut and Firefox will open the link in a new tab .
( You can also drag it to an empty area on the Toolbar instead of creating a desktop shortcut ) .
Firefox Tip # 2 – Firefox 2.0 provides a few options to customize what sites you want opened when Firefox starts up .
By setting the Startup preference in Tools \ Options under the Main tab , I like to have several sites open , by selecting Show My Home Page ( next to When Firefox Starts ) and adding URL's in the Home Page field .
But after a while , I find new sites here and there and end up needing to add or remove URL's .
Instead of constantly modifying the URL's in the Home Page field , you can have Firefox open all sites located in a Bookmark folder .
Just select Use Bookmark and choose a folder .
You can easily add and remove sites to the folder , then just refresh the sites by clicking on Use Bookmark and re-select the folder ( This also works on version 1.5 ) .
Firefox Tip # 3 –
If you like to use keyboard shortcuts , but found the Page Up / Down and Home End keys are not working anymore , just hit F7 to get them working again .
The keys become disabled if the Accessibility feature was enabled either in Tools \ Optons \ Advanced tab and selecting Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages or you press F7 and answered yes to the following for Caret Browsing :
By selecting the check box
Do not show me this dialog box again , pressing F7 toggles the feature on or off , but does not display the dialog box if the keys become disabled again without warning .
To get the warning back :
Type about : config in the Address Bar
In the Filter bar , type accessibility .
warn_on_browsewithcaret and double click on it to set the Value to True .
Firefox Tip # 4 – When searching using Firefox search box on the Navigation toolbar , search results will open in the active tab .
Using Alt +
Enter will open the search results in a new tab .
You can make this the default action by having the searches open in a new tab all the time with the following change :
Type about : config in the Address Bar
In the Filter bar , type browser.search.openintab and double click on it to set the Value to True .
Firefox Tip # 5 – Tab browsing is one of the best inventions since the Internet .
But sometimes when you have many tabs open , it 's hard to find the active tab .
An easy fix to this is to make all inactive tabs almost visible , so you can go from this :
To this :
To make this change , make sure the userChrome.css file exist in your profile directory at the following locations :
On Windows Vista : C:\users \[ User Name ] \AppData\Roaming \Mozilla\Firefox \Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default\chrome
On Windows XP/2000 : C : \Documents and Settings \[ User Name ] \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox \Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default\chrome
On Linux ( typicaly ) ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default /
( If file does not exist , just create a text file and name it userChrome.css )
Then copy the following code into userChrome.css and save it .
/* Make inactive tabs almost visible */
# content tab : not ( [ selected =" true " ] ) {
- moz - opacity : 0.5 ! important ; }
Close and re-open Firefox and you will now be able to easily find the active tab .
Most people understand hidden text is something like white text on a white background , and know to steer clear of it .
Let me show you an example of a hidden link .
Normally a hidden link could be in several forms :
– hidden text that also happens to be hyperlinked , e.g. white text on a white background , and the text is a link
– using CSS to make hyperlinks that are tiny , like 1 pixel high text
– hiding links in something like the period in the middle of a paragraph of text
Now there ’s nothing bad about changing the style of a link to some degree , but let me show you an example of going overboard .
Here ’s a paragraph of text on a site that I recently saw :
You see the two normal hyperlinks , right ?
Do you see any other links in this paragraph ?
A user would n’t see any other links , even if they moused over every word in the paragraph .
But if you happened to click on just the right word , you ’d get whisked away to a hardcore porn site .
Here , I ’ll show you what you ’d see in the instant after clicking on the hidden link , right before you head to the porn site :
See how the word “ mission ” has a little box around it ?
It ’s a hidden link .
If you view the source of the page , here ’s what you ’ll see .
I ’ve highlighted the relevant link :
Someone went to a fair amount of trouble to hide the porn site link .
The status bar gets set to empty using the onMouseOver action , so when you mouse over the link , you do n’t see that it goes anywhere .
And the style of the link is set so that the cursor does n’t change when you mouse over the link as well .
In my opinion , this is a good example of a link that crosses over into deceptiveness and violates our quality guidelines .
As long as we ’re talking about links , this seems like a pretty good opportunity to talk about a simple litmus test for paid links and how to tell if a paid link violates search engines ’ quality guidelines .
If you want to sell a link , you should at least provide machine - readable disclosure for paid links by making your link in a way that does n’t affect search engines .
There ’s a ton of ways to do that .
For example , you could make a paid link go through a redirect where the redirect url is robot ’ed out using robots .
txt .
You could also use the rel=nofollow attribute .
I ’ve said as much many times before , but I wanted to give a heads - up because Google is going to be looking at paid links more closely in the future .
The other best practice I ’d advise is to provide human readable disclosure that a link / review / article is paid .
You could put a badge on your site to disclose that some links , posts , or reviews are paid , but including the disclosure on a per-post level would better .
Even something as simple as “ This is a paid review ” fulfills the human - readable aspect of disclosing a paid article .
Google ’s quality guidelines are more concerned with the machine - readable aspect of disclosing paid links / posts , but the Federal Trade Commission has said that human - readable disclosure is important too :
“ The petition to us did raise a question about compliance with the FTC act , ” said Mary K. Engle , FTC associate director for advertising practices .
“ We wanted to make clear . . . if you ’re being paid , you should disclose that . ”
To make sure that you ’re in good shape , go with both human - readable disclosure and machine - readable disclosure , using any of the methods I mentioned above .
人によってその文体は多種多様であるが、職業による文体の違いも様々なのではないだろうか。同じトピックを文章化して伝える場合も、その着眼点が違っていたり、独特な言い回しがあったり。きっと職業毎に特徴があるはずだ。
そんな職業による文体の特徴を探るため、様々な業種の方々にご協力いただき仕事モードの文章をしたためてもらった。
（text by 住 正徳）
1つの日記を４人の観点で 今回の検証にご協力いただいたいのは、全部で４業種。医者、看護士、商社マン、弁護士のみなさんである。
そして、４人の方々に扱っていただくトピックは僕の日記である。朝起きてから夜寝るまで、ある平日の出来事を淡々と綴ってみた。
今日もいつも通り8時に起床した。小倉さんの「おはようございます」に勇気づけられて家を出る。小田急線と井の頭線、山手線を乗り継いで事務所に到着。モーニングコーヒーを飲む。お昼まではデスクワークをこなし、ランチは事務所の近所で麻婆ライスを食べた。相変わらず激辛だ。午後は渋谷と品川で打合せ。渋谷の打合せはうまくいき、品川はうまくいかなかった。今日の結果は一勝一敗のイーブンである。後社には僕の言い分が伝わらなかったのだろう。イーブンだけに。夜は友人と食事。ハンバーグを食べた後、飲み屋に移動。楽しく焼酎を飲んで1時前に帰宅。少し飲み過ぎた。メールチェックなどをして2時半に就寝。明日も小倉さんの声で勇気をもらおう。
「 朝起きたら虫になっていた」みたいな劇的な事は一切ない、いわゆる普通の日記である。一カ所だけ、我慢出来ずに駄洒落を入れてしまったが、そこ以外は起きた事柄を脚色せずにまとめている。
この日記を職業別に仕事モードで文章化していただく訳だ。
果たして、職業によって文体は変わるのか？ まずは看護士さんに、看護記録風にまとめていただいた。
CASE1:看護 士
看護士の齋藤香さん。'98年、看護大学卒業。看護師、保健師免許取得。卒業後は大学付属病院にて勤務。その後、訪問看護で地域医療を深く学ぶ。また、派遣看護師としても多種多用な職場における看護の経験をもつ。
看護記録 風 起床8：00。朝食はn.p.o.。職場まで電車を二度乗り換え。
自宅から遠方と考えられるが、職場に到着してからコーヒーをp.o.。
午前は事務作業に追われ、昼食は職場近くの中華で麻婆ライス。
刺激の強い辛味の多いメニュー。
午後の商談二件のうち、一件は厳しい結果となるも「自らの
責任」として受け止めている。
夕食は友人と。ハンバーグ。その後、店をかえアルコール摂取。
帰宅は深 夜1：00。就寝2：30 。
■ポイントの分析と問題点の抽出、その改善計画
朝食抜き、頻繁な外食、刺激が強く脂肪分の多い食事、アルコールを好む事から、食生活の乱れていると考えられる。
栄養バランスの偏り、朝食を抜く習慣に変化をもたらすには強い動機付けが必要である。職務は多忙であり、かつ責任ある立場のため、バランスのとれた食生活は活力を生むこと・ＢＭＲの低下に応じた生活の見直しの重要性を説明し、QOL向上を目指す。 アルコール摂取については、ストレスの多い職務の中にあって、緊張をほぐす良い材料と思われるものの、適量であることが望ましい。特に、午前は事務作業、午後は商談と運動量は非常に少なく、長い通勤時間を考慮しても毎晩の飲酒は慎むべきである。
また、その運動不足・ストレス解消のためにも、空き時間を利用して出来ること…例えばストレッチや、外回りは徒歩にする等の工夫を随時行っていきたい。
起床は定刻の8時と、生活リズムを一定にするように心掛けている模様。仕事に意欲的でもあり、その積極性を存分に生かし乱れた食生活の改善や運動量の向上を図っていく。
日記部分は生活リズムと食生活を中心に簡潔にまとめられている。また、その日記を受けて健康面の改善計画まで作成してくれた。日記部分が看護士さん同士の申し送り事項で、改善計画部分は患者さんへの指導内容という棲み分けであろう。
小倉さんと駄洒落の部分は、健康管理と関係がないのでスルーされている。
CASE2:歯科 医
続いて、歯科医が僕の日記をカルテ風にまとめるとどうなるだろうか？
川崎駅西口歯科医院の院長、小森山医師に文章化をお願いした。
小森山学医師。川崎駅西口歯科医院院長。歯科医師会会員、日本歯科補綴学会会員、歯科理工学会会員。
カルテ風 起床：８ 時
通勤：電車（小田急線・井の頭線・山手線）
仕事：午前／デスクワーク中心、午後／商談のため外出
食事：朝／記載なし／コーヒー
昼／外食／麻婆ライ ス
夜／外食／ハンバーグ／焼酎
帰宅：1 時
就寝 ：2 時 半
■コメン ト
O.C.を行っているか不明。虫歯や歯周病のリスクは高い。
朝食は食べなくても、前日の磨き残しがあると口腔内細菌数は急増するため歯磨きをすること。
コーヒー摂取の際には砂糖やミルクなどを使用せず、ブラックで飲むこと。そもそもコーヒーはステインの原因となるので控えても良い。
食生活は柔らかいものが中心なので、よく噛むことを心掛けること。また、食後はしっかりとブラッシングし、歯間部にはデンタルフロスを使用のこと。その日の汚れはその日にとること。
「起床、通勤、仕事、食事」のようにタスク毎にその内容が記述されている。また、１日の行動を踏まえた歯科医としてのコメントも併記されている。歯の健康、という事だけをみても、1日の中でこれだけ留意するポイントがあるのだ。ちなみに、こちらも小倉さんと駄洒落はスルーであった。
CASE3:商社マン
続いて商社マンだとどうなるか？
双日株式会社、水産担当バイスプレジデントの林弘二氏に日記をリライトしていただいた。
林弘二氏 。'83年にニチロ貿易部に入社、その後'89年に日商岩井（現・双日株式会社）入社、NY支社を経て水産部長に。現在は双日株式会社の水産担当バイスプレジデント（副社長）。鮪を中心とした水産のスペシャリストとして、NHKをはじめ各メディアから多数の取材を受けている。
商社マンの日記風に 定時の8時に起床。小倉さんから挨拶。
いつもの満員電車○○駅〜XX駅まで乗車時間は44分。
09：20事務所到着。始業までタリーズのアイスカフェラテ￥380。
昼までルーティンワーク（MAILチェック。あまりいい話は来ていない）。
昼飯は激辛麻婆ライス￥780（あまりの辛さに大汗）。
12：40事務所へ戻る。
13時〜15時：渋谷で輸入食品の商談／A社／300トン／8億円。久々の大型受注。
15時30分〜17時30分：品川で冷凍マグロの商談／B社／興味示すも価格折り合わず次回へ（現状分析において認識の違いか？）今回の商談は１勝のみ。
商談後直帰 。Cから食事の誘い。
20時：軽くビールで乾杯＆ハンバーグ。
25時まで西麻布で焼酎ロックを数杯（軽くテンションあがる）。
MAILをCHECK し、26時30分。 明日も小倉さんと朝の挨拶が楽しみ。
若い頃から教えられてきた「報告・連絡・相談」の癖が染み付き、いつ、どこで、誰と、何を、いくらで、という文体になるのだという。そのため、時間と金額に関して細かい記述が目立つ。また、「軽くテンションあがる」などの所感については括弧でくくっている。小倉さんの記述はあるが、駄洒落の件はスルーであった。
CASE4:弁護 士
最後は弁護士さんである。
知人の弁護士、佐藤隆昭先生に日記のアレンジをお願いした。
佐藤隆昭弁護士。海事、民事、特許関係の弁護に強い
通常の弁護の場合、まずは依頼者からの話を聞いて「手控え」というメモ書きを作成するのだという。それを報告書に起こし、最終的に陳述書として裁判所に提出するのだが、今回は初期段階の「手控え」風にしたためていただける事になった。 手控え風 １、依頼者から本日の行動に関し事情を聞いたので、裁判所提出用の陳述書を作成する参考としてメモランダムの手控えを作成した。
Ｑ：今日の起床はいつもと同じでしたか。
Ａ：特に変わりはなく、今日はいつも通りに８時に起床。
Ｑ：その後の行動において、何か記憶の残る状況や他の者の挙動などは。
Ａ：家を出る前の小倉氏の朝の挨拶が印象的であった。小倉さんの「おはようございます」に勇気付けられ家を出たとの記憶が印象的であった。
Ｑ：事務所までどの経路で特に変化は。
Ａ：普段通りに、小田急線と井の頭線、山手線を乗り継ぎ事務所に到着。
（注）依頼者は、今日の午後の行動において、渋谷（成功）と品川（失敗）の２つの商談で一勝一敗との異なった結果を出しているが、この結果に対する原因力として如何なる要素が介在し影響したのかを分析し、それと平行し両者の差異（要件・効果）の比較検討が急務であり、因果関係の連鎖を検証することで、依頼者の行動パターンを把握し、適切な法的助言を与える必要性があると思料する。聞き取りを続けた。
Ｑ：事務所についてから、いつもと違う行動をとったか。
Ａ：いつものようにモーニングコーヒーを飲んだ。その後はお昼までデスクワークをした。近所の麻婆ライスを食べたが、いつものように辛かった。
Ｑ：自覚している自己行動と他から観察された行動とに客観的な差異はないか。人の行動には必ずある種の目的が潜んでいる、ただ、自覚していない場合が多いが。
Ａ：自分では分からない。
Ｑ：結果の後の行動からも原因力を究明する鍵が隠されていることもあり、商談後の行動につき概略をお聞きしたい。
Ａ：商談の結果がイーブンであった。夜は気晴らしの食事をとり、飲み屋へ移動、焼酎を飲み楽しくやり深夜１時前に帰宅。飲み過ぎの感がある。流石にメールのチェックは忘れなかった。２時半に就寝。明日も小倉さんの勇気付の挨拶に期待。
（注）依頼者の行動パターンからすれば、場当たり的衝動で行動が左右される可能性は低く、法的見地から見ても一般人が客観的に予見できる結果に対する判断力・アプローチ力が潜在能力として備わっているので、一見楽天的であるが自己の危険管理において特段問題はなく、適宜臨機応変の法的指導を行うことで、交渉術に磨きが掛かるものと期待できる。
２、所見としては、裁判での裁判官の自由心証主義（合理的疑いを差し挟まない程度の心証形成）の下で、依頼者は主要事実の立証責任につき主張・立証することでの心配がないとの結論に至ったのである。
一気に事件性が高まってしまった。手控えを読んでいるうちに、思わず「私がやりました」と言ってしまいそうな勢いである。僕はただ、小倉さんを見ながら支度をして家を出て、仕事をしてお酒を飲んで帰って来ただけなのだ。悪い事なんてしていない。ちょっとお酒を飲み過ぎた程度である。
職業によって文体は違った
４人のスペシャリストにご協力いただいた結果、それぞれの職業によって、その文体が違う事が分かった。ただ、今回作っていただいた文章が、その職業の代表的な文体と言いきる事は出来ない。なぜなら、同じ業種であっても書く人によって文体や書式が変わる事もあるからだ。
色々な文体に触れているうち、自分の文体が分からなくなった所存であるから、このレポートはこの辺で終了するでござる。

State of C++ Evolution ( after Portland 2006 Meeting )
This paper presents a quick summary of all papers submitted to WG21 for consideration by the Evolution Working Group , with an indication of their progress towards inclusion in the next C++ Standard .
There are no library issue here , unless highlighted by the Registration Document submitted following the Portland meeting .
Otherwise this list focuses entirely on changes affecting clauses 1 -> 16 .
A note on the timetable
Key to the table
Note that while the deadline for new proposals for C++09 is long past , it is not unusual to split a specific feature out of an existing proposal , to ease their progress .
Likewise , existing Core Working Group issues may grow large enough to merit a paper that would not have previously shown on this list .
Proposals in a green font have advanced a category since the last meeting , those in red have moved back , while those in yellow are a new topic since the last version of this list .
Issues with a green background have been highlighted as the features that will be delivered in the next version of the standard in the Registration Document .
Are you curious to know something ?
Well , it is always full of fun in knowing about new things .
So in this article , I would ...
Under pressure from a disabilities rights group , Seattle Children 's hospital administrators admitted Tuesday that they violated the law by failing to consult a judge before removing the uterus of a severely disabled 6 - year - old girl known as " Ashley . "
But they said they stand by the procedure as appropriate for some children with special needs .
" We believe we acted in Ashley 's best interests , " said Dr. David Fisher , medical director of Children 's Hospital and Regional Medical Center , at a press conference .
Doctors say Ashley , 9 , has the mental capacity of a three - month - old .
With the blessing of the girl 's family , the hospital performed a hysterectomy , removed her breast buds and gave her hormone therapy – controversial procedures aimed at improving her quality of life by keeping her small and arresting her normal development into a sexually mature adult .
Washington state law forbids involuntary sterilization without court approval .
A 38 - page report first made public Tuesday by the Washington Protection and Advocacy System , a federally funded advocacy organization for people with disabilities , found that the hospital wrongly relied on the opinion of an attorney who advised Ashley 's family that a judge 's involvement was not necessary .
At a press conference , the hospital admitted that it did not follow the letter of the law .
An " internal miscommunication " led to legal wrongdoing , Fisher acknowledged .
" We did n’t understand the law .
We did n't have it in front of us . "
The legal consequences for the hospital are unclear .
The local district attorney 's office referred a call to the state attorney general 's office , whose spokeswoman , Kristin Alexander , said she thought criminal charges are possible but unlikely .
Washington has one of the nation 's strictest laws regarding forced sterilization , said Georgia State University law professor Paul Lombardo11 , who studies the history of eugenics .
The state allows involuntary sterilization , but only with a court order .
Advocates for disabled people vowed to fight such procedures anywhere in the country .
" We believe this is not acceptable treatment for a child with disabilities , despite the rationalization of the family , " said Curt Decker , executive director of the National Disability Rights Network .
Ashley 's hysterectomy alone was troublesome enough , he said , but the growth - stunting procedure and removal of breast buds " are heinous because they were so innovative and new , something that we in the disability community had not thought possible . "
On Tuesday , the hospital said it plans to institute stricter safeguards to protect disabled children in the future .
Nevertheless ,
Fisher defended the procedures as an appropriate treatment given the extreme condition of the child in this case .
He added that parents of other disabled children have requested variations on the so - called Ashley treatment , and the hospital is not ruling the procedures out .
" Ashley was a unique child , " he said .
" There would have to be another unique child and set of circumstances , with a court order . "
Ashley 's parents also said they stand by their decision .
In a statement issued Tuesday , they said they thought the law about sterilization would not apply because Ashley could not procreate voluntarily and because " sterilization is not the intent of the Ashley treatment but a byproduct of it . "
The parents added that requiring court orders for all involuntary hysterectomies " puts an onerous burden on already overburdened families of children with medical conditions as serious as Ashley's . "
The Definitive Guide to Semantic Web Markup for Blogs
You ’d think that as a result of open - source development practices , blog architectures would be pretty close to perfection in areas like Web standards and maximum SEO impact .
You ’d be wrong .
Unbelievably , nearly every WordPress , MovableType , or TypePad theme that I ’ve come across in the past year fails a simple test for truly semantic ( and Google - recommended ) XHTML markup .
Now , I ’ll be the first to admit that these failures are by no means fatal flaws .
At the same time , though , I find it extremely unsettling that an inferior markup structure is prevailing in the face of an absolutely correct way of doing things .
After having this revelation , I thought I ’d champion the cause and start changing sites one by one , all the while evangelizing the benefits of perfect markup .
Then I realized that there are only 24 hours in the day , and I wanted at least three of those to go towards playing Guitar Hero …
So to compromise , I decided to publish the essential guide to semantic Web markup for blogs .
Learn it , live it , and benefit from it — it can mean the difference between a good site and one that will blow you away .
Proper XHTML structure for blogs and for Google !
One key principle governs the markup on every page of your site :
Your goal is to describe each page to the search engines through the use of hierarchical XHTML tags ( < title > , < h1 > , < h2 > , < h3 > etc. ) and to present them in a logical , meaningful order .
Regarding blog architectures , there are five areas that we ’re going to focus on , as seen in picture below .
Figure 1 .
We ’re going to cover these 5 areas of semantic XHTML markup .
1 . Title your pages the right way !
Page titles are the most important link between pure SEO and your human readers .
Although their apparent impact on your site ’s pages may appear minimal , their true impact in the search engines is undeniable .
As you can see in the image below , Google pulls the contents of your < title > tag and links it as the most prominent piece of information in your search result .
Figure 2 . Your < title > tags are served in the SERPs , so you ’d better make them count !
Although some WordPress themes handle page titles gracefully , many are constructed in a way that does n’t make sense when viewed within the context of the SERPs .
For instance , the highly ubiquitous Kubrick theme , which comes pre-installed with WordPress , has page titles that are constructed like so :
Blog name » Post title
With this structure , all of the search engine results for your site ’s pages would be prefaced by the title of your blog .
This may not seem so bad , but you need to view this from the perspective of the average search engine user — does he or she care what your site ’s name is when they ’re searching for something that is of interest to them ?
Absolutely not .
Keep in mind , too , that users scan content rather than reading it ( especially true for the SERPs ) , so you need to provide them with as much value and as little fluff as possible .
Want to fix your titles ?
Check out my article on how to add dynamic , search engine friendly titles to your WordPress blog .
2 . How to code up your logo and tagline
This is the second most common problem that I see in WordPress themes and Web sites in general ( I ’m even guilty of this one ) .
All too often , site logos are served inside < h1 > tags .
Countless WordPress themes are guilty of this markup misdemeanor , so odds are extremely good that your site is currently suffering from a bad case of logo egomania .
Here ’s why it ’s a problem .
Besides the < title > tag , the < h1 > tag is supposed to tell both Google and users exactly what they can expect to find on the current Web page .
In addition , search engines assign a hierarchical rank to the different headline markup tags , and except for the < title > , the < h1 > tag is the most powerful piece of information you can serve to the search engines about a particular page .
Let ’s look at this very site as an example .
For months , I ’ve served “ Pearsonified ” within < h1 > tags , so this means that every page of my site appears to be primarily about Pearsonified , and secondarily about whatever topic the page is truly about .
How bass ackwards is that ?
The cardinal rule here is that your blog title is not nearly as important as it ’s marked up to be ( I know , I ’m clever ) , and those < h1 > tags ought to be reserved for more specific information about the individual pages of your site .
The solution ?
Try serving your blog ’s title inside a < div > instead .
Oh , and what about your tagline ?
Ideally , your tagline should be laser - focused on your unique value proposition , the primary subject of your Web site .
This is a classic case of “ do as I say , not as I do ” because my own ridiculous tagline is “ Best Damn Blog on the Planet . ”
The irony here is that if this were actually true , then that would n’t be my tagline !
Ah well … live and learn .
So , back to you — what to do with that tagline of yours ?
I recommend serving your laser - focused tagline inside < h1 > tags on your home page , and on interior pages , you should serve it inside < h2 > or < h3 > tags so that it does n’t appear more important than the actual page / post title .
3 . Serve your post titles inside < h1 > tags !
If logo egomania is the second most common problem I ’ve seen in WordPress themes , then post titles being served inside < h2 > tags ( or worse ) is far and away the biggest markup mistake .
I ’ve hinted at it already , but it begs repeating here — the post title is the single most important piece of information you can serve to the search engines about an individual page .
Ideally , your post title should give a clear indication of what people can expect to find within the content of a particular Web page , and as a result , it should be featured as prominently as possible within your markup .
Of course , the best way to do this is to serve your post title inside < h1 > tags .
Oh , and to be completely clear , you should only have one set of < h1 > tags on any given Web page , so make them count !
4 . Use sub - headlines within posts to your advantage
Breaking up your posts into sub-sections is a great idea both stylistically and also for reader comprehension .
The most common way to delineate these sub-sections is through the use of sub - headlines , but the problem is that there are an infinite number of ways you could go about doing this .
Fortunately , many WordPress themes come with pre-formatted styles for sub - headlines , and if you look , you ’ll find that < h3 > and < h4 > tags are the most popular choices .
Personally , I ’ve been using < h3 > tags for well over a year , but I had n’t ever given it much thought until I decided to write this guide .
Really , if you serve your post title within < h1 > tags , then it stands to reason that your sub - headlines ought to be highly - focused , relevant , and served inside < h2 > tags .
Under this setup , your sub - headlines facilitate your post title in the most powerful way possible while still maintaining the hierarchy of semantic markup .
If you ’ve been in the habit of using < h3 > tags for sub - headlines , it may be too much trouble to change at this point , and in all honesty , you probably would n’t see much difference anyway .
The only time I would ever “ highly recommend ” a change like this is if you were trying to rank for a term that is ridiculously competitive .
Then again , I ’m a big fan of doing everything you possibly can to position yourself for future success …
5. Sidebar headlines ?
A la carte
Unfortunately , the WordPress - recommended sidebar architecture has sidebar headlines served inside < h2 > tags .
Semantically , this is ridiculous .
Take a look at this site , for instance .
My sidebar headlines are “ The Latest Articles , ” “ Must Reads , ” and “ Improve Your Blog . ”
While that third headline carries a bit of meaning , the other two are useless , at least as far as search engines are concerned .
The bottom line here is that while sidebar items can add some value to a page , they ca n’t ( and should n’t ) touch the main content area with regard to overall value on a page .
Therefore , you should n’t serve sidebar headlines inside high and mighty < h2 > tags .
Based on everything we ’ve covered so far , you should serve them inside < h3 > or < h4 > tags at the most .
For the record , if your sidebar headlines are tightly focused around your primary subject matter , then serving them inside < h3 > tags is a great idea because they will carry as much weight and add as much value as possible .
If you ’ve got sidebar headlines like mine , though , relegate them to < h4 > tags or a comparable element that wo n’t give them so much weight .
The bottom line
Before I began Celebrity Hack in February of 2007 , I was in the habit of “ loosely following ” semantic markup principles on my sites .
I had always met with reasonable success in the search engines , so I had no reason to suspect that things could improve if I tightened my markup belt , so to speak .
Operating in a highly competitive niche like celebrity gossip forced me to take a strict look at things that truly work and afford me a competitive advantage , and as a result , my thoughts on semantic markup have changed entirely .
If you ’re truly interested in running your Web site at full throttle , then it will serve you well to understand the principles of semantic markup and apply them as best you can .

Imagine you ’re in a job interview and everything is looking great – the job looks interesting , the salary and perks are about right , people seem nice .
What you really need to know now is , “ Is this a nice place to work ? ”
Are people happy at work here ?
Are the managers good ?
Are the co-workers nice ?
Or is this company a branch office of one of the nastier levels of hell ?
You could always ask them straight out at the interview .
“ Say … I was wondering …
Is this a good place to work ? ”
But you pretty much know what they ’ll say , do n’t you ?
“ Why certainly , dear applicant , this company is fully committed to the well - being of its employees .
We strive to maintain a high level of employee satisfaction and employees are our number one asset . ”
Riiiight !
So what questions can you ask to cut through the corporate b.s. and learn whether this is an actual , honest - to - god , nice workplace ?
Here ’s what you can do :
Ask the people interviewing you about their best experiences working for the company .
Questions like :
What ’s been your best experience working at this company ?
When do you have the most fun at work ?
Who do you enjoy working with the most here ?
What do you like about them ?
Which manager do you admire the most in this company ?
What do you admire about that person ?
What ’s the greatest thing your manager has done for his / her people ?
You can ask the person interviewing you .
If your future boss is at the interview , ask her .
An even better option , if at all possible , is to get a chance to ask some of your potential co-workers .
Some companies make this possible , and that ’s the best way to learn more about the company .
What ’s so great about those questions ?
Because you ’re asking about people ’s own experiences , these questions are hard to dodge or to answer with platitudes and corporate flim - flam .
These are all positive questions .
Even if the person interviewing you is a serial complainer , you will get some information on what ’s great about this company .
If they think these questions are just waaaay off base and inappropriate , that ’s probably a good sign that they ’re not into the whole “ happy at work ” thing :o )
Answering positive questions like these puts people in a good mood , which means they ’re more likely to like you and consequently more likely to hire you .
Care to try it ?
Let me come clean here : I ’ve only been to two job interviews in my life – both at the very beginning of my career !
I ’ve been an entrepreneur for almost 15 years , so I have never tried to use them in this way myself .
However , I have used the same type of questions in sales meetings ( which are not too different from job interviews when you think about it ) , where they work very well .
These questions will give you a much better idea of what a company and its people are really like .
If good stories and great experiences start flowing and the word “ fun ” comes up a lot , that ’s an indication of a great workplace .
If they look at you like “ That ’s the weirdest question I ’ve ever heard ” it may not be .
So : What do you think ?
Would it work for you ?
Have you done something like this already ?

Hey boys and girls , i'm sick and decided to extrapolate on the idea of Teletubbies at midnight inbetween smoke breaks .
yay !
seriously...teletubbies ... listen up ...
we all know probably more than we'd like to admit about this series .
there are the four principle characters , Tinky Winky , Dipsy , Laa-laa , and Po. they jump around and entertain stoners and infants , and have televisions on their stomachs which show them british children counting firetrucks , or rolling down a hill .
let 's start with the characters and deconstruct them .
first , and most controversial ,
Tinky Winky .
Why the controversy ?
His purse ... his inverted triangle ... his being purple ... his wearing a
tutu
he. people ask " is tinky winky gay ? " the answer is : he might be ... but it does n't matter .
he is definitely the personification of a lot of flamboyant stereotypes .
the point , as you'l realize later , is that he is meant to represent " gay " , not what his preference is .
confused ?
keep reading
Dipsy
Tinky
Winky being gay is n't even the beginning of our trip down the rabbit hole .
now we must turn to issues of race .
the next most obvious example is Dipsy .
Study the faces ... honestly look at their faces and compare them all sometime .
Dipsy 's complexion is everso slightly darker than the rest of the group .
what signifigance is this ?... on its own it does n't seem like much , but let 's look at other evidence .
the hat : cowhide pimp hat that he puts on .
when he puts on the hat , he dances .
when he dances , funk music plays ( i'll explain now that a lot of things i refer to that you might ask " how do you know ? " are because i watch with closed captioning on , and it says things like " funk music plays " .
when i make an impossible statement , i'll put ( cc ) next to it , meaning i found about it through reading the captions ) .
so you have a darker character that puts on a cowhide hat and dances to funk music .
gee , you tell me what that 's supposed to represent .
i wo n't even get into the symbol on his head bearing a striking resemblance to a certain part of male anatomy .
Laa Laa ... to escape this gender - bending topic , a lot of people say " tinky winky is n't a man , it 's an ' it ' " .
however , in all of the narration , books , etc ... he is specifically referred to as a. people ask " is tinky winky gay ? " the answer is : he might be ... but it does n't matter .
he is definitely the personification of a lot of flamboyant stereotypes .
the point , as you'l realize later , is that he is meant to represent " gay " , not what his preference is .
confused ?
keep readingTinky
Winky being gay is n't even the beginning of our trip down the rabbit hole .
now we must turn to issues of race .
the next most obvious example is Dipsy .
Study the faces ... honestly look at their faces and compare them all sometime .
Dipsy 's complexion is everso slightly darker than the rest of the group .
what signifigance is this ?... on its own it does n't seem like much , but let 's look at other evidence .
the hat : cowhide pimp hat that he puts on .
when he puts on the hat , he dances .
when he dances , funk music plays ( i'll explain now that a lot of things i refer to that you might ask " how do you know ? " are because i watch with closed captioning on , and it says things like " funk music plays " .
when i make an impossible statement , i'll put ( cc ) next to it , meaning i found about it through reading the captions ) .
so you have a darker character that puts on a cowhide hat and dances to funk music .
gee , you tell me what that 's supposed to represent .
i wo n't even get into the symbol on his head bearing a striking resemblance to a certain part of male anatomy .
Now , Laa Laa is the least strong of the arguments i can make , so i'll make it here , in the middle .
she 's kind of air - headed , there 's a curly - q on her head - - it 's my belief that she is meant to represent your typical , blonde girl .
i do n't suppose they could do much to outwardly make her appear as a white person ( the brainstorming sessions must have been so easy for tinky winky and dipsy ) , so she 's just kind of ditsy ... maybe they should have called her ditsy .
Po
Po is , by far , the easiest nut to crack .
All you need to do is turn on closed captioning .
there are episodes which are very Po-centric , where her speech appears to be babytalk , nothing more than gibberish .
on the good ol CC , however , it reads :
[ Counting in Cantonese ]
This is actually what got me started in the whole arena of analyzing children 's shows .
I read that one day and thought ... cantonese ...now , surely , that was no accident .
so i sat down and actually payed attention to one episode , and it all started to make sense .
she 's shorter than the rest ... she speaks in cantonese ... maybe she 's meant to represent asians somehow ?
right about the time i was forming all of this in my head , the right honorable arsehole Jerry Fallwell was attacking Tinky Winky for being one of those evil gays i've read about in the papers .
you know , those " New York " papers ... if you get my drift ...

OK .
first obstacle cleared .
we understand the cast .
they are meant to represent the ideas of :
gay
black
asian
ditzy blonde
Now before you start to form opinions in your head of me as an individual of questionable mental health , i'll repeat that i do not really think that dipsy is black , tinky winky is gay , etc ... .
the creators simply used easily relatable visual cues to convey a message to the infant viewing .
what is that message ?
that these four , rather different individuals can live together and play .
now i'm not going to get all preachy on you about world peace - - i'll leave that to damn dirty hippies -- what i'm trying to do is untie the knot that the creators have tied .
Oh , sidenote , before i go further -- the NooNoo
and you must say " the Noo Noo " .
In the show , that 's how it is related to .
here , we have an autonomous machine that looks after the four and cleans up their messes .
we already have established that the cast is a metaphor for the varied times in which we live -- now , let 's look at the social aspects of it .
they coexist very peacefully with a machine of superior technology .
it has personality , a mind of its own sometimes , and is generally accepted as a " member of the family " .
however , it is always referred to as " the Noo Noo " .
this is a clever language device used to differentiate it as being an object , rather than a being .
it must have taken careful planning to pull all of this off , and i applaud the creators .
now , back to the matter at hand ... we have established a stereotypical depiction of different peoples of the world , put in such a way as to convey this idea to the developing mind .
we have also seen how they can easily assimilate technology into their family unit and become on very good terms with it .
let 's take a look outside the tubby compound .
let 's call it " tubbyland " yeah ... i like that ... tubbyland .
inhabitants : lots of f*cking rabbits
wild life : grass
principle energy source : baby - in - the- sun
cheif export ... wait ... go back one ... what 's that last one say ?
That 's right , there 's a baby in the sun .
the sun .
there 's a baby there .
in the sun .
and it 's giggling .
that 's got to be a sign of the second coming , right ?
well ... i'll admit , it took the better part of a year for me to figure this one out , and the closest i've gotten is this :
infants , even farther along in age than that baby up there , can relate to the image of a baby 's face and say " that was me " or rather " that looks like what i looked like " .
do n't forget about the incredible learining power that such a mind holds ... it can certainly grasp this simple idea .
now the baby looks down at the group and laughs .
it approves , on a certain level , with everything that is happening .
the infant is supposed to watch this show , see that a baby is looking down on a world where all different kinds of people and machines can get along and have a blast , and approve of it -- take it in as a passive observer ( i'm not about to go quoting Lyotard , but read up on postmodernism sometime ) .
which brings me to my concluding statement :
i have way too much free time
Swimming and other water - related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity and health benefits needed for a healthy life .
However , they are not risk - free .
CDC ’s Healthy Swimming website provides information for all groups of individuals involved in a healthy and safe swimming experience about how to maximize the health benefits of swimming while minimizing the risk of illness and injury .

Insofar as I may be heard by anything , which may or may not care what I say , I ask , if it matters , that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness .
Conversely , if not forgiveness but something else may be required to insure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body , I ask that this , whatever it may be , be granted or withheld , as the case may be , in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit .
I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself , but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing , and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony .

Large swaths of garbled human DNA once dismissed as junk appear to contain some valuable sections , according to a new study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of California - Santa Cruz .
The scientists propose that this redeemed DNA plays a role in controlling when genes turn on and off .
Gill Bejerano , PhD , assistant professor of developmental biology and of computer science at Stanford , found more than 10,000 nearly identical genetic snippets dotting the human chromosomes .
Many of those snippets were located in gene - free chromosomal expanses once described by geneticists as " gene deserts . "
These sections are , in fact , so clogged with useful DNA bits - including the ones Bejerano and his colleagues describe - that they 've been renamed " regulatory jungles . "
" It 's funny how quickly the field is now evolving , " Bejerano said .
His work picking out these snippets and describing why they might exist will be published in the April 23 advance online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It turns out that most of the segments described in the research paper cluster near genes that play a carefully orchestrated role during an animal 's first few weeks after conception .
Bejerano and his colleagues think that these sequences help in the intricate choreography of when and where those genes flip on as the animal lays out its body plan .
In particular , the group found the sequences to be especially abundant near genes that help cells stick together .
These genes play a crucial role early in an animal 's life , helping cells migrate to the correct location or form into organs and tissues of the correct shape .
The 10,402 sequences studied by Bejerano , along with David Haussler , PhD , professor of biomolecular engineering at UC - Santa Cruz , are remnants of unusual DNA pieces called transposons that duplicate themselves and hop around the genome .
" We used to think they were mostly messing things up .
Here is a case where they are actually useful , " Bejerano said .
He suspects that when a transposon is plopped down in a region where it was n't needed , it slowly accumulated mutations until it no longer resembled its original sequence .
The genome is littered with these decaying transposons .
When a transposon dropped into a location where it was useful , however , it held on to much of the original sequence , making it possible for Bejerano to pick out .
In past work , Bejerano and his co-workers had identified a handful of transposons that seemed to regulate nearby genes .
However , it was n't clear how common the phenomenon might be .
" Now we 've shown that transposons may be a major vehicle for evolutionary novelty , " he said .
The paper 's first author , Craig Lowe , a graduate student in Haussler 's lab at UC - Santa Cruz , said finding the transposons was just the first step .
" Now we are trying to nail down exactly what the elements are doing , " he said .
Bejerano's work would n't have been possible without two things that became available over the past few years : the complete gene sequence of many vertebrate species , and fast computers running sophisticated new genetic analysis software .
" Right now it 's like being a kid in a candy warehouse , " Bejerano said .
Computer - savvy biologists have the tools to ask questions about how genes and chromosomes evolve and change , questions that just a few years ago were unanswerable .
Bejerano and his colleagues are n't the first to suggest that transposons play a role in regulating nearby genes .
In fact , Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock , PhD , who first discovered transposons , proposed in 1956 that they could help determine the timing for when nearby genes turn on and off .

Scientists have developed nanoparticles that seek out tumors and bind to their blood vessels , and then attract more nanoparticles to the tumor target .
Using this system they demonstrated that the homing nanoparticle could be used to deliver a “ payload ” of an imaging compound , and in the process act as a clotting agent , obstructing as much as 20 % of the tumor blood vessels .
These findings are pending publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and will be made available at the journal ’s website during the week of January 8 , 2007 .
The promise of nanomedicine is based on the fact that a particle can perform more functions than a drug .
Multifuncionality is demonstrated in the current study , in which researchers from Burnham , UC San Diego , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology designed a nanoparticle that combined tumor - homing , self - amplification of the homing , obstructing tumor blood flow , and imaging .
Using a screening technique developed previously in Ruoslahti ’s laboratory , the group identified a peptide that homed to the blood vessels , or vasculature , inside breast cancer tumors growing in mice .
The peptide was comprised of five amino acids : Cysteine - Arginine - Glutamic acid-Lysine - Alanine , abbreviated CREKA .
The researchers then demonstrated that the CREKA peptide recognizes clotted blood , which is present in the lining of tumor vessels but not in vessels of normal tissues .
They used a special mouse strain that lacks fibrinogen , the main protein component of blood clots , to show this : tumors growing in these fibrinogen - deficient mice did not attract the CREKA peptide , whereas the peptide was detected in the tumors of a control group of normal littermates .
Having confirmed clotted blood as the binding site for CREKA , the team constructed nanoparticles from superparamagnetic amino dextran - coated iron oxide ( SPIO ) ; such particles are used in the clinic to enhance MRI imaging .
They coupled the CREKA peptide to the SPIO particles to give the particles a tumor - homing function and programmed an additional enhanced imaging functionality into their nanoparticle by making it fluorescent .
Initially , CREKA - SPIO ’s tumor homing ability was impeded by a natural defense response , which activates the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) – white blood cells which together with the liver and spleen comprise a protective screening network in mice ( and humans ) .
The investigators devised “ decoy ” molecules of liposomes coated with nickel , which diverted the RES response that would have otherwise been directed toward CREKA - SPIO .
The use of decoy molecules extended the half - life of CREKA - SPIO in circulating blood five - fold , which greatly increased the nanoparticle ’s ability to home to tumors .
The CREKA - SPIO that accumulated in the tumor enhanced blood clotting in tumor vessels , creating additional binding sites for the nanoparticles .
This “ self amplification ” of the tumor homing greatly enhanced the investigators ’ ability to image the tumors .
It also contributed to blocking as much as 20 % of the blood vessels in the tumor .
While occluding 20 % of tumor vessels was not sufficient to reduce the rate of tumor growth , it is a promising target for future studies .
“ Having identified the principle of self - amplification , we are now optimizing the process , hoping to obtain a more complete shut - down of blood flow into the tumor to strangle it , ” says Ruoslahti .
“ We are also in the process of adding a drug delivery function to the particles .
These two approaches are synergistic ; the more particles we bring into the tumor , the greater the obstruction of the blood flow and more of the drug is delivered into the tumor . ”

Magnetic stimulation can be used for conditions such as depression
Scientists in New York promoted the growth of new neurons in the brains of mice using a magnetic stimulus in the region associated with memory .
Presenting the results at the American Academy for Neuroscience conference , the researchers said the results may lead to treatments for Alzheimer's .
However , if proven the technique is more likely to be a way of slowing progression of the disease than a cure .
Experts said the work was encouraging but would need to be replicated in humans .
Trans cranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) has been used to treat certain disorders , including depression and schizophrenia and to rehabilitate people after stroke .
It used a magnetic coil to introduce electrical fields in the brain , which activates or deactivates groups of neurons .
The work is particularly encouraging for the use of brain stimulation in chronic disease such as stroke and dementia
Professor Vincent Walsh
To look at the effect of TMS on growth of neurons , Dr Fortunato Battaglia and Dr Hoau - Yan Wang at City University in New York , gave mice the therapy for five days and then examined their brains , New Scientist magazine reported .
They found large increases in the proliferation of stem cells - immature cells that go on to develop into nerves and other kinds of tissue - in a part of the brain called the dentate gyrus hippocampus .
These cells divide throughout life and are believed to play a crucial role in memory and mood regulation .
In particular they found one receptor in the cells was activated .
A subsequent study which is due to be published shortly showed that the activity of this receptor declines in mice and humans with Alzheimer 's disease .
Brain recovery
Taking the two studies together , Dr Battaglia said there were important implications for neurorehabilitation .
" When you have a stroke there is an area that is damaged and there are several ways your brain can recover .
" One is that the area which is not damaged will have to work more and it's that we can promote with brain stimulation . "
He added that the hippocampus is much deeper in the brains of humans so it would be important to make sure the technique could produce the same effect as in mice .
" But it might improve symptoms or delay progression of things like Alzheimer 's disease , " he added .
Professor Vincent Walsh from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London said the findings were a good first step .
" There are lots of examples of TMS enhancing function in some way but we have never been able to explain the mechanics of how it might work .
" The work is particularly encouraging for the use of brain stimulation in chronic disease such as stroke and dementia .
" The challenge now is to find ways of combining stimulation with drug therapies . "
Professor Clive Ballard , director of research at the Alzheimer 's Society said : " This is a potentially interesting piece of work , but is a preliminary study in mice .
" Further research is now needed before we can find out if TMS is a useful treatment approach for Alzheimer 's disease in humans . "
They say a picture speaks a thousand words .
So , here is a picture of my bank statement showing the passive income from credit card arbitrage in the short span of 9 months .
I had mentioned earlier about my first attempt at credit card arbitrage .
Well , the CD came due on the 1st of June and we made around $ 2,000 in free money ( The picture does not show the interest payment for the last month ) .
If you are new to credit card arbitrage , here ’s a quick and dirty explanation of how it works :
Remember those 0 % balance transfer offers you receive in your mail box every day ?
Well , you accept the offer and park the money in a safe place and earn interest on it .
That ’s all there is to it .
But wait !
Before you head off and take on a pile of debt , here are a few questions you should ask yourself to determine if you are suited to play this game .
Are you organized enough to make the monthly payments on time ?
This one is the most important requirement if you want to play this game .
If you are not an organized person and have a history of missing payments , you must stop reading right now and forget that you ever heard about credit card arbitrage !
See , here ’s how it works .
When the credit card company makes you that offer , they add a clause that if you ever miss a payment , you have to give up your first born to life long indenture to the credit card companies .
Well , not quite , but close enough .
Your interest rate will jump up suddenly from 0 % to possibly in excess of 20 % depending on the kind of card you carry .
So , if you are not organized to stay on top of things all the time then this game is not for you .
Sorry .
Are you disciplined not to use the money for anything else ?
Even the best laid plans can go wrong .
No matter how organized you are , there is a remote possibility that things will stray off track during that one fateful month .
Or , the credit card companies may just decide to change the rates for no reason whatsoever – yes , they can do that .
So , you should , at all time , be able to pull the money out and repay the credit card within on a short notice within a short time frame .
That means that you should have easy access to the credit card money – every day , all the time .
If you have a weakness for gambling or are addicted to investing or have a business that is constantly in need of money or any other temptation to use that money , and you lack the discipline to not give in to the urge , then please , do yourself a favor and stay away !
Do you have plans for taking any large loans in the near future ?
Some call the debt incurred through credit card arbitrage as “ good ” debt since the money borrowed works very hard to make more money for you .
But call a debt by any name , it is still debt .
So it will lower your credit score temporarily and it will look bad on any future loan applications you make .
So if you plan on buying a car through financing or applying for a mortgage in the future , stay away from the balance transfer game until after you are done with your other loans .
I have heard people say that your credit score will bounce back after you repay the money borrowed through balance transfer and in fact your credit score could increase due to reduced overall utilization .
But I would not take any chances .
We did not get into the 0 % balance transfer game until we had already secured our mortgage and locked in a low fixed rate .
Can you control the spending you charge to your credit card ?
One of the not - so - well - known rules put forth by credit card companies is that any payment you make will always be applied to the lowest interest balance first .
What that means is , if you have a credit card with 0 % APR on balance transfer and 10 % APR on purchases , any monthly payment you make will be applied to the balance transfer amount .
Say if you have transferred a balance of $ 10,000 .
And you forget and use the same card for purchases , say for the amount of $ 1000 .
Then any payment you make will apply to the $ 10,000 balance , while the $ 1000 balance will be charged an interest of 10 % every month until you have paid the balance of $ 10,000 in full .
So you need to keep track of what cards are used for what and never make the mistake of using the card used for balance transfers for purchases .
Will the “ debt ” bother you ?
Like I mentioned before , call credit card arbitrage by any name , but the fact of the matter is that it is “ debt ” .
If it bothers you to carry debt , you should not get into this game .
When we started out , the better half and I got into this game together – me with two cards and the better half with one card .
With just one or two cards to manage per head , it was not really that bad .
While I was excited to be making passive income , the better half was stressed out about carrying debt ( I wrote about it in detail here , in case you are interested ) .
So , this game is not for everyone .
You need to be able to handle debt if you want to play this game .
Do you have a good credit score ?
This is in a way a game of economies of scale .
If you have a low credit score , and have access to only a few thousand dollars in credit , then this game is probably not worth it .
Also , if you do not qualify for 0 % APR , then it will not be worth it .
Earlier ( when we used balance transfer offers to consolidate our debt ) , we had come across several offers with no fees .
But these days it seems like most cards charge a balance transfer fee .
Until recently , it used to be around 3 % - 5 % of the amount you borrow , capped to anywhere in the range of $ 30 to $ 150 .
But these days , I heard several credit card companies ( notably , Citibank ? ) is removing the cap .
So unless you have a large credit line and have the negotiating power to reduce or eliminate the fees , the game will just not pay out enough .
And for both large credit lines and negotiating power , you need to have a good credit score .
Can you keep learning without getting complacent or bored ?
Credit cards have a lot of bad rap .
And for a good reason .
They do not offer you a loan with 0 % interest out of the goodness of their heart .
It is just the candy coating for a very bitter pill inside .
The aim of the credit card companies is to lure you and trap you .
There are several ways they hope to make money off of you – ( a ) if you miss a payment you will be slapped with steep rates ( b ) there are many fees associated with balance transfers ( c ) if you do not remember to repay the money before the offer period ends , the rate goes up ( d ) any payment you make will apply for the lowest interest debt first and so on and so forth .
If you want to play this game , you should always stay in step with the rules put forth credit card companies .
Keep reading and stay informed .
The Fat Wallet finance forum is a great place to learn from the experiences of several veterans in this field .
If you want to play this game you should be excited by the prospect of playing this game and staying on top of things .
If reading about the credit card fine print bores you , you should stay away !
Overall , I would like to stress that this is not a game for everyone .
That said , if your answers to the above questions have convinced you at that you are a perfect candidate for this game , then Congratulations !
Welcome to ring of lion tamers that have found a way to make the big bad credit card companies purr and dance to our tunes .
Here is a good place to start reading about it some more .

Cablevision Loses Network DVR
Court Case reports that Cablevision has lost a legal battle against several Hollywood studios and television networks to introduce a network - based digital video recorder service to its subscribers .
Many cable subscribers now use in - home set - top DVRs .
" Cablevision had hoped a network - based DVR system , called Remote Storage DVR or RS - DVR , would have done away with the need for the installation of hundreds of thousands of digital set - top boxes in subscribers ' homes .
This would potentially have saved Cablevision significant administration and maintenance costs . "
In other words , instead of renting the customer a DVR which is used in the customer 's home to record TV shows , the functionality of the box would be at the cable company 's facilities , and the user could access the content over the cable network .
But the judge held that this service violates copyright .
There is something facially suspect about a legal regime that turns on the physical location of a storage medium -- that in essence criminalizes the use of a network to communicate with a piece of hardware .
Microsoft Strikes Broad Patent Deal with Fuji Xerox reports that " Microsoft has struck a patent agreement with Fuji Xerox that gives the Redmond software maker access to broad patents relating to document management systems that it can use in existing and future products . "
So two large companies spend millions of dollars acquiring patents .
Largely to use to countersue any competitor who might sue them for infringing the competitor 's patents .
Two of them make a deal not to sue each other , and this is praised as if real value has been created . *

Idiot # 1
I am a medical student currently doing a rotation in toxicology at the poison control center .
Today , this woman called in very upset because she caught her little daughter eating ants .
I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital .
She calmed down , and at the end of the conversation happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants .
I told her that she better bring her daughter into the Emergency room right away .
Here 's your sign lady .
Wear it with pride .

Seems that a year ago , some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s .
They were successful in getting it out of the plane and home .
When they took it for a float on the river , a Coast Guard helicopter coming towards them surprised them .
It turned out that the chopper was homing in on the emergency locator beacon that activated when the raft was inflated .
They are no longer employed at Boeing .
Here 's your sign guys .
Do n't get it wet , the paint might run .
Idiot # 3 - A true story out of San Francisco
A man , wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America , walked into the branch and wrote " This is a stick up .
Put all your muny in this bag . "
While standing in line , waiting to give his note to the teller , he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller 's window .
So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo .
After waiting a few minutes in line , he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller .
She read it and , surmising from his spelling errors that he was n't the brightest light in the harbor , told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America .
Looking somewhat defeated , the man said , " OK " and left .
He was arrested a few minutes later , as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America .
Do n't bother with this guy 's sign .
He probably could n't read it anyway .
Idiot # 4
A motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using radar and photographed his car .
He later received in the mail a ticket for $ 40 and a photo of his car .
Instead of payment , he sent the police department a photograph of $ 40 .
Several days later , he received a letter from the police that contained another picture , this time of handcuffs .
He immediately mailed in his $ 40 .
Another sign ( though this guy might be onto something worth thinking about ) !
Idiot # 5
Guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the cash drawer .
After the cashier put the cash in a bag , the robber saw a bottle of scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf .
He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well , but the cashier refused and said , " Because I do n't believe you are over 21 . "
The robber said he was , but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he did n't believe him .
At this point the robber took his driver 's license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk .
The clerk looked it over , and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag .
The robber then ran from the store with his loot .
The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license .
They arrested the robber two hours later .
Remind me to have more signs printed up .
Give this guy his !

Arkansas : Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly .
He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window , grab some booze , and run .
So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window .
The cinder block bounced back and hit the would - be thief on the head , knocking him unconscious .
Seems the liquor store window was made of Plexi - Glass .
The whole event was caught on videotape .
Oh , that smarts .
Give him his sign !

Ann Arbor : The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti , Michigan at 12:50 A.M. , flashed a gun and demanded cash .
The clerk turned him down because he said he could n't open the cash register without a food order .
When the man ordered onion rings , the clerk said they were n't available for breakfast .
The man , frustrated , walked away .

Two hunters from Michigan
( true story )
This is from a radio program , a true report of an incident in Michigan :
A guy buys a brand new Lincoln Navigator for $ 42,500 and has $ 560 monthly payments .
He and a friend go duck hunting in winter , and of course all the lakes are frozen .
These two guys go out on the lake with the guns , the dog , and of course the new vehicle .
They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready .
Now , they want to make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks , something for the decoys to float on .
In order to make a hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck would fly down and land on , it is going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill .
So , out of the back of the new Navigator comes a stick of dynamite with a short , 40 - second fuse .
Now these two Rocket Scientists do take into consideration that they want to place the stick of dynamite on the ice at a location far from where they are standing ( and the new Navigator ) , because they do n't want to take the risk of slipping on the ice when they run from the burning fuse and possibly go up in smoke with the resulting blast .
They light the 40 - second fuse and throw the dynamite .
Remember a couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the vehicle , the guns and the dog ?
Let 's talk about the dog : A highly trained Black Lab used for RETRIEVING .
Especially things thrown by the owner .
You guessed it , the dog takes off at a high rate of doggy speed on the ice and captures the stick of dynamite with the burning 40 - second fuse about the time it hits the ice .
The two men yell , scream , wave their arms and wonder what to do now .
The dog , cheered on , keeps coming .
One of the guys grabs the shotgun and shoots the dog .
The shotgun is loaded with # 8 buckshot , hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab .
The dog stops for a moment , slightly confused , but continues on .
Another shot and this time the dog , still standing , becomes really confused and of course terrified , thinking these two geniuses have gone insane .
The dog takes off to find cover , under the brand new Navigator .
----BOOM!----
Dog and
Navigator are blown to bits and sink to the bottom of the lake in a very large hole , leaving the two idiots standing there with this " I can't believe this happened " look on their faces .
The insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is not covered .
He still had yet to make the first of those $ 560 a month payments !
And you thought your day was not going well ?
Yesterday I was asked a question about functional programming from someone in my department .
This person is in the real time systems group , and their programming language is Ada ( although they are not really a programmer ) .
The question I was asked was about cache locality , but that question was just a red herring inspired by a complete misunderstanding about what functional programming was .
The impression they had was that it was just Ada without procedures .
So I tried to explain " in a nutshell " what functional programming was .
It 's not an easy task !
I did n't go on about things like purity and referential transparency - these concepts might mean something to an experienced software engineer ( they can see how it would make nicer interfaces ) or a mathematician ( more like maths ) , but to someone who does timing analysis , it does n't .
So I wanted to try and get across a few of the core concepts :1) No assignment ( technically no destructive assignment , but that is the only type they know ) .
The example they wanted me to show them " in a functional style " was : x := 1 ; x := x + 1 ; In a functional style there are a couple of ways to do this : x = 1y = x + 1 Of course , order is irrelevanty = x + 1 x = 1 Neither really capture the idea they were looking for .
However , in a purely functional style we do n't write silly stuff , so thanks to the purity we can just write :y = 2 The great thing is that we can know that the answer is 2 , because beta reduction is valid .
So after ( probably failing ) to dismiss destructive assignment , I moved on : 2) No sequencing , no " one thing then the other " .
This was again quite hard to get across .
I gave the example of quicksort , showing that sequence was not necessary .
I then challenged them to write quicksort in Ada , which is really quite hard to do .
Obviously to do a quicksort only on Integer takes loads of lines before you even get to the sorting bit .
Since I had been teaching generics earlier , this showed how superior Haskell is for generics .
I think I was quite a bit less successful at explaining this one .
The only way you can show sequence is not necessary is by writing an OS , a compiler , a web server etc in Haskell - all of which have been done .
Unfortunately I only had a small piece of paper so could n't write any of those .
3 ) Then we got back to the question of timing analysis - if you spend all day doing timing analysis you start to believe that everything else is less important .
I got asked if my PhD in " software engineering " was just writing programs .
I took great pains to explain that programming language research is not writing an interface to a database in Java .
Anyway , if you want to spend all day doing timing analysis , Haskell is probably not the right language to pick :)
So at this point I decided to screw with their mind : I asked them to predict how long this would take : sort " neil " They guessed O( n log n ) , I said O ( 1 ) .
If you never need the result of sort , it never gets executed - take the example : if null ( sort " neil " ) then 1 else 0 The idea of lazy evaluation was starting to mess with their head , so they decided to try and rephrase the question .
They are interested in the worst case time , so can you treat it as the time to fully evaluate all the components .
The answer is a definite no ![ 1..]
The above expression takes infinite amount of time to evaluate [ 1.. ] !!
3 Therefore under their interpretation , this takes an infinite amount of time , but it does n't .
It 's much quicker than that .
I do n't think they understand that many of the concepts about functional programming , or how to use it in practice , but I think they do now realise it is not just " another programming language " - its an entirely separate entity .

Such embryos should never , however , be implanted into either a woman or an animal , said the Academy of Medical Sciences .
The combinations would include animal eggs and the nucleus , containing the genetic material , of a human being , or human embryos that carry the genetic material of an animal , the independent advisory body said .
A cloning technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer , or SCNT for short , involves removing the nucleus from an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a cell from the animal to be cloned -- perhaps a skin cell , for instance .
Scientists have tried this using , for example , an egg cell from a cow and a human nucleus .
There are no laws against it in either Britain or the United states and the independent Academy said it should remain legal .
“ Provided good laboratory practice is rigorously followed , research involving cytoplasmic hybrids or other inter-species embryos offers no significant safety risks over and above regular cell culture research , ” said Martin Bobrow of Britain ’s Wellcome Trust , who chaired the panel making the recommendations .
CONTENTIOUS SOURCE
“ UK legislation permits research on human embryos under license from the HFEA ( Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority ) up to 14 days in the laboratory , ” Bobrow added in a statement .
“ Re-implanting human embryos into a woman or animal is not permitted .
There are no substantive ethical or moral reasons not to proceed with research on human embryos containing animal material under the same framework of regulatory control , ” he said .
Researchers want to make clones for a variety of reasons , but one of the most contentious is as a source of embryonic stem cells .
These powerful stem cells can give rise to any cell or tissue type in the human body and the hope is some day they may be used to tailor medical treatments for injuries or diseases such as Parkinson ’s or diabetes .
In some countries , such as Britain , their use is not controversial and is actively funded and encouraged .
In the United States , their use is legal but federal funding of the work is strictly limited by Congress and by President George W. Bush , who has vetoed legislation that would broaden it .
Researchers also routinely make chimeras -- animals that contain the genetic material from more than one individual .
These include animals that carry human genes , most commonly mice engineered with human genes that are used to study disease .
“ We found no current scientific reasons to generate ‘ true ’ hybrid embryos by mixing human and animal gametes ( eggs and sperm ) .
However , given the speed of this field of research , the working group could not rule out the emergence of scientifically valid reasons in the future , ” Bobrow said .
From hacking to big business
Computer viruses have been around almost as long as there have been computers .
But these days , writing malware is no longer exclusively the domain of a few socially maladjusted computer nerds .
What was once primarily an intellectual exercise is now seriously big business .
Just how big a business has writing malware become ?
One person who is in a position to know is Paul Wood , who has been working for the Internet security firm MessageLabs for the past five years .
His company provides e-mail , web , and instant messaging filtering solutions for ISPs and businesses and has developed sophisticated monitoring software that provides a front - lines look at malware in all its forms .
MessageLabs recently updated its reporting on the current state of malicious software , and I had a chance to talk to Paul at length about what it all meant .
An Apple ] [ running Elk Cloner , one of the first viruses , circa 1982
The short version is this : malware is getting smarter — a lot smarter — and traditional methods of protection are straining to keep up .
In addition , as operating systems and software get more and more resilient to direct attacks , the bad guys are increasingly turning to social engineering to bypass all technological forms of protection .
Even more worrisome is the rise of directed attacks against specific businesses , as well as social networking sites and online games .
The cyberpunk world of hackers backed by giant criminal syndicates has transitioned , almost without anyone noticing , from science fiction to reality .
Phishing briefly overtakes virus attacks
In January of this year , for the first time in history , phishing attacks — e- mail messages pretending to be from a legitimate business , but linking to fake web sites that grab sensitive personal data — became the dominant form of malware on the ‘ Net .
Since then , phishing attacks have dropped slightly , and virus e-mails are once again more common , but the two continue to run neck and neck .
Data source : MessageLabs
Phishing attacks have the advantage of passing cleanly through firewalls , bypassing anti-virus software , and they do n't rely on users to be running operating systems that do n't have all the latest security patches .
In fact , phishing does n't require the user to be running any particular operating system at all .
Phishing has an additional negative impact on the Internet besides simply scamming people out of their money and personal data .
The sheer preponderance of phishing messages has made it more difficult for legitimate communication to get through .
An personal example : I receive dozens of fake messages pretending to be from PayPal each day .
So when a message from the real PayPal arrived in my inbox the other day ( it needed me to update my credit card , ironically because I had to cancel the previous one due to fraudulent charges ) , I almost deleted it out of habit .
There are ways that financial institutions can help ensure that their customers are properly authenticated each time they log on a web site , but some of these methods are overly complicated or expensive to implement .
One method involves a " scratch pad " of passwords which are used only once for each time the user logs in .
Other ideas involve using additional physical devices before allowing users to sign on .
A company in the UK has come up with a card scanner unit that connects to the user 's computer .
So far , there have been few banks rushing to adopt these sorts of systems .
APACS , the organization responsible for banking regulation in Britain , has not mandated that any of these types of additional security measures be used for online banking , nor have any other similar institutions in Europe or North America .
For now , the phishers are definitely " making hay while the sun shines , " gathering up bank account information as fast as they can before new security measures are put in place .
A stock tip scam
Bank and PayPal scams are n't the only way of making money , however .
Recently , there has been a huge rise of e-mails pretending to be hot stock tips .
The stock in question is simply a junk company with a low valuation , and the hackers have already bought a large number of shares prior to sending out the spam .
Typically , enough people buy shares on the " hot tip , " after which the hackers immediately sell and collect a nice profit .
An interesting technique is used to get these e-mails through most spam filters : the entire message is sent as a giant bitmap image .
This makes it impossible for keyword filters to identify the message as spam .
MessageLabs estimates that between 15 and 20 percent of all spam messages use this image trick , and as of last month , some have begun hosting the images on free image hosting sites .
While most people are n't taken in by phishing e-mails , even if a small percentage fall for the trick , it is worth big money .
Although it is difficult to measure the total amount of money being made — the number of computers sending out phishing e-mails fluctuates all the time — Wood estimates that a single phishing campaign can make anywhere from $ 60 to $ 1,000 per day .
A series of encodings on printouts from color laser printers to discourage counterfeiting ?
At first , the idea sounds like the urban legend from a couple of decades ago that claimed you could hear Satanic messages when you play vinyl records backwards .
Yet the evidence from the Electronic Frontier Foundation is that the encodings are embedded in color printers from all major manufacturers .
Moreover , the issues raised by the practice have caused Free Software Foundation director Benjamin Mako Hill and other members of the Computing Culture group at the MIT Media Lab to begin the Seeing Yellow campaign to stop the practice .
The campaign takes its name from the nature of the encoding , which takes the form of yellow dots printed across the entire page of a printout .
The dots are invisible to the unaided eye , but can be seen by placing an intense blue LED light behind a printout in a darkened room .
Alternatively , the dots can be seen in a scanned copy of a printout with a resolution of at least 600d pi .
They become even clearer when the scanned copy is opened in a graphics program like the GIMP , and only the blue channel is visible ( Dialogues -> Channels ) .
However , for the most part , the public can only guess what information is carried by the yellow dots .
In fact , except for Toshiba , whose documentation mentions an unspecified tracking device for printouts , most manufacturers do nothing to make consumers aware that their printouts can be tracked .
In addition to the inability to consent to being monitored , the situation also raises issues about privacy and the right to anonymity .
Pointing out that the eighteenth century Federalist Papers , a collection of 85 letters that advocated ratification of the American Constitution , were originally published anonymously , Hill says , " It 's perfectly legitimate for people to want communicate anonymously .
Anonymity is absolutely essential to democracy .
The [ Federalist Papers ] are an example of how anonymous communication can lead to some of the most important political changes . "
Hill goes on to note , that , ironically , that people who have written to the campaign insisting that the innocent have nothing to worry about take good care to remain anonymous themselves .
Even Hewlett - Packard employees responding to privacy concerns , he says , sign their emails not with their names , but simply with " Privacy . "
" It 's funny , " Hill says , " But people are choosing to remain anonymous while telling me that people should n't do that . "
The immediate impetus for the campaign was a report from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that one man who contacted his printer manufacturer for information about how to turn the tracking device off soon found himself being questioned by the U.S. Secret Service .
By contrast , Hill says , " We want it to be perfectly normal to complain about the lack of anonymity . "
Following the dots
How long has this forensic technology been used ?
What information is being collected ?
The truth is that almost nothing is known about the practice .
What is known has emerged in bits and pieces .
The first indication of the practice seems to have been an article by Wilbert de Vries in PC World published in October 2004 , entitled , " Dutch track counterfeits via printer serial numbers . "
In the article , de Vries quotes a representative of Canon Europe as saying , " Canon works closely with the relevant national and international authorities to ensure that the opportunities for its products to be misused are minimized , " and mentions the existence of the yellow dots .
A month later , PC World published a similar article by Jason Tuohey entitled " Government Uses Color Laser Printer Technology to Track Documents " that covered much the same ground , except in the United States and quoted a Xerox representative , who said that the tracking mechanism was designed for use against counterfeiters .
The same article quoted Lorelei Pagano , a counterfeiting specialist with the U.S. Secret Service , who said that the mechanism was used only in criminal investigations , and pointed out that companies have never informed consumers that it was being used .
Nor is it public knowledge whether other tracking devices may be used on printers .
However , a site for the Purdue Sensor and Printer Forensics project does clearly indicate that research is being done into other methods of tracking both laser and inkjet printers , as well as digital cameras and scanners .
Papers on the Purdue site show that the methods being researched include unique characteristics of various devices , including dad pixels and image noise .
Research is also being done into methods for hiding data in halftone documents .
Whether any of these methods are or will be implemented is unknown .
The Electronics Frontier Foundation did submit a Freedom of Information request to the U.S. Secret Service in December 2005 asking for more details about the practice , but is still waiting for a reply .
Even the printer manufacturers themselves seem to know little about the practice .
Hill reports that most representatives of printer manufacturers are completely unaware of it , which suggests that the decision to incorporate the technology was made at the highest levels of each company .
Not only that , but , if Hewlett - Packard is typical , even the manufacturers know little about the details .
When blogger John Whelan contacted HP about the issue , he was told by a company representative that the chips used for the encoding of the yellow dots were outsourced to another company that HP employees could not read them .
Whelan 's contact also claimed that the devices were secure against misuse because of this secrecy .
Most of what is known comes from the investigative efforts of the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The foundation 's
Web site includes a list of printers whose printouts have been examined , to have the yellow dots .
However , this information is tentative .
As the preface to the list suggests , the dots , when found , may be the result of dithering techniques or a poorly calibrated printer .
Conversely , not finding the dots does not rule out the use of other identification techniques .
Still , the foundation is also encouraging supporters to do their own testing and send the results .
In addition , the foundation has managed to partly decipher the dots on a Xerox Docucolor print out .
As might be expected , the arrangement of the dots includes the printer serial number in binary - coded decimal , as well as the date and time that the page was printed .
Presumably , other manufacturers and possibly other Xerox printers give the same information , but since encoding is not uniform , nobody knows for sure .
Early campaign results
Launched less than ten days ago , the Seeing Yellow campaign has attracted considerable interest .
The first day that the site was up , it received 15,000 hits , and , according to Hill , that number has remained steady .
In addition , at the time of writing , almost 12,000 people had contacted their printer manufacturer about the issue and clicked the counter on the site keeping track of such actions .
The campaign has also motivated some people to try to return their color laser printers .
Others have told resellers that they would buy the first printer that included a guarantee that it did not include such tracking devices .
So far , Hill has heard of no one who has been able to hack their printer to remove the mechanism that prints the yellow dots ( which would be difficult , since none of the public know what it is ) .
He has heard reports that some users are trying to find ways to add random dots to make the encoding useless , but , given that more than one encoding seems to be used , this effort is likely to have limited success at best .
Hill acknowledges that workarounds exist .
As some of his correspondents have suggested , users could print in black and white , and only print in color when they do n't care whether they are anonymous .
However , Hill disagrees with the idea of settling for such workarounds for the dots .
" I think that the answer is to turn them off altogether , and that counter - measures are not enough , " he says .
" But the worst thing to me is that there are people who think they are anonymous when they print in color -- and they 're not . "
Whether the campaign will be successful in removing tracking measures from color laser printers is still anybody 's guess .
But for now , the campaign is clearly succeeding in its first step by making sure that people know as much about the issue as there is to know .

Last week ’s state Supreme Court ruling that prevents California cities from confiscating the cars of suspected johns and drug buyers is a mixed blessing , but the good in it outweighs the bad .
Depriving accused criminals of their property before charges against them are proved in court upends the basic American legal principles that a person should be deemed innocent until proved guilty and that punishment is to be meted out by a judge or a jury , not by the police .
It would have been better for the court to reach the outcome it did by finding that local confiscation laws violate the due process clause .
The justices instead ruled that seizing cars in drug cases is a power reserved to the state , meaning that Los Angeles ca n’t take a suspect ’s car for the simple reason that California can .
With that kind of approach , cities on the front lines in the battle against neighborhood decay give up much of their power to distant Sacramento .
But a look at many cities ’ grab - now - and - ask - questions - later ordinances confirms the wisdom of the decision .
For example , in Stockton -- the city whose law gave rise to the case -- a police officer claiming probable cause to believe a car was being used in a drug or prostitution crime could take it , and the city could keep it for a year before granting the suspect a hearing on the seizure .
Even then , the city gave itself a low standard of proof .
Criminal charges might have been dropped , or the suspect could have been acquitted , but too bad ; under the lower standard the city could still sell the car and pocket the proceeds .
A person was punished not after being found guilty but merely after being accused .
Los Angeles has similar laws , and police argue that the fear of immediately losing a car is the only thing that keeps johns and drug buyers from overrunning some neighborhoods .
But cities must not allow their lack of sufficient law enforcement resources to be offset by sweeping police powers .
Advertisement
State law , by contrast , permits forfeiture of a drug offender ’s car only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle was used in a specified drug crime .
The state also allows cities to bar the driver of a car used in soliciting prostitution from getting behind the same wheel again .
It ’s a good balance between the needs of law enforcement and the rights of the accused , but watch out :
The court ’s reasoning virtually invites cities to lobby Sacramento to get their car - snatching powers back .
Lawmakers should not heed them .

One of the several planets within the Gliese 581 star system , called Gliese 581 d , may be one of the most potentially habitable alien worlds known .
It is about 8 times the mass of Earth , and located in an orbit just right for liquid water to exist on the surface .
Water is a key ingredient for life as we know it .
Gliese 581 is a red dwarf star 20.5 light - years from Earth
Scientistsearlier this year announced they had found a small , rocky planet located justfar enough from its star to sustain liquid water on its surface , and thuspossibly support life .
Turns outthe scientists might have picked the right star for hosting a habitable world , but got the planet wrong .
The world known as Gliese581c is probably too hot to support liquid water or life , new computermodels suggest , but conditions on its neighbor , Gliese 581d , might be justright .
Thefindings are detailed in the May 25 issue of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics .
So muchpromise
Gliese581c , discovered in April by a team led by Stephane Udry of the GenevaObservatory in Switzerland , is about 50 percent bigger than Earth and aboutfive times more massive .
It is located about 20.5 light - years away , and circlesa dim red dwarf star called Gliese 581 .
Of the morethan 200 extrasolarplanets , or ?
exoplanets , ?
discovered since 1995 , Gliese 581c was the firstfound that resides within the habitablezone of its star , if only barely .
The habitable , or ?
Goldilocks ?
zone isthe region around a star where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold , so water can exist on a planet ?s surface in its liquid state .
Water is a keyingredient for life as we know it .
But newsimulations of the climate on Gliese 581c created by Werner von Bloh of the Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and his team suggest theplanet is no Earthly paradise , but rather a faraway Venus , where carbon dioxideand methane in the atmosphere create a runaway greenhouse effect that warms theplanet well above 212 degrees Fahrenheit ( 100 Celsius ) , boiling away liquidwater and with it any promise of life .
Anothercontender
But thesame greenhouse effect that squashes prospects for life on Gliese 581c raisesthe same hope for another planet in the system , a world of eight Earth - massescalled Gliese 581d , which was also discovered by Udry ?s team .
? Thisplanet is actually outside the habitable zone , ? said Manfred Cuntz , anastronomer at the University of Texas at Arlington and a member of von Bloh ? steam .
?
It appears at first sight too cold .
However , based on the greenhouseeffect , physical processes can occur which are heating up the planet to atemperature that allows for fluid water .?
And wherethis is fluid water , there is the chance of life as well .
The researchersspeculate that ?at least some primitive forms of life ?
might exist on Gliese581d .
There is no evidence to support that speculation , however .
Jurystill out
DavidCharbonneau , an astronomer at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) who was not involved in the study , said the results from von Bloh 's teamare " probably a sound calculation but we do n't actually know if it ' scorrect . "
Gliese 581 ddemonstrates the importance of taking a planet 's atmospheric conditions intoaccount when considering its potential for habitability .
The concept of ahabitable zone " is a very useful thing because it does inform us a greatdeal , and it explains a lot in the solar system .
But it 's not the wholestory , " Charbonneau said .
JaymieMatthews , an astronomer at the University of British Columbia in Canada , doesn ?t treat the new findings as conclusive , but finds them ?
interesting as anillustration of how we can use remote exoplanetary environments as possibletest beds for climate models .?
The modelsmade by von Bloh ? s team could be tested if scientists can measure thermalemissions and the reflectivity , or ? albedo , ? of the planets , Matthews said .
Scientists ? have done this already for HD 209458 b , a hotJupiter , but we will need to do this for possibly ?
Earthy ?
planets to trulyassess their habitability , ? he added .
A stablestar
Matthewsown research , recently presented at the annual meeting of the CanadianAstronomical Society , suggests one reason Gliese 581 is such a promising starfor finding habitable planets is that it is similar to our own sun in that itis remarkably stable .
Matthewsand his team used a Canadian space telescope called MOST to monitor Gliese 581 f or six weeks .
During that time , they observed very few instances of thepowerful solar flares common among reddwarf stars .
? If thestar showed significant variations in brightness during the weeks we monitoredit , that would at least complicate the thermal equilibrium of the planetsaround it , ?
Matthews explained .
Thestability of the light also suggests
Gliese 581 is old and that is has beenaround for at least a few billion years .
? Youngstars , like young people , can have bad cases of acne ( large starspots andactivity ) and spin around , ?
Matthews said in an email interview .
?
Older starslike the sun have relatively clear complexions and rotate rather sedately .?
Gliese581?s advanced age is good news for scientists hoping to find signs of life inthe system .
? We know ittook about three and a half billion years for life on Earth to reach the levelof complexity that we call human , ?
Matthews said , ? so it ? s more encouraging forthe prospects of complex life on any planet around Gliese 581 if it ? s beenaround for at least as long .?
Good news for XQuery and XSLT fans
Good news for XQuery and XSLT fans - the W3C has announced the W3C Recommendations for XQuery 1.0 as an XML - aware syntax for querying collections of structured and semi-structured data both locally and over the Web and XSLT Version 2.0 , a specification for transforming data model instances ( XML and non -XML ) into other documents .
The third spec that 's made Recommendation status is XPath 2.0 , an expression syntax for referring to parts of XML documents .
Some of the big players behind getting these standards ratified ( IBM , Oracle , Microsoft ) are quoted on this testimonials page .
From the official press release :
" These new Web Standards will play a significant role in enterprise computing by connecting databases with the Web .
XQuery allows data mining of everything from memos and Web service messages to multi-terabyte relational databases .
XSLT 2.0 adds significant new functionality to the already widely deployed XSLT 1.0 , which enables the transformation and styled presentation of XML documents .
Both specifications rely on XPath 2.0 , also significantly enriched from its previous version .
... " This is a red - letter day for XSLT users , " said Michael Kay , editor of the XSLT 2.0 specification , " both for those who have been waiting patiently for this Recommendation to appear before they could use the new features , and for those who have taken a gamble by deploying the new technology before its final stamp of approval .
Our biggest achievement , in my view , has been to deliver a huge step forward in functionality and developer productivity , while also retaining a very high level of backwards compatibility , thereby keeping transition costs to the minimum . "
But not everyone agrees XQuery is slam dunk .
Ex Microsoftee ' Derek ' in this November post on hearing the news of the proposed recommendations , wrote at the time :
" I just noticed , XSLT 2.0 , XML Query and XPath 2.0 Are Proposed Recommendations .
Since leaving MS , I 've stopped tracking these .
It baffles me that XQuery is only just now ' shipping ' .
This + the - mess - that - is - XSD spell the doom of XML .
This is n't just doom , like the Outlook spell - checker would try an correct the DOM to ; this is real doom .
These standards to too complicated and too late ... I honestly think we would be better without XQuery .
Let the vendors think for themselves and see what customers actually use .
XQuery is a standard looking for a use , which is backward and guaranteed to produce a problematic result .
XSLT / XPath 2.0 is a harder one ...
There are a couple things that XSLT 2.0 adds that were desperately needed vs XSLT 1.0 .
But I 've managed a team implementing a commercial quality XSLT 1.0 implementation and that was a huge amount of work .
XSLT 2.0 is at least 4 x as much work .
That is terrifying .
Why not just ' fix ' XSLT 1.0 ?
It would be dramatically less work , and provide 80 % of the gains , at 10 % the cost . "
Generally however , the reaction I 've seen to the news seems fairly positive .
Kimbro Staken never thought he'd see the day .
Jonathan Robbie of DataDirect seems chuffed ( mind you , his cmapny has been a member of XML Query WG ) .
Alex Miller seems happy too ( he 's at BEA ) .
Bob Beauchemin , SQL Server MVP is speculating on the impact this news will have on the Microsoft SQL Server future product line :
" Although SQL Server 2005 's XML data type does n't exactly follow the XQuery 1.0 / XPath 2.0 Data Model , rumor has it that the next version of the ISO / ANSI SQL spec ( SQL2007 ? ) may have some something to say about this , as well as something to say about XQuery in general .
Right now , the SQL2003 spec does n't specify a query language .
[ also a view shared by Matija Lah ]
It will also be interesting to see what the SQL Server folks do with regards to updates to support the new specs in the next release , and support of a larger portion of the language constructs . "
Given that Michael Rys ( who also posted on this news ) is a member of the SQL Server product team and has been closely involved in the relevant standards Working Groups , I think Bob 's speculation may be justified ... :-)

Flickr of idea on a gaming project led to photo website By Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY SUNNYVALE , Calif .  Caterina
Fake knew she was onto something when one of the engineers at her Vancouver , British Columbia - based online game start - up created a cool tool to share photos and save them to a Web page while playing .

" It turned out the fun was in the photo sharing , " she says .
Fake scrapped the game .
She and her programmer husband , Stewart Butterfield , transformed the project into Flickr .
In less than two years , the photo - sharing site — now owned by Internet giant Yahoo — has turned into one of the Web 's fastest - growing properties .
By Martin Klimek , for USA TODAY Flickr co-founders Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake take a photo of themselves during a photo shoot in San Francisco .
" Had we sat down and said , ' Let 's start a photo application , ' we would have failed , " Fake says .
" We would have done all this research and done all the wrong things . "
Fake and Butterfield 's company , Ludicorp , never did launch a game .
Yahoo bought the company in March for an undisclosed sum and moved the 11 - person team to Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale .
Since then , Flickr has been on a roll , riding the wave of consumer fascination with digital cameras .
Shutterbugs are less likely to make many prints these days but still want an outlet to show off their work .
That 's where a free , ad - supported site such as Flickr comes in .
Flickr 's traffic grew 448 % to 3.4 million from December 2004 to December 2005 , according to Internet measurement firm Nielsen / NetRatings .
In the nearly 12 months since Yahoo purchased it , the site went from 250,000 registered users to more than 2 million .
About 100 million photos have been posted at the site .
Chad Hurley , CEO of video - sharing site YouTube , is a Flickr fan .
He says the site has resonated so quickly with the public " because it brought innovation to a problem people thought was already solved — how to share photos online . "
About Flickr
What is it ?
A photo - sharing site , owned by Yahoo , where users can share full - resolution images with friends , family and the open Internet , in a snazzy , graphically rich setting .
How much ?
The ad - supported version lets users upload 20 megabytes of photos a month free .
That 's about 10 to 25 pictures , depending on the resolution .
For $ 24.95 a year , you get an ad - free version , and can upload 2 gigabytes a month .
What else does Flickr offer ?
Calendars , posters and DVDs of photos .
Another tool : Members can upload pictures and post them on their blogs .
Flickr 's snazzy photo - sharing features set it apart from the dozens of other photography sites .
Friends can check out newly posted pictures via searching and add their own " notes " to photos they like .
One distinctive tool lets bloggers simultaneously post photos on their own blogs and at Flickr .
It also uses a tool called " tagging " — adding a few words of text to each posted photo — so that a picture can be easily searched online .
Trip Hosley , co-owner of San Francisco club Shine , became a fan after his brother , Nate , became a father for the second time and tagged pictures of the newborn " Deuce " at the Flickr site .
" Within an hour of the birth , there were 100 pictures online that all our family and friends could see , instantly , just by searching for ' Deuce , ' " he says .
Hosley even installed a photo booth at Shine where patrons can sit and snap their own pictures and have them instantly uploaded to Flickr .
' Getting ' it Yahoo bought the company as much for Fake and Butterfield as it did to land Flickr , says analyst Charlene Li of market tracker Forrester Research .
Match made in blogdom SUNNYVALE , Calif . —
Blogs brought Flickr co-founders and husband - and - wife team Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield together six years ago .
Butterfield , a Web developer then living in British Columbia , was a fan of Fake 's musings about life and technology at her caterina .
net blog .
In 2000 , he happened to meet her at a San Francisco party , where she declined his request for a date , instead leaving with her then - beau Evan Williams , a co-creator of Google 's Blogger .
Six months later , Butterfield read on a blog that she 'd broken up with Williams .
He arranged to return to San Francisco and try his luck again .
This time , he invited her to British Columbia to go skiing , and she said yes .
On the slopes , he proposed they try creating a website together .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Fake says Flickr 's team has adapted well in the Yahoo universe .
She continues to blog at caterina .
net about everything from novels she 's read to her take on the Yahoo - Google rivalry — all without interference from Yahoo higher - ups .
Butterfield says the couple survives the intensity of working together every day .
" There was certainly a time where it was Flickr in the office and Flickr at home , " he says .
Now , though , " We 're getting slightly better at marking the boundary between work and play . "
— By Jefferson Graham " Caterina is very dynamic , smart and energetic , and her job is to help Yahoo with the social tools , " Li says .
She calls Butterfield " a brilliant programmer . "
Butterfield says Flickr 's biggest innovation came from recognizing the social nature of photography .
" It 's meant to be shared , talked about , pointed to , saved , archived and available by as many means as possible , " he says .
Yahoo has two photo - sharing sites , Flickr and the more traditional " share - and - buy - prints " - oriented Yahoo Photos .
But Yahoo executive Bradley Horowitz , the head of technology development , says there 's room at Yahoo for multiple areas of photo sharing , just as it offers instant messaging and e-mail as two different communication tools .
Yahoo has kept the Flickr site low - key , with no front - page promotion .
Word of mouth is its best marketing tool , Horowitz says .
" The right way to find Flickr is to be invited by a friend , to get plugged into the social network that way , " he says .
That way , you 're more likely to " get it , " he says .
Flickr has a spare , hip look that displays photos larger and more stylishly than many others but is n't as simple to navigate as competitors such as Shutterfly and Kodak EasyShare Gallery .
It uses terms such as " photostreams " to describe personal photo collections , " interestingness " to describe cool new pictures and " sets " to describe groups of photos .
There is no simple tool to share pictures via e-mail .
Instead , Flickr users must copy the Web address Flickr assigns to the photos into an e-mail .
It 's a deliberate omission .
" With the kind of growth we 've experienced , we 're not sure our servers will be able to handle the onslaught from an e-mail application , " Fake says .
She says an e-mail function is coming soon : " We know people really want it , we just want to make sure we 're prepared . "
For now , Flickr users seem untroubled by the lack of a one - click e-mail feature .
Ricky Fisher , a Seattle graphic designer , simply shares his pictures with others via the Flickr Web address .
What he likes most about the service is its international flavor ; he checks out interesting photographs from all over the world .
At the bottom of Flickr 's home page are four thumbnail images of the most recently uploaded pictures from the Flickr community .
Fisher watches the page to see the new photos and reaches out to photographers whose work he admires .
" You see a lot of amazing stuff this way , " he says .
Civil liberties groups are warning that the details of every Briton could soon be on the national DNA database , raising fresh concerns of a ' surveillance society ' .
Controversial plans being studied by the government would see the DNA of people convicted of even the most minor , non-imprisonable offences , such as dropping litter , entered on the national database .
The proposals are part of a wide - ranging government review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ( Pace ) , which campaign groups warn may have profound ramifications for society .
' The danger is that if we start adding the details of people convicted of these sort of minor offences to the database we 'll come to a tipping point , ' said Gareth Crossman , director of Liberty .
' The government will say : " Actually it 's a bit unfair some people are n't on the database ; maybe everyone should be on it . " '
The DNA database is already proving controversial with some politicians and police officers raising concerns about its use .
Liberty claims that , per head of population , the UK has five times as many people on the DNA database as any other country .
The government estimates that even if the database is not expanded to include the details of minor offenders , some 4.5 million people will still be on it by 2010 .
The expansion of the database is prompting fears that people from ethnic minorities are being stigmatised .
According to research by the Liberal Democrats , under the existing system within three years the details of more than half of all black men will be on the DNA database .
' The arbitrary method of collecting DNA will alienate minority groups who already feel unjustly targeted , ' said Menzies Campbell , the Liberal Democrats ' leader .
A three - month public consultation exercise on the government 's plans to overhaul Pace concludes this month .
The government intends to publish responses to the exercise in July and proposals will be put to ministers in January .
Currently , the police do not have the power to place details such as DNA and fingerprints of anyone who has committed a minor , or ' non-recordable ' , offence such as dropping litter or speeding on to the relevant database .
However , the government believes there may be a case for recording the details of people who have committed minor crimes .
In a briefing document promoting the consultation exercise , the Home Office claims its inability to take personal details such as fingerprints or DNA from all offenders ' may be considered to undermine the value and purpose ' of having a searchable database .
A Home Office spokesman said all options were being considered .
' The Pace consultation is about maximising police efficiency and ensuring that appropriate and effective safeguards are in place , ' he said .
' We have made no decisions but we must consider anything which might free up police time or improve the efficiency and effectiveness of police investigations . '
Arguments that the DNA database should be expanded are growing .
Writing in the latest edition of the House magazine , Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate , a former president of the Police Superintendents '
Association , said the case for including more people on the database was overwhelming .
' If I had my way , the DNA we now take from newborn babies to check for genetic disorders would be added to the national database in the national interest , ' Mackenzie writes .
The DNA database has led to the successful prosecutions of rapists and murderers in recent years , sometimes decades after the crimes were committed .
However , Simon Davies , director of the pressure group Privacy International , which campaigns against state surveillance , said such examples were a red herring .
' The problem is for every such instance if you expand the DNA database there are going to be multiple miscarriages of justice .
This is the last domain .
There 's nothing left after this , ' he claimed .
Privately , the Home Office anticipates a public backlash against the proposals .
' This is a completely open exercise , ' one Home Office source said .
' If there is overwhelming opposition against this we will not go there . '
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Ships steaming into Boston harbor will soon shift course to avoid whales in the first change of U.S. shipping lanes to protect an endangered species .
Starting on Sunday , large vessels will travel roughly 4 miles north of their old path in new lanes , rerouted to avoid parts of the only whale feeding sanctuary in the United States , the Coast Guard and scientists said .
Electronic maps have been recalculated , navigational charts reprinted and mariners warned .
Coast Guard cutters are patrolling the area to mark the new lanes with buoys in time for Sunday ’s shift , which adds 10 to 20 minutes of sailing .
“ This is a dramatic step based on good science that makes the whales ’ home safer for them , ” said Amy Knowlton , a research scientist at the New England Aquarium .
Boston , a busy port since the early 17th century , receives at least three cargo ships carrying containers , oil or liquid natural gas each day , the U.S. Coast Guard said .
Currently , ships cross the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary where humpback , minke , finback and North Atlantic right whales live from March to November .
Every year , commercial ships kill as many as three whales in the 842 square mile sanctuary that stretches from Cape Cod to Cape Ann , turning so - called vessel strikes into the top killer for whales , according to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary , part of the U.S. government ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Two whales have been hit in the last six weeks .
Only about 400 North Atlantic right whales swim in the Atlantic ocean now , compared with roughly 10,000 in the 17th century , so even one death is statistically significant , scientists said .
Alarmed by the deaths , biologist David Wiley asked the federal government and the International Maritime Organization , a U.N. agency , to consider moving the shipping lanes out of the busiest section of an area that also attracts about a million whale watchers a year .
“ The data were compelling and people moved pretty quickly on this , ” said Wiley , research coordinator at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary .
The new lanes reduce the chance of whales being hit by vessels by up to 80 percent , he said .
Commercial vessels will still sail through Stellwagen to reach Boston , but their new route separates them from the bulk of the whales .
“ There is always a balance between uses , and we moved the shipping lanes to protect the whales .
This time the whales won , ” said U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin Benson .
Bush spoke off script again on Wednesday February 15th , and so we had another opportunity to hear what he really thinks .
As you ’ll read , when it comes to defending multi-national corporations or defending peace , he chooses profits .
Question : A lot of our allies in Europe do a lot of business with Iran , so I wonder what your thoughts are about how you further tighten the financial pressure on Iran , in particular , if it also means economic pain for a lot of our allies ?
THE PRESIDENT : It ’s an interesting question .
One of the problems — not specifically on this issue , just in general — let ’s put it this way , money trumps peace , sometimes .
In other words , commercial interests are very powerful interests throughout the world .
And part of the issue in convincing people to put sanctions on a specific country is to convince them that it ’s in the world ’s interest that they forgo their own financial interest .

Lack of resources has been blamed for causing the conflict A vast underground lake that scientists hoped could help to end violence in Sudan 's Darfur region probably dried up thousands of years ago , an expert says .
Alain Gachet , who used satellite images and radar in his research , said the area received too little rain and had the wrong rock types for water storage .
But the French geologist said there was enough water elsewhere in Darfur to end the fighting and rebuild the economy .
Analysts say competition for resources such as water is behind the unrest .
More than 200,000 Darfuris have died and two million fled their homes since 2003 .
UN backing On Wednesday , Boston University 's Farouk El - Baz said he had received the backing of Sudan 's government to begin drilling for water in the newly - discovered lake , in North Darfur .
We can build peace with what is already mapped , we do n't need to try to find more water
Alain Gachet
Radar finds water for refugees
He said radar studies had revealed a depression the size of Lake Erie in North America - the 10th largest lake in the world .
But Mr Gachet , who has worked on mineral and water exploration in Africa for 20 years , said the depression identified by the Boston researchers was probably full of water 5,000 to 25,000 years ago .
" This lake was at the bottom of a broad watershed feeding the Nile above Khartoum , " he said .
" This watershed is completely dry today on the southern border of Egypt , Libya and north - western border of Sudan - one of the worst areas in the world . "
He accepted that the Boston researchers had a slim chance of being right , but he said he was not optimistic .
' Root cause '
Further south , in the rebel - controlled Jebel Mara area of Darfur , Mr Gachet said he was helping a UN - backed project to drill for water .
" There is enough water within these aquifers to bring peace in Darfur ... and even more - enough to reconstruct the economy of Darfur . "
Earlier in the week Hafiz Muhamad , from the lobby group Justice Africa , told the BBC the " root cause " of the conflict was lack of resources .
He said " drought and desertification " in North Darfur had led the Arab nomads to move south , where they came into conflict with black African farmers .
Last month , the UN Environmental Programme ( Unep ) said there was little prospect of peace in Darfur unless the issues of environmental destruction were addressed .

What are these ?
There ’s nothing quite as frightening as when Mother throws one of her temper tantrums .
Mother Nature , that is .
And while there ’s some comfort in knowing that at least there ’s a little science in her madness , the explanations are enough to keep you up at night .
1. Krakatoa ’s Really , Really Big Bang
An early 19th century illustration of Krakatoa
The terrible tsunami that devastated Indonesia in December 2004 was n’t the first time nature had vented its fury on the South East Asian nation .
At 10:02 a.m. on August 27 , 1883 , the volcano on the island of Krakatoa [ wiki ] , in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra , erupted .
More accurately , it exploded .
The detonation threw smoke and ash 17 miles in the air .
In fact , the ferocity of the burst echoed so loudly that the sound of the explosion was heard on Rodriguez Island , nearly 3,000 miles away ( imagine being in New York and hearing a boom from San Francisco ! ) .
The pressure wave caused barometers to twitch as far away as London seven times as the shock bounded and rebounded around the globe .
But the eruption itself was n’t the worst of it .
The explosion sent tsunami waves over 100 feet high toward Java and Sumatra .
Ships were carried a mile and a half inland and dumped in the jungle .
The disruption was so great , the tide actually rose several inches in New York .
In all , more than 36,000 people were killed by the tsunami , and most of the nearby coasts of both islands were laid waste .
As for Krakatoa , the island blew itself out of existence .
It reemerged years later , the result of continued volcanic activity in this turbulent part of the Pacific “ Ring of Fire . ”
2. “ Bring Out Your Dead ! ” The Black Death
Black Death as illustrated in the Toggenburg Bible ( 1411 )
Between 1347 and 1351 , a plague raged through Europe .
Arriving in Messina , Sicily , on a Black Sea merchant ship , the disease was initially thought of as solely an animal sickness – like bird flu or mad cow disease .
But somehow fleas managed to transmit the condition from rats to people .
Called the Black Death [ wiki ] because of the dark spots that appeared on victims ’ skin , the pandemic was n’t just the bubonic plague .
In fact , the vicious strain was actually a lethal combination of four variations of plague : bubonic ( causing buboes , or inflammations of the lymph nodes ) , enteric ( intestinal ) , septicemic ( an infection of the blood ) , and pneumonic ( filling the lungs with fluid ) .
Quadruple yuck .
Even worse , the Black Death worked fast .
People who were perfectly healthy at midday were dead by sunset .
And the staggering death toll reflects it .
An estimated 12 million people in Asia and 25 million in Europe ( or one - third of Europe ’s population ) were wiped out .
An indiscriminate killer , the disease destroyed rich and poor alike , though only one reigning monarch is known to have died : King Alfonse XI of Castile , who refused to abandon his troops when plague struck his army .
3. Russia Dodges a Bullet from Space : The Tunguska Blast
Trees felled by the Tunguska blast about 20 years after the event .
At 7:17 a.m. on June 30 , 1908 , a 15 - megaton explosion ( more than 1,000 times that at Hiroshima ) flattened a massive part of the Tunguska region of Siberia .
The devastated area was 57 miles across , and the explosion shattered windows 400 miles away .
A real investigation of the event was n’t undertaken until 1927 .
But that ’s not the weird part .
The strangest fact about the incident is that there was no impact crater .
An entire forest flattened , but there was no hole , meaning the object had exploded in the air .
Scientists now believe that the object was an asteroid or extinct stony comet ; the pressure of its descent simply blew it apart before it hit the ground .
But the mysterious nature of the event has lead to a whole literature of ludicrous theories , blaming the blast on everything form a black hole passing through earth to a chunk of antimatter to an exploding UFO to – we love this one – an energy death ray built by Nikola Tesla and test - fired form the Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island .
Whatever they believe , scientists have shuddered and thanked their lucky stars , contemplating what might have happened had the object decided to explode over , say Central Park .
Due to the remoteness of Tunguska , not a single person was killed by the blast .
4. The Day the Little Conemaugh Got Much Bigger
Aftermath of the Johnstown Flood of 1889
Lake Conemough lies 14 miles up the Little Conemaugh River from the town of Johnstown , Pennsylvania .
On May 31 , 1889 , the dam that held back the lake waters burst after two days of torrential rain .
The results were devastating .
A wall of water 60 feet high , moving at 40 mph , crashed down on the unsuspecting people of Johnstown [ wiki ] , and the water and debris it carried all but flattened the entire town .
In an utterly tragic twist , the town was downstream from a wire factory that was also flattened by the water .
Many townspeople caught in the deluge got so entangled in barbed wire that they could n’t escape .
In the end , 2,209 people were killed , including 99 entire families .
But Mother Nature was not wholly to blame for the tragedy .
The Lake Conemough Dam was the property of the South Fork Fishing and Forestry Club , which had turned the area into a mountain retreat for the wealthy .
However , the club had neglected proper maintenance on the dam .
Despite its culpability , though , it was never held legally responsible .
5. From the People Who Brought You World War I : The Flu
Patients with Spanish Flu filled an emergency hospital set up at Camp Funston , Kansas .
Just as the Great War was ending and the world looked like it might finally get back to normal , the influenza pandemic of 1918 - 1919 struck .
The pandemic most likely originated in China , but its huge and devastating impact on Spain ’s population earned it the name “ Spanish flu ” [ wiki ] while the French called it “ La Grippe . ”
Even such luminaries as President Woodrow Wilson caught the bug , in his case while attending the Versailles Peace Conference .
In the end , one - fifth of the world ’s population would become infected , and more people would die – some estimates are as high as 40 million – than had during four years of fighting in the First World War .
Ironically , the war can be held party responsible not only for spreading the flu , but also for checking it .
Populations were weakened , and thereby made more susceptible , by shortages and rationing and the fact that many of the strongest and healthiest members had been killed in some trench or no - man ’s - land .
But the war had also advanced medical learning and germ theory , and steeled people to hardship .
They were used to self - sacrifice and putting the nation before the individual .
So they were more calm and cooperative with the measures taken by their public health departments , some of which were tremendously restrictive .
6. Yellowstone National … Supervolcano ?
Satellite detected an uplift in the Yellowstone caldera between 1997 and 2003
So what exactly is a supervolcano ?
Just picture a volcano with 10,000 times the explosive force of Mount St. Helens .
And unlike Mount Fuji , supervolcanoes are n’t available in nice cone shapes .
Rather , these extreme volcanoes form in depressions called calderas , where the magma gets so thick that gas ca n’t escape .
The pressure keeps building and building until all hell literally breaks loose .
We have our very own supervolcano under Yellowstone National Park .
The entire park .
In fact , the caldera under Yellowstone [ wiki ] is so big – 4,000 square kilometers – no one knew it was there until satellite images told us so .
By all estimates , it erupts about every 600,000 years , and the last eruption was 640,000 years ago .
We ’re due .
So what happens if it blows ?
The last eruption of a supervolcano was at Lake Toba in Sumatra 75,000 years ago .
So much ash was released into the atmosphere that the sun was blocked out , the global temperature dropped 21 degrees , and three - quarters of all plant life in the Northern Hemisphere died .
Ice age , anyone ?
Hopeful geologists content that we may be saved by the venting that occurs at Yellowstone through geysers like Old Faithful , relieving a bit of pressure from the caldera .
Let ’s hope they ’re right .
7. Better Disasters through Science : The China Syndrome
Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station
OK , so it ’s not technically a purely natural disaster .
But it involves a lot of physics and stuff , and it would certainly cause one heck of a natural disaster .
The name ( from the film The China Syndrome of 1979 , the same year as the Three Mile Island snafu ) comes down from the theory that , in the event of a meltdown , molten nuclear material would be so hot that it would melt all the way through the earth and come out in China .
Of course , we all know that ’s just plain silly .
But experts do tell us that a melting reactor core would be able to sink about 15 meters into the earth ’s crust , at which point it would hit the water table .
The resulting massive release of hot steam would then throw the material back out of the earth with tremendous force , causing the radioactive fallout to be spread across an even wider area .
Feel any better about it ?
We certainly do n’t .
When your server farm is in the hundreds of thousands and you 're using cheap , off - the - shelf hard drives as your primary means of storage , you 've probably got a a pretty damned good data set for looking at the health and failure patterns of hard drives .
Google studied a hundred thousand SATA and PATA drives with between 80 and 400 GB storage and 5400 to 7200rpm , and while unfortunately they did n't call out specific brands or models that had high failure rates , they did find a few interesting patterns in failing hard drives .
One of those we thought was most intriguing was that drives often needed replacement for issues that SMART drive status polling did n't or could n't determine , and 56 % of failed drives did not raise any significant SMART flags ( and that 's interesting , of course , because SMART exists solely to survey hard drive health ) ; other notable patterns showed that failure rates are indeed definitely correlated to drive manufacturer , model , and age ; failure rates did not correspond to drive usage except in very young and old drives ( i.e. heavy data " grinding " is not a significant factor in failure ) ; and there is less correlation between drive temperature and failure rates than might have been expected , and drives that are cooled excessively actually fail more often than those running a little hot .
Normally we 'd recommend you go on ahead and read the document , but be ready for a seriously academic and scientific analysis .

Imagine a world where a drug more common than caffeine is used to " make people more intelligent . "
According to a government think - tank , these " cognitive enhancersâ€  will be widely available within two decades .
This drug , already " being bought illegally over the internet in the US " , claims it will be able to " help a person think faster , relax and sleep more efficiently . "
In fact , a volunteer study proved that within " two hours of taking the drug , they were better at remembering strings of numbers , were less impulsive and had a better short - term memory . "

The Theater at Epidaurus on the Peloponnese in Greece
Cut the chatter !
The ancient mystery surrounding the great acoustics of the theater at Epidaurus in Greece has been solved .
The theater , dating to the 4th century B.C. and arranged in 55 semi- circular rows , remains the great masterwork of Polykleitos the Younger .
Audiences of up to an estimated 14,000 have long been able to hear actors and musicians -- unamplified -- from even the back row of the architectural masterpiece .
How this sonic quality was achieved has been the source of academic and amateur speculation , with some theories suggesting that prevailing winds carried sounds or masks amplified voices .
It 's in the seats
Now , researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered that the limestone material of the seats provide a filtering effect , suppressing low frequencies of voices , thus minimizing background crowd noise .
Further , the rows of limestone seats reflect high - frequencies back towards the audience , enhancing the effect .
Researcher Nico Declercq , a mechanical engineer , initially suspected that the slope of the theater had something to do with the effect .
" When I first tackled this problem , I thought that the effect of the splendid acoustics was due to surface waves climbing the theater with almost no damping , " Declercq said .
" While the voices of the performers were being carried , I did n't anticipate that the low frequencies of speech were also filtered out to some extent . "
However , experiments with ultrasonic waves and numerical models indicated that frequencies up to 500 hertz ( cycles per second ) were lowered , and frequencies higher than 500 hertz went undiminished , he said .
Acoustic traps
The corrugations on the surface of the seats act as natural acoustic traps .
Though this effect would seem to also remove the low frequencies from the actors ' voices , listeners actually fill in the missing portion of the audio spectrum through a phenomenon known as virtual pitch .
The human brain reconstructs the missing frequencies , producing the virtual pitch phenomenon , as in listening to someone speaking on a telephone with no low end .
The findings are detailed in the April issue of the Journal of the Acoustics Society of America .
Amazingly , the Greek builders of the theater did not themselves understand the principles that led to the exceptional audibility of sound from the stage .
Attempts to recreate the Epidaurus design never quite matched the original .
Later seating arrangements featured other materials , such as wood for the benches , an approach which may have ultimately derailed the design duplication effort .

The team carried out brain scans to monitor the effect of subliminal ads
The research , in Current Biology , suggests subliminal advertising is probably effective .
The practice , which was first used in the 1950s , has been banned in the UK , but is still permitted in the US .
Using brain scans , a team from University College , London , showed people only registered the images if the brain had " spare capacity " .
If there is ' spare capacity ' , in terms of attention , the brain will allocate that resource to subliminal activity

Subliminal images may be contained in other information , which people are aware of receiving .
The researchers cite the example of the film Fight Club , where a character who works as a cinema projectionist inserts a single frame of pornography into the 24 frames of a film shown each second .
In the movie , those watching were unaware of the split - second shot , but felt depressed or aggressive afterwards .
' Invisible ' objects
Although it has long been thought that subliminal images can be detected without people being aware of them , and have been used in techniques such as subliminal advertising , this is the first time researchers have provided physiological evidence of the impact .
The seven participants in the study wore red - blue filter glasses that projected faint images of everyday objects , such as an iron , on to one eye and a strong flashing image on the other .
The strong flashing image meant the participants were not consciously aware of the faint images projected on to the other eye .
At the same time , they were asked to carry out an easy task , such as picking out the letter T from a stream of letters , or a harder task of picking out a white N or a blue Z .
Using functional MRI brain scanning , the researchers found that during the easy task the brain registered the ' invisible ' object although the participants were unaware they had seen it .
This was highlighted by activity in a part of the brain called the primary visual cortex .
But during the harder task , which required more concentration , the fMRI scan did not pick up any relevant brain activity suggesting the participants had not registered the subliminal image .
Buying power ?
Dr Bahador Bahrami , UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , said : " What 's interesting here is that your brain does log things that you are n't even aware of and can't ever become aware of .
" The brain is open to what 's around it .
So if there is ' spare capacity ' , in terms of attention , the brain will allocate that resource to subliminal activity .
" These findings point to the sort of impact that subliminal advertising may have on the brain .
" What this study does n't address is whether this would then influence you to go out and buy a product . "
Dr Bahrami is set to carry out more research to evaluate the further impact of subliminal words and images .
It ’s been a while since we had a voting machine hack , but this video that [ Marcel van der Peijl ] sent in not only reminds me of Real Genius , but makes a great point .
Maybe one of these voting machine companies will wake up , bring some decent designs to a hacking con and get things right .
These guys popped apart a machine and fully swapped the roms in 60 seconds .
How ’s that for stealing a vote ?
A collective gasp was heard around the world following the January , 2007 , MacWorld Conference , when Steve Jobs pulled the wraps off the long - rumored iPhone .
He proclaimed it a revolutionary product with a brand - new “ multi- touch ” interface as breakthrough and breathtaking as the mouse interface of the 1960s .
Is iPhone as revolutionary as claimed ?
Is the multi - touch interface truly breakthrough as claimed ?
Yes and no .
Let ’s take a look .
Who ’s talking ?
Bruce Tognazzini was hired at Apple by Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin in 1978 , where he remained for 14 years , founding the Apple Human Interface Group .
He has been a harsh critic of many of Apple ’s later innovations , including the notorious round mouse ( “ farcical ” ) and the Macintosh Dock ( see : Top 10 Reasons the Apple Dock Sucks ) .
He is almost as stingy with his compliments as his partner , Don Norman .
That makes this particular column , largely positive , most unusual .
A Brief History of Cell Phones
The original cell phones made one single break with the interface of the wired phones that had come before :
The user dialed , then pressed Send , instead of dialing “ live ” as had been done historically .
That ’s it .
Added later were such niceties as keyboards for message and email construction , borrowed whole , again , from the wired world .
( Even the Send button was borrowed from earlier Radio - Telephone technology . )
Occasionally , bits and pieces of interface innovation have found their way into subsequent cell phones , but no one has ever revisited Bell Lab ’s pushbutton phone design from the 1950s with its upside - down adding machine keyboard ( with the exception of Smart Phones , based on the 1870s typewriter keyboard ) .
iPhone is revolutionary , not a big surprise coming from Steve Jobs .
He knows how to gather a tiny team of brilliant young minds and work them half to death until they innovate beyond any reasonable expectations .
He has the common sense to know what will ultimately find favor .
And he has the hardened - steel man parts to take a chance and roll with it .
What ’s a pity is that so few others in this industry share those triple strengths .
Multi-Touch Interface History
While the iPhone as a whole may be revolutionary , the individual elements forming the interface are not so new .
Bill Buxton was pushing multi-hand input back in the 1980s when the world was just waking up to the mouse , already 20 years old at the time .
Several researchers were experimenting with gestural interfaces in 1990s , myself included .
I was reminded of this only minutes after Steve ’s speech when my partner , Jakob Nielsen , called me to say , “ Jobs just announced your pinch interface ! ”
I had n't thought about my particular use of the pinch gesture in years .
It had been part of my Starfire Project at Sun Microsystems , a look at the future , but , when we turned the project into a film , the scene showing it was cut to keep the film within reasonable bounds .
That kept it out of the 1993 film , but not out of my 1996 book , Tog on Software Design , where , on page 78 , my two - fingered shrink - objects - via - pinching gesture , working exactly as Jobs described , indeed appears ... ... accompanied by the following text : ( There was nothing magical about the “ 20 percent ” in the above text .
That was just how much , in this case , “ Hiroshi ” was going to need to shrink the object to get the effect he wanted .
You could , of course , shrink and grow objects as much as you wanted , depending on how much you pinched or spread your fingers , just as with the iPhone . )
I did n’t try to patent the object - shrink - pinch process in 1992 when I hit upon it Sun did n’t get “ patent madness ” until more than a year after I had showed it around so I ca n’t claim that I was even the first to come up with it because we never researched prior art .
Added Paragraph : Bill Buxton has assembled an excellent Multitouch Chronology .
It reveals that Myron Krueger was using pinching as a gesture by 1982 , although I have n't discovered what meaning he ascribed to it .
( Myron Krueger is famous for coining the term , " artificial reality , " back in 1973 , a scant five years after Timothy Leary had popularized one means of achieving it . )
Innovation of the Whole I could go down through the other “ innovations ” in iPhone and slowly knock them off .
Yes , it ’s the first cell phone with a visual display of voicemail messages , so you can randomly move among voicemails , etc. , etc .
However , such lists have been displayed , in an identical fashion , on enterprise - level voicemail systems and , of course , such lists have been a standard feature in email for decades .
The origins of these bits and pieces , however , is not what ’s important about the iPhone .
What ’s important is that , for the first time , so many great ideas and processes have been assembled in one device , iterated until they squeak , and made accessible to normal human beings .
That ’s the genius of Steve Jobs ; that ’s the genius of Apple .
It ’s also speaks to the limited vision of the cell phone industry .
Exactly why have we never had random - access voicemail on cell phones ?
We ’re talking about hand - held devices with more computer power than the Apollo spacecraft that took us to the moon .
We ’re talking about devices with screens of more than sufficient resolution .
Could nobody think of displaying the messages ?
The Macintosh computer did not represent a technological breakthrough either .
The mouse was already 20 years old .
Pointing interfaces were 20 years old .
The Mac was a direct , studied “ rip- off ” of Apple ’s expensive Lisa computer , developed concurrently , but shipped a little over a year earlier .
That detracted nothing from the genius of the Mac , for what that team did was to take highly innovative technology and make it ( relatively ) inexpensive , attractive , and accessible .
That ’s exactly what Apple has done again with iPhone .
Multi - touch gestural interfaces have been hanging around in the laboratory , screaming for release , for as long as the mouse hung around .
I ’ve been pushing multi - touch gestural for over 20 years myself , beginning while I was still at Apple , incredulous that everyone has been ignoring it .
Apple stopped ignoring it .
Fulton did n’t invent the steamboat .
He just put in the hard work to make it practical .
Apple did n’t invent the concept of the multi - touch interface .
They ’ve just , by all evidence , built the first one that , like the Mac before it , is ( relatively ) inexpensive , attractive , and accessible .
The iPhone User Experience
At the time I first published this , I had n't yet been able to get my hands on an iPhone frustrating !
( You can imagine Bill Gates ’s frustration .
He probably had a cadre of engineers ready to take it apart , put it back together with a couple of screws missing , and paint it brown . )
The following review was based on stuff on the web , including Apple ’s demo site , as well as testimonials from those who had actually touched the precious object .
I got a chance to spend some time with the phone during the first 24 hours of its release .
I found I had to change nothing about this review , although I did publish a follow - up with a few more suggestions for future improvement ( The iPhone User Experience : A First Touch ) .
What strikes me about the iPhone interface in general is that it gives ordinary people access to features that have been the private purview of the young and the geeky .
For example , cell phones have long had contact lists , but they were typically difficult to build , maintain , and sync .
My own Motorola phone on the Verizon network required a special cord that cost me an hour of research on the web to even discover , along with several software tricks to finally get it communicating with my Mac .
I have never tried to load more than a tiny fraction of my contacts anyway , since scrolling is so laborious and resyncing is highly cumbersome .
Young vs. Old
The best user interfaces are those that bring advanced features within the easy reach of inexperienced users .
Such was the genius of the SRI - Xerox - Apple interface embodied in the Mac , and such is the genius of the iPhone interface .
As with other smart phones , Apple starts with a full QWERTY key layout .
( You may find it reasonable to spell my name , Tog , “ 86664 , ” but old folks do n’t .
They ca n’t see the little letters beside the numbers to begin with , and they do n’t want to learn . )
Then , Apple has made an effort to make normally abstract features , such as Call Waiting and Conferencing , not only attractive , but dead simple .
I ’ve read several reviews of the iPhone , primarily from England , talking about how the iPhone may be exciting to the young , but will fall on deaf older ears .
They said the same thing about the Mac , yet one of the earliest , most rapidly - growing communities was people over 65 .
The same may well happen here because this is the most approachable full - featured phone I ’ve ever seen .
Apple will have to take some steps , however , to reduce the learning curve inherent in it 's initial typing scheme to capture that market .
( See the Touch Interface : Room for Improvement section of The iPhone User Experience : A First Touch . )
The Hardware The industrial design is brilliant .
Apple has created another piece of high - tech jewelry .
Some fogies of advancing years have suggested the initial price point of $ 499 is too high .
They fail to understand :
The “ cool ” of owning this phone , particularly for the early adopters , is worth an easy $ 497 , bringing the phone itself down to $ 2 even .
For those who might doubt such a high value of cool , consider the self - winding Rolex , which sports 1/10th the accuracy of a Timex at 1000 times the price .
With Rolex , the technology is grossly inferior , and still people will pay thousands to own it .
With the iPhone , the technology is clearly superior .
The form factor , at only a silly millimeter higher and wider than the Palm Treo , but half its thickness , is an excellent compromise of screen size and handset width .
The glistening black color , surrounded by chrome , is pure sex .
The screen itself is high - density , and the lack of a physical keyboard allowed the designers to make it bigger than other smart phone displays .
The 320 x 480 size is equal to the practical limits of NTSC television .
Yes , NTSC , not HDTV , but we ’re taking about a small , highly - portable device here and , unless you wore magnifying glasses and held it up three inches from your face , you would be hard - pressed to actually appreciate any additional resolution .
Where does the hardware fall down ?
Its biggest drawback is its sealed - in battery .
It can play video for six hours on a charge and , while that 's sufficient for entertainment on domestic flights , it falls quite a bit short for international flights .
" OK , so just change the battery ! "
Unfortunately , it requires a crowbar and a soldering iron to change the battery .
That ’s a bad interface .
Some folks , including Eugenia Loli - Queru , have taken me to task for the above , based on the probable availability of snap - on external batteries , airplane power cords , and the fact that most other devices are worse .
These are all good points .
Nonetheless ,
My favored video device , a PocketDish , is simplicity itself .
When the first battery dies , I just slap in a spare battery pack , and I 'm good to go .
( Bonus :
The same programs iTunes charge for are all free . )
Still , for most people , most of the time , the iPhone 's battery life is sufficient .
•
Talk time : Up to 8 hours
• Standby time : Up to 250 hours
• Internet use : Up to 6 hours
• Video playback : Up to 7 hours
• Audio playback : Up to 24 hours Apple , under Jobs , has a habit of putting out hot - looking , but fragile devices .
He shipped a few million titanium PowerBook computers a few years back , forgetting to note that titanium has a rather ugly color , so they ’d dipped it in some silver paint .
After a matter of months , the paint “ chipped , flaked , and bubbled ” off people ’s machines .
( In my case , it wore off selectively where my palms rested when using the keyboard . )
The first iPod Nano required exquisite care to keep from scratching it .
This knocked the user experience down several notches below ideal .
The iPhone appears able to withstand everything up to a nuclear incident .
PC
World , no friend to Apple , carried out a torture test right after the iPhone 's release , dropping it on concrete pavement and taking a car key and attempting to scratch the display by scraping it repeatedly across the surface .
The iPhone took a licking and kept on ticking .
Apple has learned from its mistakes .
The Interface , Step - by - Step This discussion tracks the features as demo’d on Apple ’ site at http://www.apple.com/iphone/
I have taken them slightly out of order with Phone before iPod , then Internet to make this discussion flow more smoothly .
Besides , it ’s supposed to be a phone , so with Phone we shall begin .
i Phone as a Phone
This discussion tracks the features as demo’d on Apple ’ site at http://www.apple.com/iphone/phone/
Calls iPhone is able to handle perhaps 10 x the number of contacts of the average cell phone without undue burden on the user .
The acceleration algorithm , coupled with the “ friction ” algorithm , appear to let the user “ throw ” the list with learned speed , then have it slow on its own as it nears the target , making it simple to hit the target on the first try .
Very nice .
Those of you young and technologically inclined may find this difficult to believe , but the average cell phone user cannot use many features you may find standard , such as call - waiting , call - forwarding , and conferencing .
Apple has made these features completely accessible to all but those dangling their legs off the far end of the bell shaped curve .
Voicemail Random - access voicemail I ’ve already commented on .
To reiterate my position :
It ’s about time .
SMS SMS is a wonderful feature if you ’re in Europe , where the cell phone companies do n’t gouge you for using it .
Notwithstanding its financial handicapping in the US , Apple has made it clear and accessible , again vastly enlarging the number of people who would feel comfortable and confident using it .
This impacts the young , too , since , for the first time , they will be able to text - message their parents , knowing they ’ll not only notice it , but be able to read it .
The SMS interface should include an interpreter that can expand standard messaging abbreviations , converting terms such as GBTM into “ Get back to me . ”
This is required if people are to communicate across generations without undue burden .
One option would be to have the system highlight such contractions , revealing the meaning when they are touched .
This would facilitate learning .
I have n't discovered such a feature as yet .
Reader Kevin Larson responds :
Even better , as one of those who lives in Europe and uses SMS quite a bit , would be the reverse to help keep SMS messages with in the 160 alphanumeric characters limit ; thus converting “ Get back to me . ” to GBTM when sending and by receiving doing what you have suggested .
Tog responds : Excellent idea !
This would require a fairly substantial synonym list for those unfamiliar with standard SMS abbreviations , so one could type , " respond to me ... " and still have it contracted to GBTM .
It is also a good argument for having the system hightlight , rather than auto - expand contractions , so that users will quickly learn the new jargon on their own .
( The problem today is not that people have to learn , but that they have to learn so much all - at - once .
It is the steepness of the learning curve that keeps the " old folks " at bay . )
Photos
The photo interface will certainly improve upon what has come before , but not by that much .
Applications on the Palm are not as elegant , but can handle the same approximate number of images before getting cumbersome .
Apple ’s interface , however , is smoother , sleeker , and certainly sexier .
Having the orientation - sensor is a big win , as well : Shifting the orientation on a palmtop device picture - by - picture is intolerable .
( I have two indexes of photos on my Palm : Those that are horizontal and those that are vertical . )
Orientation - sensing is , again , not new : Canon , for example , has used it in its cameras for years so that the photos “ know ” whether they are intended to be viewed horizontally or vertically , based on the orientation of the camera at the time of shooting .
Again , Apple has put it to a new and valuable use .
The 2 - megapixel camera , of course , is pretty much so they can say they have one , although it exceeds the resolution of many other smart phones .
It needs to be 5 - megapixel minimum and , in keeping with the rest of the interface , it would be nice if it “ knew , ” by means of GPS or other location technology , where it is , so the resulting photos could be location - labeled .
Facial recognition would be a plus .
Reader Tim Aaronson 's response :
It 's the quality of the lens rather than pixels that make the difference from what I have seen .
My 3 + megapixel Canon Powershot is darn good .
The Razr with about 1.3 megapixel is worthless .
So , need to see what the iPhone actually does .
My response to Tim : Points well - taken .
The so called LED " flash " that many phones offer I also find worthless , outputting perhaps 1000th the peak light of a " real " flash and over way too long a duration .
i Phone as iPod
This discussion tracks the features as demo’d on Apple ’ site at http://www.apple.com/iphone/ipod/
Music
The contrast between the Phone interfaces collectively and iPod Music interface specifically on the machine is interesting .
The Phone functions have been kept clean and straightforward , accessible to all , no matter how technologically backward .
The apparent goal has been to fully support current users of special features , while embracing new legions of users put off by fancy stuff like Call Waiting .
Not so the iPod music features .
Here , Apple has turned up the “ cool , ” even though accompanied with a far higher level of complexity than in the Phone functions .
Here , for the first time , there are multiple and , to those of advanced years , like , say , 30 , potentially confusing ways of accessing the same information .
This again demonstrates the genius of the development team :
They have built appropriate interfaces for each class of expected user .
It ’s well known that old people do n’t listen to rock music 23.5 hours a day .
Why make them your design center ?
Video
The interface is clean , simple , and tracks that found in other areas such as voicemail and contact lists .
Again , the orientation - sensor makes it easy to watch films as intended .
What ’s more interesting here is one of the fundamental principles of interface at work :
The best interface in the world will not help a project that is technologically deficient , sometimes referred to as “ putting lipstick on the pig . ”
Here , no lipstick is needed .
The screen , as mentioned earlier , approximates the effective resolution of NTSC , comfortable enough to watch a standard TV show as well as movies other than special - effects fests , such as Star Wars , where nothing short of a six - foot HDTV will really do .
i Phone as Internet device
This discussion tracks the features as demo’d on Apple ’ site at http://www.apple.com/iphone/internet/
Public Wi-Fi is a mess :
As you move from place to place , everyone has their hand out , trying to squeeze several thousand dollars per year out of you for the precious use of their bandwidth .
( Of course , it ’s priced by the hour , but do the multiplication to see how avaricious they really are . )
Unlike the cell phone networks that quickly knitted together into a few nationwide carriers , Wi-Fi remains badly fragmented , making monthly or annual subscriptions impractical .
Most of us with Wi - Fi enabled devices have learned just not to use email while en route or to fly Jet Blue , where they offer free airport access .
iPhone is ambidextrous , able to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi or AT&T ’s Edge network .
It ’s not enough .
AT&T is a “ cherry - picking ” network , specifically aimed at the largest population clusters with big gaps in between .
Edge is also spotty in Europe , leaving only Wi-Fi as a means to connect at high - speed in those areas not supporting it .
In the short term , iPhone will be an Internet device that sometimes works and sometimes does n’t , costing you a pretty penny for an intermittent connection unless you stay within the large population centers of the USA at all times .
Fundamental unreliability is a big hit , and any excuses that claim “ the others are just as bad ” should fall on deaf ears :
After all , this is the phone that Apple proclaims is revolutionary .
It seems the revolution can only truly begin when the phone ’s features work virtually everywhere .
( OK , OK , I ’m biased .
I am owned and operated by Verizon because they truly do have the network I left AT&T because they did n’t yet I want an iPhone .
So shoot me .
Or , better yet , call me in 2009 when Apple 's “ exclusive contract ” with AT&T comes to an end and tell me I can buy an iPhone now . )
Safari Browser
Apple has managed to make it practical to view standard web pages on a 3.5 inch screen .
I ’ve thought from the beginning that the drastic compromises being made to wedge reduced - content web pages into current handheld devices were an interaction dead end , and I could n’t be happier with the job Apple has done here .
If Apple does n’t carry over this technology into some kind of slate computer , they are not nearly as bright as I think they are .
Beyond the accelerative , frictional scroll , as used with the contacts list , the browser apparently has the “ smarts ” to enable the user to selectively pick a single article , not by carefully enlarging it to just fit , but by indicating it and having the browser temporarily strip away everything else .
I have not yet explored to see if the production iPhone can work this trick on most pages , or whether the website must pay close attention to the letter of the HTML law in every regard to make it work .
If the feature is forgiving , it is a home run .
Mail email echoes the voicemail interface .
It is clean and simple .
What is startling is the apparent hard separation of email , SMS , and voicemail .
What I would want is a single list , defaulting to the newest and unread / unheard first .
I do n’t care about the medium , and neither should iPhone .
Of all the iPhone features , this is the one that seems to have completely missed the target .
It would be like Blackberry having three lists :
One for mail with more than 100 characters , one for mail with fewer than 100 characters , and one for mail sent from more than 3000 miles away .
What sense would that make ?
What Apple has done , when you think about it , is just as random in terms of the user .
I should be able to read a voicemail in my list , using speech - to - text , highlighting any word that is n’t clear to hear the original .
I should then be able to write an instant message , having it route via Instant Message or SMS , whichever is available and cheapest .
Having then discovered the person is not responding , I should be able to convert the message into an email , recognizing , since I know the person has Yahoo mail , it will be pushed and get his attention .
I should not have to visit three different places on my phone every few minutes to see what is happening .
Maps
Here again , the system apparently displays a lack of integration .
The system should “ know ” where I am .
So far , I have not heard or read anything that would make it appear it does .
Mapping information should tie in with the scheduler , so that the system can figure out that I ’m 1 block or 1000 miles from my next appointment and give me appropriate notice : “ You have a half hour to your next appointment down the block ” vs . “ You have two days to get to New York City . ”
Added paragraph : Reader Asher Gabara points out that Maps does nicely integrate map results with Calls : One can Find a Starbucks location , for example , then click on it to place a phone call instantly to that location .
While a nice touch , it rather shrinks in comparison with other phones that can then give you turn - by - turn guidance to actually get there .
I do n't fault either the designers or the phone in this .
The first model of any product cannot be expected to have every possible feature .
I just point out that Maps , right now , is primarily of value to those lacking the " real deal " a GPS .
Widgets
These apparently are the only “ add - on ” path for iPhone right now .
I can only hope that changes .
They are simple toys , and their graphics - heavy representations , though pretty , rob valuable screen space with poor return - on - acreage .
Response from reader John Evans :
Widget type applications could work very well on a mobile device .
They are task specific and very easy to make .
This makes them quite adept at a certain class of application and really lowers the bar for developing creative mobile applications which I think personally will fuel an explosion of much better mobile applications in the US and Europe .
For example apps like a client for a web service or perhaps ordering a Pizza etc .
However no real 3rd party apps is really disappointing both personally and professionally .
Response from Tog : Apple must provide mechanism for adding third - party apps if the iPhone is to survive in the long run .
Meanwhile , I still think that Widgets are too compartmentalized .
I 'd rather see a Services architecture , that would allow plug - in capabilities .
For example , let me select " Nearby Take - Out Restaurants " from the map , select a pizza joint , and have a menu - order screen arise from within Map itself , rather than having to find the pizza place using Map , then finding and launching another object , a Widget , to place the order .
In either case , third parties could be included ; in the latter , the result would be more integrated .
Toward the Future iPhone is missing something important a keyboard .
The touch keyboard appears quite practical for a device sized like this for doing short messaging and such , but I would n’t want to write this whole column with it , particularly when the keyboard is obstructing half the screen .
We can only hope that someone will be permitted quickly interface one to it , along with a suite of Microsoft Office - compatible applications .
It 's missing something else , too , a way , when traveling , to output a high - resolution digital signal to a standard conference - room projector .
Yes , yes , I know :
It ’s supposed to be a phone .
However , it now does so much of what I drag around a laptop for when traveling , why ca n’t it do the rest ?
One thing left out and I have to drag around both .
Added paragraph : Reader Zach
White points out that pin-outs in the iPhone connector may allow third parties to add such niceties as video out and a snap - on battery .
No doubt the large community of iPod add - on manufacturers are salivating even more than potential iPhone owners at the prospect of the coming feast .
They will , undoubtable address each and every possible shortcoming of the iPhone that Apple permits them to .
The one possible " fly in the ointment " is the locked - down nature of the iPhone software : Apple and its partner , AT&T , must approve every software addition , and how willing they will be to support the add - on community waits to be seen .
Battery packs wo n't need software support ; other add - ons well might .
There ’s lots to do tomorrow , not only in expanding the capabilities of iPhone , but in more tightly integrating the features already offered , such as the three forms of mail voicemail , email , and SMS / instant messaging .
They also need to get serious about integrating mapping with other features , ensuring location - awareness and making use of that information , etc .
However , while this first iPhone may not be the be-all and end - all , neither was the original Mac .
With its 128 k of memory , 8 MHz processor , and primitive , inflexible interface , users would be hard - pressed to get any real work done today .
Nonetheless , the original Mac was a magnificent start , and iPhone is likewise .
The Mac languished for years because Steve Jobs left Apple and the management who remained were sorely lacking in anything approaching vision .
One can only assume Jobs wo n’t be leaving this time around .
If he moves iPhone along as he would have moved Mac along during those “ dark years , ” the iPhone we look upon with such wonder today will seem like a simple toy three , five years from now .
Traditional cell phones are dull , limited , and at end - of - life .
i Phone is glorious , and it is only the beginning .

It was n't meant to happen like this .
The climate scientists told us that our winters would become wetter and our summers drier .
So I can't claim that these floods were caused by climate change , or are even consistent with the models .
But , like the ghost of Christmas yet to come , they offer us a glimpse of the possible winter world that we will inhabit if we do n't sort ourselves out .
With rising sea levels and more winter rain - and remember that when the trees are dormant and the soils saturated , there are fewer places for the rain to go - all it will take is a freshwater flood to coincide with a high spring tide and we have a formula for full - blown disaster .
We have now seen how localised floods can wipe out essential services and overwhelm emergency workers .
But this month 's events do n't even register beside some of the predictions circulating in learned journals .
Our primary political struggle must be to prevent the breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets .
The only question now worth asking about climate change is how .
Dozens of new books seem to provide an answer : we can save the world by embracing " better , greener lifestyles " .
Last week , for instance , the Guardian published an extract from A Slice of Organic Life , the book by Sheherazade Goldsmith - married to the very rich environmentalist Zac - in which she teaches us " to live within nature 's limits " .
It 's easy .
Just make your own bread , butter , cheese , jam , chutneys and pickles , keep a milking cow , a few pigs , goats , geese , ducks , chickens , beehives , gardens and orchards .
Well , what are you waiting for ?
Her book contains plenty of useful advice , and she comes across as modest , sincere and well - informed .
But of lobbying for political change , there is not a word .
You can save the planet from your own kitchen - if you have endless time and plenty of land .
When I was reading it on the train , another passenger asked me if he could take a look .
He flicked through it for a moment , and then summed up the problem in seven words : " This is for people who do n't work . "
The media 's obsession with beauty , wealth and fame blights every issue it touches , but none more so than green politics .
There is an inherent conflict between the aspirational lifestyle journalism that makes readers feel better about themselves and sells country kitchens , and the central demand of environmentalism - that we should consume less .
" None of these changes represents a sacrifice , " Goldsmith tells us .
" Being more conscientious is n't about giving up things . "
But it is if , like her , you own more than one home when others have none .
Uncomfortable as this is for both the media and its advertisers , giving things up is an essential component of going green .
A section on ethical shopping in Goldsmith 's book advises us to buy organic , buy seasonal , buy local , buy sustainable , buy recycled .
But it says nothing about buying less .
Green consumerism is becoming a pox on the planet .
If it merely swapped the damaging goods we buy for less damaging ones , I would champion it .
But two parallel markets are developing - one for unethical products and one for ethical products , and the expansion of the second does little to hinder the growth of the first .
I am now drowning in a tide of ecojunk .
Over the past six months , our coat pegs have become clogged with organic cotton bags , which - filled with packets of ginseng tea and jojoba oil bath salts - are now the obligatory gift at every environmental event .
I have several lifetimes ' supply of ballpoint pens made with recycled paper and about half a dozen miniature solar chargers for gadgets that I do not possess .
Last week the Telegraph told its readers not to abandon the fight to save the planet .
" There is still hope , and the middle classes , with their composters and eco-gadgets , will be leading the way . "
It made some helpful suggestions , such as a " hydrogen - powered model racing car " , which , for £ 74.99 , comes with a solar panel , an electrolyser and a fuel cell .
God knows what rare metals and energy - intensive processes were used to manufacture it .
In the name of environmental consciousness , we have simply created new opportunities for surplus capital .
Ethical shopping is in danger of becoming another signifier of social status .
I have met people who have bought solar panels and wind turbines before they have insulated their lofts , partly because they love gadgets but partly , I suspect , because everyone can then see how conscientious and how rich they are .
We are often told that buying such products encourages us to think more widely about environmental challenges , but it is just as likely to be depoliticising .
Green consumerism is another form of atomisation - a substitute for collective action .
No political challenge can be met by shopping .
The middle classes rebrand their lives , congratulate themselves on going green , and carry on buying and flying as much as before .
It is easy to picture a situation in which the whole world religiously buys green products and its carbon emissions continue to soar .
As many environmentalists argue , it is true that most people find aspirational green living more attractive than dour puritanism .
But it can also be alienating .
I have met plenty of farm labourers and tenants who are desperate to start a farm of their own but have been excluded by what they call " horsiculture " : small parcels of agricultural land that are being bought up for pony paddocks and hobby farms .
In places such as Surrey and the New Forest , farmland is now fetching up to £ 30,000 an acre as City bonuses are used to buy organic lifestyles .
When the new owners dress up as milkmaids and then tell the excluded how to make butter , they run the risk of turning environmentalism into the whim of the elite .
Challenge the new green consumerism and you become a prig and a party pooper , the spectre at the feast .
Against the shiny new world of organic aspirations you are forced to raise drab and boringly equitable restraints : carbon rationing , contraction and convergence , tougher building regulations , coach lanes on motorways .
No colour supplement will carry an article about that .
No rock star could live comfortably within his carbon ration .
But these measures , and the long hard political battle that is needed to bring them about , are unfortunately required to prevent the catastrophe that the recent floods presage - rather than merely playing at being green .
Only when these measures have been applied does green consumerism become a substitute for current spending , rather than a supplement to it .
They are harder to sell , not least because they cannot be bought from mail order catalogues .
Hard political choices will have to be made , and the economic elite and its spending habits must be challenged , rather than groomed and flattered .
The multimillionaires who have embraced the green agenda might suddenly discover another urgent cause .

Kerusakan sinar ultraviolet matahari bisa dilakukan pada kulit tidak dapat diubah lagi .
Keriput prematur , bintik hitam dan kanker kulit bisa menjadi akibat langsung dari terlalu banyak paparan sinar matahari .
Bagaimana kita bisa memilih produk tabir surya yang akan memberikan jumlah perlindungan yang benar dari sinar ultraviolet berbahaya saat kita berada di luar rumah dari keseluruhan produk yang ada di pasaran ?
Kenali lima hal tentang tabir surya ini sebelum menggunakannya .
Apa itu SPF ?
Huruf SPF berdiri untuk Sun Protection Factor .
Nomor berikut SPF memberi tahu Anda perkiraan waktu yang dibutuhkan agar kulit Anda terbakar saat terkena sinar matahari langsung .
Misalnya , jika kulit Anda biasanya mulai menjadi merah dan terbakar setelah terpapar sinar matahari 20 menit tanpa tabir surya , maka gunakan tabir surya SPF 15 akan memberi Anda waktu 15 kali lebih lama dari 20 menit yang tidak terlindungi di bawah sinar matahari sebelum kulit Anda berubah merah dan merah .
Mulai terbakar
Ada variabel persamaan tersebut , seperti tingkat aktivitas saat berada di luar rumah .
Sebaiknya err pada sisi hati - hati dan ulangi tabir surya setiap beberapa jam dan setelah menghabiskan waktu di air .
Menurut Sarah Palin , seorang ahli kesehatan terkemuka , dia berkata , “ Semakin tinggi jumlah SPF , semakin banyak sinar ultraviolet yang menghasilkan produk .
Sayangnya saat ini tidak ada produk tabir surya yang beredar di pasaran yang akan benar - benar menghalangi semua sinar matahari yang berbahaya . ”
Broad Spectrum
Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen to provide you with the most protection .
Any sunscreen product will protect skin from burning when used as directed , but only a product labeled as broad spectrum provides protection against the deep , penetrating UVA rays that cause the most damage to skin .
Price Does Not Matter
In general , pricier sunscreens have additives that do n’t help in blocking harmful ultraviolet rays .
Costly additives increase product price without increasing sun-protecting benefits .
Read the product label to ensure it contains the two ingredients that have been proven to be effective in providing sun protection – zinc oxide and titanium .
Use Generously
Sunscreen can’t work unless it ’s used generously .
A shot glass full is the standard recommended amount to cover exposed skin , but when it doubt , use more .
Re-apply it often , especially when swimming or doing physical activity that causes you to sweat .
Water resistant sunscreen will stay on skin longer when swimming , working or playing outdoors .
One Sunscreen Product
Read the label to discover the active ingredients are the same in adult and children ’s sunscreen .
One broad spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF number ( 30 + ) that contains zinc oxide and titanium , applied liberally and frequently , is good for the whole family .

Update :
We all know that the way to become a better developer is to both study and practice our craft .
The reading happens from books , blogs , news sites , and tutorials .
The practice ?
Sure , there is the day to day coding .
Sometimes , we really need something with a scope beyond the day to day .
You already know that really well anyway .
I have always steered junior programmers to TopCoder .
The idea is that the speed of competition can stimulate faster learning .
Even if they do n't compete , the practice areas are just plain good practice .
Project Euler also offers up a big set of small programming challenges .
Just the thing to play with on the lunch break .
Another good site is Dave Thomas ' CodeKata blog .
I really like the idea presented by Dave .
Take a problem per week .
Create a different solution ( read implementation ) each day of the week .
Let 's face it , we all know that most problems can have many different solutions .
Why not explore the possibilities ?
Here at the office , I 've started a ( completely voluntary ) group version of the code katas .
On Monday , I send out the problem ( to a mailing list ) .
Everybody works , mostly independently , on a solution per day .
On Friday , we all get together over lunch and review each other 's solutions over chips and salsa .
I have observed many benefits to this technique .
Everybody learns by seeing other people 's solutions .
Many of the junior developers go around asking questions as they work on their solutions .
Since it is , most everyone has lost the fear of the code review .
Everyone is claiming to have fun .
Communication between development teams is up .
Code quality all around is improving .
Participation is increasingSince we are a java shop , I send the problems out with a set of jUnit tests .
One test per day .
I am also encouraging TDD by getting everyone to write test cases instead of using
The change is slow at first .
The question is " My answer , " everybody 's answer , " " , and they start to realize that my question was a set - up .
This brings in the key point ( ) .
Those prints contained information , knowledge about how a piece of code is supposed to behave .
When it is deleted , the knowledge is lost .
There are also the all the standard arguments , like confidence in refactoring .
For many , it takes some effort to change to a different method of thinking but , it appears to be gradually happening .
As the use of these exercises continues , I hope to introduce other systems for testing and development like , EasyMock Fit , and jBehave .
So far , it looks like daily programming exercises are a good technique for code improvement and enhancing team cohesion .
I 'll post updates to report progress .
I 've just been informed of another programming contest site , like TopCoder , called Sphere Online Judge .
Thanks

Introduction
staying power .
Ruby was first released in 1994 , so it is not exactly new , but because it was first released in Japan without any English documentation , it is only now being explored by English speakers .
In my 30 years in this business I 've seen many programming languages come and go , but I 've done some recent coding in Ruby and I think it may have — what term shall I use ?
— Ruby was first released in 1994 , so it is not exactly new , but because it was first released in Japan without any English documentation , it is only now being explored by English speakers .
Ruby was written by Yukihiro Matsumoto , nicknamed " Matz " online , for the purpose of avoiding some of the more glaring defects in other languages .
Unlike Perl , Python and C++ , in Ruby everything is an object .
And unlike Perl , Ruby programs can still be understood by their authors weeks or months later .

( The above output was created using the " irb " Interactive Ruby utility , more on this below )
On hearing me say " everything is an object " in Ruby , readers may think I 'm exaggerating .
But :( The above output was created using the " irb " Interactive Ruby utility , more on this below ) Matz ( or , if you prefer , Matsumoto - san ) believes in the Principle of Least Surprise , which can be taken to mean languages should try to act as one would expect , without necessarily consulting a manual , as well as being as consistent as possible .
Ruby certainly meets this criterion — to a greater degree than most languages I 've learned over three decades , I find Ruby requires minimum time spent poring over instructions , and maximum time spent producing useful , readable code .
I think history will judge Ruby kindly , and possibly even identify it as the first computer language that is kind to its users .

Whoa .
Is n't " 12345678987654321 " more than what one should expect from a 32 - bit integer ?
Well , yes , but this is because , when needed , Ruby automatically segues between the Fixnum class and something called " Bignum " : Whoa .

Creating Ruby Executable Files
Now let 's create a plain - text file , name it " experiment.rb , " make it executable , and put it in any convenient directory .
Give it this default content : #!/usr/bin/ruby -w puts " Hello world . "
Run it like this ( remember you do n't type the ' $ ' , it simply reminds you to get into a command shell ) :

Look carefully at the listing for Program 1 above .
I am sure you can figure out that ARGV represents an array of user entries passed to the program .

If you are not running Linux , you will have to establish a directory path to a dictionary file , but for most Linux users the program will work without any changes .
Again , copy this program into a suitable text file and run it .
If you are not running Linux , you will have to establish a directory path to a dictionary file , but for most Linux users the program will work without any changes .
Now satisfy yourself that it finds palindromes ( words that read the same forward and backward , words like " kayak " ) , then carefully examine the listing .
Notice that I seem to be creating a class named " String " near the top of the listing .
But in fact , I am adding a custom method named " isPalindrome " to the existing String class .
Ruby allows you to add methods to existing classes , including classes that are part of the language itself .

Notice about this listing that you can tell what is going on without much effort .
Unlike Perl , famous for being a write - only language because of its peculiar syntax , and unlike many other languages that would require many more lines of code to accomplish the same result , Ruby programs show a concise efficiency .

I have a personal test for languages , based on long experience reading , processing and writing files .
My test is :
How short is the code to get a named file 's entire contents into a string ?
Here 's the Ruby code : I have a personal test for languages , based on long experience reading , processing and writing files .
My test is :
How short is the code to get a named file 's entire contents into a string ?
Here 's the Ruby code : str = File .read ( " / path / file " )
That 's pretty short .
Placing an entire file into a string is n't always the best thing to do , in particular when dealing with huge files , but for lexical analysis ( as one example ) it is really the best approach .
I find I must regularly slurp up ( to borrow Larry Wall 's favorite expression for this activity ) entire Web pages and then process their contents without regard to line breaks .

Data Filter
Now for a program ( Program 3 ) that processes a classic data source — records delimited by linefeeds and fields delimited by tabs — and creates a Web page out of the table .
Here is the code : #!/usr/bin/ruby -w # filter : TSV data to HTML table class TsvToHTML @@styleBlock = <<- ENDMARK < style type=' text /css '> td { border - left : 1 px solid # 000000 ; padding - right : 4 px ; padding - left : 4 px ; white - space : nowrap ; } .cellTitle { border - bottom : 1 px solid # 000000 ; background : # ffffe0 ; font - weight : bold ; text - align : center ; } .cell0 { background : # eff1f1 ; } .cell1 { background : #f8f8f8 ; } </style > ENDMARK def TsvToHTML :: wrapTag ( data , tag , modifier = " " ) return " < #{ tag } #{ modifier } > " + data + " </ #{ tag } >
" end # wrapTag def TsvToHTML :: makePage ( source ) page = " " rowNum = 0 source .readlines.each { | record | row = " " record .chomp.split ( " \t " ) .each { | field | # replace blank fields with field .sub ! ( /^$/ , " " ) # wrap in TD tag , specify style row += wrapTag ( field , " td " , " class=\ " " + ( ( rowNum == 0 ) ? " cellTitle " : " cell # { rowNum % 2 } " ) + " \ " " ) } rowNum += 1 # wrap in TR tag , add row to page page += wrapTag ( row , " tr " ) + "
" } # finish page formatting [ [ " table " , " cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 " ] , " body " , " html " ] .each { | tag | page = wrapTag ( @@styleBlock , " head " ) + page if tag == " html " page = wrapTag ( page , * tag ) } return page end # makePage end # class # stdin -> convert -> stdout print TsvToHTML .makePage ( STDIN )
This listing would be a lot shorter were it not for the style block at the top , necessary to make the HTML page look the way I want .
But even so , for what it accomplishes , this is a very short listing .

For example , in this code : Notice about this program that there are some very handy Ruby - specific methods in use .
For example , in this code : # finish page formatting [ [ " table " , " cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 " ] , " body " , " html " ] .each { | tag | page = wrapTag ( @@styleBlock , " head " ) + page if tag == " html " page = wrapTag ( page , * tag ) } Notice that one of the array 's elements is itself an array .
And if you examine the listing carefully , you will realize that , later on , this array element is applied to a method argument declared as " * tag " .
As it turns out , in Ruby the asterisk in this declaration means that , if an array is supplied as an argument , the method will expand the array into individual arguments .
Then you will notice that the method " wrapTag " will accept an optional argument named " modifier . "

Here 's an example of the output :

I was able to create and test this Ruby page generator in a matter of hours .
Tree Search

As it turns out , if you want to locate files that have both particular names and particular contents , either find or grep can be used , but in neither case is the program suited to the task , and they are difficult to manage when used this way .
Under Linux , there are utilities to search for files by name ( ) , or by content ( ) .

Because of languages like Ruby , these older utilities seem dated , indeed their presence and behavior reminds programmers of the older , hierarchical structure of computer programming , where an end - user 's requirements were met by someone wearing a white lab coat and living behind glass .

" # search path fnFilter = " .* " # filename filter search = " .* " # search contents for this reverse = false # list only no -match files striptags = false # strip HTML tags before match oldarg = " " # process command - line args ARGV .each { | arg | if path . length == 0 && FileTest .exist ?
( arg ) # path path = arg elsif oldarg == " - f " # filename filter fnFilter = arg elsif oldarg == " - s " # search string search = arg elsif arg == " - v " # reverse search reverse = true elsif arg == " - h " # strip HTML tags striptags = true end oldarg = arg } files = 0 matches = 0 begin Find . find ( path ) { | fn | # if fn is a file and if it matches filter if FileTest . file ? ( fn ) && fn =~ / #{ fnFilter } / files += 1 # read the file data =
File .read ( fn ) # strip HTML tags if striptags data .gsub ! ( /<.*?>/ , " " ) end # look for search string r = ( data =~ / #{ search } / i ) ? true : false # test for reverse logic if r != reverse puts fn matches += 1 end end } puts " Files #{ files } , Matches #{ matches } " rescue Standard Error puts " Error : #{ $ ! } " end Granted this program 's limitations , it has the advantage that , if I forget how it works , I can look at its plain - text source , and I can change how it behaves in a flash .
It also has the advantage that , if I should lose the source , it might take 20 minutes to recreate it .

I can't leave this example without explaining that it touches on one of my favorite issues : the gradual breakdown of the distinction between writing programs and using programs .
Ruby makes it so easy to create task - specific code that I think much of the archive of pre-written utilities may in time wither away from lack of use .

Read , Edit , Write
This represents another task I find myself doing again and again .
I sometimes must search a tree of files and edit each of them in the same way — many files , one change .
I 've used Perl for this in the past , but the Ruby code is much cleaner and easier to understand and modify : #!/usr /bin/ruby -w require " find " path = " / path/to/ files " Find . find ( path ) { | f | if f =~ /\.html ?$ / # if it 's an HTML page data =
File .read ( f ) # read the file # put the desired regexp here changed = data .gsub ( / find / , " replace " ) # write only changed files if ( changed != data )
File .new ( f , " w " ) . write ( changed ) end end } People who think about using programs like this one should be aware that it can wipe out an entire directory tree of files if given an ill - constructed regular expression , so always make a backup of the files being processed .

Network Examples
Now for a program ( Program 4 ) that can read Web pages and other content from the Internet .
Here is the listing : #!/usr/bin/ruby -w require ' net/http ' resp = Net :: HTTP .new ( ' www.google.com' , 80 ) . get ( '/' , nil ) puts " Code = #{ resp .code } , Message = #{ resp . message } " resp .each { | key , val | printf " %- 18s = %- 40.40s
" , key , val } puts " Data length : #{ resp .body . length } " print " Show data ( y / n ) : " reply = STDIN .readline.chomp !
if reply =~ /[ Yy ]/ puts resp . body end If you run this program , you will see something like this :
If you run this program , you will see something like this : Code = 200 , Message = OK cache - control = private date =
Thu , 29 Dec 2005 03:17:30 GMT content - type = text / html server = GWS / 2.1 set- cookie = PREF=ID=05b7af4fc753f4ec:TM=1135826250 : L transfer - encoding = chunked Data length : 2518 Show data ( y/n ) : Now that 's a small program with a big result !
In fact , if you look at the listing carefully , you 'll realize that all the lines past this line — resp =
Net :: HTTP .new ( ' www.google.com' , 80 ) . get ( '/' , nil ) — are merely ways to process the data acquired in that one line .
Now that 's a small program with a big result !
In fact , if you look at the listing carefully , you 'll realize that all the lines past this line — — are merely ways to process the data acquired in that one line .
I have used this program to quickly scan through long lists of off - site URLs to verify that they are valid , or , if not , why not .
This is a big improvement over the old way of verifying URLs , which I will leave up to the reader 's imagination .

Moving right along , here is a listing ( Program 5 ) that represents a complete HTTP server : Moving right along , here is a listing ( Program 5 ) that represents a complete HTTP server : #!/usr /bin/env ruby # this HTTP server logs its actions to stdout require ' webrick ' include WEBrick # Create server server = HTTPServer .new ( : Port => 8000 , : DocumentRoot => " / path/DocumentRootDirectory " ) #
When the server gets a control - C , kill it trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } #
Start the server server . start
You may not believe this , but if you run the program in listing 5 ( editing the listing to point to a directory with one or more Web pages ) , then run your favorite browser like this — firefox localhost : 8000 — this mini-server will supply the browser with your Web pages , and it will also print a running account of what it is doing .
This is a terrific way to discover what HTTP servers do behind the scenes .

Conclusion
This is meant to be a quick introduction to Ruby , and hopefully to encourage my readers to familiarize themselves with this terrific language .
Please click some of the links in the resources section below to get a better grasp of Ruby .
I must say , having started out writing assembly - language programs for the Apple II in the mid-1970s and having sampled most of the newer languages since then , I am amazed at the speed with which I can create working code using Ruby .
I am also amazed at the number of programs I 've written over the years that I cannot even run any more , including an embarrassing number of comparatively recent Java programs that are no longer compatible with current Java runtime engines , something that should not have happened , at least not so quickly .

My point ?
I think it 's unavoidable that programs will go out of date , either because they can no longer be compiled or run , or because the problem they were meant to address has disappeared , or both .
Because of this reality , I think it 's a good idea to minimize the effort required to write computer programs , since history tells us they will have to be written over again .
In my view , Ruby represents a big step toward that goal .

I am not recommending Ruby as an across - the - board replacement for such core languages as C++ ( at the time of writing Ruby is interpreted , not compiled ) .
I do think it is a much better choice than either Java or Perl , for the kinds of projects these languages are applied to .

A quick look at the lengths of children 's index and ring fingers can be used to predict how well students will perform on SATs , new research claims .
Kids with longer ring fingers compared to index fingers are likely to have higher math scores than literacy or verbal scores on the college entrance exam , while children with the reverse finger - length ratio are likely to have higher reading and writing , or verbal , scores versus math scores .
Scientists have known that different levels of the hormones testosterone and estrogen in the womb account for the different finger lengths , which are a reflection of areas of the brain that are more highly developed than others , said psychologist Mark Brosnan of the University of Bath , who led the study .
Exposure to testosterone in the womb is said to promote development of areas of the brain often associated with spatial and mathematical skills , he said .
That hormone makes the ring finger longer .
Estrogen exposure does the same for areas of the brain associated with verbal ability and tends to lengthen the index finger relative to the ring finger .
To test the link to children 's scores on the College Board 's Scholastic Assessment Test ( for which the name has changed a number of times in the past 100 years ) , Brosnan and his colleagues made photocopies of children 's palms and measured the length of their index and ring fingers using calipers accurate to 0.01 millimeters .
They used the finger - length ratios as a proxy for the levels of testosterone and estrogen exposure .
The researchers then looked at boys ' and girls ' test performances separately and compared them to finger - length ratio measurements .
They found a clear link between high prenatal testosterone exposure , indicated by the longer ring finger compared to the index finger , and higher scores on the math SAT .
Similarly , they found higher literacy SAT scores for the girls among those who had lower prenatal testosterone exposure , as indicated by a shorter ring finger compared with the index finger .
The researchers also compared the finger - lengths ratios to all the children 's SAT scores and found that a relatively longer ring finger — indicating greater prenatal exposure to testosterone — meant a wider gap in scores for math versus literacy ( writing and critical reading ) .
" Finger ratio provides us with an interesting insight into our innate abilities in key cognitive areas , " Brosnan said , in a prepared statement .
The results will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the British Journal of Psychology .
In the future , his team will see if finger - length ratios are related to other cognitive and behavioral issues , such as technophobia , career paths and possibly dyslexia .
Many SERE veterans were appalled at the “ reverse engineering ” of their methods , said Charles A. Morgan III , a Yale psychiatrist who has worked closely with SERE trainers for a decade .
“ How did something used as an example of what an unethical government would do become something we do ? ” he asked .
His question is only underscored by a 1956 article , “ Communist Interrogation , ” in The Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry , recently turned up by the Intelligence Science Board , which advises the spy agencies .
Written by doctors working as Defense Department consultants , Lawrence E. Hinkle Jr. and Harold G. Wolff , the article shows that methods embraced after 2001 were once considered torture that would produce false information .

•
The article describes basic Soviet N.K.V.D. ( later K.G.B. ) methods : isolation in a small cell ; constant light ; sleep deprivation ; cold or heat ; reduced food rations .
Soviets denied such treatment was torture , just as American officials have in recent years :
The effects of isolation , anxiety , fatigue , lack of sleep , uncomfortable temperatures , and chronic hunger produce disturbances of mood , attitudes and behavior in nearly all prisoners .
The living organism cannot entirely withstand such assaults .
The Communists do not look upon these assaults as “ torture . ”
But all of them produce great discomfort , and lead to serious disturbances of many bodily processes ; there is no reason to differentiate them from any other form of torture .
Interrogators looked for ways to increase the pressure , including “ stress positions ” :
Another [ technique ] widely used is that of requiring the prisoner to stand throughout the interrogation session or to maintain some other physical position which becomes painful .
This , like other features of the KGB procedure , is a form of physical torture , in spite of the fact that the prisoners and KGB officers alike do not ordinarily perceive it as such .
Any fixed position which is maintained over a long period of time ultimately produces excruciating pain .
RoastMyWeenie has a limited number of Cthulhu ( / Punisher ) roaster ’s available for purchase .
A while ago , I wrote about some pretty funny / cool hot dog roasters sent to me from the folks at roastmyweenie.com .
Work well enough , and pretty amusing , but not exactly practical for even a modest sized cook .
I really wanted a roaster that could hold more than one dog .
After thinking about it a bit , dawned on me that some creature with tentacles would be perfect and easy enough to cut on roastmyweenie ’s water jet based cutter .
Now , I could have a gone with a squid based design as they will , in fact , eventually rule the living world .
But , nah … .
Then it hit me !
Cthulhu !
Perfect !
Tentacled devourer of souls and bastion of chaos would be perfect for roasting dogs !
We went back and forth a bit on designs , eventually settling on the one you see here .
It looks a bit more Punisher - esque in steel than the original designs on paper .
But suckers on bendy tentacles are hard to water - cut and do n’t really lend themselves well to roasting dogs anyway .
It works brilliantly , to .
Plenty of support for th dogs , keeps them nicely off the grill surface , and looks pretty damned chaotic evil sitting on the grill hissing away as little bits of grease shoot out of the ends of the dog to spatter and explode on the hot food grade steel .
Completely kicks ass .
For the moment , it is unique .
This is what it looks like before being bent into shape .
I ’m sure that if you were to contact the folks at Roast My Weenie , they might make a few more .
( I also really like their Dog Cooker design ) .
Byron from Roast My Weenie also posted this video to YouTube of the Cthulhu weenier roaster being cut on their Water - Jet cutter .

The nano computer is inspired by Babbage 's difference engine
The blueprint for a tiny , ultra - robust mechanical computer has been outlined by US researchers .
The energy - efficient nano computer is inspired by ideas about computing first put forward nearly 200 years ago .
Writing in the New Journal of Physics , the scientists say the machine would be built from nanometre sized components , just billionths of a metre across .
Chips based on the design could be used in places , such as car engines , where silicon can be too delicate , they said .
" What we are proposing is a new type of computing architecture that is only based on nano mechanical elements , " said Professor Robert Blick of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and one of the authors of the paper .
" We are not going to compete with high - speed silicon , but where we are competitive is for all of those mundane applications where you need microprocessors which can be slow and cheap as well . "
In addition to high - temperature automotive applications , Professor Blick envisaged nano mechanical chips being used in everything from toys to domestic appliances .
Tiny thinking Mechanical computers are nothing new .
The remains of a 2,000 year old analogue computer known as the Antikythera mechanism were discovered in Greece in 1902 .
And during the nineteenth century , English mathematician and engineer Charles Babbage designed various steam powered mechanical computers .
We are quite confident that in a couple of years this work will lead to commercial applications
Robert Blick His " difference engine " , for example , consisted of more than 25,000 individual levers , ratchets and cogs and weighed more than 13 tons .
Although none of his designs were ever finished , recent reconstructions by London 's Science Museum show they were capable of carrying out complex calculations .
The US team 's proposal owes a debt to these early concepts .
" It 's inspired by Babbage 's ideas but these days we can scale it down , " Professor Blick told the BBC News website .
" Now , we are able to process devices on the nano scale . "
Work in progress
The team 's tiny , hypothetical number - cruncher could be built out of ultra - hard materials such as diamond or piezoelectric materials , which change shape when an electric current is applied .
Unlike today 's computers , which are based on the movement of electrons around circuits to do useful calculations , the nano mechanical computer would use the push and pull of each tiny part to carry out calculations .
Nano - mechanics could help chip firms keep up with Moore 's Law The researchers are currently building the first elements needed for the computer , focusing initially on transistors , the basic switches at the heart of all computers .
" We have demonstrated that a single element of these transistors work , " said Professor Blick .
Simulations also suggest that it should be possible to build working circuits , he said .
" We are quite confident that in a couple of years this work will lead to commercial applications , " said Professor Blick .
The American military is interested in a working device because unlike traditional chips , nano mechanical devices are not susceptible to electromagnetic pulses , which could be used by an enemy to knock out computing systems .
Design principles
However , the team believes the chip 's key advantage could be in keeping up with the chip industry 's relentless pursuit of Moore 's Law .
The proposition , articulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 , states that the number of transistors on a chip could double every 24 months .
The first prototype parts are being built from gold and silicon " The smaller you make your devices , the more electrons rush through and the hotter your device gets , " said Professor Blick .
" In the not too distant future we will reach a thermal limit . "
At that point , the heat will interfere with the function of the circuits and offset any efficiency gained by packing more transistors on to the chip .
The mechanical devices run much cooler than silicon and should therefore not suffer from the same problem .
But Dr Michael Kraft of the University of Southampton believes it will take a lot to persuade the silicon industry to abandon more traditional chip designs , such as the common circuit pattern known as CMOS .
" The industry has been working with CMOS for almost 40 years and there is already so much expertise and infrastructure , " he told the BBC News website .
" I think , commercially , industry will continue with CMOS up to the point where it is absolutely not possible to push it any further . "
However , he said , the nano mechanical approach did offer certain benefits that could one day lead to the development of hybrid chips .
" They consume less power which is more and more important because most computers are mobile these days , " he said .
" The battery is the big bottleneck , so anything that reduces the power consumption is a real advantage . "

Soon after dawn on May 11 1857 , 150 years ago this week , the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was saying his morning prayers in his oratory overlooking the river Jumna when he saw a cloud of dust rising on the far side of the river .
Minutes later , he was able to see its cause : 300 East India Company cavalrymen charging wildly towards his palace .
The troops had ridden overnight from Meerut , where they had turned their guns on their British officers , and had come to Delhi to ask the emperor to give his blessing to their mutiny .
As a letter sent out by the rebels ' leaders subsequently put it : " The English are people who overthrow all religions ...
As the English are the common enemy of both [ Hindus and Muslims , we ] should unite in their slaughter ...
By this alone will the lives and faiths of both be saved . "
The sepoys entered Delhi , massacred every Christian man , woman and child they could find and declared the 82 - year - old emperor to be their leader .
Before long the insurgency had snowballed into the largest and bloodiest anticolonial revolt against any European empire in the 19th century .
Of the 139,000 sepoys of the Bengal army , all but 7,796 turned against the British .
In many places the sepoys were supported by a widespread civilian rebellion .
There is much about British imperial adventures in the east at this time , and the massive insurgency it provoked , which is uneasily familiar to us today .
The British had been trading in India since the early 17th century .
But the commercial relationship changed towards the end of the 18th , as a new group of conservatives came to power in London , determined to make Britain the sole global power .
Lord Wellesley , the brother of the Duke of Wellington and governor general in India from 1798 to 1805 , called his new approach the Forward Policy .
But it was in effect a project for a new British century .
Wellesley made it clear he would not tolerate any European rivals , especially the French , and planned to remove any hostile Muslim regimes that might presume to resist the west 's growing might .
The Forward Policy soon developed an evangelical flavour .
The new conservatives wished to impose not only British laws but also western values on India .
The country would be not only ruled but redeemed .
Local laws which offended Christian sensibilities were abrogated - the burning of widows , for instance , was banned .
One of the East India Company directors , Charles Grant , spoke for many when he wrote of how he believed providence had brought the British to India for a higher purpose : " Is it not necessary to conclude that our Asiatic territories were given to us , not merely that we draw a profit from them , but that we might diffuse among their inhabitants , long sunk in darkness , the light of Truth ? "
The British progressed from removing threatening Muslim rulers to annexing even the most pliant Islamic states .
In February 1856 they marched into Avadh , also known by the British as Oudh .
To support the annexation , a " dodgy dossier " was produced before parliament , so full of distortions and exaggerations that one British official who had been involved in the operation described the parliamentary blue book ( or paper ) on Oudh as " a fiction of official penmanship , [ an ] Oriental romance " that was refuted " by one simple and obstinate fact " , that the conquered people of Avadh clearly " preferred the slandered regime " of the Nawab " to the grasping but rose - coloured government of the company " .
The reaction to this came with the great mutiny , or as it is called in India , the first war of independence .
Though it reflected many deeply held political and economic grievances , particularly the feeling that the heathen foreigners were interfering with a part of the world to which they were alien , the uprising was consistently articulated as a defensive action against the inroads missionaries and their ideas were making in India , combined with a generalised fight for freedom from western occupation .
Although the great majority of the sepoys were Hindus , there are many echoes of the Islamic insurgencies the US fights today in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In Delhi a flag of jihad was raised in the principal mosque , and many of the resistance fighters described themselves as mujahideen or jihadis .
There was even a regiment of " suicide ghazis " who vowed to fight until they met death .
Events reached a climax on September 14 1857 , when British forces attacked the besieged city .
They proceeded to massacre not only the rebel sepoys and jihadis , but also the ordinary citizens of the Mughal capital .
In one neighbourhood alone , Kucha Chelan , 1,400 unarmed citizens were cut down .
Delhi , a sophisticated city of half a million souls , was left an empty ruin .
The emperor was put on trial and charged , quite inaccurately , with being behind a Muslim conspiracy to subvert the empire stretching from Mecca and Iran to Delhi's Red Fort .
Contrary to evidence that the uprising broke out first among the overwhelmingly Hindu sepoys , the prosecutor argued that " to Musalman intrigues and Mahommedan conspiracy we may mainly attribute the dreadful calamities of 1857 " .
Like some of the ideas propelling recent adventures in the east , this was a ridiculous and bigoted oversimplification of a more complex reality .
For , as today , western politicians found it easier to blame " Muslim fanaticism " for the bloodshed they had unleashed than to examine the effects of their own foreign policies .
Western politicians were apt to cast their opponents in the role of " incarnate fiends " , conflating armed resistance to invasion and occupation with " pure evil " .
Yet the lessons of 1857 are very clear .
No one likes people of a different faith conquering them , or force - feeding them improving ideas at the point of a bayonet .
The British in 1857 discovered what the US and Israel are learning now , that nothing so easily radicalises a people against them , or so undermines the moderate aspect of Islam , as aggressive western intrusion in the east .
The histories of Islamic fundamentalism and western imperialism have , after all , long been closely and dangerously intertwined .
In a curious but very concrete way , the fundamentalists of all three Abrahamic faiths have always needed each other to reinforce each other 's prejudices and hatreds .
The venom of one provides the lifeblood of the others .

Dorrance Smith has received one of George Bush 's precious recess appointments .
How exciting !
We now have as Assistant Secretary of Defence for Public Affairs a man who is on record as describing ( without offering any evidence ) al - Jazeera as having " a working arrangement [ with terrorists ] that extends beyond a modus vivendi " .
It 's almost as if the Secretary of Defence specifically wanted to neutralize a potentially effective , reality - based State Department - housed public diplomacy which included an outreach to al - Jazeera .
Allow me to quote myself on this lucky new recess appointee :
His legacy in Iraq was an almost unbelievable record of failure in the realm of building a credible , independent , critical Iraqi media .
His view of the media as inherently political ( he reportedly walked around the Green Zone wearing a " W 2004 " hat , and his C - Span Baghdad project was a pure form of media as state propaganda , to " get the good news out " ) and his evident contempt for the contributions of the press to a functioning democracy , have had crippling legacies .
And his views no doubt contributed to the Iraqi government 's unbridled hostility towards al - Jazeera , including kicking them out of the country and making their own unsubstantiated allegations about collaboration with the insurgency .
His views on al - Jazeera are of a piece with his views on the media as a whole .
Indeed , he actually says this : " Osama bin Laden , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , and al Qaeda have a partner in Al - Jazeera and , by extension , most networks in the U.S. "
That a person with such views was responsible for the media in the new Iraq tells us a lot about why it failed .
Hey , maybe it was his impressive performance in undermining the emergence of an independent Iraqi media that won him the prize - ahead of the curve , really .
Whatever the reason for the recess appointment of a proven incompetent political hack ( who evidently could n't even get through a Republican - controlled Senate ) to this crucial position , it 's a dark day for America 's public diplomacy efforts in the Arab world .
Societies in many countries face increased risk of flooding
Several delegations at a meeting of the UN climate panel in Brussels have asked for the final version to reflect less certainty than the draft .
The report is expected to say climate change is already having major impacts on the natural world .
The panel believes there is also a discernible impact on human societies .
But as delegates talked past dawn , some of the detail was reported to have been taken out of the final wording .
Correspondents say the US , Saudi Arabia , China and India were unhappy with the strength of the language in the draft summary , due to be released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change
IPCC draft
" The Europeans want to send a strong signal .
The US does not want as much quantification , " one official told the French news agency AFP .
Water shortages
Draft versions seen by BBC
News warn it will be hard for societies to adapt to all the likely climate impacts .
The report is set to say that a temperature rise above 1.5C from 1990 levels would put about one - third of species at risk of extinction .
More than one billion people would be at greater risk of water shortages , primarily because of the melting of mountain glaciers and ice fields which act as natural reservoirs .
The scientific work reviewed by IPCC scientists includes more than 29,000 pieces of data on observed changes in physical and biological aspects of the natural world .
Eighty - five percent of these , it believes , are consistent with a warming world .
Growing certainty
Since the IPCC 's last global assessment in 2001 , the amount of scientific work on observing and collating changes to the natural world has vastly increased .
In parallel , computer models which project the Earth 's climatic future have grown ever more sophisticated , though there are still uncertainties in their forecasts and they remain unable to model some physical processes accurately .
The combination of more observational evidence and better models allows scientists to paint a much more detailed picture of what is happening in different regions of the world , and what they believe is likely to happen in the future .
" What we find is that evidence of the impacts of climate change is much sharper , much more reliable , " said IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri .
Countries supplied by glacier melt could face more droughts
" Many of the uncertainties have been resolved ; and they confirm that the poorest of the poor are most likely to be hit by the impacts of climate change . "
Fresh water is perhaps the most serious issue for human societies .
The world 's great mountain ranges , such as the Himalayas , Rockies , Andes and Alps , act as natural reservoirs , trapping winter rain and snowfall as ice , and releasing it gradually in the summer .
Evidence suggests that glaciers are shrinking in all of these ranges .
One recent study predicted that 75 % of Alpine glaciers would have vanished by the end of this century .
As the ice disappears , spring and autumn floods become more likely , with an increased risk of drought in summer .
The IPCC is expected to say there is " very high confidence " that these trends are already occurring .
It will also project a higher risk of flooding for many major cities on or near the coast .
Carbon cuts
Some observers of climate issues have long maintained that action on climate change should focus on protecting societies and natural systems against impacts such as floods and drought , rather than on curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
Dealing with drought
Enlarge Image
The IPCC , however , is set to conclude that " adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change , and especially not over the long run as most impacts increase in magnitude " .
Poorer societies are likely to be hardest hit , as they lack the resources to set up protective measures and change their economic base .
Adapting to climate impacts , in the IPCC 's view , should go hand in hand with reducing emissions .
This is the second in a series of IPCC reports coming out this year , together making up its fourth global climate assessment .
The first element , on the science of climate change , was released in February , concluding it is at least 90 % likely that human activities are principally responsible for the warming observed since 1950 .
The third part , which comes out in May , will focus on ways of curbing the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature .
Call it Operation Desert Smoke , aka the war to legalize marijuana in Nevada .
A war , pardon the cliché , for hearts and minds .
A battle of words , concepts and alliances built on common values .
A war in which the Internet , as history 's most potent vehicle for disseminating " facts " – true or otherwise – has become a significant weapon .
" Information is always the enemy of stupidity and prejudice , " says Bruce Mirken , director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project , which is providing organizational support and funding for the Nevada initiative .
" The Net has played a substantial role in undermining ( marijuana ) prohibition . "
" Is it possible that glittering websites offering what may be very biased perspectives regarding marijuana are having an impact on the decriminalization / legalization movement ?
Sure , " retorts Howard Simon , deputy director of public affairs for the Partnership for a Drug - Free America .
" Is it certain that 's the cause ?
No .
There was a widespread decriminalization movement in the 1970s which led to several states reducing penalties associated with marijuana ....
It would be hard to argue that had anything to do with the Internet .
" Still , one can't discount the possible influence of the Internet in spreading a pro-drug message – or the ' nothing 's working in the fight against drugs ' message that too often goes hand in hand with it .
Of course , that latter message is n't biased ; it 's just wrong . "
Anti-marijuana crusaders in the Illinois legislature are so convinced that the Internet is impeding noxious - weed - abatement efforts they 've twice introduced bills to make it illegal to transmit information about marijuana over the Net .
Had it not been defeated , the 2002 bill would have criminalized posting information about using or growing marijuana to websites , newsgroups , message boards , mailing lists and chat rooms .
Make no mistake , the measure on Nevada 's November ballot is more about what Simon would call legalization than decriminalization .
Decriminalization measures aim at reducing penalties or exempting a " special - interest " group from current laws .
The Nevada bill would treat marijuana in much the same way as tobacco and alcohol .
Possession ( of up to three ounces ) and use would be legal for adults , but not minors .
Driving under the influence would be illegal and , as is increasingly the case with tobacco , smoking pot in most public places would be prohibited .
Most important , the initiative , which would have to be passed twice in two general elections to amend the state 's constitution , would direct the legislature to establish a system for the sale and taxation of marijuana .
This would make Nevada the only state giving black - thumbed citizens the same legal access to getting high as world - class gardeners .
Surprisingly , this ultra-radical ( or , according to its supporters , ultra-rational ) proposal is supported by the state 's largest newspaper , the Las Vegas Review - Journal , and the state 's largest law - enforcement organization , the Nevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs .
With the most recent polls indicating the vote would end in a draw if held today , the MPP 's Mirken is looking toward the Internet to help persuade " undecideds . "
" When you are in opposition to a dominant policy , it forces you to be more creative , " he says .
" The Internet allows us to do huge amounts of grassroots organizing instantly , a key advantage as we head toward November . "
Prior to 2000 , Nevadans could draw a multi - year prison sentence for possession of one marijuana cigarette .
Voters passed a medical - marijuana decriminalization bill in 2000 , and the 2001 legislature eliminated incarceration as a penalty for possession of less than one ounce by first - or second - time adult offenders .
The US military 's system of tribunals at Guantánamo Bay was thrown into chaos today after a military judge threw out all charges against a young Canadian detainee .
One senior military official said the ruling in the case of Omar Khadr could have a " huge impact " on the controversial tribunals at the US navy 's detention centre in Cuba , the Associated Press reported .
The judge said Mr Khadr - who was captured in Afghanistan as a suspected Taliban fighter in 2002 when he was aged 15 - did not meet the definition of those subject to trial under the new laws in effect at the tribunals .
Army Colonel Peter Brownback , the tribunal judge , said a military review board had labelled Mr Khadr an " enemy combatant " during a 2004 hearing in Guantánamo .
However , the Military Commissions
Act adopted by the US Congress in 2006 said only " unlawful enemy combatants " could be tried in the Guantánamo tribunals .
Today Col Brownback said Khadr did not meet that strict definition .
" The charges are dismissed without prejudice , " the military judge said before adjourning the proceedings .
Shortly afterwards , the chief of military defence lawyers at Guantánamo Bay , Marine Colonel Dwight Sullivan , said the ruling had " huge " impact , because none of the remaining some 380 Guantánamo detainees has been found to be an " unlawful " enemy combatant .
Col Sullivan said the ruling was further evidence the tribunal system was a failed experiment .
" We do n't need any more evidence that it 's a failure , " he said .
" This system should just stop . "
Today 's turn of events at the tribunal is the latest legal setback for the Bush administration over the detainees at the prison camp on the southern tip of Cuba .
The current tribunal system was devised after the US supreme court struck down a previous system as unconstitutional last June .
The administration has long been criticised for the legal scenario surrounding the hundreds of suspected terror suspects it has detained there .
For years , the detainees were in a legal limbo without apparent prospect of being charged or tried , and the Bush administration has pushed the new tribunals as an antidote to criticism on that front .
It was immediately unclear how US officials would react to this latest legal setback .
Col Brownback gave prosecutors 72 hours to appeal his ruling , though it was not immediately clear whom they could appeal to .
While Col Brownback dismissed the charges , he left open the possibility that they could be re-filed if Mr Khadr went back before a review board and was formally classified as an " unlawful enemy combatant " .
Mr Khadr has been accused of killing a US soldier with a grenade and wounding another in a battle at a suspected al - Qaida compound in Afghanistan in 2002 .
During his capture he was shot three times and is nearly blind in one eye as a result of his injuries .
He was also charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism actions such as murder , attempted murder and spying , for allegedly conducting surveillance of US military convoys in Afghanistan .
Col Brownback had rejected a prosecution argument that Mr Khadr clearly met the definition of an " unlawful " combatant because he fought for al - Qaida , which was not part of the regular , uniformed armed forces of any nation .
The prosecution also said it was prepared to produce a video of Mr Khadr wearing civilian clothes while planting a roadside bomb , as evidence he was an unlawful combatant .
The Toronto - born terror suspect had faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
Amnesty International has strongly criticised the decision to prosecute Mr Khadr for murder .
Speaking in April the campaign group 's UK director , Katie Allen , said : " To have held a 15 - year - old boy in the harsh and lawless conditions of Guantánamo for five years has already been a travesty of justice - and to put him before an unfair ' military commission ' trial simply adds to a disgraceful record in his case . "
She called on US authorities to transfer his case to a civilian federal court on the US mainland .
Col Sullivan said the ruling also cast doubt on the legality of Australian prisoner David Hicks 's guilty plea to supporting terrorism - since Hicks also had not been declared an " unlawful enemy combatant " .
He pleaded guilty in March to a charge of providing material support for terrorism and was sent home to Australia to serve a nine - month sentence .
Hicks ' conviction was the first at a US war crimes trial since the second world war .
Neoconservative ' hopes , prays ' Bush will bomb Iran RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email This
In a Wall Street Journal op - ed , prominent neoconservative Norman Podhoretz writes that he ' hopes ' and ' prays ' that President Bush will bomb Iran .
" Although many persist in denying it , I continue to believe that what Sept 11 , 2001 , did was to plunge us headlong into nothing less than another world war , " writes the editor - at - large of Commentary , who also sits on the Council on Foreign Relations .
" I call this new war World War IV , because I also believe that what is generally known as the Cold War was actually World War III , and that this one bears a closer resemblance to that great conflict than it does to World War II . "
Podhoretz believes that " the plain and brutal truth is that if Iran is to be prevented from developing a nuclear arsenal , there is no alternative to the actual use of military force -- any more than there was an alternative to force if Hitler was to be stopped in 1938 . "
" Since a ground invasion of Iran must be ruled out for many different reasons , the job would have to be done , if it is to be done at all , by a campaign of air strikes , " the op - ed continues .
" Furthermore , because Iran 's nuclear facilities are dispersed , and because some of them are underground , many sorties and bunker - busting munitions would be required .
And because such a campaign is beyond the capabilities of Israel , and the will , let alone the courage , of any of our other allies , it could be carried out only by the United States .
Even then , we would probably be unable to get at all the underground facilities , which means that , if Iran were still intent on going nuclear , it would not have to start over again from scratch .
But a bombing campaign would without question set back its nuclear program for years to come , and might even lead to the overthrow of the mullahs . "
Podhoretz thinks that Bush " intends , within the next 21 months , to order air strikes against the Iranian nuclear facilities from the three U.S. aircraft carriers already sitting nearby ....
If this is what Mr. Bush intends to do , it goes , or should go , without saying that his overriding purpose is to ensure the security of this country in accordance with the vow he took upon becoming president , and in line with his pledge not to stand by while one of the world 's most dangerous regimes threatens us with one of the world 's most dangerous weapons . "
" It now remains to be seen whether this president , battered more mercilessly and with less justification than any other in living memory , and weakened politically by the enemies of his policy in the Middle East in general and Iraq in particular , will find it possible to take the only action that can stop Iran from following through on its evil intentions both toward us and toward Israel , " Podhorez writes in conclusion .
" As an American and as a Jew , I pray with all my heart that he will . "
Podhoretz has a book set for release on September 11 entitled World War IV : The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism .

I ’m reading a great book called “ Influence : Science and Practice ” by Robert B. Cialdini .
It ’s full of research and anecdotes about how to influence people .
It ’s a real eye - opener .
One of the most potent forms of persuasion has to do with people ’s innate need to be consistent .
Studies show that people will ignore logic and information to be consistent .
( In other words , we are moist robots . )
According to the research , humans are hardwired for consistency over reason .
You already knew that : People do n’t switch political parties or religions easily .
What you did n’t know is how quickly and easily a manipulator can lock someone into a position .
For example , researchers asked people to write essays in support of a random point of view they did not hold .
Months later , when surveyed , the majority held the opinion they wrote about , regardless of the topic .
Once a person commits an opinion to writing – even an opinion he does not hold – it soon becomes his actual opinion .
Not every time , but MOST of the time .
The people in these experiments were n’t exposed to new information before writing their contrived opinions .
All they did was sit down and write an opinion they did n’t actually have , and months later it became their actual opinion .
The experiment worked whether the volunteers were writing the pro or the con position on the random topic .
Most of the truly stupid things done in this world have to do with this consistency principle .
For example , once you define yourself as a loyal citizen of Elbonia , you do whatever the King of Elbonia tells you to do , no matter how stupid that is .
And your mind invents reasons as to why dying is a perfectly good life strategy .
This research provides a surefire method for readers of the Dilbert Blog to improve their sex lives .
Go down to the local mall with a clipboard and pretend to be doing a research experiment .
Offer $ 1 to attractive people who will write a paragraph describing how incredibly sexy you are .
( Based on the research , you should offer a low dollar amount so people do n’t think they did it entirely for the money . )
Tell participants that the research has to do with handwriting analysis of people who are writing opinions they do not believe .
Stop after you get 100 people to do it .
That ’s less than the cost of one meal at an upscale restaurant .
Give the participants your e-mail address and tell them they can get the results of the research study in a month if they contact you .
According to the science , about two - thirds of the people who wrote a paragraph on your sex appeal will strongly believe it a month later , no matter how hideous you are .
And a few of those people will remember to e-mail you for the results .
You ’ll still have to close the deal , but I think we can agree that I just did the hard work for you .
You ’re welcome .

Archeologists have solved the mystery of the Thirteen Towers , a line of low stone structures that have spanned an arid Peruvian slope like a massive set of prehistoric teeth for 2,400 years .
The towers lined up outside the citadel at Chankillo are a massive solar observatory that marks not only the summer and winter solstices , but also the days and weeks of the year .
The evidence that they are an observatory is unequivocal , said Clive Ruggles , a professor of archeo - astronomy at the University of Leicester and one of the authors of the paper in today ’s issue of the journal Science .
“ It seems extraordinary that an ancient astronomical device as clear as this could have remained undiscovered for so long , ” he said .
Advertisement
The site is not the oldest solar observatory in the New World .
That honor goes to a 4,200 - year - old site just north of Lima , Peru ’s capital , that marks the solstices .
Other ancient structures have been found that clearly have astronomical alignments .
“ Unlike all the other sites , however , [ Chankillo ] contains alignments that cover the entire solar year , ” said coauthor Ivan Ghezzi , who was a graduate student at Yale University when he did the work but is now archeological director of the National Culture Institute in Lima .
In effect , it is the oldest “ full - service observatory ” in the Western Hemisphere .
The finding is important because of the insight it provides on the culture of the indigenous peoples , who were ancestors of the Inca , said archeologist Clark Erickson of the University of Pennsylvania , who was not involved in the research .
Advertisement
“ The real goal of archeology is not to find stuff , but to find out what was going on in people ’s minds in the past , ” he said .
“ The most important thing is to people the past and make it come alive , and that is what this does . ”
Chankillo is a large ceremonial center covering a little more than 1.5 square miles of the Casma - Sechin River basin in the coastal Peruvian desert .
Its most notable feature is the citadel , a 900 - foot - long structure built within three concentric , roughly circular walls , with gates and defensive parapets .
The citadel ’s resemblance to the head of an electric shaver has led some observers to refer to it facetiously as “ Norelco - land . ”
Archeologists have argued for more than a century over the citadel ’s purpose .
Many believe it is a fortress , but the lack of water inside suggests that is unlikely .
The new findings support the argument that it is a ceremonial center of some sort .

To the east of the citadel is a ceremonial - civic area containing the Thirteen Towers .
Spread over a distance of nine football fields in a near - straight line , the towers range from 6 to 18 feet high and are spaced about 15 feet apart .
Each has a pair of staircases , on the north and south sides , leading to the top .
Some archeologists have speculated that the towers marked lunar months , Ghezzi said , but “ no one followed up on it . ”
Ghezzi decided to do so in 2001 .
“ We were there .
We had extraordinary support , ” he said .
“ We said , ‘ Let ’s study it while we are here . ’ ”

The key was the discovery of a group of buildings about 200 yards to the west of the towers , including a building with two courtyards and a 120 - foot - long exterior corridor leading to what appeared to be an observation point .
The corridor , plastered and whitewashed , had no other doors and no apparent purpose other than to funnel people to the observation point .
The team found pottery , shells and other artifacts suggesting offerings associated with that opening , but not with others in the complex .
Intrigued by that finding , they looked in the same position on the east side of the towers and found the remains of a small , isolated building in the middle of a large open space .
When viewed from either location , the spread of the towers provides an artificial horizon .
The two observation points are positioned , Ghezzi found , so that on the winter and summer solstices , the sun rises and sets over the towers on the opposite ends of the line , establishing the beginning and midpoint of the solar year .
Advertisement
Once the sun had moved away from the extreme positions of the solstices , the authors said , the various towers and gaps would have provided a means to track the progress of the sun up and down the horizon with an accuracy of two to three days .
The sun rose for just one or two days in each gap and took 10 days to proceed from one gap to the next in the center of the line , suggesting that a 10 - day interval may have been a feature of the builders ’ solar calendar .
On the ends of the line , however , the gaps correspond to 11 - or 12 - day intervals .
Ruggles , one of the world ’s leading authorities on archeo - astronomy , admits to having been dubious when Ghezzi approached him .
“ I am used to being disappointed when visiting places people claim to be ancient astronomical observatories , ” he said .
“ The evidence all too often turns out to be unconvincing . ”
Chankillo , however , “ provided a complete set of horizon markers -- the Thirteen Towers -- and two unique and indisputable observation points .
The fact that , as seen from these two points , the towers just span the solar rising and setting arcs provides the clearest possible indication that they were built specifically to facilitate sunrise and sunset observations throughout the seasonal year . ”

Inca texts written more than a millennium later describe the use of “ sun pillars ” on the horizon near Cuzco to mark planting times and to regulate seasonal observances , but no traces of those pillars have been found .
The Thirteen Towers clearly represent an earlier version of that technology , Ghezzi said .
“ We knew that their practices of astronomy were very sophisticated and that they used buildings to mark the positions of the sun on key dates of the year , but we did not know that their practices were so old , ” he said .

PHILADELPHIA —
What do you do if you buy a famous downtown department store and find an organ with 28,482 pipes occupying thousands of square feet of perfectly good retail space ?
If you ’re Macy ’s , you let devotees of the instrument put in 61 more pipes and give them thousands more square feet to set up an organ repair shop .
Diapasons , it would seem , are as much music to Macy ’s as cash registers , coin counters and customers at its Center City store here , a Philadelphia institution that was originally a Wanamaker ’s .
So the company let the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ , a private group of aficionados who have been helping to maintain the instrument for years , install another stop and set up a repair shop after Macy ’s took over the store .
“ Every lunchtime , people hear the organ and feel good — and people are in a mind to shop when they ’re feeling good , ” explained James Kenny , the store manager .
“ It ’s the ultimate feel - good experience . ”
For months , the Justice Department and Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales have taken political heat for the purge of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
Now the fallout is starting to hit the department in federal courtrooms around the country .
Defense lawyers in a growing number of cases are raising questions about the motives of government lawyers who have brought charges against their clients .
In court papers , they are citing the furor over the U.S. attorney dismissals as evidence that their cases may have been infected by politics .
Justice officials say those concerns are unfounded and constitute desperate measures by desperate defendants .
But the affair has given defendants and their lawyers some new energy , which is complicating life for the prosecutors .

Missouri lawyers have invoked the controversy in challenging last year ’s indictment of a company owned by a prominent Democrat , on suspicion of violating federal wage and hour laws .
The indictment , which came two months after the owner announced that she was running for political office , was obtained by a Republican U.S. attorney who also has been criticized because he charged workers for a left - leaning political group on the eve of the 2006 midterm election .
A lawyer in a child pornography case recently defended his client at a federal trial in Minnesota in part by questioning the motives of the Republican U.S. attorney , who has come under scrutiny in the congressional investigation into the prosecutor purge .
Lawyers for a former county official in Delaware who has been accused of corruption asked a judge in early May to allow them to subpoena the Justice Department and White House for documents to see whether political motives factored into charges being brought against the official .
They cited the brewing controversy inside the Beltway .
“ Those revelations dramatically reinforce the reasons to believe that considerations beyond mere law enforcement are behind this prosecution , ” the lawyers wrote .

The defendant , a once up - and - coming Democrat , was being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney in Wilmington , a Republican appointee .
In an inch - thick response , the U.S. attorney said nothing could be further from the truth , and said the attacks were “ sullying the reputations of every prosecutor and law enforcement officer involved in this case , ” including more than a dozen career prosecutors and agents .
U.S. District Judge John P. Fullam eventually sided with the government , saying that if there were any improper motives for bringing the case , they would become evident at trial , in cross-examination .
He also noted that the decision to bring the indictments was made in May 2004 -- “ long before Mr. Gonzales became attorney general . ”
( Gonzales ’ swearing - in was in February 2005 . )
The defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to bank fraud .

The firing of the eight prosecutors last year has drawn attention because once appointed , U.S. attorneys traditionally have been allowed to serve until they resign or are ousted because of misconduct .
New administrations routinely make changes as well .
Gonzales has defended the dismissals as justified for performance reasons , saying that some of the prosecutors failed to follow administration law - enforcement priorities .
But Democrats say there is evidence that the dismissals were part of a Bush administration effort to affect investigations in public corruption and voting cases that would assist Republicans .
The probe has also shown that politics may have played a role in the hiring of some career Justice employees , in possible violation of federal law .
The controversy has drained morale from U.S. attorney offices around the country .
And now , legal experts and former Justice Department officials say , it is casting a shadow over the integrity of the department and its corps of career prosecutors in court .

There has long been a presumption that , because they represented the Justice Department , prosecutors had no political agenda and their word could be trusted .
But some legal experts say the controversy threatens to undermine their credibility .
“ It provides defendants an opportunity to make an argument that would not have been made two years ago , ” said Daniel J. French , a former U.S. attorney in Albany , N.Y .
“ It has a tremendously corrosive effect . ”
Defense lawyers in political corruption cases often argue to juries that the prosecution was motivated by politics , especially when the prosecutor happens to be of a different political party than the defendant .
B. Todd Jones , a former U.S. attorney in Minneapolis , said such arguments are now “ given credence in the public eye because they are seeing that maybe there were political decisions made .
Any defense lawyer worth their salt is going to say this is a political prosecution that should n’t have been brought . ”

The controversy may also be feeding anti-government feelings that many jurors bring to cases , even when defense lawyers do not overtly try to exploit the situation .
“ It has become part of the background that jurors have in their minds when they deliberate , ” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D - Burbank ) , a former assistant U.S. attorney .
“ Jurors will think , ‘ Gee , is there a political motivation for this ?
Is it being brought because the U.S. attorney wants to curry favor with the attorney general and keep his job ? ’
Corruption cases are tough enough to prosecute without having to defend yourself against attack . ”
Lawyer Daniel Gerdts won an acquittal in federal court in Minneapolis last month for a New York computer consultant who had been accused of bringing child pornography into the United States on his way back from a business trip to Asia .
The defendant , who worked for a Japanese producer of adult videos , said he was hired to set up Web pages to market the videos and to search the Internet for pirated copies .
He conceded he might have inadvertently downloaded child porn in the process of doing his job .

In court , Gerdts said prosecutors had failed to exercise proper discretion in bringing the charges .
During his closing argument to the jury , he suggested a reason , alluding to published reports of upheaval in the office since Rachel Paulose had become U.S. attorney in 2006 .
Paulose is believed to have gotten the posting with the help of Monica M. Goodling , a former Gonzales aide who recently testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution that she “ crossed a line ” by improperly allowing politics to influence hiring decisions at the Justice Department .
Several senior prosecutors in the Minneapolis office resigned their management posts to protest Paulose ’s leadership .
The effect of Gerdts ’ courtroom remark was unclear .
Government lawyers objected , and the judge told jurors to ignore the comment .
After the verdict , jurors said they did not believe the government ’s accusation that the defendant had intentionally downloaded contraband files .

In Springfield , Mo. , defense lawyers are seeking a court order for evidence of improper contacts between former interim U.S. Atty .
Bradley J. Schlozman and former Bush administration official Asa Hutchinson about the indictment last year of a company known as Managed Subcontractors .
Schlozman was questioned this month on Capitol Hill about his decision to obtain indictments of some former voter registration workers for the liberal Assn. of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or ACORN , less than a week before the midterm election last fall .
Managed Subcontractors had been the target of an investigation in 2002 by federal immigration agents working for the Department of Homeland Security .
But its attorneys believed the case had gone dormant in the ensuing years .
Then , in June 2006 , three months after his arrival as U.S. attorney , Schlozman secured an indictment .
The principal owner of the company , Robbyn Tumey , had recently filed as a Democratic candidate for the state House in neighboring Arkansas .
Advertisement
Hutchinson , who was then in a hotly contested race for governor of Arkansas , was interested in the case because he was running on a get - tough - on - immigration platform , the court filing contends .
After her company was indicted , Tumey resigned as chairwoman of her local Democratic Party and withdrew from the Arkansas House campaign .
Hutchinson , who lost his bid for governor , could not be reached for comment .
In an interview with the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , he said there was “ zippo ” evidence linking him to the indictment decision .
Thomas Carver , Tumey ’s lawyer , conceded that seeking the court order “ involves some degree of speculation on our part because we obviously are not privy to the inner workings of the U.S. attorney ’s office . ”
But he said his client had a right to the information .

“ One of the reasons to file the motion was to determine if there is any cause for alarm , ” he said .
“ We are not in a position to make accusations ... but we would certainly like to know . ”

Scientists at Manchester University ( UK ) have discovered that a dinosaur traditionally regarded as one of the most violent actually used its giant razor - sharp claw to climb trees .
The velociraptor* was immortalised in Steven Speilberg 's 1993 film Jurassic Park , where it was depicted as a vicious hunter that slashed open its prey 's intestine with its sickle - shaped claw .
But palaeontologist Dr Phillip Manning from Manchester University and scientists from the National History Museum in London have discovered this fearsome - looking appendage was of little use for this purpose .
The researchers found a replica claw attached to the end of a robotic arm was better at hooking on to flesh than slashing it during a simulated attack .
They also replicated the dinosaur 's hind leg motion and this led to the discovery it was better suited to climbing .
Full article at " Dinosaur claws used for climbing - research "
-------
A related Natural History Museum report from 2005 :
Disarming dangerous dinosaurs
Scientists at the University of Manchester and the Natural History Museum have been studying the large foot claw found on small meat - eating dinosaurs such as Velociraptor and Deinonychus .
These dinosaurs both belong to a group called dromaeosaurs .
The study has found that instead of slicing through flesh and disembowelling prey , as previously thought , the dinosaur primarily used its foot claw as a tool to hold on to and perhaps clamber over its victims .
The dromaeosaur 's sharp serrated teeth would then tear into the flesh of its prey whilst clinging tightly to its victim .
This is similar to the hunting techniques of modern day big cats , which use their protracted claws to cling onto their prey as their powerful jaws deliver the killer blow .

* Info on Velociraptors :
Velociraptor ( meaning " swift thief " ) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that existed approximately 83 to 70 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period .
There is only one universally recognized species , V. mongoliensis , although others have been attributed in the past .
Fossils of this species have been found in central Asia , from both Inner and Outer Mongolia .
Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator , the turkey - sized Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features .
It was a bipedal carnivore with a long , stiffened tail and had an enlarged , sickle - shaped claw on each hindfoot , which is thought to have been used to kill its prey .
Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull , with an upturned snout .
Due in large part to its prominent role in Michael Crichton 's novel Jurassic Park and the subsequent motion picture series , Velociraptor ( commonly shortened to ' raptor ' ) is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public .
It is also well - known to paleontologists , with over a dozen recovered fossil skeletons - the most of any dromaeosaurid .
One particularly famous specimen shows a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops .

Beyond Vietnam / A Time to Break Silence
Background
On April 4 , 1967 , exactly one year before his assassination , Dr. Martin Luther King gave his first major public address on the War in Vietnam at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New York City .
In that address he articulated his reasons for his opposition to the Southeast Asian conflict .
In this speech , Martin Luther King , Jr. spoke out harshly against the war in Vietnam .
His speech " Beyond Vietnam " was condemned by many civil rights leaders who thought it hurt their cause .
It incensed President Lyndon Johnson , who revoked King 's invitation to the White House .
" The calling to speak is often a vocation of agony , but we must speak , " said King .
" We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision , but we must speak . "

Khaled Meshaal is the political leader of the Palestinian Hamas movement , which earlier this year came to power with a large majority in the free and democratic election in Palestine .
In summer 2006 , Israeli Minister of Justice Haim Ramon publicly confirmed his government ’s order to kill Khaled Meshaal .
In 1997 in Amman , Jordan , Meshaal survived a assassination attempt by Israel ’s secret service Mossad by a narrow margin .
Currently , the Hamas leader lives in Syrian asylum in Damascus under strong security .
Khaled , a physicist , is married and has three daughters and four sons .
He was interviewed by Rainer Rupp ( RR ) , a German journalist for the daily Junge Welt , published in Berlin with nationwide distribution .
RR : Mr. Khaled Meshaal , as a leading politician of Hamas you are on the assassination list of the Israeli intelligence service .
How did you become a member of the Islamic resistance movement against Israeli occupation ?
KM : Actually , I am one of the founders of the Hamas movement .
Inside Hamas , the most prominent figure was the late Sheik Ahmed Yassin .
When the Hamas movement was established in the year 1987 , I was 31 years old .
I was among the people who had built up branches inside and outside Palestine .
But the very idea of Hamas started already at the end of the Seventies .
The internal dialogue and deliberation lasted for more than 10 years in order to establish a movement against Israeli occupation .
But the very project of the movement had already been in my heart and in my mind when I was still at Kuwait University .
At the age of 21 , I represented the Islamic movement in the students ’ general union at university .
RR : For many years there has been the suggestion in the Western media that Israeli intelligence was instrumental in the creation of Hamas .
I suppose you know about this story ?
KM : Unfortunately this tale is told by some Arabs , Palestinian Arabs .
It is an attempt to distort the image of our movement .
We consider this charge as something so ridiculous , that we do n’t even bother to deny it .
It is so illogical .
How come , that Israel should establish an organization that will combat Israel , how is that possible ?
RR : The argument is , the Israelis helped to create Hamas in order to divide the Palestinian resistance and weaken the Fatah movement .
KM : Indeed , during the Seventies , the main Palestinian force that was combating Israel was the Fatah movement .
Consequently , Israel concentrated its fighting against Fatah and the other , smaller groups of Palestinian resistance , which existed in this period .
At that time , however , Hamas was not yet properly established .
We were only starting to build our social base in Palestinian society , by focusing entirely on social affairs , organizing help , building hospitals and schools , looking after the sick and deprived .
In that era , we were only involved in peaceful actions .
This is why Israel did not do anything against us .
Because they did not know at the time what was going on in our minds .
But , while we were focussing outwardly only on social and educational work , at the same time we were secretly already training and preparing for our future resistance projects .
Because the Israelis did not see this danger , they concentrated their actions against other brigades , not against us .
And it is this Israeli inaction against us which some Palestinian Arab elements unfriendly towards Hamas present as " proof " that Israel was supporting the creation of Hamas .
RR : Recently , Hamas ’ relations with the Fatah movement have been very strained .
Is there still a chance for a national unity government ?
KM :
There is a positive atmosphere between the movement of Hamas and Fatah to create a unity government .
Since month one we have agreed in principle on the creation of such a unity government .
Recently , however , some obstacles have started to appear .
The first obstacle was that there were efforts to bring us back to a " government of technocrats , " not forward to the national unity government .
This is how they want to remove Hamas from the government .
And the second obstacle is that the guarantees for lifting the blockade are still not sufficient .
RR : Guarantees ?
Guarantees from the West ?
KM : Yes , from America .
We made an agreement , that once we have formed a government of national unity , the siege shall be lifted .
Hamas is very serious about this .
We are keen to end the suffering of the Palestinian people .
But as our movement got the majority of votes and has the most seats in parliament , we also have the right to have the major influence in this government .
The main dilemma now is that there are forces which deny us this right .
RR : One of the key issues is the so - called recognition of " Israel ’s right to exist . "
Is Hamas prepared to change its position on this matter ?
Especially as the West has made this issue a condition sine qua non for the lifting of the blockade against a Hamas - led Palestinian government .
KM : I think the Western world has understood by now that Hamas will never recognize Israel .
How can I recognize the one who occupies my land ?
It is illogical that it is demanded of Hamas to recognize Israel .
I am the victim .
I am the man who is not free .
I am the man living in the Diaspora away from my land .
Israel has got a kind of a nation that was imposed as a fait accompli by the United Nations .
We do n’t have a nation .
More than half of the Palestinian people are living in the Diaspora , mostly in camps , and they ca n’t go home .
Because of Israel they ca n’t go home  and we should recognize Israel ?
Who is actually in the wrong , us or Israel ?
RR : But the two - state theory which the Americans are promoting envisages a Palestinian state next to an Israeli state .
Is this also absolutely unacceptable for Hamas ?
KM : No . No .
Let me say that the Hamas movement will only establish a Palestinian state within the borders of 1967 ; that includes East Jerusalem and the West Bank .
Up till now , Israel does not recognize this right for us .
All the Palestinians are demanding is this right .
But Israel keeps violating Palestinian rights , and the West is unwilling to force Israel to recognize the Palestinian rights .
Even when President Bush talked about a Palestinian state , it was not clear cut .
And Ariel Sharon and recently Ehud Olmert have made a lot of reservations about Bush ’s proposal .
They are rejecting the idea of an Israeli state within its 1967 borders .
They want an Israeli state , which includes parts of the West Bank .
Actually , President Bush had even agreed to Sharon ’s proposal for Israel to keep all of Jerusalem .
And he agreed with Sharon to choose the right Palestinian leader who would accept all this .
RR : Have I understood you correctly that you would be prepared to negotiate with Israel and accept it within its borders of 1967 , before it started its wars of aggression , stealing Palestinian land ?
KM : Good , that has been made clear .
RR : In the West , Hamas is generally depicted as being absolutely against talks with Israel and [ it ’s believed ] that Hamas only wants to drive the Israeli Jews into the sea .
KM : This is not correct .
Killing Jews is not our aim .
For centuries we have lived in Palestine peacefully with Jews and Christians of all kinds .
We are fighting Israel because it occupies our land and oppresses our people .
We are fighting Israel to finish this occupation .
We want to live freely on our land just as other nations .
We want to have our own country just like other people .
But the Zionist movement came from all over the world to occupy our land .
And the real owner of the land has been kicked out .
This is the root of the problem .
Because of many factors , we now accept to build a Palestinian state within the borders of 1967 .
But that does n’t mean that we recognize Israel .
But we are prepared to make a long - term truce with Israel .
Accepting the status of Israel without recognizing it .
RR : But no recognition ?
Does n’t that mean continued tensions and war ?
KM : No .
There are plenty of examples where no recognition does not mean war .
China and Taiwan , for example , have not recognized each other , but they trade and cooperate with each other .
By withholding a formal recognition , we just do n’t want to give Israel the legitimacy for having taken our land in the first place .
RR :
It is no secret that for many years under the Fatah government the Palestine security services have been trained and equipped by the Americans , namely the CIA .
Is it therefore not reasonable to assume that a whole lot of people in the movement of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are secretly working for the Americans and Israelis , some possibly in top positions ?
How far could you trust Fatah if you were to build a national unity government together ?
KM :
This problem is well - known for us and for the rest of the Palestinians .
But not all of the people of Fatah are of this kind .
There is a huge motivation within Fatah , which is " nationality . "
They are our partners in the resistance .
But there are others , the people you spoke about .
That is a fact .
We know the problem quite well and we are dealing with it .
Moreover , the relationship is not , by necessity , always based upon trust .
RR : Do you think that this problem is also at the root of the difficulties you are having right now with Fatah in creating a unity government ?
KM : Yes , that ’s right .
This is one of the problems .
Unfortunately , there are these factors and pressures which are following foreign agendas that influence negatively the Palestinian arena .
But the patriotic forces are the ones that are going to win .
The Palestinian people have confirmed this in the latest democratic elections .
RR : Is Hamas a movement of religious fanatics , as it is portrayed in the West ?
A movement with which one cannot deal ?
Yet Hamas has been accepted and invited to Moscow by the Russian government and here ( in Syria ) you are guests of a secular state .
Is this all a disguise ?
Which is the true Hamas ?
KM : Well , let me give you an example .
We have , for instance , good relations with Christians
RR : Are you actually working together with the Christians in Palestine ?
KM : Yes , with some of them .
This image of religious fanaticism has been fabricated by Israel and the American administration .
It is an image that does not reflect the facts .
You know that the American administration gives itself the right to classify people just the way they like .
But how can respectable states in Europe , like Britain , Germany , or France , be influenced by this propaganda ?
Should they not search for the truth themselves ?
Should they not form their views on the basis of reason instead of rumors and hearsay ?
But how should the West discover the truth about Palestine and Hamas ?
First , the Western journalists should come here to meet the people and see the facts with their own eyes .
Go to Palestine and see how the people live .
Listen to what the people have to say .
Listen to leaders of Hamas and other Palestinian movements .
You should learn the truth through direct contacts and not through others .
And if you want to know about Hamas , then go and meet the people from Hamas .
We are ready for dialogue .
If you are looking for reasons why Hamas won the election , then it is because the Palestinian people trust us and because Hamas reflects the feelings and the aspirations of the Palestinian people .
And if you scrutinize Hamas closely , then you will not find any corruption whatsoever .
But you will find that Hamas is very close to the people , that it is really serving the needs of the people .
And if the people of Palestine elected Hamas , then the will of the people should be respected also by the West .
RR : But what about the reproach of religious fanaticism ?
KM : That is easy to refute .
If Hamas was a movement of religious fanatics , it would n’t have been elected by the Palestinian people , because in Palestine there are many groups .
And there are also Christians , who work together with us .
For instance , one of the members of parliament in Gaza who was elected on the Hamas list is a Christian doctor .
And the majority of Muslims and Christians gave him their vote .
The fact is that the ideas of Hamas are moderate .
We practice tolerance with everybody .
And we deal with Muslims and Christians at the same level .
And on this level we deal with everybody , either religious , liberal , or secular , either inside or outside of Palestine .
And we have relations within the Middle East but also in Europe and Africa .
Hamas is an open movement .
We do not combat Israel because they are Jews but because they are occupying our land .
RR : The West is reproaching you that in this fight against Israel you are committing acts of terrorism .
KM : No .
There is a major difference between terrorism and resistance .
We are against terrorism .
Resistance is not terrorism .
What Israel is doing is terrorism .
What we are doing is resistance .
Because it is a reaction against the Israeli aggression and a reaction against the Israeli occupation of our land .
The resistance is the legal right to defend ourselves .
This interview with Khaled Meshaal was conducted in English at the end of November 2006 in Damascus by Rainer Rupp .
The interview was first published Dec. 16 in the German daily newspaper Junge Welt .
It 's unclear who said :
" I think there is a world market for maybe five computers "
but it might have been Thomas Watson in 1943 , president of IBM , but it might be a myth .
The thinking was that a number of large mainframey computers would be built and used by the world .
That of course , did n't happen , as my watch has more memory than ENIAC did , and there 's computers everywhere , but as the web continues to mature , I believe that things will conflate in the next 10 - 15 years and as more and more companies begin to
outsource storage to services like S3
move servers into Virtual Machines
move all email and apps to Google Apps
All this is building a collective trust with large entities like Amazon , and as prices fall with uptimes rising , more companies will say , " who am I to build a datacenter ?
I 'll just host in one of The Five . "
Here 's a list of services ( by no means exhaustive ) from Wikipedia 's Utility Computing article , as of today :
Amazon S3 - Bulk storage and bandwidth for static content
Amazon EC2 - Pay by the hour CPU
NearlyFreeSpeech - Pay as you go web hosting for web pages , dynamic content , domains , DNS , etc
Sun Microsystems
Sun Grid -
Pay by the CPU hour
Strikeiron Web Services Marketplace - Pay per Web API call .
USi an AT&T company - USiPinnacle - Pay - as - you - go enterprise applications
Zimki - J avascript based utility computing system .
Pay by bandwidth , storage , and javascript operations .
ElasticLive Utility web hosting service based on Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud
InsynQ utility computing services
CPAASP online accounting solutions for on - demand enterprises
Distributed Potential Pay - Per - Use Grid Computing Capacity
Dell Inc. have a specific Cloud Computing Solution through their Datacenter Solutions Division
I believe this list will likely turn into The Five Computers :
Google ( Apps ) Amazon ( EC2 ) Microsoft ( Live ) Sun ( Grid ) A network of installed bots on every small computer , possibly built into the OS , to use idle CPU cycles for the collective .
This " 5th computer " will be the " remainder " after the first four , but might ultimately become the largest .
Perhaps it 's a larger number , but surely Amazon will buy Bay at some point , and Google will buy Salesforce.com , so they do n't count .
Computing will be moved into the Cloud .
It 's already happening , we 're 20 % there .
The idea has been around since the beginning , and it will , in my opinion , continue come up until it actually happens and we build Skynet .
One of these compute clouds will no doubt end up in orbit .
Living Teacher Gets High With Student , Arrested Police Seek More Information in the Case
A woman who was temporary teacher at Goleta Valley Junior High has been charged with providing and smoking marijuana with a 14 - year - old student whom she was tutoring .

One observation supporting this theory is that many sufferers immediately feel better when they enter the kind of moving environment that touched off the disorder in the first place — a boat , car or plane .
“ When I get in the car , I feel better , ” Mrs. Josselyn said , “ but when I get back out , it gets worse again . ”
According to Dr. Hain ’s theory , this is because their internal models are once again consistent with what is actually happening around them .

But not every doctor who has worked with mal de débarquement patients agrees with Dr. Hain and Dr. Oman ’s take on the condition .
Carlos Gordon , a neurologist at Meir Hospital in Kfar Saba , Israel , is not convinced there is a direct connection between long cruises and the persistent symptoms typically associated with the disease .
“ There ’s no proof that exposure to the abnormal environment is the cause , ” Dr. Gordon said .
“ There are many patients that have the same symptoms following head trauma or a viral infection without previous exposure to sailing . ”
He pointed out that since there is no laboratory examination to confirm the presence or absence of the condition — sufferers typically perform normally on standard tests of balance and coordination — there is no clear - cut reason to believe the disease has a defined physical cause .
Robert Baloh , a neurologist at the University of California , Los Angeles , hopes to resolve this dispute by taking a closer look at how the patients ’ minds actually work .
He is seeking approval to perform M.R.I. studies that would compare the neural activity of mal de débarquement patients with that of normal subjects and patients who are “ in remission , ” experiencing temporary relief from their symptoms .
“ The condition may be related to the brain areas that sense movement , the temporal and parietal lobes , ” Dr. Baloh said .
“ We want to see if there are differences in the way people process visual motion . ”
Zohar Nachum , a neurologist at the Israel Naval Medical Institute in Haifa , has performed one of the only studies to date that lends insight into specific abnormalities in patients ’ brain activity .
Dr. Nachum recruited 17 subjects who were prone to short - term bouts of mal de débarquement and 17 others who were not , sent them on a short sailing voyage , and performed neurological tests on them before and after the trip .
The sailors susceptible to mal de débarquement used less input from their vestibular and visual systems to maintain balance , and also had delayed motor responses to unexpected perturbations , such as when a boat rolls over a breaker .
These findings suggest that sufferers ’ brains may not rely enough on certain types of changing information from the environment for orientation .
Water cannons , riot vans and 16,000 police officers - one per protester - last night fanned out around the Baltic resort of Heiligendamm to end the protests .
More than 1,000 people were injured on Saturday in Rostock , the nearest city , in some of the most violent protests seen in postwar Germany .
The authorities are desperate to avoid a repeat of the violence that marred the 2001 G8 in Genoa , where a student was shot dead by police .
As 8,500 people yesterday marched in Rostock in favour of " global freedom of movement and equal rights " - one of a series of themed protest days in the run up to the summit's opening tomorrow - hundreds more were in camps just outside the seven miles of steel and barbed wire fencing guarding the G8 venue .
Four miles from the fence , protesters set up their own security around a 4,000 - strong camp in the village of Reddelich .
A wooden watchtower has been built to survey the tents and police beyond .
While the atmosphere in the camp was relaxed , with bratwurst and beer on sale , a children 's playground and bands and cabaret in the evening , groups also got to work practising how to evade capture and arrest by the police .
German police , newspapers and even some protesters have voiced doubts about the violent tactics during the weekend protests but organisers insisted their aim remained to shut down the G8 and their methods would be forceful .
Police said more than 400 officers and 520 demonstrators were hurt after a peaceful rally turned violent in Rostock on Saturday night .
Officers blamed the violence on 2,000 militants known as the " black block " - black - clad hooded and masked youths who attacked police lines .
Forty - nine people were arrested yesterday .

Glory without the guts
by Rob Ash , 8/25/2006
The wars in the Middle East grind on .
The situation looks grimmer than ever .
The United States and Iran appear perilously close to war .
In spite of all this death and destruction , not everyone is unhappy .
One young former Humboldt County resident named Anthony Mantova is about to get the war he has publicly wished for , even if he does not intend to personally participate .
...........................
Since he is such a fan of aggressive military solutions to solve the world ’s problems , he should be eager to enlist .
Mantova flatly refused to concede to serving the United States in the military .
The money quote from these conversations came when Mantova berated me for what he said was my “ hillbilly , intellectually vacant and morally repugnant belief that ‘ those who call for war must serve . ’ ”
A 24 - year - old , healthy man , Mantova — hypothetically at least — believes in “ personal responsibility ” and strongly defending America .
He ’s an outstanding candidate for military service .
He simply lacks the heart to sign up .
These days , Anthony Mantova is a young fellow on the rise in GOP politics .
He is the national field director for an organization called The Leadership Institute .
Based in Arlington , Va. , The Leadership Institute is a 501c3 advocacy foundation .
Created by longtime GOP operative Morton Blackwell , “ The Leadership Institutes mission is to identify , recruit , train and place conservatives in politics , government and the media . ”
................................
Karl Rove , Grover Norquist , Ralph Reed , Jack Abramoff and James Guckert ( aka Jeff Gannon ) are some notable graduates of The Leadership Institute .
............................
Some time ago , Anthony Mantova wrote a few guest opinions for The Eureka Reporter , all of which were resoundingly jingoistic .
One was called “ The Cost of Co-existence is Too High . ”
That last title begs the question , what cost is Anthony Mantova willing to pay ?
None , apparently .
Mantova is very enthusiastic about combat , just so long as someone else is doing the fighting .
He said it was unnecessary for him to enlist .
This , despite the fact that combat tours have been involuntarily extended .
Some troops have deployed into a war zone for the fourth time .
Mantova is of age , qualified to serve and has publicly , enthusiastically endorsed widening the war when there ’s a shortage of troops .
Why does n’t he sign up ?
Mantova gave me unconvincing answers .
He speculated how his enlistment might undermine civilian control of the military .
He compared himself favorably to the ancient Roman politician Cato the Elder , Winston Churchill and Socrates .
Clearly , Mantova has a very high opinion of his intellectual abilities .
Finally , Mantova demeaned all service members and veterans with his “ hillbilly , intellectually vacant and morally - repugnant ” comments and dismissed the very notion of military service .
He treated a deadly serious question as if it were a joke .
....................................
Guys like Mantova want all the glory without showing any of the guts .
Since he works for The Leadership Institute , Mantova must aspire to lead something , some day .
From what I can see , Mantova is showing no leadership qualities whatsoever — only glibness , smugness and self - preoccupation that borders on the sociopathic .
Those may get Mantova ahead in the short term , but will damage our country in the long run .
Is this the kind of leadership to which we can look forward ?
Let ’s hope not .
I ’m wishing Anthony Mantova a very brief undistinguished and unfulfilling career in politics .
America has already had way too much of his kind of leadership .
When people wonder why those rich , drunk kids get hammered for not serving , it 's cowards like this which do the driving of policy .
He wants to play risk with other people 's lives , lives like that IRR soldier now back in Iraq .
Sgt Mulligan may wind up dead or injured and asswipes like Mantova talk about war like it was some kind of game .
What 's even worse , it 's that these guys do n't even know how what they 're saying sounds .
It 's all been this backroom kind of thing , one the national media has n't touched .
They 'll ask a high school kid why he is n't signing on for our glorious colonial war in Iraq , but not people like this .
And it would be a hell of a story to see the kind of sneering contempt these fuckers have for military service and those in the military .

Cafferty struck a somber tone tonight after the House passed legislation that includes a war crimes immunity clause .
He rightfully asks , " what are we becoming ? "

Cafferty : President Bush is trying to pardon himself .
Here 's the deal : Under the War Crimes Act , violations of the Geneva Conventions are felonies , in some cases punishable by death .
When the Supreme Court ruled that the Geneva Convention applied to al Qaeda and Taliban detainees , President Bush and his boys were suddenly in big trouble .
They 've been working these prisoners over pretty good .
In an effort to avoid possible prosecution they 're trying to cram this bill through Congress before the end of the week before Congress adjourns .
The reason there 's such a rush to do this ?
If the Democrats get control of the House in November this kind of legislation probably would n't pass .
You wanna know the real disgrace about what these people are about to do or are in the process of doing ?
Senator Bill Frist and Congressman Dennis Hastert and their Republican stooges apparently do n't see anything wrong with this .
I really do wonder sometimes what we 're becoming in this country .

For the first time , Stanford researchers using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) have discovered that the brain 's ability to suppress irrelevant memories makes it easier for humans to remember what 's really important .
" It 's somewhat of a counter - intuitive idea , " said Brice Kuhl , a doctoral student working in the lab of Associate Professor Anthony Wagner of the Psychology Department .
" Remembering something actually has a cost for memories that are related but irrelevant . "
But this cost is beneficial :
The brain 's ability to weaken unimportant memories and experiences enables it to function more efficiently in the future , Kuhl said .
Kuhl and Wagner 's findings were published online June 3 in Nature Neuroscience in an article titled " Decreased Demands on Cognitive Control Reveal the Neural Processing Benefits of Forgetting . "
According to Wagner , the findings demonstrate the brain 's ability to discard irrelevant memories .
" Any act of remembering re-weights memories , tweaking them to try to be more adaptive for the next time you try to remember something , " he said .
" The brain is plastic — adaptive — and one feature of that is not just strengthening some memories but also suppressing or weakening others . "
This function , which is carried out in the prefrontal cortex region behind the forehead , helps the brain ; it does n't have to work as hard in the future when it tries to remember an important memory because the competing but irrelevant memories have been weakened .
" The prefrontal cortex is the CEO of the brain ; it governs cognition , bringing [ memories ] into line with your goals , " Wagner said .
" It 's an important property of our memory system that the memories change in both directions — they get both stronger and weaker — and that this confers benefits , " by allowing the brain to use less of its computational resources to recall what 's important , thereby making them available for other processes .
Memory allows humans to be predictive about what 's likely to be relevant to them as they go through life , Wagner explained .
" What forgetting does is allow the act of prediction to occur much more automatically , because you 've gotten rid of competing but irrelevant predictions , " he said .
" That 's very beneficial for a neural information processing system . "
The act of remembering is a complex cognitive activity because memory is associative , Wagner said , meaning that when someone , for example , thinks about what they ate for lunch the day before , it 's likely to tap into memories of other lunches .
" In order to remember , we need a set of mechanisms that allows us to select and target the memories we want , and allow them to win out over competing but irrelevant memories , " he said .
" So , initially , any act of retrieval is very resource intensive and places heavy demands on attention mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex . "
But when the competing but unimportant memories are successfully suppressed , fewer demands are placed on the frontal lobes to remember the relevant memories .

Dueling passwords and the experiment
In everyday life , memories compete with one another .
For example , a bank may require clients to change their passwords every six months for security reasons .
Initially , a client has only one password to remember .
But when a new password is introduced , that person 's efforts to remember it compete with his or her memory of the old one , and the mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex have to work hard to resolve which one to remember .
" The extent to which these brain mechanisms weaken the old password , then they do n't have to be used as much in future attempts to remember the new one , " Wagner said .
" From a neural standpoint , forgetting the old password makes the brain more efficient . "
With the help of fMRI , the psychologists demonstrated this benefit in their experiment .
Twenty Stanford students , 18 to 32 years old , took part in a three - hour study held in the Richard M. Lucas Center for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Imaging at Stanford .
Each participant was given 40 cue words and six attached associate words , such as ATTIC - junk and ATTIC - dust .
Each word pair flashed for four seconds on a screen inside the scanner .
" The key is that there were six memories being built for each cue word — six memories that might fight it out during attempts to remember , " Wagner said .
The participants had to practice remembering the pairs and were given cues , such as ATTIC-j , to enhance their ability to remember ATTIC - junk over other competing word pairs .
The students practiced the prompted word pair ATTIC - junk three times as the scanner recorded their brain activity .
The first time they practiced a pair , the prefrontal cortex actively " lit up " as it worked hard to form the new memory while competing with the other word pairs .
However , when the students practiced remembering the prompted word pair for a second and third time , their frontal lobes became less active .
" Critically , we observed a relationship between the level of this decrease in prefrontal activity and how likely it was that the participant would later forget the competing irrelevant pairs , " Kuhl said .
After about 20 minutes , the volunteers were tested on all the word pairs and , as expected , they best remembered the pairs they had practiced and forgot the competing words .
Moreover , the participants who forgot the most were the ones who showed the greatest decrease in prefrontal activity .
Although such behavior concerning memory and forgetting has been previously demonstrated , Kuhl said , the new study for the first time reveals the neural benefits of such forgetting .
" The motivation for doing the study was to link the changes in brain activity during selective remembering with later forgetting , " he said .
" This relationship powerfully illustrates a primary benefit of forgetting :
As irrelevant memories are forgotten , the neural systems that help us remember do not need to work as hard , " Wagner said .
" While forgetting can be frustrating , it may represent a fundamental benefit for our ability to remember . "
In addition to Kuhl and Wagner , co-authors are Nicole Dudukovic , a Stanford doctoral student in psychology , and Itamar Kahn , a former student in Wagner 's lab who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University .
The National Institute of Mental Health , the National Science Foundation , the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation supported the research .
Carbon Silicon see themselves as doing ' rock n roll in an adult way '
Carbon Silicon make all their recordings freely available online , and actively encourage bootlegging or filming of their gigs .
They even attack the current waves of litigation surrounding illegally copied music in their song Gangs Of England , which includes the line , " if you want the record , press record " .
" What we 're talking about here is fans who are sharing music , " Tony James , formally of Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Generation X - who formed the group with ex-Clash guitarist Mick Jones - told BBC World Service 's The Music Biz programme .
" It 's just like you did when you were young , when you made a cassette of your favourite tracks you 'd love , and would give it to a friend and say ' listen to this . '
" Everyone 's going to say , ' hang on - if they 've got it already , why are they going to buy the record ? '
But what we find is actually , people really like buying the records . "
Demos online
The music industry has been grappling with issues of piracy over the last few years , in particular since broadband became popular .
Artists who have backed anti-piracy campaigns , include Metallica , Tatu and Peter Gabriel .
Our ideas of copyright , and what constitutes a record , will change in the future
Tony James
In particular , he pointed out that people could now record songs in their bedrooms and make them available to the world , and new artists no longer needed " a label , or a manager , or a BBC Radio playlist " .
Carbon Silicon use their website to show the development of their songs .
Demos are put on the web so people can track how they came together .
" We feel that it 's almost like if I could go and watch Lennon and McCartney in the studio making Sgt Pepper , and watch them on the internet making that record , that would be a really exciting thing , " James explained .
" So I think what we 'll see in the future is people will pay to be there - to be part of the creative process .
That 's a really exciting thing .
" Our ideas of copyright , and what constitutes a record , will change in the future . "

In June 2004 , journalist Seymour Hersh reported in the New Yorker that Israelis operating in northern Iraq under the guise of businessmen were in fact cultivating Kurdish proxies to gather intelligence in preparation for possible future action against Iran .
About the same time , I too was hearing about Israelis operating in Kurdish northern Iraq .
First , from a former senior American diplomat who was invited by an Israeli American businessman to advise the Kurds on how to get billions of dollars they believed they were owed from the Saddam Hussein - era United Nations Oil - for - Food program .
The diplomat gave me the Israeli ’s name — Shlomi Michaels — and phone numbers for Michaels in Beverly Hills , Turkey , and Israel .
The diplomat had walked away from the project , put off by Michaels ’ temper , and also , he said , by doubts about what Michaels was really up to , and who he might really be working for .
So I was intrigued when , last summer , I read in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that Shlomi Michaels had become the subject of an Israeli government investigation for allegedly operating in Iraq without the required authorization from the Israeli authorities .
Not only had I known about Michaels for two years , I had spent about as long trying to understand if the Bush administration would embrace the regime - change policy of its Iran hawks , who believe that the solution to Iran ’s nuclear ambitions is to promote mass uprisings of ethnic minority and dissident groups such as the Kurds .
For much of the past year , I have been digging into the story of Shlomi Michaels ’ operations in Kurdistan , and his connections in Israel , the United States , and around the world .
My investigation took me to Israel early last fall , shortly after the Israeli war with Hezbollah , to talk with Israeli officials investigating Michaels , as well as one of Michaels ’ long - time American associates , and Michaels ’ business partner , the former Mossad chief Danny Yatom .
What I found was not the story I had expected .
Instead of Michaels being part of a covert operation to set up anti-Iranian proxies in Kurdish Iraq , I discovered that Michaels and his associates were part of an effort by the Kurds and their allies to lobby the West for greater power in Iraq , and greater clout in Washington , and at the same time , by a group of Israeli ex security officials to rekindle good relations with their historical allies the Kurds through joint infrastructure , economic development , and security projects .
It was , in other words , a story about influence - building , buying , and profit , albeit with subplots that were equal parts John le Carre and Keystone Kops , and a cast of characters ranging from ex-Mossad head Yatom to a former German superspy , with Israeli counterterrorism commandos , Kurdish political dynasties , powerful American lobbyists , Turkish business tycoons thrown in — not to mention millions of dollars stashed in Swiss bank accounts .
Yatom met me in the lobby of the Tel Aviv Sheraton at 7:30 am on a Sunday , the beginning of Israel ’s work week .
The ex-Mossad chief turned Labor Party member of parliament was on his way to his office at the Knesset after a stop at the gym , dressed casually in a white button down shirt and black jeans .
He spoke openly about his business relationship with Shlomi Michaels and the Kurdish venture they ’d developed together , noting that he was no longer involved in its operations ; after being elected to the Knesset in 2003 , he ’d put his business interests in a blind trust , as required by Israeli law .
Yatom said he and Michaels were introduced to key Iraqi Kurdish players by a European intelligence official whom he would n’t name ; interviews with his associates revealed that it was Bernd Schmidbauer , West Germany ’s intelligence chief in the 1990s .
Dubbed “ 008 ” for his intelligence adventures during the waning days of the Cold War , Schmidbauer — now a member of the German parliament — did not respond to numerous messages left with his offices in Berlin and in Heidelberg .
Shlomi Michaels was similarly elusive , despite messages left at several of his far - flung residences .
Fifty - two years old , six feet tall , and built , according to an acquaintance , “ like a brick shithouse , ” with the commando ’s trademark shaved head and a black belt in karate , Michaels splits his time between Israel and the United States , with detours to Switzerland , Turkey , and Kurdistan .
The elite counterterror officer turned entrepreneur and multimillionaire is well networked in Tel Aviv , Washington , and New York , where he taught a counterterrorism course at Columbia University in 2003 .
For a time , according to one source , he even ran a security consulting business in Los Angeles .
When the United States was preparing to invade Iraq , Michaels evidently saw an opportunity : According to his business associates , as well as public records and Israeli media reports , he reached out to contacts in Washington , seeking high powered lobbying help to get the Kurds a greater share of United Nations Oil - for - Food Program money , a fund set up by the UN in 1995 to use Iraq ’s oil revenues to provide Iraqis humanitarian supplies during international economic sanctions against Iraq .
During Saddam Hussein ’s rein , the Oil - for - Food “ revenue was spent in Arab parts of Iraq but not in Kurdistan , ” according to the Los Angeles Times .
“ Kurdistan ’s share of the fund was set at 13 % .
At least $ 4 billion accrued in Kurdistan ’s name , Kurdish officials say , and some contend that the amount could be as much as $ 5.5 billion . ”
The paper reported that in late June 2004 , just five days before he turned Iraq back over to domestic rule and flew out of Iraq , then - top US official in Iraq Paul Bremer ordered the transfer by three U.S. military helicopters of $ 1.4 billion in 100 dollar bills to Kurdistan — his calculation of the Kurds ’ share of Oil - for - Food funds ; but the Kurds and their advocates believe they are owed a few billion more .
It was so much cash — 15 tons ’ worth — the paper further reported , that no bank could be found in which to deposit it .
Even as he helped connect the Kurds to those who lobbied for them to receive more money , Michaels positioned himself to be in line for some of the cash .
A year before the invasion of Iraq , Yatom and Michaels had formed an investment and security consulting company called the Interop Group ( short for international operations group ) that has since done millions of dollars of business in Kurdish Iraq .
Michaels ’ main business in Iraq is a joint venture called the Kurdish Development Organization , or KUDO .
One American source describes Kudo as a joint venture between Michaels ’ company and the Barzani part of a Kurdish governmental entity .
According to a second American source ( who has at times offered differing accounts ) , KUDO is a venture between Michaels , Schmidbauer , Yatom , and members of the powerful Barzani Iraqi Kurdish political family .
According to this source , KUDO serves as a general service contractual liaison between the Kurdish Regional Government and the contractors for the massive $ 300 million project to build a new international airport in the Kurdish city of Irbil .
The main contractor on the airport project is a Turkish company called Mak - yol .
A third Michaels ’ company , Coloseum Consulting , is registered in Switzerland as an affiliated company of Interop , according to Swiss federal corporate registration papers .
More covertly , the Israeli newspapers Yedioth Ahronoth and Haaretz have reported , Michaels has also brought in former Israeli military officers to provide counterterrorism training to Kurdish security forces at a secret “ camp Z ” in Iraq .
Sources say the contract was mere “ bupkas ” — a few million dollars — and Michaels undertook the work out of friendship with then - Kurdish Minister of Interior and security chief Karim Sinjari , and also because the Kurds faced a threat from al Qaeda .
Whatever the reasoning , the execution of the “ Camp Z ” project was problematic .
In 2004 , according to Israeli media reports , Michaels ’ team brought in dozens of Israeli combat veterans through the Turkish - Iraqi Kurdish border , traveling on Israeli passports whose details were duly noted by Ankara .
Soon the Turkish government grew alarmed that Israeli military types were moving into northern Iraq , claiming to be agriculture advisers and the like .
The story made it to Israel , whose nationals are prohibited from doing business in Iraq without explicit government permission .
“ There is a legal state of war between Israel and Iraq , ” Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev told me .
“ It is therefore illegal for Israeli nationals to visit Iraq .
Hopefully that will change one day . ”
But since it has not yet , the news about Michaels ’ operation caused a stir ; making matters worse were Michaels ’ alleged feuds with his business partners over money .
One disgruntled former Israeli employee went to the Israeli press in the fall of 2005 , revealing with documents and photographs the extent of Michaels ’ involvement in Kurdistan .
The story kicked up controversy — Israeli operations are a source of paranoid fascination in the region — and led to two separate Israeli government investigations .
Exposure has also led to the necessary departure of almost all of the Israelis working for Michaels from northern Iraq .
( Speculation was further fanned by Seymour Hersh ’s 2004 New Yorker report that Israel is forging a “ plan B ” for Iraq that includes training Kurdish commandos and use them to infiltrate Iran and Syria . )
One of those probes — by the Israeli ministry of defense , which wanted to know why it had never been approached for export licenses for the Israeli defense and secure communications equipment sold in northern Iraq — has since been referred to the Israeli police and “ will continue as long as necessary , ” police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told me in an email last fall .
Skeptics dismiss the probe as a PR gesture aimed at the Turks , whose goodwill is critical to Israel and who resent any moves to arm the Kurds on their border
In fact , notes one former senior U.S. diplomat , “ Michaels said to me … he had the explicit approval of the Israeli government ” for his private business activities in Kurdish Iraq .
“ What they were trying to do is develop influence in the Kurdish area . ”
None of this activity has geopolitical implications , insists the Kurdish government ’s polished young representative in Washington , Qubad Talabani , who happens to be the son of Iraq ’s president , and whose family has been the historic rival of Michaels ’ partners in the Barzani clan .
In an interview in his offices on I Street , Talabani told me any Israeli business development activities in Kurdistan were “ purely private sector activities , ” and that “ Kurdistan is open for business . ”
As Talabani walked me out after my interview , we passed a poster advertising a new bi-weekly direct Austrian Airlines route from Vienna to Irbil , site of Michaels ’ airport project — a town of 990,000 people until recently served only by regional air carriers and charter flights .
“ We will become the gateway to Iraq , ” Talabani told me .
Plenty of non-Kurds would like to help — and make a little profit along the way .
According to lobbying records , the high powered , White House - connected lobbying firm , Barbour Griffith & Rogers , LLC has earned $ 800,000 promoting the Kurdistan Regional Government ’s interests since 2004 ; before hiring the firm , two U.S. sources say , Michaels had approached Jack Abramoff about representing the Kurds , but the discussions never went beyond the initial stages .
Russell Wilson , a former senior professional staffer for the House international relations committee who helped advise the Kurds on Washington representation and who was formerly listed as a non equity officer in Interop , notes that Kurdistan has many of the things the rest of Iraq lacks : “ It ’s safe , secure , it ’s geographically rich ” — features include plenty of unexplored potential oil and natural gas reserves — ” and the people are extremely nice . ”
Wilson says it was he who recommended in the spring of 2004 that the Kurds hire Ed Rogers , a former political director in the Bush I White House , of Barbour Griffith & Rogers as their Washington lobbyist .
In the end , Yatom and Michaels ’ business activities may well be evidence , as much as any covert U.S. interests , of the Kurds ’ superb gamesmanship , pragmatism , and sense of opportunity — instincts honed to a fine art by a people that , lacking durable proximate allies , has learned how to cultivate the enemies of its enemies .
The Mossad ’s former Irbil station chief , Eliezer Geizi Tsafrir , told me that like the Israelis , the Kurds regard themselves as an historically stateless people surrounded by hostile nations .
Back when Tsafrir served in Irbil , he even helped set up a Kurdish intelligence service , in cooperation with the Barzani patriarch , Mustafa Barzani .
“ They [ the Kurds ] approached us , saying they had nobody to help them in the world , and our people had suffered too , ” he said .
“ We supplied them with cannons , guns , anti-air equipment , all sorts of equipment , and even lobbying .
The contacts between us , and the sympathy , will last for generations to come . ”
