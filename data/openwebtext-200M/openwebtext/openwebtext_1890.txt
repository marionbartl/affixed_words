Scientists believe they have discovered the biggest migration of wild animals on Earth , with an aerial survey revealing vast herds of gazelle and antelope on the move in southern Sudan in a region which had been assumed to have been denuded of its wildlife by years of civil war .
The Wildlife Conservation Society , together with the autonomous government of South Sudan , has announced that a study of the area 's fauna had revealed an abundance of antelope , particularly of white - eared kob , in breathtaking numbers .
It 's official : " wiki " is now a fully - fledged member of the English lexicon , according to the latest update of the online Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) .
OED chief editor John Simpson said in a statement : " Words are included in the dictionary on the basis of the documentary evidence that we have collected about them .
A while ago this evidence suggested that wiki was starting to make a name for itself .
" We tracked it for several years , researched its origins and finally decided it was time to include it in the dictionary . "
Wiki has come a long way from its Hawaiian roots , Reuters notes , where " wiki wiki " means " quickly " .
The OED 's principal editor of new words , Graeme Diamond , explained : " That the word acquired a new meaning is attributed to the fact that commenting and editing on internet websites became faster . "
Other new boys in the OED include " asswipe " , " bathorhodopsin " , " claymation " , " irritainment " , " malware " , " technopreneur " and " zipperhead " .
And just in case our pals across the channel think it 's only they who are menaced by foreign imports , our beloved mother tongue now embraces " Bangla " , " capoeira " and - by the Lord Harry and Saint George - " citron pressé " and " crème fraîche " . ®
Worried friends and relatives have been waiting for news
The plane , which originated in Ivory Coast , came down after taking off in heavy rain from Douala en route to the Kenyan capital , Nairobi .
The Boeing 737-800 was carrying 114 people from more than 20 countries .
It was found in mangroves close to the airport in Douala , officials said .
There was no information on survivors .
" Kenya Airways regrets to confirm that its flight KQ 507 has been located on a mangrove swamp 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of Douala , " CEO Titus Naikuni told a news conference in Nairobi .
He said the reason the aircraft was not found earlier was because it was covered with trees .
Rescue workers were at the site , he said , but there was " no confirmed information about survivors or any possible casualties " .
Cameroon 's Minister of State for Territorial Administration , Hamidou Yaya Marafa , said that access to the site was very difficult .
Good record
Flight KQ 507 left Douala at 0005 on Saturday ( 2305 GMT Friday ) and was due in Kenya at 0615 ( 0315 GMT ) .
It sent a communication to the control tower in Douala shortly after take - off and later issued an automatic distress signal , Kenya Airways said .
Search efforts initially focused on dense jungle under the plane 's intended flight path from Douala and then on a swamp area where fishermen reported hearing noises the night the plane disappeared .
It was the fishermen who led rescuers to the site , Mr Naikuni said .
Officials said it was too early determine what caused the crash .
The aircraft was just six months old and part of a new fleet bought by the airline , which has a good safety record .
But in January 2000 , one of its planes crashed into the sea after taking off from Abidjan , killing 169 passengers .
Ten people survived .
I would swear this guy breaks every rule in physics and aerodynamics .
Give this guy an RC Apache helicopter , and we can go home .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts suffered a seizure and was taken to the hospital on Monday but a neurological evaluation showed no cause for concern , a Supreme Court spokeswoman said .

“ Chief Justice John Roberts , Jr. took a fall about 2 p.m. today near his summer home in Maine after suffering what doctors describe as a benign idiopathic seizure , ” court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement .
Arberg said Roberts , 52 , suffered minor scrapes in the fall but said he was “ fully recovered ” from the incident .
“ He was taken by ambulance to Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport , Maine , where he underwent a thorough neurological evaluation , which revealed no cause for concern , ” Arberg said .
Roberts , who experienced a similar seizure in 1993 , will remain overnight at the hospital as a precaution , Arberg said .
Roberts is the youngest of the nine Supreme Court justices .
He has no known medical conditions .
The chief justice was at his home near Port Clyde , Maine when he suffered the seizure .
The area around Port Clyde , midway up the coast of Maine , is known as a summer vacation spot .
Roberts and his wife , Jane , purchased the home about a year ago .
The Supreme Court has been in its three - month summer recess since the end of last month .
Roberts , a conservative , was appointed to the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush .
He took his seat on September 29 , 2005 , succeeding William Rehnquist , who died of cancer .
Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , Bush ’s other appointment to the court , helped push the court to the right in its just - ended term on issues including abortion and race in schools .

Good for you .
The lesson of how VHS made Betamax obsolete in the ’ 80s is still part of your folk memory , so you did n’t buy a Blu-ray or hd dvd player last December .
As a video refusenik , unsure which format would win the dvd wars , you demonstrated a sophisticated appreciation of product obsolescence and decided not to buy a new device until you knew it would play movies for years to come .
Or perhaps you ’re still smarting from being burned again and again by audio obsolescence :
Albums went to eight - tracks , and then to cassettes , before CDs were introduced .
With each change , audiophiles repurchased the classics .
These days , the champion of audio obsolescence is Apple , which successfully combined its iPod with a unique digital format ( aac ) .
By embracing a non-MP3 format , Apple locked you into its world .
Now , when your iPod breaks , you have a library of music that you ca n’t use on other players .
You have to buy another iPod .
Enjoy your music for as long as your iPods lasts .
Apple says that will be for years ; for us nitpickers that means about 13 months .
Yes , the secret is out .
After 13 months of heavy use , the lithium - ion battery of the iPod can lose more than half of its functionality .
You ’ll find that even though you recharge more often , your iPod can fade out by the end of a long day .
Simply put , even though an iPod can cost you $ 350 , these digital music players are designed to be disposable .
Then why not get a new battery ?
Good idea .
But Apple deliberately seals the battery inside the iPod.
Replacement costs $ 65 ( a new 1 - gig iPod shuffle costs $ 79 ) , takes several weeks , and worst of all — because the new battery comes in a refurbished and wiped - clean iPod — you ’ll lose all your songs .
Or you can say , “ Screw Apple , ” opt for an aftermarket battery kit , and repair your own machine .
It ’s easy , cheaper , and more fun than having Apple fix it .
The kit from Sonnet Inc. ( sonnettech.com ) is especially useful .
For $ 19.95 it includes a special iPod opening tool , but best of all it comes with a dvd showing exactly what to do .
If you ’re not into do - it - yourself , you could send your iPod to any one of the outfits such as Small Dog Electronics ( smalldog.com ) that repair or resell these digital throwaways .
But battery decline is only one way that Apple encourages speedy obsolescence .
Another is by introducing spiffy new models shortly after you ’ve acquired the latest thing .
December ’s iPod looks a little duller since the introduction of the iPhone , does n’t it ?
The screen is probably already scratched .
Time , then , to let you know about the three models of next - generation iPods that , scuttlebutt says , will be available this year .
As Steve Jobs said , “ If you …want the latest and greatest … you have to buy a new iPod at least once a year . ”
Yes , this is from the same man who wants you to know that “ Apple has a really strong environmental policy . ”
The fact that Apple ’s cofounder and ceo seems positively gleeful about the amount of waste his product generates is alarming , since the iPod is designed to be all too easy to throw away .
Of course , if you live near an Apple store , you can recycle your obsolete iPod for free .
But then , the iPod is only one small aspect of an avalanche of electronic waste that will soon overwhelm America .
Microsoft ’s recent release of its memory - hogging , graphics - intense Vista operating system will effectively render many existing PCs obsolete .
Industry analysts say that 95 percent of the household PCs in Great Britain wo n’t be able to run all of Vista ’s bells and whistles , and that only a third of laptops currently sold will be able to meet even its minimum requirements .
Sooner or later they will all be junked .
By 2009 , 300 million analog TVs in the United States will also become obsolete when America ’s broadcast signal format changes to digital .
( Sure , you will be able to get a set - top converter box — yet another gadget — but marketers are salivating at the chance to persuade you to buy a new TV . )
Meanwhile , in 2007 the 3 billionth cell phone — with its life span of about 18 months — will roll off an assembly line somewhere in Asia .
In this context , the disposability of the iPod and the fight among manufacturers over dvd formats seem irresponsible if not criminally negligent .
iPods are crammed with lead , mercury , and flame retardant , and the 70 million already sold represent a sizable amount of toxic chemicals that seep through landfills and contaminate groundwater .
Electronic waste accounts for 2 percent of America ’s trash in landfills but 70 percent of its toxic garbage .
In 2003 alone , 3 million tons of e-waste were generated in the United States .
The good news is that Americans are reacting to the greedy tactics of force - fed obsolescence in the best possible way .
Few people bought a new - format dvd player for Christmas , and disillusioned consumers are fighting e-waste .
Last December , Greenpeace activists bathed Apple ’s Fifth Avenue New York store in green floodlights to publicize the group ’s “ Green My Apple ” campaign that is aimed at shaming the iPod manufacturer into becoming more environmentally responsible .

ReactOS is a free and open - sourced operating system based on the Windows architecture , providing support for existing applications and drivers , and an alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system .
ReactOS 0.3.1
Mainly , the work focused on rewriting certain parts of the ReactOS Core ( kernel , HAL , bootloader , etc ) .
It ’s very hard to sum up the huge Changelog in an outline , but briefly :
Freeldr was improved
HAL ’s key areas have been significantly improved ( irql - related , bus support , kd - functions )
The Kernel experienced a massive rewrite of incompatible parts ( and is still in the process of improvement )
Run -time library ( Rtl ) got a lot of improvements and bugfixes
Bugs were fixed in kernel - mode drivers and a better USB driver was added
Registry - support has been greatly improved thanks to addition of “ cmlib ” , a library shared by the boot loader and the kernel to handle binary registry hives ; it even supports binary registry hives created by Windows
More fixes in the Win32 subsystem and user - mode DLLs
Boot video driver ( and a splash screen ) was added
Read through the changelog , and you will see the amount of changes in this release !
However , there are a few things worth mentioning .
First of all , please do n’t forget this is an alpha - stage operating system , which means it is not suitable to replace your main OS ( due to stability and compatibility concerns ) .
And second , this release is aimed to be run mostly in virtualizers / emulators ( like QEmu , VMWare , Parallels , etc ) : because of the big amount of changes , our development team was not able to test / fix all problems which arise when running ReactOS on real hardware .
Note :
This project is still in Alpha state ..
But has shown massive improvements which is a good point .

Creating an internal DSL ( or embedded DSL ) is challenging , but it does provide many advantages .
One advantage to expressing your business rules in an internal DSL is the ability to execute them in various contexts .
By executing the DSL in various contexts you can generate multiple behaviors from the same business rule .
When the rule changes over time , all parts of the system that reference the rule will also be changed .
For example assume you work for a casino and you have been tasked with designing a system that will notify the poker room employees when a new table needs to be opened or when you are looking to open a new table .
The rules for opening a table vary based on the stakes of the table and the length of the waiting list .
For example , you need more people waiting for a no limit game because people go broke more quickly and you do n't want the table to be short - handed shortly after you open it .
The rules would be expressed in your DSL like this :
The first context in which I will execute the DSL is the context that notifies the employees .
ContextOne uses the DSL to check the List for the size per stakes and sends notifications when necessary .
This is of course sample code and my List object is just a stub to verify that everything works correctly .
I 'll add a link to the sample code at the end of the post .
Based on this same script you could execute a second context that returns a list of the different games that are currently being spread .
As you can see , adding additional contexts is very easy .
Another could be added to display all positions that are set up to receive notices .
Executing a DSL script in multiple contexts begins to blur the line between code and data .
The script ' code ' can also be executed to do things such as generate reports ( i.e. A report of which employees are contacted by the system ) .
The script could also be executed in a context that will show how long before a table will be opened ( i.e. the rule states that 15 are needed , the system knows 10 are on the list so it displays the message ' 5 more people needed before the game can start ' ) .
A note on implementation :
In my experience it is much easier to create a class per context and execute in the scope of that object .
An alternative is to execute the script in the scope of one object that creates a generic object graph .
The problem with this approach is finding an object graph that is generic enough to be useful in several situations .
Clearly , I prefer the first approach .

When did Microsoft lose its status among open - source developers as the evil , or better still , incompetent empire ?
When did open - source developers stop trying to make software better than Microsoft's and start imitating everything Microsoft does ?
Why do we have to have an open - source Outlook , or an open - source dotNet ?
Sure , there are examples of how we do things better in Linux than Windows .
But I 'm getting really tired of the monkey see Microsoft , monkey do Microsoft mentality that has infected open source .
And the operative word here is “ monkey ” -- hint , hint .
Aside from being open and free , is n't superiority what got Linux where it is today ?
Once upon a time , Microsoft was under intense pressure to catch up to Linux stability ( in my unhumble opinion , Microsoft still has a long way to go ) .
Now we have several projects that exist for no other reason than to to catch up to and duplicate Microsoft software .
Worse , we 're duplicating architectural nightmares like the registry , and with no other apparent purpose than to be more like Windows .
I have nothing against cream - skimming the best features of Windows for use in Linux .
But creating a registry for Linux is not cream - skimming .
It 's pond - scum - skimming .
What happened to the days when people were appalled at the idea that you'd have to edit a registry in order to make this or that feature work the way you wanted ?
I do n't care if the registry is binary or XML .
It 's a maintenance nightmare .
Next time you visit Redmond , take a look at big hole with teeth marks in the Microsoft butt .
That 's a “ came back and bit it ” bite mark left by the registry .
While Microsoft is trying to get around its mistakes , we 're busy duplicating them .
Here 's another example .
Emulating what OLE 2.0 brought to Microsoft Office is not cream - skimming .
It 's biohazardous - medical - waste - skimming .
I remember the original Microsoft demos of OLE 2.0 .
You paste spreadsheet cells into a Word document .
You click on the cells and the word processor magically transforms into a spreadsheet program .
That makes good demo , but did anyone ask what real value it offers ?
Aside from looking cool , that is ?
This feature is bad not because of what it does , but because of what it fails to do .
It fails to make it easy to create a live link between the original spreadsheet data and what you paste into the document .
Fortunately , not everyone has imbibed from the punch bowl of Microsoft cool - aid .
EIOffice , although it looks and feels more like Microsoft Office than OpenOffice.org or KOffice , actually came up with a fresh idea .
Imagine that .
Innovation .
But it took a commercial company , not an Open Source community , to do it .
The folks at Evermore Software ( the makers of EIOffice ) must have at least one non-Microsoft drone on board to enlighten the developers as to what really matters .
EIOffice gives you a menu selection to paste a bit of spreadsheet into a document where the cells are live - linked to the original spreadsheet data .
And this next bit of information should send open - source fanatics into a tizzy .
EIOffice is based on that evil , despicable language called Java .
How dare they ?
Mono C# , Python , Ruby , maybe even Perl. But Java ?
Wo n't that encourage Sun to become dictator of the world if EIOffice gets popular ?
It 's perfectly fine to copy Win32 DLLs in order to make Linux do Windows tasks , but heaven forbid Linux should be infected with a Java runtime .
How Sun replaced Microsoft as the evil empire is beyond me .
But do n't get me started on that .
Back to OLE 2.0 and its successors .
Of course , the OpenOffice.org and KOffice folks have faithfully duplicated this monstrosity .
Hey , it 's how Microsoft Office works .
It must be the way to go , right ?
That 's what they want you to think .
Who is they ?
I do n't know , but I can't help but wonder if one or more people within some of these open - source projects are Microsoft moles .
“ Here 's the plan .
Infiltrate the Open Source community and neutralize it .
Convince them that the only way to compete with Microsoft is to create open - source versions of Microsoft 's great software and development tools .
Without our patents , you 'll always be several steps behind everything we do .
And the fact that you 're imitating us makes us look like the clear innovation leaders .
End result ?
Free advertising and marginalization of the value of having Linux . ”
It 's time to boot the Microsoft suck - ups out of the Open Source community .
Give them a free copy of Windows XP , Visual Studio dotNet and two months to use these to create a navigation system for the rocket we 'll use to send them to Mars .
Yeah , but what do I really think ?
An axis of information .
A resource for those wanting to connect to the urban & ethnic communities in the city of Fresno .

The Republic of Cascadia stretches from 42° to 60° north latitude .
Its western border consists of the Pacific coast and a portion of the American state of Alaska .
On the east , it borders the American states of Idaho and Montana and the Canadian province of Alberta .
Cascadia is divided into three prefectures : British Columbia , Oregon , and Washington .
Government :
Cascadia is a constitutional republic that guarantees its citizens their basic rights , including freedom of speech , freedom of religion , and the right to a fair trial with a jury of peers .
It has a strong democratic tradition and universal suffrage .
The seat of the national government is in the capital city of Cascadia , which is tucked safely away from centers of urban decadence .
Resources :
Cascadia has abundant natural resources .
Vast forests provide it with ample timber for both export and domestic use .
Rich fish and shellfish stocks also supply valuable exports as well as powerful brain - food for its citizens .
Raging rivers and vulcanism offer cheap and renewable forms of hydrodynamic and geothermal power generation .
Its many harbors and protected waterways give Cascadia an edge when it comes to trans -Pacific shipping .
Its natural resources are exceeded only by its industrial resources .
The Cascadian software and biotechnology industries lead the world in innovation and market - share dominance .

Three workers killed and three wounded in blast
Blow for Virgin space programme as prototype rockets go up in smoke
Richard Branson 's plans to run the first commercial space flight service were thrown into disarray yesterday after an explosion during a test of the rocket 's propulsion system left three workers dead and three seriously wounded with shrapnel injuries and burns .
Witnesses at the world 's first commercial spaceport at Mojave in California , said the explosion was accompanied by a blast that sounded like a 500 lb bomb .
The accident happened at 2.34 pm local time on Thursday during tests of the propulsion system used in the new SpaceShipTwo - the prototype for Virgin Galactic 's eight - seater private rockets .
The system is hybrid , using both solid fuels and liquid oxidisers , a combination chosen paradoxically because it is safer than solid fuels alone .
Two workers were killed at the scene while the third died later in hospital .
The billionaire entrepreneur has invested at least $ 200 m ( £ 99 m ) in the groundbreaking work of Scaled Composites , the company leading the mission that launched the first private manned flight into space in October 2004 .
Sir Richard 's spokesman Will Whitehorn yesterday declined to comment on the incident until it had been properly investigated .
The blast is a setback for Burt Rutan , the maverick and secretive aerospace designer who is pioneering the development of the rockets .
Described by those in the business as a studious , quiet genius , Mr Rutan made his name creating experimental planes before he branched out into private space travel .
Clearly shaken , he told a press conference that the accident was " a very big deal " .
He said he did n't know what went wrong : " We felt it was completely safe . "
The accident comes at a bad time for his company as Scaled Composites is in the closing stages of being sold to another firm , Northrop Grumman .
It is also awkward timing for Sir Richard who has pledged to start commercial space flights in 2009 .
The inquiry into the incident is likely to cause delays , though some analysts estimated they may be no more than six to nine months .
Under the Branson / Rutan plans , would - be space travellers will pay $ 200,000 for one of six passenger seats on SpaceShipTwo .
They would feel the thrust of the rocket 's engines that propel the vehicle from 140 knots to supersonic speeds in about 10 seconds .
As one of the pilots from the first series of three flights in SpaceShipOne put it : " Boy , that first 10 seconds is about the most dynamic flying I 've ever done . "
The ship would then rise to 62 miles above the ground , giving the passengers and two pilots views back over Earth and the experience of five minutes ' worth of weightlessness .
The test that went awry involved the passing of pressurised nitrous oxide through an injector to gauge its performance - a process known as " cold flow " .
There was no flame present and no fuel , and observers were baffled as to why the nitrous oxide , or laughing gas , should have ignited .
Similar tests had been conducted without incident on SpaceShipOne , the first prototype developed by Scaled Composites , which made the 2004 manned commercial debut and was funded by Paul Allen , co-founder of Microsoft .
" Nitrous oxide is something that is often handled , it is not a particularly exotic material , " said John Loizou of Vega , an aerospace technology company .
He said that while tragic , the accident did not reflect on the safety of the nascent space tourism industry .
" It 's not the same thing as a flight test accident .
You ca n't extrapolate from this to the safety of the operating system . "
Though the technology involved in travel into space is decades old , it is only now that it is being applied commercially .
Brett Alexander , president of the Personal Spaceflight Federation that represents 18 companies and organisations , said that at least six firms were actively developing commercial manned rockets .
How the explosion will impact on the timetable of the Branson launch will have deep resonance for the residents of Mojave , a community of just 4,000 people in the desert .
About 1,500 of them work at the spaceport .
Bill Deaver , editor of the weekly Mojave Desert News , said the community has always been engaged in pioneering travel since the days in the 1880s when it developed the 20 - mule team wagons used to pull borax from the local mines .
" This is the kind of place where when you look up at the sky you may see a restored world war two fighter or there may be something you have never seen before .
People are constantly pushing out the envelope . "
Scaled Composites uses part of the isolated airport , a former US air force base , as a testing facility for its space ventures .
A number of other companies - including other commercial space ventures - used the Mojave facility for testing , said Stuart Witt , the site 's general manager .
" What we do is inherently risky , " he said .
" These are not the days we look forward to , but we deal with it . "
A local hospital spokesman said two of the three injured workers were in a critical condition and one was serious .
All were suffering numerous shrapnel wounds .

The Blackstone Group , the big buyout firm , has devised a way for its partners to effectively avoid paying taxes on $ 3.7 billion , the bulk of what it raised last month from selling shares to the public .
Although they will initially pay $ 553 million in taxes , the partners will get that back , and about $ 200 million more , from the government over the long term .
The plan , laid out in the fine print of Blackstone ’s financial documents , comes as Congress debates how much managers at private equity firms like Blackstone and hedge funds should pay in taxes on their compensation .
Lee Sheppard , a tax lawyer who critiques deals for Tax Notes magazine and has studied the Blackstone arrangement , said it was a reminder of the disconnect between the tax debate in Congress and how the tax system actually operates at the highest levels of the economy .

A reader transcribed this exchange concerning habeas corpus from today 's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings ( no official transcript yet ) :
Specter : Now wait a minute , wait a minute .
The Constitution says you can't take it away except in the case of invasion or rebellion .
Does n't that mean you have the right of habeas corpus ?
Gonzales : I meant by that comment that the Constitution does n't say that every individual in the United States or every citizen has or is assured the right of habeas corpus .
It does n't say that .

IfP ’s Jodin Morey — Quotes from Kwwl.com
Iowa Delaware Senator Joe Biden says a case could be made to impeach President Bush .
Of course .
But he says that would be impractical and possibly create unintended consequences .
Since when is accountability impractical ?
How does he define impractical ?
Is a criminal justice system impractical ?
Is he saying it will take too long ?
Nixon resigned after two months of impeachment hearings .
Clinton was impeached after 6 months .
Unintended consequences ?
Does he mean politically ?
So , Biden would rather win elections than do what ’s right for the country ?
I believe the public is willing to throw additional support to any party that holds our elected officials accountable for their actions .
This has been historically true with every single impeachment effort launched .
And this impeachment effort would begin with majority support ( unlike most past impeachments , including Nixon ) .
He says impeaching Bush would be bad politics — and possible create the unintended consequence of creating President Cheney .
The most recent impeachment resolution introduced by McKinney included Bush , Cheney , and Rice .
Although , even if we only initially pursue Bush , initiating the impeachment process will lead to an investigation that will implicate lots of people in the Bush administration who are guilty of committing crimes , including Cheney .
In addition , no matter who we get to replace Bush , we ’ll be showing those in power that anyone who breaks the law will be held accountable .
Biden also says the nation ’s reputation abroad would not be repaired until there is a new president and Bush policies are abolished or altered .
He says Bush has squandered the opportunity to unite and lead the world and has left the U - S less safe from tyranny and terrorism .
Indeed , but his conclusion is that despite all this , he should sit on his hands and let Bush continue to kill troops and Iraqis abroad , and eliminate our Constitutional rights at home while ignoring his oath of office to defend the Constitution .

I 've dashed off the first - cut of an " install the Lisp world on my virgin computer " shell script called clbuild .
The idea is that a newbie Common Lisp free - software hacker can run :
sh ./ clbuild build
and grab a coffee while it automatically downloads the latest versions of important Common Lisp programs and libraries and installs them in a directory tree safely away from their own stuff .
Running the script again will update from all the repositories and compile as needed .
This all makes it easy to bootstrap a Common Lisp environment and saves you chasing down a lot of different packages .
The next step is to run :
sh ./ clbuild mcclim-listener
and wait a few tens of seconds to see the McCLIM listener pop up in a window .
If you 'd like to contribute support for more packages you can snarf the darcs version :
darcs get http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/misc/repo/clbuild
and mail changes to luke@member.fsf.org .
The inspiration is jhbuild by James Henstridge .

It is n’t quite Reagan and Gorbachev in Reykjavik , but on a Tuesday afternoon in the 2 Penn Plaza offices of ABC Radio , two titans of clashing ideologies come face to face .
Fresh off his daily one - hour ESPN broadcast with former SportsCenter co-anchor and longtime pal Dan Patrick , Keith Olbermann spies a familiar figure settling into Studio B for his afternoon shift .
Olbermann , his anchor - issue trench coat tucked under an arm , opens the door and thrusts a hand toward Sean Hannity .
“ Mr. Hannity , good to see you , sir , ” says Olbermann .
Off - camera Olbermann , it turns out , is a lot like on - camera Olbermann .
The gray pin-striped suit is perfectly crisp .
The basso profundo booms .
The outsize ego and acid tone ooze from him .
It ’s unclear whether the mannerisms are real or a bit of an ironic put - on that became Olbermann ’s default setting after a time .
“ Keith , how you been ? ” Hannity asks with a grin .
The congeniality is a bit startling .
Olbermann is the ornery host of MSNBC ’s Countdown and a newly minted , if unintentional , hero of the left .
Five nights a week , he gives the president a beat - down so severe that it almost makes you feel sorry for the man ( almost ) .
Hannity , meanwhile , is a Fox News icon with a major Rudy Giuliani crush .
Nevertheless , the two men chitchat pleasantly until Hannity realizes a reporter is present and freaks .
“ This is off the record , ” says Hannity , perhaps fearing a red - state backlash .
“ Well , you can say I think Keith is a great guy . ”
Olbermann displays no such penchant for diplomacy .
After the two say good - bye , he heads downstairs to a waiting Town Car that will take him to MSNBC ’s Secaucus , New Jersey , studios .
“ I have n’t figured out who will be my ‘ Worst Person in the World ’ for today , ” he says .
“ Worst Person in the World ” is a nightly feature of Countdown .
Some days , the Worst Person is a Rummy - or Gonzales - quality viper .
Some days , it ’s a hapless soul whose lone mistake is trying to make a living in Olbermann ’s chosen profession .
Olbermann ’s arch - nemesis , Bill O’Reilly , has earned the distinction scores of times .
Hannity , a multiple Worst Person himself , is barely out of earshot when Olbermann finishes the thought .
“ I ’m sure there wo n’t be a shortage of candidates . ”
Keith Olbermann is pissed off .
That ’s nothing new .
Keith Olbermann has been pissed off since he could lift the toilet seat .
What ’s new is that the 48 - year - old Olbermann has lately taken to directing his considerable , bred - in - the - bone rage at high - value targets .
That ’s a fresh wrinkle .
Yes , at ESPN , Olbermann was hugely popular — a pioneer in the now - stultifying genre of the loudmouthed , blow - dried smart - ass sports anchor .
But in the end , this was sports .
How much did it matter , really , that Bobby Knight tossed another chair ?
After ESPN , Olbermann took a job hosting a nightly hour - long talk show called The Big Show for the then - fledgling MSNBC ( he also occasionally hosted sports programming and sporadically anchored the weekend news for NBC ) .
On that program , Olbermann offered wry commentary about Monica Lewinsky and similar fodder , but again , his bombast seemed out of proportion to the issues at hand .
As an employee , Olbermann was his own kind of Worst Person in the World .
His sense of superiority and caustic vibe eventually cost him gigs and friends at three networks .
How naughty was he ?
Olbermann was the only former ESPN star not invited back for the sports network ’s 25th anniversary ( he ’s allowed to participate on Patrick ’s radio show only because Patrick promised that Olbermann would never set foot on the network ’s Bristol , Connecticut , campus ) .
He was fired from his first stint at MSNBC after he denounced his own show in a commencement address at his alma mater .
Fox hired him to host its major - league baseball Game of the Week and then sent him home with a year left on his contract simply for being a malcontent .
That was then .
Now , in his second go - round at MSNBC , Olbermann is doing politics , and he ’s found his sweet spot .
In politics , incompetence does n’t lose pennants ; it gets teenagers killed in a faraway land .
Suddenly , viewers did n’t see Olbermann hauling off on hapless foes ; they saw him speaking truth to power .
“ I think there was a lot of times where Keith ’s anger was directed to targets not worthy of his anger , ” says Dan Patrick .
“ Now he ’s going after presidents and secretaries of State .
They ’re more worthy than Barry Bonds or a network executive . ”
Viewers also see a lefty who is n’t afraid to mix it up — Keith the Impaler .
Ever since Olbermann ripped into Donald Rumsfeld in a much talked - about August 2006 Countdown segment , his popularity has soared .
Improbably enough , the former SportsCenter anchor has even been credited with helping to effect the Democratic takeover of Congress this past November .
Here , at the outset of the 2008 presidential season , Keith Olbermann may not be as popular or influential as Rush Limbaugh , but Olbermann has his own dittoheads ( Olberites ? ) .
They just happen to drive Honda Elements with a dedicated iPod port .

It ’s a couple of hours before his nightly broadcast , and Olbermann is looking through boxes of mail in his Secaucus office .
“ Maybe this one contains Chris Matthews ’s eyebrows , ” he says , referring to his fellow MSNBC host .
“ You see them last night ?
Did he borrow them from Joe Pesci ? ”
When it ’s time for the show to begin , Olbermann sits alone on the Countdown set .
Tonight , Newsweek ’s Jonathan Alter is in the studio for a conversation , but he ’s tucked into an auxiliary room ( Olbermann does n’t share the Countdown stage with anyone ) .
After Alter talks about global warming , there ’s a segment on the Scooter Libby trial followed by video of Paul Wolfowitz at a Turkish mosque , taking off his shoes and exposing socks with holes in them .
“ Wolfowitz seems completely unembarrassed by the ordeal , ” says Olbermann .
“ Then again , after Iraq , how could you be embarrassed by anything ? ”
He segues into a segment on a chicken born with duck feet .
I ’m watching from the wings with Jeremy Gaines , an MSNBC flack .
“ Did you hear that snort he just did ? ” asks Gaines .
“ That ’s Keith ’s imitation of Matthews . ”
Gaines then bites his lip as if to say “ oops . ”
He tries to respin .
“ But they really , really like each other . ”
Bill O’Reilly has liberal guests on so he can skewer them .
Olbermann ’s visitors are affable yes - men providing can - I - get - a - witness nods to the latest gem proffered by their all - knowing host .
After a commercial , Olbermann interviews Countdown regular John Dean on the Bush administration ’s alleged abuse of executive orders .
Olbermann eventually does “ Worst Person in the World . ”
Tonight , he gives the silver medal to O’Reilly for supposedly blaming the victim in a child - kidnapping case .
Then he gives O’Reilly the gold as well for promising to send a copy of his latest book to an American soldier for every copy bought at full price .
“ Bill , why do you hate the troops ? ” mocks Olbermann .
During the final break , Olbermann checks his hair in a Snow White–size mirror and twiddles his BlackBerry .
Then he launches into another five - minute pummeling of the president .
Tonight , he ’s questioning the authenticity of the four terrorist plots that Bush , in his State of the Union speech , said his administration had foiled .
“ What you gave us a week ago tonight , sir , was not intelligence but rather a walk - through of how speculation and innuendo , guesswork and paranoia , daydreaming and fearmongering combined in your mind and the minds of those in your government into proof of your derring - do and your success against the terrorists , the ones that did n’t have anthrax , the ones who did n’t have plane tickets or passports , the ones who did n’t have any clue , let alone any plots . ”
A moment later , Olbermann ends the show with Edward R. Murrow ’s “ Good night and good luck ” ( Murrow was an Olbermann boyhood hero ) .
Then Olbermann tosses his script pages into the air , and he ’s done for the night .
The whole affair is classic Countdown : moments of juvenile absurdity followed by moments of biting , sincere , and genuinely affecting commentary .
Olbermann has been hosting Countdown since March 2003 , the month the U.S. invaded Iraq , and the show has grown progressively anti-Bush as the situation there has deteriorated .
But it was n’t until last August — when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was implying that those in favor of staying the course in Iraq were Churchillian while those opposed were modern - day Neville Chamberlains — that Countdown began to click .
“ I was sitting on the tarmac in L.A. , ” recalls Olbermann over lunch at the Meridien Hotel .
“ I ’d exhausted all conversations with James Gandolfini , who was on the flight .
And I thought , ‘ Where is the outrage ?
Where are the constitutional - scholar conservatives coming out and going , “ This guy is a danger to the democracy .
Not to the Democrats or Republicans but to the democracy . ”
Where is that person ? ’ ”
Olbermann pauses .
“ Then I thought , ‘ Oh , yeah , I have a newscast , do n’t I ?
I have editorial latitude , do n’t I ?
Well , I guess it ’s my turn .
Let me strap the jetpack on . ’ ”
The next night , Olbermann delivered a six - minute jeremiad against Rumsfeld .
It began with the lines , “ The man who sees absolutes where all other men see nuances and shades of meaning is either a prophet or a quack .
Donald H. Rumsfeld is not a prophet . ”
Olbermann ’s outrage read real , not focus - group manufactured like much of cable punditry .
Even a Bush acolyte had to admire Olbermann ’s eloquence .
Suddenly , Olbermann was a player in the war debate .
Countdown ’s ratings spiked , making it MSNBC ’s most - watched show .
Everyone from the Washington Post to the National Review was talking about Olbermann as a pop liberal antagonist .
On the streets of Manhattan , strangers began flashing him thumbs - up .
One afternoon a few weeks ago , I was having lunch with Olbermann when no less a left - wing eminence than Ted Danson approached him .
“ Excuse me , I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate what you ’re doing every night , ” Danson offered .
“ Thank you , and keep it up . ”

“ People say , ‘ You may have been the difference in the election , ’ ” says Olbermann .
He gives a shudder .
I ca n’t tell whether it ’s genuine revulsion or managed humility .
“ I ’m like , ‘ Oh , Christ , I do n’t want that . ’
I ’m not out for some power trip on this .
I have some personal and professional ambition , but in terms of influence , I just want to see the truth out there . ”
Olbermann says he does n’t vote , and he insists his Bush bashing is n’t ideological .
“ Look , I did n’t begin this show in 2003 with ‘ This is a damn - fool war , ’ ” says Olbermann .
“ We in the media were guilty of assuming our government would n’t lie to get us into war .
We were largely exploited because we gave them the benefit of the doubt after 9/11 .
They could n’t have choreographed it any better if they tried .
What angers me is their certainty .
The closer you get to something , the less certain you should be of your position .
That does n’t happen with these people .
The number of opportunities and chances to redirect this that have been missed is tragic . ”
Up until January , everyone who counted was a Republican , says Olbermann .
“ If the Democrats continue to drag their feet on what the country surely wants , which is non-escalation , I ’ll go after them in the same terms : ‘ Why are you not listening ?
Who do you think you answer to ? ’ ”
It may be true that the roots of Olbermann ’s rage are n’t political , strictly speaking .
His anti-Bush rants are as much about a kind of reflexive populist anger as anything .
But it ’s also true that Olbermann does n’t tend to go after Democrats with the same bloodthirsty zeal with which he attacks the Republicans .
In January , when Olbermann asked Hillary Clinton , “ Would you apply the word mistake to your vote to authorize the war in Iraq ? ” she bobbed and weaved and never answered the question .
Olbermann did n’t follow up and instead steered the dialogue to safer ground .
In October , Olbermann ran a prerecorded segment of an interview he did with Bill Clinton , at the end of the Clinton Global Initiative meetings .
One of the ideas discussed at the conference involved creating educational opportunities in Africa .
Before he asked his first question , Olbermann handed Bill a check , saying , “ Here ’s eight more schools in Kenya from me . ”
While the thought might have been noble , the gesture did n’t exactly smack of political objectivity .
It probably wo n’t come as much of a surprise that when Keith Olbermann was a kid , he got the tar kicked out of him on a regular basis .
And not by the football team .
“ I got beat up by girls all the time , ” says Olbermann .
“ They literally posted a sign - up sheet and would take turns .
I think that ’s why I ’ve always been such a fan of Mencken ’s line , ‘ Afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted . ’
I ’ve been afflicted . ”
Olbermann ’s affliction began at age 5 , when his Westchester parents — his father was an architect , his mother a preschool teacher — jumped Olbermann from kindergarten to second grade .
“ I do n’t recommend that , ” says Olbermann .
“ I was always trying to match my intellectual maturity with an equal emotional maturity , and it did n’t work . ”
At age 9 , Olbermann started collecting baseball cards , even climbing into Dumpsters to collect special 3 - D editions thrown out with Twinkie boxes .
On television , Olbermann was entranced by former iconoclastic Yankee turned New York sports anchor Jim Bouton .
On the radio , he avidly listened to Bob and Ray , the deadpan New York comedy duo who dominated the AM dial in the fifties and sixties .
He also memorized late - night reruns of Murrow broadcasts .
In junior high , Olbermann spent his summers poring over transcripts of the Army - McCarthy hearings and reading Teddy White ’s Making of the President books .
By high school , Olbermann decided he wanted to be a broadcaster .
At the Hackley School in Tarrytown , he met an older kid named Chris Berman ( the future ESPN fixture ) , and the two classmates ran a half - watt school radio station .
Graduating at 16 , Olbermann shipped off to Cornell as the school ’s youngest freshman .
It was n’t much fun .
His parents went to extreme lengths to make his dorm room the only one in Ithaca with cable TV .
Between tearful calls home , Olbermann sat alone and watched the tube .
“ Thank God for Monty Python ’s Flying Circus , ” says Olbermann .
“ Or I might not have made it . ”
Olbermann skipped classes to report for his college radio station on the championship Yankees teams of the late seventies .
After graduating , he landed sports - anchor jobs in Boston and Los Angeles .
Olbermann ’s L.A. sportscast sometimes finished seventh behind reruns of Spanish - language soap operas , but people noticed the quirky guy who once ate prime rib during a broadcast .
In 1992 , ESPN director of programming John Walsh hired Olbermann and paired him with Dan Patrick to host the 11 p.m. edition of SportsCenter .
The smart - ass New Yorker and the Ohio high - school hoops star quickly established a winning , irreverent rapport .
There were T - shirt - launching catchphrases , like Patrick ’s “ En fuego ” and Olbermann ’s “ If you ’re scoring at home , or even if you ’re alone … , ” and the pair became the model for sports anchors as TV stars .
Eventually , Aaron Sorkin would base his sitcom SportsNight on the duo .
( Olbermann once claimed that both characters were based on him . )

Still , where some saw a brash breath of fresh air , others saw a self - righteous gasbag .
And despite the show ’s unprecedented success ( Olbermann and Patrick were SportsCenter ’s most popular duo ) , Olbermann was a world - class agitator .
He began firing off thousand - word memos to management , lobbying on causes from saner hours for lowly production assistants to profit - sharing for ESPN employees who were helping the network generate billions .
Along the way , he won a reputation as a miserable jerk .
“ Of all the people I ’ve known inside and outside of the business , he was the unhappiest , ” recalls a SportsCenter staffer .
“ Sometimes , at the end of the night , I ’d leave early just so I would n’t have to give him a ride home .
And it was n’t out of my way . ”
In 1997 , Walsh allowed Olbermann ’s contract to expire , and Olbermann escaped to his NBC and MSNBC gigs .
“ I ’d always wanted to do news , ” says Olbermann .
“ But every time I had a chance to leave sports for news , I ’d find a reason not to do it . ”
In quintessential Olbermann form , he was ready to quit the show before it started .
That Labor Day weekend found him in the Hamptons along with then–Today - show producer Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin , a longtime Olbermann friend and soon - to - be producer of his MSNBC show .
The weekend was going well until news came in that Princess Diana ’s limo had crashed inside a Paris tunnel .
According to a source familiar with the situation , Zucker and Griffin began dialing their cell phones furiously while Olbermann panicked , alternately chanting , “ We ’ve got blood on our hands ” and “ I ’m not going to be able to do the show . ”
( Olbermann denies this characterization . )
Ultimately , Olbermann went ahead with the program .
The Big Show was essentially a free - ranging forum for Olbermann ’s edgy , quick - witted commentary and polymathic interests .
But when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke , the show morphed into an all - Monica - all - the - time format — a development Olbermann could n’t stomach .
“ All the yelling on the show reminded me of a part of my childhood that I did n’t want to relive , ” recalls Olbermann .
“ I just could n’t deal with it . ”
In May 1998 , Olbermann gave the commencement address at Cornell .
“ There are days now when my line of work makes me ashamed , makes me depressed , makes me cry , ” Olbermann told the assembled soon - to - be graduates .
“ About three weeks ago , I awakened from my stupor on this subject and told my employers that I simply could not continue doing this show about the endless investigation and the investigation of the investigation , and the investigation of the investigation of the investigation . ”
The speech , naturally , did n’t go over well at MSNBC .
Olbermann stayed on through that fall , but in December , his contract was sold to Fox .
Olbermann moved to Los Angeles , doing baseball pregame shows and a quirky Sunday - night news show that was critically acclaimed and universally unwatched .
But again , Olbermann was unhappy .
He bought a house on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica , but found it too noisy and moved out after a week and a half .
Then he moved into a posh Santa Monica hotel , but eventually left over a billing fight involving $ 16,000 worth of disputed phone calls .
In May 2001 , Fox canceled Olbermann ’s show and took him off their baseball broadcasts , eight months before his contract was up — with no explanation .
In June , Fox bought out the remainder of Olbermann ’s deal .
That summer , Olbermann was a man without a broadcast .
He moved back to New York , and was working on a novel when he had a dream in which JFK appeared before him on a bus , his head wound dressed with plaster of Paris .
In the dream , JFK had just one question for Olbermann : “ Why did you leave SportsCenter ? ” ( The novel was never published . )
That summer , Olbermann spent hours tending to his baseball - card collection , feuding with the L.A. hotel , and generally nursing grudges against the world .
Even longtime friends Patrick and Griffin were at loose ends on how to help their friend .
Then 9/11 happened .
“ Please do n’t say how my life changed on 9/11 , ” said Olbermann .
“ I did n’t have some epiphany .
It trivializes people who really suffered . ”
But something changed .
After the towers fell , Olbermann began filing freelance dispatches from Manhattan for an L.A. radio station .
They were surprisingly moving and heartfelt .
For the first time , Olbermann seemed to have found a purpose .
By 2002 , Olbermann was in full rebuild mode , penning a 3,000 - word Salon piece , titled “ Mea Culpa , ” apologizing to ESPN for his years of churlish behavior .
Olbermann wrote , “ I have lived much of my life assuming much of the responsibility around me and developing a dread of being blamed for things going wrong .
Moreover , deep down inside I ’ve always believed that everybody around me was qualified and competent , and I was n’t , and that some day I ’d be found out . ”
Where did his feelings of inadequacy come from ?
“ My frustration has been over many years of never being able to be an irresponsible kid , ” says Olbermann .
“ I ’ve always felt like I was the designated driver 24 hours a day . ”
In late 2002 , Phil Griffin brought Olbermann back to MSNBC as a guest host on the Jerry Nachman program .
With the network foundering in a distant third place to CNN and Fox News , Griffin gambled and gave Olbermann a second chance .
Olbermann has had his bumps in his current gig .
It took time for Countdown to find its audience , and Olbermann , despite having significantly mellowed by most accounts , has again had run-ins with colleagues .
In December , when Dan Abrams , a former MSNBC talking head and now the network ’s general manager , offered praise for Olbermann ’s show , Olbermann repaid him for the favor by saying , “ I do n’t know what Dan has to do with [ my show ] , frankly .
We ’ve never had a conversation about the direction of the show . ”
And he once told a viewer via e-mail that MSNBC reporter Rita Cosby is “ nice , but dumber than a suitcase of rocks . ”
Still , four years in at MSNBC , Olbermann is probably about as happy as he can be .
With his newfound success came a fresh contract , reportedly worth $ 4 million a year , and the promise of prime - time Countdown specials .
Once a recurring “ Page Six ” figure for his dating escapades , Olbermann recently moved in with his girlfriend , Katy Tur .
Yes , she ’s a 23 - year - old 2005 graduate of the University of California , Santa Barbara , but the relationship marks his first attempt at cohabitation .
For the moment , anyway , Olbermann seems to have achieved a measure of peace .
“ It takes some people a long time to find their happiness , ” says Olbermann ’s friend and producer , Griffin .
“ Keith has that now . ”
At the end of The Candidate , Robert Redford turns toward a crony at his victory party and says , “ What do we do now ? ” Post - 2006 , Keith Olbermann is facing the same problem .
With Bush headed toward irrelevance , Olbermann ’s favorite target is passing from the scene .
What ’s a W. basher to do ?
Olbermann insists he ’ll slam whoever deserves slamming , and that that strategy will serve him fine .
Unlike his sworn enemy , O’Reilly , who proclaims almost nightly how he will use his program to hold presidential candidates accountable , Olbermann is reluctant to say how Countdown will cover the 2008 election .
“ I hesitate to plan stuff , ” says Olbermann .
“ Then you get away from it being organic . ”
Not that Olbermann lacks opinions on the candidates .
A few weeks ago , on another ride out to Secaucus , I toss out names like clay pigeons for him to blast down .
Giuliani : “ He had a great finish , but the rest of the time he was a schmuck . ”
Hillary : “ When I interviewed her , she did n’t seem preprogrammed .
It was like she had gone to Hillary boot camp : ‘ Do n’t answer like that .
Smack !
Answer like this .’
If she does n’t Alex Rodriguez everything , she may get through . ”
Obama : “ At the end of our interview last October , he asked me who I thought was going to win the World Series , the Cardinals or the Tigers .
I told him the Tigers .
And he said , ‘ Yeah , I think they ’re going to beat them fairly easily . ’
At that point , I realized , ‘ He ’s from Illinois , and downstate Illinois is Cards territory . ’
He was willing to pick against the Cardinals on national TV .
He ’s willing to say , ‘ You ’re not going to agree with everything I say . ’
The politician who can do that is the one who is going to cut through .
I do n’t think that ’s going to be Giuliani .
I do n’t think it ’s Mitt Romney or McCain . ”
Earlier , for the sheer sport of it , I had asked him about O’Reilly : “ It was n’t until I left MSNBC in December of ’ 98 that Bill took second place .
Seeing what he did with that and the perversions of television he ’s created , I felt bad about it .
I might have been able to stop this .
It must be like the way Gore or Kerry wake up in the middle of the night thinking , I could have stopped this .
I carry that around with me . ”
By now we ’re at the studio , in a makeup room , and Olbermann starts in on Anderson Cooper .
The CNN anchor , Olbermann notes , recently told a Men ’s Journal writer that he would n’t talk about his private life .
“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t want to talk about personal life when you wrote a book about your father ’s death and your brother ’s death , ” says Olbermann .
“ You ca n’t move this big mass of personal stuff out for public display , then people ask questions and you say , ‘ Oh , no , I did n’t say there was going to be any questions . ’
It ’s the same thing as the Bush administration saying , ‘ We ’re going to war , but you really are n’t allowed to know why . ’ ”
Olbermann checked his hair in the mirror just as a worried PR assistant materialized .
But he was n’t done .
“ Do n’t tell me you ca n’t talk about your personal life and then , when they send you overseas and you do a report that consists of your voice - over and pictures of you in a custom - made , blue - to - match - your - eyes bulletproof vest , looking somberly at these scenes of human devastation — like a tourist — and that ’s your report .
Your shtick is your personal life . ”
It was a vintage Olbermann screed , almost lyrical in its vicious eloquence .
But at the same time , it felt off again — too big a gun for too small a target .
For a moment , it made me think that Olbermann will , in fact , be lost without Bush .
But not so fast .
I asked him what would happen if peace were to break out in Iraq and , more improbable still , if O’Reilly were to follow Bush into a glorious retirement .
“ If there ’s nothing to complain about , I ’m not going to fictionalize anger , ” Olbermann said .
“ Then I become everything I despise . ”
He grinned a gloomy grin as he contemplated a universe without Worst Persons in the World .
Then he brightened .
“ But I think that is highly unlikely . ”
I really wish I knew how to have the comments written on this blog posted along side the post .
That is where the action is and where some of the best ideas are .
Case in point :
Rich , one of the evil overlords of BizNicheMedia and Matt of the Blog Herald , both made interesting points about my rant against current copyright law and my use of Angelina Jolie pictures .
I 'm sure other people took offense with what I said but did n't know exactly how to express it .
Law is a touchy subject and I knew it would step on a few toes .
Especially when you are talking about copyright .
Here are some things you need to realize about copyright .
It has been used by big corporations to screw the little guy for a while .
Walt Disney was able to get rich off of many of Nineteenth Century public domain works , including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Cinderella , Pinocchio , The Hunchback of Notre Dame , Alice in Wonderland , and The Jungle Book ( released exactly one year after Kipling 's copyrights expired ) .
But when the copyrights were about to expire on Mickey Mouse , the Disney corporation and other media companies decided to change the law .
What they did went against what we are supposed to stand for .
Dig this :
The Framers of our Constitution viewed inventions and expression not as " property " , but as public goods to which exclusive rights may be granted purely as a means of incenting production .
Thomas Jefferson expressed the then - dominant view with characteristic felicity in an 1813 letter :
If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property , it is the action of the thinking power called an idea , which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself ; but the moment it is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of every one , and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it .
Its peculiar character , too , is that no one possesses the less , because every other possesses the whole of it .
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me . . . .
Inventions then cannot , in nature , be a subject of property .
Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them , as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility , but this may or may not be done , according to the will and convenience of the society , without claim or complaint from anybody .
Correspondence between Jefferson and Madison regarding the drafting of the Copyright Clause evidences the same concern : both men classify copyrights and patents as " monopolies " sufferable only for limited periods , and only for the purpose of incenting invention .
Now what does this have to do with Angelina Jolie / Time and You ?
When I write something here , if it 's decent it may be linked to .
The ideas may be used without ever giving credit .
And that 's cool with me .
Because I realize what a lot of people realize in their gut and what the framers of the constitution knew : Value is not in the actual product .
( This may seem confusing but bear with me . )
Let 's take for example , a song by the Beatles .
Now few things are as personal as a songwriters songs .
The value of that song is tied to the singer .
Does the original song lose value because I ( with my horrible voice ) decide to sing it ?
Does the original lose value because I press records of my horrible version and sell it ?
Of course not .
And it 's the same with everything .
It 's why Rolex is more than a watch and a Big Mac is more than a hamburger .
Value comes from the experience .
Not the actual product itself .
Thanks to the internet Everything is a commodity .
Walt Disney told somebody else 's stories his way and built an empire .
Does that make him a thief ?
The truth is , he could n't do that under current copyright law .
Somebody is going to get smart and take everything I have ever written , spit it out in a video form being spoken by Jessica Alba and make a mint .
It 's the packaging .
I doubt the internet decreased sales of People magazine .
It probably raised them .
Because no website can ever recreate the People magazine experience .
Here 's the deal .
You came here with nothing and you 're leaving here with nothing .
Everything you create belongs to the universe .
Your profit in this lifetime comes from your unique interpretation of it .
Value is different in a world where everybody knows ( or has the ability to know ) everything .
Until the law understands that , it 's valueless .

I ’ve seen some steep traffic in my blog after my first post on jQuery ( 10 jQuery Essentials ) .
Thanks to everybody who paid a visit .
It ’s time for the Round 2 of the same series .
The new collection walks through some more areas in the web toolkit where jQuery can help UI builders out .
Although it contains the elements missing from the last post , it also includes better implementation of some previously mentioned element ( for example , the tabs ) .
Without more blabbing , here we go :
11 . InnerFade with JQuery
“ InnerFade is a small plugin for the jQuery .
It ’s designed to fade any element inside a container in and out .
Thess elements could be anaything you want , e.g. images , list - items , divs .
Simply produce your own slideshow for your portfolio or advertisings .
Create a newsticker or do an animation . ”
12 . jQuery BlockUI Plugin
The jQuery BlockUI Plugin shows the gray overlay over your whole page or a page element to prevent the users from interacting with it .
Its very useful in conjunction with AJAX , where you need to intentionally limit the user ’s actions for some time .
The author has included a number of examples matching most practical uses .
13 . tablesorter 2.0 ( beta )
This excellent implementation of a table sorting has made its way even if its in the beta stage .
I ’ve looked for a simple solution of this type for too many times , and now finally found it .
It allows you to present your data in table and will allow multi-column sorting behavior to it .
And implementation is pretty straight - forward .
14 . jCalendar
A beautifully done inline dynamic calendar with a few useful features – navigation , auto sizing , degradation , etc .
It looks aesthetically pleasing to me than many other calendar implementation .
15 . idTabs
A fabulous tab implementation using jQuery !
It has outnumbered all the implementation before .
A ticker in the site says the best thing to me : “ It ’s not overloaded with features , it gets to the point . ”
Superbly done !
16 . EasyDrag jQuery Plugin
A great implementation of drag n drop functionality using jQuery .
It makes any DOM element draggable , with the minimal amount of code .
Very handy if you want to facilitate the user with something on the site that they can move along and place wherever they need .
17 . jTagEditor
It ’s a nice , simple plugin that can turn your textarea into a tag editor .
The editor can provide a variety of commands in a non-WYSIWYG way .
Helpful if you would like your visitors enter contents without much fuss .
Its lightweight and customizable .
And the author shows some good examples as well .
That will conclude the list for today .
Again , thanks to the visitors who came by to pay a visit and also to the mighty resource finders : Google , Ajax Rain , Ajaxian , and AJAX Magazine .
Goodbye for today !

10 . McDonald 's Monopoly
How do you combine the ruthless consumerism of the fast food industry with a board game about ruthless consumerism ?
Easily .
You put " game pieces " on whatever you 're looking to move ( large fries and drinks , Big Macs ) , and then you advertise the holy hell out of it .
People like fast food , but people love fast food plus a chance to win a million dollars , or , as was more often the case , " 1 sm. fry . "
Over the years , McDonald 's has given out enough prizes to choke an asthmatic baby ( read : 1 sm. fry ) because , as it turns out , someone high on the game piece totem was siphoning off the rare pieces , giving them to his friends , and sharing in the winnings .
Ah , to be possessed by the spirit of Monopoly .
9. Angus Beef
It 's delicious and , by now , this high quality meat is an option on everyone 's menu .
But it was n't until 1994 that any fast food chain dove head first into Angus .
It was Arctic Circle , the Utah - based - and - therefore - little - known burger joint , who first went Angus - only back in 1994 ; they remain the only fast food restaurant to deal exclusively in Angus Beef today .
Though they are alone in the refusal to carry lesser meats , Arctic Circle deserves a sliver of recognition for putting enough regional pressure on the big chains to get them to step up their respective games .
8. McDonald 's introduces supersize it
Are you ( or have you ever been ) fat ?
You can thank David Wallerstein for that .
He was the McDonald 's executive who came up with the Supersize idea for McDonalds .
Mickey D's " founder " Ray Kroc was an old fashioned guy and fired back at Wallerstein 's suggestion that people , if they wanted more soda or more fries , would simply purchase a second helping .
But Wallerstein pushed and pushed and the Supersize campaign went into affect .
It was a soaring success .
Why did people fall for the Supersize trickery when , at the time it was introduced , it was n't even that much of a value in price ?
Because people believed if they ate one larger portion they were still not eating as much as two portions , therefore convincing themselves they were n't the helpless wads of fat they really were .
Thanks mostly to " Super Size Me , " McDonalds has dropped their Supersize campaign , but while it was in effect it inspired several other fast food chains , most notably Wendy's , with their " Biggie " size .
But nothing beats a eating a pound of McDoanald 's fries .
7. Taco Bell stays open late and encourages drunks to eat their " fourth meal "
Even though it 's totally counterintuitive to all logic , nothing makes a drunk person feel better like a meal right before bed .
Usually these meals were limited to bar food or all night diners .
But those places took too long and if you wanted to grab a hot load of food to quell your queasiness right before bedding a hot slut , you 'd be shit out of luck .
Taco Bell changed all that .
They opened their restaurants late ( first , until 11 , then all the way to 1 ... and now , in select locations , all night ) .
Then they started their " 4th Meal " campaign .
Now , in the ads , they never once mention alcohol .
But their repeated campaigns depicting 20 - somethings franticly searching various cities for their late night snack clearly is courting the drunk and high crowd .
And God bless them - - now , most other fast food places stay open late as well ( or at the very least , keep the drive - thru open ) .
Wendy 's seems to take the drunken crowd almost as seriously as Taco Bell .
It seems like if there 's a bandwagon to be jumped on , Wendy 's is chasing that wagon at full speed , jumping shoes and all .
6 . Subway successfully tricks people into thinking they make healthy fast food
By the time I graduated high school , I was getting close to being borderline obese .
I ballooned from a size 40 to a size 44 pants size within my senior year .
Things were looking grim .
Then I got a summer job that required I be on my feet at all time and an internship that was seven miles from my house that required a 45 minute long bike ride there and back .
Oh , also , I barely had any time to eat and ended up quickly making two hot dogs for lunch and two for dinner .
Needless to say , by the time I entered college , I was down to a size 36 and I had lost almost 50 pounds ( in under three months ) .
I suppose you could say I lost weight thanks to hot dogs in addition to exercise .
That 'd be a fib ... the kind of fib Jared , from Subway , tells every day ( his , as you probably know , is that he lost nearly 100 pounds ) .
But it 's the kind of fib lazy people who do n't want to ride bikes and run and exercise want to believe .
Thanks to Jared and his perfect " aw shucks " delivery , Subway is now the fastest growing fast food chain in America ( in fact , there are more Subway restaurants in Manhattan than there are McDonalds ) .
Thanks to Jared , every fast food chain ( save Popeye's ) has " healthy " food items on their menu now .
And thanks to Jared , people will continue to believe they can lose weight by not exercising and eating shitty ham sandwiches .
And here 's something , guys : even if you do lose weight , the sandwiches are still not " healthy " for you .
They still do n't contain vegetables or nutrients that your body needs and are still mostly packed with bullshit and you 'll still die of a coronary .
But you 'd never know that ... because a guy who used to be fat told you he lost weight .
5. Wendy's 99 Cent Menu
The main attraction of fast food was that it was fast .
But people kept coming back in droves for another reason .
No , not because it was delicious .
Are you serious ?
You 're gonna get your ass kicked even suggesting that one .
No ... not because it was so gosh darned healthy for you .
Look in the mirror -- do you look healthy ?
Do you even look alive ?
No ... people kept coming back because fast food was CHEAP .
That , unfortunately , stopped being the case .
With the advent of McDonald 's meal menu and steady inflation during the 1980s , fast food quietly got more expensive , sort of like a whore who handcuffs you , gives you a blow job and then takes your wallet .
By 1988 , you could n't get a full meal at a fast food spot for under three bucks , unless you were an anorexic girl or a two year old .
Enter Wendy's 99 Cent Value Menu .
From 1988 until a few years ago , all items on the 99 Cent Menu were ... 99 cents .
The choices on the menu varied -- sometimes a baked potato , sometimes some strange desert item , often times a weird cheeseburger with bacon that changed its name weekly -- but from then on , you knew you could get full for very cheap .
McDonalds soon followed suit with their dollar menu and Taco Bell and KFC recently introduced their own versions -- but you can thank Dave Thomas for keeping your cheap eats intact .
4. The Drive - Through ( or : The Drive - Thru )
Drive - through service was pioneered by banks who rightly assumed that their customers hated to stand up under any circumstance .
But it was long after the frontier had been blazed by banks that fast food restaurants finally took up the standard of the drive - through window .
The first drive - through window opened in an Arizona McDonald 's in 1975 to help serve a nearby military base , but its popularity was not limited to the army , and so the concept took root and spread .
The drive - through is beautiful not only because it allows you to stand up roughly one - less time per trip to a fast food restaurant , it also seriously reduces the amount of interpersonal contract necessary , and excises almost all direct contact .
Talk into the speaker , give money , take food , leave .
The drive - through is quick and clean and leaves very little opportunity to ruin your day , except when you drive home and realize that your order is so wrong that it makes you want to open up your own fast food place just to see if it 's really that hard , Well , guess what ?
I did , and it is n't .
3. Pizza is Delivered
Sometime after World War Two , soldiers returning from the Italian front opened pizzerias .
There were so many , though , that competition was tense , and that competition resulted in one of the finest consumer conveniences ever imagined : hot food brought directly to your door , ready to be served and immediately eaten .
I want you to think back , now , on all the nights you 've had in which a delivered pizza has saved your lazy ass from actually working to feed yourself in any way .
This is nothing to be trivialized .
Think about what it must have been like before World War II .
You 'd call up your local pizza place and ask if you could get a pizza delivered only to be informed that there are no pizzeria 's yet -- they largely were n't opened until after the war , remember ? -- and you 're talking to a guy at the lead paint store and , " Would you like some lead paint ? "
And , also , your kids act all crazy from the lead paint .
Are n't you glad you can get a pizza delivered ?
2. Ray Kroc Supersizes McDonald's
Ray Kroc was a 50 - something - year - old milkshake machine salesman when he first set foot in a McDonald 's restaurant , so he knew he did n't have any more time to waste .
He was interested by the quantity of machines the McDonald 's wanted ( 8 ) , and immediately went into business with them setting up a series of their quick - serve burger stops across the state of California .
He bought out the McDonald brothers in 1961 and pushed his fast food empire global .
Finally , in a move that surprised no one , the McDonald 's magnate died of heart trouble .
Live by the burger , die by the burger .
1 . The Earl of Sandwich puts meat between two pieces of bread
John Montagu was not destined to be a great man .
He lived his life as the Earl of a small area of England rather uneventfully and though he was born of noble birth , he was really an average guy .
Which makes it rather fitting that he singlehandedly invented fast food .
You might already know the legend -- that the Earl was looking a quick way to eat his steak while gambling and quickly improvised and put the meat between two pieces of bread ( hah !
he invented it while gambling ... sounds like a pretty cool guy actually ) .
This story has been disputed by party poopers who claim he probably invented the " Sandwich " while working , at his desk .
But whether the Earl was busy with work or with a hearty round of gambling ... he needed his food ... FAST .
And thus John Montagu , the Earl of Sandwich , jump - started the whole fast food movement .
What a saint .
Congressional Republicans , Vote Vets and a couple of ex-Senators have a message for you :
This ad -- more powerfully than any other in recent memory -- exposed the truth about Republicans , and helped end the careers of several incompetent troop - haters , who finally faced the music over the bait - and - switch hypocrisy they 'd been selling the voters for years .
Under instructions from the National Republican Committee , George Allen , Conrad Burns , Rick Santorum , Jim Talent and others dutifully complied with their orders : say you support the troops , but vote to kill them .
This cold - blooded political manipulation cost thousands of brave Americans their lives over the course of four years , but only when the truth came to light did it cost these Republican traitors their jobs .
Maybe it should have cost them much , much more , but the political system only gives us one option : dump politicians who vote to kill American troops .
Seems like a no - brainer , does n't it ?
Then you tell me why Republicans continue to vote unanimously to send unarmored , untrained , unrested ( and even , Salon and the Hartford Courant tell us , wounded and mentally unstable ) troops to Iraq .
In a recent vote , the Republican members of the House Appropriations Committee unanimously opposed requiring that the troops sent to Iraq be properly prepared for their mission and protected with armor .
Again .
So who did it ?
Does one of these troop - killers live near you ?
Let 's name names :
Alabama : Robert Aderholt
California : John Doolittle and Jerry Lewis
Florida : Ander Crenshaw , Dave Weldon and C.W. " Bill " Young
Georgia : Jack Kingston
Idaho : Michael K. Simpson
Illinois : Mark Steven Kirk and Ray LaHood
Iowa : Tom Latham
Kansas : Todd Tiahrt
Kentucky : Harold Rogers
Louisiana : Rodney Alexander
Michigan : Joe Knollenberg
Mississippi : Roger Wicker
Missouri : Jo Ann Emerson
Montana : Dennis Rehberg
New Jersey : Rodney Frelinghuysen
New York : James Walsh
Ohio : Ralph Regula and David Hobson
Pennsylvania : John Peterson
Tennessee : Zach Wamp
Texas : John Carter , John Culberson and Kay Granger
Virginia : Virgil Goode and Frank Wolf
In the days ahead , hundreds more Republicans will close their eyes to the reality so starkly portrayed by Vote Vets , and the political retribution so clearly visited upon their colleagues who failed to heed the basic message that America will no longer tolerate the Republican plan to abandon and expose our troops to preventable death .
The more who die , of course , the stronger becomes the Republican mantra that their deaths must not be in vain .
For Republicans , more dead troops = more emotional heartstrings they can pull to continue their shell game .
And the more heartstrings pulled , the more troops they 're free to kill .
It 's the only part of the Iraq war that actually does pay for itself .
Small wonder , then , that we 're entering the fifth year of this war , sending yet more troops into battle , and still sending them without what they need to survive the fight .
In any other setting and with any other players , the plan would be considered lunacy .
But for Republicans , the blood of the troops has become the oil in their political machine .
There is no other plausible excuse for it .
And as surely as the sun rises , Republicans will later this week once again vote against armor for the troops .
Why ?
Because George W. Bush says it will pay for them at the polls .
In 2008 , whatever black magic George W. Bush has been using to accomplish this ghoulish deception runs out , and at long last the reality of facing voters who know the truth and have buried the dead -- the reality that cut short the blood - fueled careers of the worst offenders in the upper chamber -- will be visited on their weaker siblings in the House .
Democrats will be working overtime in the days ahead to make sure that it is so .

Story Highlights • 9 - year - old disabled girl 's growth was deliberately stunted
• Parents say action was taken to improve child 's quality of life
• Case has triggered wide debate and a protest at the AMA
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- David is a young man with severe cerebral palsy .
He can't walk , he can't talk , he can't sit up by himself , but he can blog .
This week , David blogged about Ashley .
" Ashley 's parents have committed the ultimate betrayal , " he writes .
" They have treated their daughter as less than human , not worthy of dignity ....
What strikes me about ' the Ashley treatment ' and has brought me to tears is that the very people in all of society whom this child should trust have betrayed her . "
Everyone on the Internet , it seems , has an opinion about what Ashley 's parents did to her .
Ashley , 9 , has a condition called static encephalopathy , which means an unchanging brain injury of unknown origin .
She 's in a permanent infant - like state -- can't hold her head up , speak or roll over on her own .
( Read a Q&A with the ethicist who helped decide on Ashley 's treatment . )
When Ashley was 6 years old , her parents and doctors agreed to have her uterus and breast buds removed so she 'll never reach puberty .
She was given estrogen treatments and will never be more than 4 feet 5 inches and 75 pounds .
Like the Terri Schaivo story before her , Ashley and her story have a lot to say about what it means to be disabled , what it means to be different and what it means to be human .
Feminist groups and disability activists protested Thursday in front of the American Medical Association headquarters in Chicago , demanding that the AMA officially condemn Ashley 's doctors for performing the procedures .
Ashley 's parents speak publicly only through their blog .
On it , they explain why they did what they did : Ashley will be more comfortable at a smaller size ; large breasts would have made lying down difficult ; it will be easier to include her in family gatherings if she is lighter and easier to carry around .
Some of the most vociferous critics of what Ashley 's parents call " the Ashley treatment " have been other parents of disabled children .
" My son is 11 .... does n't walk , does n't talk , etc. , etc. " writes one mom .
" He 's hard to carry .
He 's not going to get easier to carry ....
And still , I do n't understand .
I do n't understand removing healthy tissue and functioning organs ....
Growing is not a sin or a disease -- it's what kids ' bodies do , even disabled bodies . "
" Do n't get me wrong -- caring for a 5 feet something , 110 - plus pound adult with physical disabilities is no walk in the park , " blogs another mom .
" I 've got the trashed lumbar discs to prove that .
But I am truly just sick to my stomach to imagine that it 's acceptable medical practice in any case to surgically stunt a child 's growth ....
Using their logic , why not just perform quadruple amputations ?
I mean , really , she 's not going to use her arms and legs . "
Many others have been supportive of Ashley 's doctors and parents .
On CNN.com , for example , one person wrote , " No one objects to surgery to remove a cancer or hormone treatments to treat a variety of ailments .
No one objects to pain medication for palliative care .
Why would anyone object to surgery or hormones to improve the quality of life and care for a severely mentally disabled child ? "
In the end , as in the Schiavo case , it comes down to who speaks for Ashley , a girl who can not speak for herself .
A CNN.com reader who is supportive of Ashley 's parents wrote : " Nobody is stopping to think how a little girl with the mentality of an infant would treat bodily processes such as puberty and menstruation -- a process that scares even the most normal of our children . "
But others think they 're in a position to understand what Ashley wants .
" Ashley is human .
I am human , " writes David on his blog .
" Ashley is me .
I am Ashley .
And you are Ashley , too . "
WASHINGTON — There was a time when the dark , political drama was my preferred weekend movie .
That was before kids and suburbs and serial viewings of “ Shrek . ”
The films were almost always about some exotic country gripped in a vise of poverty and dictatorship , where human life is cheap and strongmen unaccountable for crimes that shock the conscience .
The genre was popularized in the 1982 film “ Missing , ” by the master director Costa - Gavras .
It was a fictionalized account of the kidnapping and murder of a young American journalist in Chile , and the political awakening that his conservative father and the journalist ‘s wife undergo when they come to understand that the American government refuses to aide their search and somehow appears complicit in the horrors they see unfolding around them .
No matter where these dramas were set — in Latin America or in Africa or the Soviet Union or Northern Ireland — you would leave the theater stunned and silent , for a time .
But safe , it seemed , in the knowledge that it could not happen here .
Now it has .
It is not only that the United States has swept people off the streets and held them in secret overseas prisons where , by many credible accounts , they were tortured .
Now a collaboration of six domestic and international human rights groups has concluded that 39 of those who were in U.S. custody at one time or another since the 9/11 attacks still are unaccounted for .
These are not the 14 “ high - value detainees ” transferred in the past few months to the military penal colony at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
No one knows where these 39 are — or if they are still alive .
They are missing .
Or , in the language of international law , they have undergone a “ forced disappearance . ”
At some point , the list of the missing included at least three minors — two of them the children of Khalid Sheik Mohammed , mastermind of the 9/11 attacks .
“ We do n’t have any information that the children are still in custody , and I really do n’t think they are , ” says Joanne Mariner , terrorism and counterterrorism director for Human Rights Watch and one of the authors of the report .
Wives also were detained .
Their fate also is unknown , Mariner said in an interview , though it is likely they are living among relatives somewhere .
The rights groups compiled the list by examining accounts the United States gave when it acknowledged having a person in custody , eliminating those whose whereabouts later were disclosed .
Investigators looked at names some members of Congress had placed in the Congressional Record last year as “ terrorists no longer a threat ” — though no official definition of that term was given .
They reviewed public pronouncements — often made by the Pakistani government — that a terrorism suspect had been turned over to the United States .
And they pored over accounts of former detainees who said they ’d seen a certain individual while in detention , and compared this account with other bits and pieces of evidence .
It is unknown whether the missing remain in some secret U.S. - run facility , or were transferred to foreign governments whose security apparatuses routinely practice secret detention and torture .
It is not known if they are dead or alive .
The U.S. government gave the researchers an “ absolute non-response ” Mariner says , just a pro-forma letter with printouts from the “ war on terror ” section of the White House Web site attached .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said in an e-mail that “ when it comes to the CIA and the fight against terror , there ’s no shortage of inaccurate allegations . ”
He would not comment when asked if he believes the report is inaccurate , pointing to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit the groups have filed .
The United States , meanwhile , has declined to sign a new U.N. convention against forced disappearances .
It would require countries to enforce victims ’ rights and penalize disappearances carried out by agents of a state .
Somehow , we have come to expect this moral hollowness from our government .
But we object — loudly , relentlessly , and with saber ready — when such state - sponsored depravity is applied to one of our own .
“ How would we feel if it were done to an American ? ” asks Tom Malinowski of the Human Rights Watch Washington office .
“ If the North Korean government or the Iranian government took custody of an American and transferred him to the custody of their intelligence agency ? ”
The plotline would have the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster .
And my guess is the line would stretch down the block .

Maria Pantalone , 49 , was charged with two counts of assault - one against that child and one against another – but only admitted to one of the charges today .
“ I could n’t take it any more , ” she testified , in describing the provocative circumstances leading up to the incident last June 30 .
But she agreed it was n't in any way justified .
Pantalone , who is the sister of Toronto Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone , was principal of Keele Street Junior Public School and Mountview Alternative , which collectively have 500 students and operate out of the same building near Keele St. and Humberside Ave .
The names of the victims cannot be published owing to a ban imposed by provincial court Justice Howard Borenstein .
Neither child was a student at her school .
Since being charged last summer , she has been suspended with pay and ordered to stay away from anyone under the age of 16 , unless under supervision .
Both Crown prosecutor John Ball and defence lawyer Michael Caroline jointly recommended that she receive an absolute discharge , which will leave her without a criminal record , and enter into a peace bond not to have contact with the two children .

We just received this notice from the Chicago chapter of World Ca n’t Wait – Drive Out the Bush Regime !:
“ I just talked to an aide at Jesse Jackson Jr’s office in DC , who said that HR 333 was discussed at their staff meeting today and the exact wording was given to Jackson for a final decision .
I told him Jackson ’s letter to the NY Times about Scooter Libby was good and that if he felt that way about commutation , he would surely have to support impeachment for all the other crimes committed by this administration .
The aide said that HR 333 and impeachment is the top issue that constituents are calling about , as well as Bush ’s executive order last week taking over the power to seize property of anyone he deems to be interfering in “ Iraq stabilization efforts . ”
He was also aware of the march from Arlington Cemetery to Conyers ’ office today , but would n’t say what Jackson ’s position on impeachment would be .
Once again , we find that opinion among so many millions of people is so strongly opposed to this gang in power and yet , we have so little time to make what ’s known in these offices in Washington , DC , VISIBLE in the streets of the country !
Gotta declare it now !
Orange outrage everywhere ! ”
( from Jay Becker Oneil , World Ca n’t Wait – Chicago Chapter )
With John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) having said he will move on impeachment if three more Representatives sign on , we could be very , very close to impeachment becoming a reality in DC today .
The Senate takes up " comprehensive " immigration reform again this week .
But the meat 's still missing in this burrito .
As Mexico 's ambassador to Washington warns , even the " rosiest , peachiest " reform in the US wo n't end the flow of poor migrants .
Reform must also take place in Mexico .
And begun it has .
For the past seven months , Mexico has been at war with itself , literally .
A new president , Felipe Calderón , has dispatched 24,000 troops into battle with the most corrosive influence in Mexico 's economy : powerful drug cartels .
These violent syndicates , which mainly transport drugs into the US , have exploded in the past decade .
They 've escalated crime and political corruption , hindering creation of well - paying jobs for would - be migrants .
At election time , they provide cash for many campaigns .
This domestic war , which resembles the Iraq war in tactics and killing rates , was Mr. Calderón 's opening gambit for wholesale reform .
It is widely popular but faces an uncertain future .
The cartels are fighting back with gruesome murders .
And the Army , one of the few respected institutions in Mexico , is not good at policing , a task it must do to root out local drug networks .
Some of its elite soldiers have joined the cartels .
Still , the war gives Calderón enough public support to conduct a quiet and pragmatic battle with the ruling opposition in the legislature .
In March , he was able to win reform of state pensions .
This week , he will propose tax hikes to reduce the government 's risky reliance on oil - export revenues .
And he was helped this month by a Supreme Court ruling that struck a blow at the broadcasting giant Televisa , one of many monopolies controlled by powerful , vested interests .
Opening up these key parts of the economy – telecommunications , oil , cement , and electricity – to fair competition under the law would be Calderón 's greatest legacy .
It would build on two other major reforms : the opening of Mexico 's markets since the mid-1990s through NAFTA and the establishment of real democracy with the end of one - party rule in 2000 .
Any reforms would do little to stem migration , however , unless they reach the poorest regions in the south , such as Chiapas and Michoacán .
These areas are the main source of migrants to the US , and a better economy there would help keep valuable workers in Mexico .
Among his reforms , Calderón has offered help to young entrepreneurs and launched job - training programs .
How can the US help ?
For one , effective border enforcement would keep more Mexicans in Mexico where they can contribute to the economy .
The US can also better crack down on the flow of arms to Mexico 's cartels and the flow of drugs into the US .
Mexico does n't require a mini-Marshall plan from the US , as some suggest – the kind that Colombia has received to fight off its drug cartels .
That $ 5 billion project entailed the use of American troops to help the war against Colombian rebels .
Mexico hardly needs GIs on its soil .
And as one of the world 's 15 largest economies and an oil exporter , it does n't need money – just reform .
The US Congress should see its immigration reform in the larger picture of Mexico 's needs .
The ultimate solution truly lies south of the border .
A coalition of library organizations which includes the American Library Association ( ALA ) sponsored a gathering this week in Washington DC to promote awareness and advocacy on a broad assortment of political issues that impact libraries .
The ALA 's priorities for the National Library Legislative Day ( NLLD ) include advocating net neutrality , promoting copyright reform , and voicing concerns about the Real ID Act and the Patriot Act .
The ALA also called for " ongoing investigations " into FBI use ( and abuse ) of National Security Letters ( NSLs ) and asked legislators to " incorporate judicial review and remove gag orders from NSLs . "
NSLs , a special kind of subpoena that can be issued without probable cause or judicial oversight , prohibit recipients from disclosing information about NSLs to the extent that recipients can't even publicly admit receiving one .
Although the basic concept of NSLs has existed in American law since the late 70s , the Patriot Act expanded the potential for abuse by making it possible for federal law enforcement agents to use NSLs to investigate citizens who are not suspects in any criminal investigations .
Lack of judicial oversight in NSL issuance and implementation is particularly disturbing in light of revelations regarding systematic abuses of Patriot Act powers ( particularly NSLs ) and investigatory misconduct that are apparently pervasive within the FBI and other law enforcement agencies .
Initially , the Patriot Act allowed law enforcement agents to get full access to any library records that they sought for formal investigations .
The standards were changed during the reauthorization process and now require that law enforcement agents have " reasonable grounds " to believe that such records are " relevant " to an investigation .
As the ALA points out , the new standard still leaves open the possibility of wide search order requests because it still does n't require the FBI to demonstrate that targeted individuals are themselves suspects .
The ALA also encourages supporters and NLLD participants to support network neutrality by promoting the Internet Freedom Preservation Act , which aims to prevent Internet service providers from leveraging network control in predatory ways that could potentially limit free speech on the Internet .
The ALA supports copyright reform as well and wants additional exceptions added to the DMCA to protect fair use rights .
The ALA 's political agenda reflects the organization 's extensive understanding of the present legislative climate and the consequences that sweeping laws like that Patriot Act have on libraries and library patrons .
In addition to promoting advocacy , the ALA and other sponsors of the NLLD are also looking to improve awareness .
At a series of briefings that were part of the event , policy experts presented information on topics like privacy and telecommunications and advocacy experts gave tips on how concerned citizens can make their message heard .
The ALA is one of many organizations calling for reform as more evidence of systematic Patriot Act abuses continues to emerge .
Our next wave of Do - It - Yourself Impeachments are due .
This time we ’re sending them to Republican Representative and Presidential Candidate Ron Paul .
He ’s spoken in favor of impeachment .
Here ’s a clip of his most recent comments about impeachment .
While he shies away from calling for it directly , he does speak in favor of impeachment investigations .
If you ’re unfamiliar with the DIY Impeachment method , IfP has researched a method for impeaching the president using a little known and rarely used part of the Rules of the House of Representatives ( “ Jefferson ’s Manual ” ) .
This document actually empowers individual citizens to initiate the impeachment process themselves .
“ Jefferson ’s Manual ” is an interpretive guide to parliamentary procedure , and is included ( along with the Constitution ) in the bound volumes of the Rules of the House of Representatives .
It is ratified by each congress ( including the current one ) , and has been updated continuously through the history of our democracy .
The section covering impeachment lists the acceptable vehicles for bringing impeachment motions to the floor of the House .
Before the House Judiciary Committee can put together the Articles of Impeachment , someone must initiate the impeachment procedure .
Most often , this occurs when members of the House pass a resolution .
Another method outlined in the manual , however , is for individual citizens to submit a memorial for impeachment .
After learning this information , Minnesotan and Impeach for Peace member ( Jodin Morey ) found precedent in an 1826 memorial by Luke Edward Lawless which had been successful in initiating the impeachment of Federal Judge James H. Peck .
Impeach for Peace then used this as a template for their “ Do - It - Yourself Impeachment . ”
Now any citizen can download the DIY Impeachment Memorial and submit it , making it possible for Americans to do what our representatives have been unwilling to do .
The idea is for so many people to submit the Memorial that it cannot be ignored .
Go to the document at our website , fill in your relevant information in the blanks ( Name / State ) , print it out , sign it , and send in your memorial on Tuesday the 20th .
There ’s also extra credit for sending a DIY Impeachment to your own representative .
That ’s right — to make a big impact , we ’re having everyone send it in on the same date ( Over 500,000 downloads so far representing over 1.6 million mailings ) .
We hope to flood the congress with sacks of mail and cause a newsworthy event to further pressure them to act on the memorials .
Although , it ’s important to keep in mind that in the 1830 precedent , impeachment resulted as a result of a single memorial .
Yours might be the one .
Here ’s where to find the DIY Impeachment ( Also en espaÃ±ol . )
Our next wave , which we currently plan on delivering in July is going to be a little different .
We ’re asking everyone to mail them to IfP .
We ’ll then video tape one of our members hand delivering them to Washington .
Stay tuned …
CIA director told group ' Iraq unable to govern ' Will Menaker
Published : Thursday July 12 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an article in Thursday 's Washington Post , Bob Woodward reports that in late 2006 , CIA director Michael Hayden briefed members of the Iraq Study Group that the Iraqi government was irreversibly damaged and that he could not " point to any milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing around . "
This stands in stark contrast with President Bush 's public statements of progress in Iraq , but also his private assessment of what one member of the ISG called a " Churchillian vision of victory " in Iraq .
Hayden 's bleak analysis came one week after the Democrats took back control of the House , and was a " pivotal moment " for in the ISG 's deliberations , and their conclusion that the situation in Iraq is " grave and deteriorating . "
Hayden told the group 's members point blank , " The government is unable to govern .
We have spent a lot of energy and treasure creating a government that is balanced , and it cannot function . "
The article also states that in her appearance before the ISG , Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice was asked by former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor , whether she was aware of the CIA 's analysis of Iraq .
Rice responded , " We are aware of the dark assessment , ' but quickly added : ' It is not without hope . "
The CIA was quick to respond to Woodward 's piece , saying it " is not an accurate reflection of what Director Hayden said at that meeting , nor does it reflect his view , then or now . "
In the eight months since the closed - door ISG meeting , neither Hayden or any other Bush administration official has spoken of Iraq in anywhere near the same stark terms as this CIA analysis .

“ The really awful predications about rapid , massive extinction appear to be true ” — Jeremy Kerr , University of Ottawa
“ Unless we do something there will be no tigers , lions or bears left in the wild for my grandchildren ” — Stuart Pimm , Duke University
Scientists Foresee Extinction Domino Effect
By Stephen Leahy
May 17 ( IPS ) – Climate change is accelerating species extinctions and unraveling the intricate web of life , experts fear .
Birds , animals , insects and even plants are on the move around the Earth , trying to flee new and increasingly inhospitable local weather conditions .
For some , including alpine species and polar bears , there is nowhere to go .
And many others , like plants , lack the mobility to stay ahead of changing climatic conditions .
“ We ’re already seeing species moving , but they ’re not moving fast enough to avoid potential extinction , ” says Jeremy Kerr , an ecologist at the University of Ottawa in Canada .
“ The really awful predications about rapid , massive extinction appear to be true , according to the early evidence , ” Kerr told IPS .
One of those predictions came last year from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA ) , an unprecedented international four - year research effort .
The MA warned that up to 30 percent of all species on Earth could vanish by 2050 due to unsustainable human activities .
By 2100 , it will be a completely different planet if greenhouse gas emissions continue rising at the current rate .
Nearly 40 percent of Earth ’s continental surface may experience totally new climates , primarily in the tropics and adjacent latitudes , as warmer temperatures spread toward the poles , said a new study published this month by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ We are going to be seeing climates that certainly are completely outside the range of modern human experience , ” said Stephen Jackson of the University of Wyoming in a statement .
Scientists estimate there are between three and 30 million species of plants , animals , fungi , bacteria and so on , but only 1.4 million have been identified so far .
The importance of species — and the word “ biodiversity ” — is not well understood by the public , business or politicians .
And yet biodiversity — the sum total of all living species — is what gives us air to breathe , water to drink and food to eat .
Schoolchildren learn that trees and plants produce oxygen , absorb carbon dioxide , clean water , and so on .
However , what is not well understood , even by scientists , is exactly how insects , bacteria , birds , and animals interact with trees and plants to produce the ecological services we rely on , like clean air and water .
The loss of a few species in a forest or the oceans might not result in any obvious immediate changes , but scientists are beginning to connect the dots .
One example of a cascade of impacts was recently documented by Canadian and U.S. marine scientists , who found that a dramatic reduction in shark populations along the U.S. east coast has resulted in population booms for rays and skates , which in turn decimated their food supply of shellfish .
The loss of the shellfish has reduced water quality and seagrass beds .
The cascade does n’t stop there , but that is as far as science has been able to track it .
Michael Totten , senior director of Conservation International , a global environmental group , offers another example .
Coastal mangrove forests provide local communities with nearly 90 percent protection from storm surges , studies show .
Equally important , mangroves are the nurseries for many species of fish and play a key role in sustaining ocean fish populations , Totten said in an interview .

During my college years , I worked two summers as a desk clerk for a resort in the Catskills .
That ’s where my boss taught me that one of the services we offered was listening to irrational whining .
He explained that certain customers enjoy complaining .
To them , it ’s not so much about getting a solution to the problem as it is the complaining itself .
The resort catered to people ’s vacation needs , and if complaining was what they needed , it was our job at the front desk to listen to it .
We were trained to write down the complaint on a slip of paper clearly labeled “ Work Order . ”
And throw away the piece of paper when the complainer left .
Okay , not every single time .
Sometimes the complaint involved something fixable , and we fixed it .
But often the complaints were purely recreational , as in “ The leaves on the trees are rustling too loudly in the wind . ”
I would express concern , apologize on behalf of the resort , and make a big deal about writing down the details just right .
“ Are ALL the leaves a problem , Mrs. Johnson , or is a particular group of leaves being extra noisy ? ”
I confess that I did not believe my boss when he said people complained for recreation .
But I witnessed it often and became a believer .
You could tell the difference between the people who wanted a solution and the people who were in it for the complaining .
The first group would just mention the problem on the way to the pool .
The recreational complainers would bring a snack and a thermos and set up a campsite by the front desk .
They were going to be there for a while , describing their pain , suggesting alternatives , asking for the manager , and anything else to make the experience last .
I was thinking about that training last night as I checked into one of the top hotels in Las Vegas .
The client for whom I ’m speaking today was nice enough to reserve a suite for me .
I slipped the key in the door , went inside , and immediately noticed that something was wrong .
I could n’t put my finger on it at first , but then I realized it was a smoking room .
Crap .
I walked further into the suite to verify my suspicion and noticed there were some coins on the table .
There were more personal items on other surfaces as well .
Yes , this room was already occupied .
By a guy who smoked Marlboros , judging from the pack on the table .
Luckily , he was n’t in his room at that moment .
I turned toward the door , and it seemed to retreat into the distance in direct correlation with my desire to get - the - fuck - out - of - there .
You do n’t want to be standing in some drunken , Marlboro - smoking guy ’s room when he comes back all mad about the money he just lost in the casino .
I ran for the exit in a sort of dream - state slow motion .
After an hour or so of running against the wind , I escaped without detection .
Then came the fun part : I got to express some righteous indignation at the front desk , purely for entertainment .
This was n’t the sort of problem that bothers me much , so I had to focus to get into the mood .
Luckily , as complaints go , this one had everything .
It was curable , multi-leveled , and it had just the right touch of horror in the telling .
I did n’t want to waste it by having insufficient indignation , so I dug deep .
I returned to the front desk and waited my turn in line – AGAIN – so as to perfectly ripen my righteous indignation .
When it was my turn , the pleasant desk clerk ( a different one ) greeted me with a smile .
I tried to not smile back because it would ruin the mood by improving it .
“ I have some good news and some bad news , ” I said in a serious tone .
She responded with a nicely played “ Uh- oh . ” I kept my voice loud enough for the nearby guests to hear .
Loudness is essential for squeezing all of the whiney goodness out of the process .
“ The good news is that your key card works perfectly .
It opened that door like a charm . ”
She waited .
“ The bad news is that you gave me a smoking room . ”
I could tell that she felt relief , knowing that this was a minor infraction and easy to fix .
Little did she know that I saved the best part for last .
“ And …it … was … occupied , ” I said with my best artificial scowl .
I decided to be silent on the question of whether I walked in on anyone doing something Vegas - like with a midget and a Zebra , preferring to leave it to her imagination .
She was well - trained .
She apologized immediately , expressed just the right amount of artificial shock and concern , and offered some discounts for restaurants in the hotel .
I waived them off , partly because I would n’t have a chance to use them , but mostly because it would have taken the edge off of my righteous indignation .
When I got my new room key – to a much better suite , as it turned out – I was totally satisfied .
I smiled and thanked her .
She felt good for solving a problem .
I felt good for getting to express my righteous indignation .
It was a win -win .
Experts say that the most loyal customers are not the ones who had a flawless experience , but the ones who had a problem that was resolved .
I think they ’re right .
I would use that hotel again in a heartbeat .

Most Dutchess County schools wo n't start sports
Tuesday
As Section 1 sets to resume sports on Tuesday , three Dutchess County districts will wait additional days , and Pawling withdrew from the fall season .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Police who have raided vice - ridden Mexico City neighborhoods in a push against drug violence hope to take guns off the streets by offering to swap them for computers and video - game consoles .

Launching the program Tuesday in the notorious inner-city barrio of Tepito , which police stormed last month , city police chief Joel Ortega said anyone who turns in a high - caliber weapon like a machine gun will get a computer .
Owners can swap smaller guns for cash or Microsoft Corp . ’s Xbox video - game consoles under the plan .
Newly elected Mayor Marcelo Ebrard has moved quickly to restore order to the chaotic capital by going after well - known crime dens and clearing the city ’s narrow streets of informal vendors whose stalls have blocked sidewalks for years .
His moves echo those of new conservative President Felipe Calderon , who since December has ordered the military into several states infested by ruthless drug gangs who killed about 2,000 people last year .
Last month police stormed Tepito , a warren of scruffy homes and market stalls a few blocks north of the capital ’s main square , seizing a tenement complex known as “ The Fortress ” -- reputedly a major cocaine and marijuana distribution center .
“ This area is a symbol of crime , ” said police spokesman Ricardo Olayo .
Organizers say they have 100 computers ready for the first wave of the program , each worth 8,500 pesos ( $ 769 ) and equipped with software donated by Microsoft .
On the first day , Olayo said the city received 17 guns , including 12 from Tepito .
If successful , the program will be extended to Iztapalapa , another area targeted by police where last week 800 officers expropriated a six - block neighborhood filled with stores selling parts torn from stolen cars .
Guns that are handed over will be destroyed by the army .
The city promised to protect their owners ’ anonymity .
Supreme court narrows rules for claims of unfair pay RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This Earlier today , the Supreme Court narrowed the rules for claims of unfair pay , according to a report in the LA Times , referring to it as " a victory for employers , shielding them from discrimination claims from the past . "
" In a setback for employees claiming job bias , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that they could not rely on old evidence showing that they have long been paid less than co-workers to argue that they are discriminated against now , " David G. Savage reports for the paper .
The article continues , " In a 5 - 4 decision , the justices said federal civil rights law requires proof of a ' discrete act of discrimination ' in the 180 days before a suit is filed .
A discrimination claim cannot rely on earlier pay decisions that shortchanged a black , female or disabled worker , the court said . "
In a press release obtained by RAW STORY , Senator Hillary Clinton ( NY - D ) said , " Today 's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. interprets Title VII in a way that limits a worker 's right to receive equal pay for equal work . "
" In her dissent , Justice Ginsburg invites Congress to remedy this problem , " Clinton 's press release continued .
" I intend to do just that by introducing legislation to clarify Congressional intent on this issue .
All Americans deserve equal pay for equal work , and it is my hope that Congress can remove the technical hurdles that will prevent individuals from receiving what is rightfully theirs . "
Excerpts from article : #
The ruling threw out a pay discrimination claim brought by a woman who for nearly 20 years was the lone female supervisor at a Goodyear Tire plant in Gadsden , Ala .
She sued the company in 1998 and showed that she was being paid 15 % to 40 % less than the men who held the same job .
A jury sided with her and awarded her back pay , but the Supreme Court agreed with the company that her suit should have been thrown out at the start because it relied on evidence of discrimination in the 1980s , not a current unfair - pay action by the company in 1998 .

From my essay , “ Understanding the Significance of Guantanamo : The Symbol of Omnipotent Power , ” written almost two years ago , in May 2005 :
And that , in brief , is why Guantanamo is so crucial to the Bush ’s administration ’s goals in its war , a war that will be never - ending if it has its way : Guantanamo symbolizes the Bush administration ’s desire for omnipotent power  for the administration to be able to do whatever it wants , with no oversight or interference by anyone , including the federal judiciary and including those restraints imposed by the Constitution itself .
In this manner , especially when coupled with the great danger represented by the Padilla case , the Bush administration seeks to place itself beyond all restraint derived from any source , and to make itself all - powerful .
If it is successful , that will definitively and absolutely spell the end of liberty in America  and the rest is only a matter of time , and of details .
In this sense , it is entirely appropriate that Guantanamo is located where another omnipotent dictator already holds sway .
Whether Bush and his enablers will admit it or not , in fact the policies they seek to implement would make the United States itself into one gigantic Guantanamo : where any one of us can be detained indefinitely merely upon the word or desire of one person , with no charges ever filed against us , and where we can be abused or tortured , and perhaps even murdered , at will .
And no one and nothing would be able to stop or even question them .
That ’s the future they want so desperately  and I suggest that you always keep it in mind and never , ever forget it .
In an act of profound , historic cravenness and betrayal , the Congress acceded to the administration ’s desire for absolute power , with the passage of the Military Commissions Act .
As I detailed in “ Thus the World Was Lost , ” the Democrats offered no serious opposition , until it was far too late , and despite the fact that all of us had been on notice for several years that this battle would soon arrive :
There is no question that the Military Commissions
Act , given the language it now contains , grants  in principle  full dictatorial powers to the executive .
As I explained in the earlier essay , the executive and certain entities it controls can designate anyone , including any American citizen , as an “ unlawful enemy combatant . ”
That person can then be imprisoned for the rest of his life , with no recourse whatsoever .
Period .
The critical point is what , in principle , the grant of power includes .
As noted , the grant is absolute : it includes everything .
As I have pointed out , the determination of the Bush administration to achieve absolute power has been indisputably clear since shortly after 9/11 .
And this is hardly the first time that I and others have noted that the mechanisms for a complete dictatorship have now been put in place .
With proper preparation , and with the requisite understanding that freedom itself was imperiled , the Democrats could have achieved these aims .
All of us would be forever in their debt .
Surely liberty itself is worth such a battle , is n’t it ?
But the Democrats did none of these things , so the bill passed .
Thus , they share in the guilt and responsibility .
The guilt and responsibility that accrues to the Democrats is not as great as that of the Republicans , but it is surely great enough .
And when your freedom , and that of your family and friends , and that of every single one of us , is destroyed in this manner , how do you even go about measuring degrees of guilt ?
How do you say this failure is worse than that one ?
The bill passed .
They all failed , Republicans and Democrats alike .
In principle , torture was enshrined and liberty was destroyed .
Some argue that the Supreme Court will find the act , or at least certain key provisions , unconstitutional .
That , too , is a hope , but I myself am far from certain that the Court will rule in such a manner .
In any event , we do not know what the ultimate outcome will be as far as the judicial system is concerned .
So we are confronted with one stark certainty , opposed by fragile and uncertain future hopes .
We know the Military Commissions Act destroys liberty at its very foundation .
We do not know if this fatal injury will ever be ameliorated .
The Act should have been stalled at the very least .
It was not .
Destroying the very basis of liberty is not an event that occurs every day .
Mark the date .
Historians may well have cause to note it .
A brief word to those who think the “ Restoring the Constitution Act ” is an effective means of combatting the immense evil represented by the Military Commissions Act .
When I first read about this proposed legislation , I thought it was an important step in the right direction .
After considering it further , I have concluded this is precisely the wrong way to fight this battle .
Let me repeat : the Military Commissions
Act destroys the ultimate foundation of liberty , and it transforms the great evil of torture into a State - sanctioned means for treating those designated as enemies of the State by the executive and those who do his bidding , on any basis they choose or on no basis at all .
( On the second point and in connection with the hell on earth to which such a government sanction can lead in time , see my series On Torture , and especially Part I . )
The Act is an abomination in its totality , and in every detail .
If we genuinely seek to walk the long road back to a constitutional republic , the Act must be repealed .
It must be wiped from the books completely .
Instead , the Democrats propose to enact another bill , “ correcting ” the errors in the first .
Inevitably , this will lead to endless debates , in Congress , in the courts and everywhere else , about how the two bills should be construed in relation to each other .
These debates and confrontations will go on for years  and all the while , the Military Commissions
Act will remain the law of the land , a law that destroys the very concept of law in terms of what it had once meant .
You do not “ fix ” evils of this kind .
You obliterate them as required .
It is required here .
At long last , let the Democrats understand the nature of this battle , as I discussed it in the earlier essay .
Let them educate themselves , other members of Congress , and the American public .
Let them attempt to mobilize Americans to demand that the Act be repealed , on a scale and in a manner that can not be ignored .
All our political leaders endlessly praise those who give their lives in defense of liberty , as they should when it is true .
( It is not true in Iraq . )
If they are sincere in that praise to any degree at all , ca n’t they fight a legislative battle to restore the basis of liberty ?
They are being asked to take up only intellectual arms .
For God ’s sake , they can do it sitting down the entire time .
But , you say , Bush will veto legislation repealing the Military Commissions Act .
I initially note that Bush is equally likely to veto any attempt to “ fix ” that Act .
But if the Democrats waged the necessary campaign and enlisted a significant part of the American public on their side , then let him .
He will stand alone , revealed as the enemy of liberty and civilization that he is .
To my knowledge , Bush has demonstrated no courage on any issue at all in the full course of his life .
Since he and his cabal are after absolute power and do not have much time remaining to achieve their goal , I suppose he might surprise us all and reveal a ruthless determination , devoid of conscience and decency , in the pursuit of a dictator ’s powers .
Given the ends he seeks , “ courage ” is a word that grants far too much dignity and humanity to such tenacity .
It is the dogmatic obstinacy of an authoritarian ; it is the stubbornness of a rabid , homicidal dog , that wants to make absolutely certain its prey is dead .
Here , the prey is your liberty , and mine , and that of every single one of us .
Repeal the Military Commissions Act .
Wipe the evil out of existence .
I also note , realizing this argument very rarely applies in politics , that it is the right thing to do  constitutionally , legally , and morally .
And the world will know that some Americans still give a damn about what ’s right .
Moreover , as Chris Floyd notes , there is an important strategic purpose as well : “ Bush will doubtless veto any move to tamper with his beloved MCA , but at least the ‘ will of the Congress ’ argument in favor of gulags and tyranny will no longer apply when the case finally reaches the Supreme Court . ”
That may be crucial , especially in light of this news :
Detainees being held at the prison camp at Guantnamo Bay , Cuba , have lost their bid for access to US courts to challenge their open - ended detention in the war on terror .
In an important ruling announced Tuesday , a divided federal appeals court panel here dismissed cases filed by 63 detainees raising fundamental legal challenges to various aspects of the Bush administration ’s approach to the war .
The ruling applies to every pending or future case — in effect closing all but a few doors to the courthouse for those being held at Guantanamo .
“ Federal courts have no jurisdiction in these cases , ” the appeals court declared .
The ruling is expected to be quickly appealed — perhaps to the full US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia — or directly to the US Supreme Court .
At the center of the appeals case was the assertion that the newly enacted Military Commissions Act of 2006 ( MCA ) was an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus .
Lawyers for the detainees argued that their clients enjoyed a constitutional right to challenge their open - ended detention before a neutral judge .
If the Bush administration ’s position prevailed , they said , it would mean that terror suspects at Guantanamo could be tossed into a legal black hole .
Two of the three appeals - court judges disagreed .
They ruled that Congress did not violate constitutional protections when it passed the MCA .
The law was approved in part to overturn last summer ’s decision by the Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , which overturned the military commission process proposed by the administration .
Congress later passed the MCA .
“ Everyone who has followed the interaction between Congress and the Supreme Court knows full well that one of the primary purposes of the MCA was to overrule Hamdan .
Everyone , that is , except the detainees , ” writes Judge Raymond Randolph in an opinion joined by Judge David Sentelle .
Judge Randolph says the detainee arguments are “ creative but not cogent . ”
He adds , “ To accept them would be to defy the will of Congress . ”
About 400 detainees are currently held at Guantanamo .
According to MSNBC.com , 110 are labeled ready for release .
Among the others , only several dozen are likely to face trial before special organized military commissions .
For those remaining , there appears to be no end in sight to their detention .
Writing for the panel , Judge Randolph said that Congress could not have been clearer about its intent when it passed the Military Commission Act .
The law says the repeal of habeas jurisdiction in Guantanamo cases applies in all cases without exception .
“ It is almost as if the proponents of these words were slamming their fists on the table shouting , “ When we say ‘ all , ’ we mean all — without exception ! ”
Note carefully where we are : a judge defends absolute authoritarian rule , and embraces naked evil  and he cloaks and seeks to disinfect it with allegedly neutral , dispassionate “ legal argument ” and theory .
History has seen this phenomenon many times before ; the twentieth century saw it repeatedly .
Those parallels should disabuse you of the pathetic notion that this battle is anything like one over tax policy or Social Security , or that it can be fought in the same manner .
The Democrats ( and a few Republicans ) have the opportunity to fight for liberty once again .
It is a considerable miracle that they , and we , even have another chance of this kind .
Let us see what they do with it .
History will long remember the final outcome of this struggle  and history is not forgiving .
“ Good intentions ” count for nothing .
Let them act .
And we must let them know , in no uncertain terms , what liberty and honor now demand of them .

Asian paper's ' I Hate Blacks ' column assailed
A San Francisco weekly newspaper that bills itself as " The Voice of Asian America " is facing harsh criticism from that very community for publishing a column Friday titled " Why I Hate Blacks . "
In the column , AsianWeek regular contributor Kenneth Eng listed " reasons " to discriminate against African Americans .
The piece has been pulled from the newspaper 's Web site , but the print edition of the free paper , owned by the politically influential Fang family , was still available in news racks Monday .
Eng called himself an " Asian supremacist " in January in another installment of the column , which runs under the label " God of the Universe . "
Prominent Asian Americans immediately condemned Eng 's current column .
" The hate is based on ignorance and is very similar to the rationales that the KKK uses against African Americans , " said Henry Der , director for 22 years of Chinese for Affirmative Action and the former state administrator for Emeryville 's schools .
" What gives me the greatest concern was AsianWeek 's judgment in printing such a piece out of context , " Der said .
" It is so trite and hateful , it does n't speak well for the publication . "
San Francisco NAACP
President Amos Brown , who heard about the column from a Chronicle reporter , was speechless at first .
" I can't believe this , " Brown then said .
" I am surprised the Fangs , who have supposedly been involved in interracial - understanding issues , would publish something like this .
I am flabbergasted .
We can't afford for these kind of racist flames to be fueled in that kind of setting . "
AsianWeek issued a statement regretting " any offense caused by the one opinion piece , " and Editor in Chief Samson Wong declined further comment .
Editor at large Ted Fang did not return phone calls seeking comment .
Members of his family , who are Chinese American , have owned a number of local publications , including AsianWeek and the Independent .
They bought the Examiner in 2000 and sold it in 2004 .
Ted Fang 's brother James , who is president of the paper , has spent more than a decade on the BART Board of Directors and previously worked as international trade director for former San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan .
Eng 's " reasons " for hating black people include :
-- " Blacks hate us .
Every Asian who has ever come across them knows that they take almost every opportunity to hurl racist remarks at us . "
-- " Contrary to media depictions , I would argue that blacks are weak - willed .
They are the only race that has been enslaved for 300 years . "
-- " Blacks are easy to coerce .
This is proven by the fact that so many of them , including the Rev. Al Sharpton , tend to be Christians . "
Eng , who is in his early 20s , according to material on the Internet promoting his science fiction writing , started at AsianWeek in November after moving from the East Coast .
In 2004 , for an online magazine called Down in the Dirt , he wrote about experiencing racism as an Asian American student at New York University after he " expressed my negative views on America , religion and African Americans . "
Other AsianWeek columns of Eng's -- including " Proof That Whites Inherently Hate Us " and " Why I Hate Asians " -- have resulted in criticism .
In the first , he complained about the scarcity of Asian heroes in the media .
In the second , he described Asian Americans as apathetic , brown - nosing and lacking in cultural pride .
Eng could not be reached for comment Monday .
Leaders of the Asian Law Caucus , Asian American Justice Center , Chinese for Affirmative Action and other groups and individuals began circulating a petition Friday calling for the paper to apologize , terminate its relationship with Eng , print an editorial refuting the column and review its editorial policy .
The leaders ' statement , issued in Washington , D.C. , called the piece " irresponsible journalism , blatantly racist , replete with stereotypes and deeply hurtful to African Americans . "
In its statement , AsianWeek , which has a circulation of 48,505 , said it " sincerely regrets any offense caused by the one opinion piece which reflected that author 's personal views .
We apologize for any harm or hurt this has caused the African American community .
AsianWeek has great respect for all that the African American community has done for Asian Pacific Americans . "
David Lee of the Chinese American Voters Education Committee said Eng 's statement echoes the feelings of some Asian Americans .
He said that rather than condemning the paper , black and Asian people should participate in a town hall - style meeting to address tension he said exists between the two communities .
" There is a segment that feels the way Eng does , but the sentiment is underground and not brought to the surface , " Lee said .
" If you do n't have a discussion , then I think it allows these types of views to fester and turn into something much more negative .
Rather than refute and bury this , we should be calling for a community dialogue to address this . "
The paper said it will announce in this Friday 's edition plans to co-sponsor a town hall - style meeting with the Willie L. Brown Jr. Institute on Politics & Public Service .
" What this controversy points out is the lack of community leadership in addressing the critical and difficult issues of race relations , particularly between Asian Pacific Americans and African Americans , " the paper 's statement said .
San Francisco writer Claire Light , one of several bloggers who wrote about the column over the weekend , said the newspaper in general -- and especially Eng 's column -- makes her embarrassed to be Asian .
She said that " most Asian Americans have never even heard of AsianWeek , much less agree with its editorial decision making . "
Der said the column was offensive not only to African Americans but to everyone -- and especially because it was published during Black History Month .
" It is pretty despicable that the piece would do that at this time , " he said .
" If we are to talk about race and issues , then there should be a thoughtful presentation of the diverse views on this topic .
If they had done that , however offensive , we would at least understand it in the context in the larger community . "
Ling -chi Wang , retired chairman of the ethnic studies department at UC Berkeley , said there is an urgent need for Asian Americans to be aware of the history of this country and know that Asian American gains have come largely as a result of the efforts of black people .
" Personal experiences cannot be generalized , " Wang said .
" It is really sad to see the racism sentiment being expressed so publicly .
I can't believe Ted Fang would allow such a column to go to print .
It is really offensive and damaging and is not one that contributes to a better understanding of diversity .
" I was very disappointed to see it published , and I 'm glad there are people protesting . "
I have written in the past about the paranoid , twisted obsession that most religious fundamentalists have with sex .
Rather than viewing it as a natural , healthy part of human life , and a source of pleasure and emotional connection when engaged in responsibly , excessive religious devotion leads some believers to view sex as a menacing and ever - present temptation to sin that must be resisted at all costs .
Some of these go even further and view sex not only as a great sin , but seemingly the only sin worth concerning oneself about .
It should be no surprise that when a person takes such a distorted and monstrous view of their own human nature , the repercussions become manifest in their behavior .
Sometimes it merely causes them to flame out and crash in spectacular bouts of public hypocrisy , such as Ted Haggard , Jim Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart .
However , in countries with less of a heritage of separation of church and state , when these self - loathing and other - loathing fanatics gain secular power , the results can be dreadful .
Witness the Taliban , whose name should become a byword for murderous , hateful fanaticism , and the state of oppression they created in Afghanistan by forcing women to live in isolation in their own homes and shroud themselves in stifling black whenever they went out in public .
Though the Taliban have been driven from power , their evil legacy is very much alive and well in the world today .
The Malaysian state of Terengganu has become the newest government to take after the Taliban by enacting a policy of totalitarianism in the cloak of God :
Religious police in a Malaysian state plan to deploy spies working as waiters or janitors in hotels to stop activities the authorities consider immoral , including sex between unmarried people , a news report said Tuesday .
… [ T ] he spies would largely look for unmarried couples committing “ khalwat , ” or “ close proximity , ” a crime under Islamic law in Malaysia akin to adultery .
It applies to unchaperoned meetings between men and women .
Those found guilty of khalwat can be jailed for up to two months under Islamic laws , which do not apply to non-Muslims .
Malaysia , a Muslim - majority nation and officially Islamic by law , has a dismal record in general when it comes to religious freedom .
Malaysia has a system of Islamic courts that uphold sharia law , imposes prison sentences on Muslims who deconvert , and censors material deemed contrary to Islam .
However , the plan of state - sponsored terror put forward by the government of Terengganu is by far the worst intrusion upon the human rights of Malaysian citizens .
Merely to prevent the “ crime ” of unmarried Muslim men and women meeting in private , they plan to turn the entire state into a regime of suspicion and fear , where every passerby on the street might be an agent secretly in the pay of the government , with unlimited discretion to report on anyone whose behavior they dislike .
Not only is this law an unbelievable squandering of resources , it is a senseless and idiotic intrusion upon human rights .
Why is it any concern of the state or of anyone else what I do in my own life ?
My private conduct has no effect whatsoever on anyone else ’s ability to conduct their lives exactly as they wish .
The arrogance of these tinpot religious tyrants , who think their beliefs give them the right to barge in on others ’ lives and control them according to their own rigid and medieval notions of morality , knows no bounds .
Though we have no direct influence over the laws of Malaysia , there may yet be a way to set them on a more rational course .
The article mentions an embarrassing incident in which Malaysian religious police burst into a motel room where they thought they would find two Muslims committing khalwat , only to find the couple was a pair of vacationing Christian tourists not subject to the country ’s harsh sharia laws .
Clearly , tourism is a major part of the Malaysian economy , and the loss of income from foreign visitors would seriously inconvenience them .
But why would any Western tourist want to visit a nation where the rules of a vicious medieval theocracy are the laws of the land ?
Not only would our tourism dollars be propping up a government that was a despicable violator of human rights , there is always the frightening chance that the next tourist could be mistaken for a citizen and would themselves be subjected to the Islamic courts .
Until Malaysia takes steps to curb its human rights abuses and create an enlightened , secular state where both citizens and visitors can live without fear , there is more than sufficient reason for all potential tourists to boycott it completely .

Feingold : Bush Admin. ' trying to gut FISA law ' David Edwards
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Today on Fox News Sunday Senator Russ Feingold called for a special prosecutor to investigate potential false statements by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
" The only way it can be done fairly is through the request that four of us have made which is that a Special Counsel be appointed through the Bush Administration , through the Attorney General 's office and that they look at it and determine whether something has happened here that I think has happened , which is , I think , perhaps a crime has been committed by the Attorney General on this matter . "
Chris Wallace went on to question Senator Feingold on the call for revision of the current FISA laws , the contempt citations for White House staffers , and the upcoming vote on censuring the President .
Wrapping up the segment , Wallace noted that the show had offered the administration and Republican Judiciary Committee members to appear on the show to defend Attorney General Gonzales , " We had no takers . "

The civil suit filed by Valerie and Joseph Wilson against Dick Cheney , Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , and Richard Armitage was dismissed by a federal judge today .
Ruling that the court lacked the jurisdiction to award damages for the disclosure of Valerie Wilson ’s covert identity , Judge John Bates made the curious argument that blowing the cover of an undercover CIA officer could be considered to fall within the job duties of an administration official .
“ The alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson ’s comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory , ” he wrote .
“ But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism … by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants ’ duties . ”
The Wilson ’s counsel , Melanie Sloan , the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , is currently reviewing the decision and anticipates filing an appeal .
After four years , Joe Wilson is n’t about to back down .
Here ’s what he had to say about the setback in a statement : “ This case is not just about what top government officials did to Valerie and me .
We brought this suit because we strongly believe that politicizing intelligence ultimately serves only to undermine the security of our nation .
Today ’s decision is just the first step in what we have always known would be a long legal battle and we are committed to seeing this case through . ”
Imagine an attack on a civilian population aimed at causing maximum hurt , shock , disruption and terror .
9/11 ? Resistance in Iraq ?
No , the Allied bombing of Hamburg in late July of 1943 .
Operation Gomorrah created a firestorm in which temperatures reached 800 degrees Celsius , oxygen was sucked out of bomb shelters , and thousands of non-combatant men , women and children ended up so shrivelled that dazed refugees took the corpses of loved ones with them packed into their suitcases .
Everyone has heard about Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
How many of us remember the fire bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 ?
Some 1,667 tons of incendiary bombs fell on 15 square miles of the most densely populated parts of the city .
The resulting fire storm killed 85,000 people .
Among the Dead Cities is a moral evaluation of the Allies ’ area bombing campaign and an attempt to purify the historical memory of the victors .
At a time when torture is seriously being contemplated in the War on Terror , A. C. Grayling , a philosopher at the University of London and Oxford , has provided us with an ABC of ethics that reminds us that not all is fair in love and war .
Indeed the bombing campaign was at its most devastating in the final months of a war that had already been won .
By the end of the war Harris was targeting certain German cities for bombing , not because they had any strategic importance , but simply because they had yet to be bombed !
Grayling is careful to distance himself from neo -Nazi apologists .
He says that the Allied pilots flew bravely , that the Nazi atrocities were on a much worse scale than anything the Allies committed and that the Nazis were the first to instigate area bombing with their aerial attacks on Warsaw in 1939 , Rotterdam in 1940 and the London Blitz .
Still , the Allies do have a case to answer .
Allied bombing killed 800,000 civilians .
Why in February of 1942 did the British War Cabinet decide to destroy all German cities with a population of over 100,000 ?
A key factor was the replacement of Sir Richard Peirse at Bomber Command HQ by Sir Arthur ( “ Bomber ” ) Harris .
In preparation for this new posting Air Staff issued the following directive : “ The primary objective of your operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civil population , and in particular on the industrial workers . ”
Harris ’ desperate attempts to “ carry the war to the Germans ” led him to target civilians as a means of halting the German war effort .
He believed , wrongly , that morale would break if Allied bombing were able to pulverise German monuments , libraries , churches and housing .
The London blitz had shown that the bombing of civilians actually strengthened resolve .
The German belief that the Allies were trying to reduce them to the pastoral status of New Zealand had a similar effect of galvanising their citizen ’s efforts at quick rebuilding .
In the end , victory in World War II was largely a matter of production .
It was the industrial might of the USA and the American strategic bombing of German oil supplies , something Harris vigorously resisted , that led to Germany ’s demise .
Harris ’ campaign for area bombing only began in earnest when the tide of the war had already turned .
Indeed the bombing campaign was at its most devastating in the final months of a war that had already been won .
By the end of the war Harris was targeting certain German cities for bombing , not because they had any strategic importance , but simply because they had yet to be bombed !
Grayling is at pains to show that , whether or not area bombing was a war crime in the legal sense of the term , it was certainly against the spirit of international law and in itself offended against natural justice .
Area bombing was a controversial volte - face from Chamberlain ’s assurances at the beginning of hostilities that civilians would not be targeted .
Pacifists like Vera Brittain wrote stern condemnations of this campaign that resonated with Londoners who knew at first hand about the horrors of civilian bombing .
Her anti-bombing tract “ Seeds of Chaos : What Mass Bombing Really Means ” ( 1944 ) closed with the following claim , “ the callous cruelty which has caused us to destroy innocent human life in Europe ’s most crowded cities , and the vandalism which has obliterated historic treasures in some of her loveliest , will appear to future civilisation as an extreme form of criminal lunacy with which our political and military leaders deliberately allowed themselves to become afflicted . ”
Various excuses are given for the saturation bombing of civilians .
Sir Arthur Harris gave the following in his memoirs , Bomber Offensive .
“ In spite of all that happened at Hamburg , bombing proved a comparatively humane method .
For one thing , it saved the flower of youth of this country and of our allies from being mown down by the military in the field , as it was in Flanders …
But the point is often made that bombing is specially wicked because it causes causalities among civilians .
This is true , but then all wars have caused causalities among civilians .
For instance , [ in ] the last war … our blockade of Germany … caused nearly 800,000 deaths – naturally these were mainly of women and children and old people because at all costs the enemy had had to keep his fighting men fed . ”
Vera Brittain had already written in Seeds of Chaos that the substitution of civilian deaths for military lives is no different to a soldier using a civilian as a shield on the battlefield .
Whilst a certain degree of “ collateral damage ” can be afforded by the principle of double effect , it must not be disproportionate .
Grayling says of such killing that it “ violates the principle established by Aquinas and Grotius that a just action in war is a proportionate one .
To stop guns being made by killing an armaments worker and his family and neighbours is disproportionate . ”
As for Harris ’ second claim that civilians always get killed in war , let us remember that two wrongs do n’t make a right .
Says Grayling : “ imagine a murderer defending himself by saying that there have always been murders , and that anyway he only murdered two people when someone else had murdered five . ”
In the same vein we cannot excuse the carpet bombing by saying that the Germans were only reaping the whirlwind of what they had sewn .
Father Gillis , then editor of the Catholic World , had pointed out the logic of this argument at the time by stating that Vera Brittain ’s opponents were arguing “ missionaries should eat cannibals because cannibals eat missionaries ” .
Perhaps another argument for bombing cities like Hiroshima , Nagaski and Dresden was to demonstrate to the Russians what Allied bombing was capable of .
The cruelty of such an exercise in real Politik speaks for itself .
After a careful examination of the Allies ’ own records and the reasons given by Bombing Command , Grayling comes to the following conclusions :
“ Was area bombing necessary ?
No .
Was it proportionate ?
No .
Was it against the humanitarian principles that people have been striving to enunciate as a way of controlling and limiting war ?
Yes .
Was it against the general moral standards of the kind recognised and agreed in Western civilisation in the last five centuries , or even 2,000 years ?
Yes .
Was it against what mature national laws provide in the way of outlawing murder , bodily harm , and destruction of property ?
Yes .
In short and in sum : was area bombing wrong ?
Yes .
Very wrong ?
Yes .
… Should airmen have refused to carry out the area bombing raids ?
Yes . ”
What does this purification of the victors ’ memory mean for the Coalition of the Willing today ?
We are at risk of going down the same ill thought - out utilitarian path .
Recent US military manuals allow for economic targets ( not just war industries ) and the breaking of civilian morale as fair objectives for attack ( cf. the Annotated Supplement to the Commander ’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations 8.1.1 .
Air Force Doctrine Document 1 ( 1997 ) ) .

Snoop Dogg has issued a new warning :
Do n't dare to compare his lyrics — or any other MC's — to syndicated radio host Don Imus ' recent racially inflammatory comments about the black women on the Rutgers University women 's basketball team .
Imus called them " nappy - headed ho's , " among other insults .
Admittedly , Snoop and some of his peers have called women " b----es " and " ho 's " in their lyrics , but as the Dogg put it Tuesday afternoon ( April 10 ) , there is no parallel to what Imus said .
" It 's a completely different scenario , " said Snoop , barking over the phone from a hotel room in L.A. " [ Rappers ] are not talking about no collegiate basketball girls who have made it to the next level in education and sports .
We 're talking about ho's that 's in the 'hood that ain't doing sh-- , that 's trying to get a n--- a for his money .
These are two separate things .
First of all , we ain't no old - ass white men that sit up on MSNBC [ which announced Wednesday it would drop its simulcast of Imus ' radio show ] going hard on black girls .
We are rappers that have these songs coming from our minds and our souls that are relevant to what we feel .
I will not let them mutha---- as say we in the same league as him . "
Snoop did say , though , that the media needs to treat Imus as it treats some MCs ( or football players , even ) .
" Kick him off the air forever , " he said .
" Ban him like they did [ Adam ] ' Pacman ' Jones .
They kicked him out the [ National Football ]
League for the whole season [ for numerous violations of the NFL 's personal - conduct policy , including multiple arrests ] , but this punk gets to get on the air and call black women ' nappy - headed ho's . ' "
At the time of this interview , Snoop 's arraignment on felony charges ( possession of a firearm and sale or transportation of marijuana ) was looming , but on Wednesday afternoon ( April 11 ) , he pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to five years ' probation and 800 hours of community service ; a three - year prison sentence was suspended .
" Snoop accepts full responsibility for these matters , " his attorney , Donald Etra , said in a statement .
" He understands that , while he has every reason to seek security and protection , he cannot have a gun in his own vehicle , and he must only employ licensed security personnel .
By the same token , although Snoop possesses a medical marijuana certificate , he recognizes , he cannot possess more marijuana than permitted by that law . "
The charges stem from Snoop 's October arrest at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank , California ( see " Snoop Dogg Arrested For Drug , Gun Possession At Airport " ) .
Amid all this , he 's promoting a new album as well : a compilation called Snoop Dogg Presents :
The Big Squeeze that is geared toward giving some shine to upcoming artists as well as seasoned vets .
It 's due April 24 on Koch .
" I produced the whole album , " the Dogg explained .
" I 'm trying to give some light to these West Coast artists out here .
Some of them are rivals , so I brought them all together so they could move forward .
I call it The Big Squeeze because I 'm finnin ' to squeeze the game by the neck .
It 's a parade of the artists that I felt was my starters .
As opposed to grabbing everybody from the West Coast , I grabbed the ones I thought were best at the time .
" We 'll be dropping The [ Big ] Squeeze 2 in like three months just to make sure it 's more and more talent that 's coming , " he added .
" As opposed to calling in Pharrell and Timbaland and Scott Storch , all my high - powered friends , I said , ' Let me do it on my own and show them that if I 'm willing to make the sacrifice , maybe they will too . ' ... I just wanted to give them a shot .
Do a record with them , people know they official ... then they got me whenever they need me .
If they wanna do a [ record ] deal with me , then come on .
If not , then they on their own .
I 'm not trying to lock anybody down . "
You may even get to see some of these artists on the stage with Snoop soon .
He and Diddy are bringing their tour to the U.S. after a run of several weeks across the world ( see " Snoop Dogg Barred From Entering U.K. , Cancels Dates With Diddy " ) .
The West Coast King is also focusing on an adults - only cartoon movie to accompany his album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment .

The contestants in the Miss Universe competition have been showing off some bizarre dressesdesigned to reflect their country 's culture .
Thousands of spectators packed the Reforma Avenue in Mexico City to watch the striking , beautiful and in some cases strange costumes , worn by the hopefuls to win the beauty pageant , which will be held in the Mexican capital on May 28 .
The loudest cheer was unsurprisingly for Miss Mexico , or Rosa Maria Ojeda , whose dress was decorated with images of Mexican food , including corn on the cob and tropical fruit , alongside symbols of ancient Indian cultures .
Miss USA , or Rachel Smith , showed the United States ' love for rock and roll , dressing in an Elvis Presley - style white suit and holding an electric guitar .
A dreadlocked Miss Jamaica , or Zahra Redwood , the first Rastafarian to compete for the beauty prize , went for a reggae theme with a T - shirt of singer Bob Marley .
There was some protests , with one group of women wearing white dresses covered in fake blood trying to draw attention to towns or states in Mexico where women have been raped or killed , in some cases with alleged involvement by police or soldiers .

" I asked a man in prison once how he happened to be there and he said he had stolen a pair of shoes .
I told him if he had stolen a railroad he would be a United States Senator " - Mother Jones
Consider this disturbing fact : the United States now has the world 's highest incarceration rate outside of North Korea .
Out of 1,000 people , more Americans are behind bars than anywhere in the world except in Kim Jong - Il 's Neo -Stalinist state .
The US has a higher incarceration rate than China , Russia , Iran , Zimbabwe and Burma - countries American politicians often berate for their human rights violations .
Well over two million Americans are behind bars .
Let us agree that violent criminals and sex offenders should be in jail , but most Americans are not aware that over one million people spend year after year in prison for non-violent and petty offenses : small - time drug dealing , street hustling , prostitution , bouncing checks and even writing graffiti .
Texas , with its boot - in - your - butt criminal justice system , is now attempting to incarcerate people who get drunk at bars - even if they are not disturbing the peace and intend to take a taxi home .
Somewhere along the line , the Lone Star State becomes the Lock - Down State : Rodney Hulin , a 16 year old in Texas , was caught setting a dumpster on fire and sentenced to 8 years in an adult prison .
Despite pleading to be removed to another section , prison officials found no reason to extract him from the general population ( despite Rodney 's official pleas ) .
He was then repeatedly raped and infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS .
He ended the nightmare by hanging himself in his cell .
Even " progressive " states like California are eager to lock up the hapless and the marginal .
Billy Ochoa , for example , is serving 326 years in a " SUPERMAX " ( super maximum security ) prison for welfare fraud .
Billy is an addict , an inept burglar , and not -very - good trafficker of food stamps .
Under California's " three strikes and your out " law , he is locked up in a tiny cell for 23 hours a day .
Arguably , continuously lowering the bar for what it takes to be jailed threatens the liberty of all Americans .
And having one million non-violent offenders in prison ( often for absurdly long periods ) makes it that much easier , in the near future , for the return of debtors ' prisons and dissident detention centers .
This approach to locking up everyone possible undermines both the liberal emphasis on personal liberty and the conservative emphasis on small government .
At this pace , the US is in danger of witnessing the development of a kind of " gulag " to jail the entire lumpenproletariat , the flotsam of society , a population that cuts across racial lines to include the men and women who never seem to break free of the tentacle - like criminal justice system .
Women , actually , are now the fastest growing prison population , and many of them are young mothers with babies .
Of course , we 'll never know how many prisoners are even guilty .
They have been locked up through mass " plea bargaining " agreements .
Originally conceived a the exception to the rule , plea bargaining has become a conveyor belt for prisons , running against the grain of the Fifth Amendment 's right to a fair trial and , more specifically , to the US Constitution , Article III , Section 2 : " The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury . "
While might be a time and a place for plea bargaining , it has become a scam in which prisons are basically guaranteed a minimum flow of prisoners .
Here 's the deal : Plead guilty to a lesser crime ( to something you might not have done ) and go to jail for 3 years - or risk a trial and the chance of doing 15 years .
It 's a no -brainer .
The Founding Fathers would be rolling in their graves even faster than they already are if they knew that prisons are now lucrative corporations .
These " McJails " receive money from government on a per-prisoner , per -day basis .
No doubt , had the framers of the Constitution imagined that future Americans could descend to such depths they would have banned the commercialization of prisons outright .
Not surprisingly , the executives of these for - profit prisons sponsor " tough - on - crime " legislation and even line the pockets of politicians who back " mandatory sentencing " laws .
For - profit prisons even get to write new mandatory sentencing laws to guarantee the raw material ( the rabble of society ) for an emerging prison - industrial complex .
In a Great Leap Backward , American politicians have also repealed two federal laws ( the Hawes Cooper Act and the Ashurst - Sumner Act ) that virtually outlawed prison labor , making it a felony to move prison - made goods across state boundaries .
Stamping state license plates for cars was generally acceptable , but these Acts tried to end the leasing out of prisoners to private companies - they tried to eliminate prison - plantations and " factories with fences . "
In the 1970s , a Supreme Court Justice , Warren Burger , proselytized for more leeway as to what kinds of " projects " prisoners could work on .
Before too long , Congress amended the laws , and by 1990 it was permissible for prisoners to produce products entering the stream of interstate commerce .
Many of the largest corporations in America have taken advantage of prison labor in what might be called " Operation Sweatshop . "
Amazingly , on http://www.correctionscorp.com/
there is a separate section for " investors . "
" Corrections Corporation of America is the nation 's largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the United States , behind only the federal government and three states " ( Corrections Corporation of America ) .
Thus , the " tough on crime " propaganda masks a profit motive .
Naturally , no politician can say that " my campaign was paid for by corporate lock - downs " or " I help run prison sweatshops . "
Representatives in Congress - mostly the " Big Government " Republicans but also many " Nanny - State " Democrats - are becoming the new goons in an emerging for - profit police state .

Senator Barack Obama is a rising star of US politics
An advertisement for a feature about the whereabouts of the al - Qaeda leader carried the caption " Where 's Obama ? " over images of Bin Laden .
CNN has apologised for " a very bad typographical error " .
A spokesman for Mr Obama , a potential presidential hopeful , said he accepted that it was an innocent error .
" Though I 'd note that the 's ' and ' b ' keys are n't all that close to each other , I assume it was just an unfortunate mistake , " his spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
The error happened on Monday night during presenter Wolf Blitzer 's news programme The Situation Room .
Mr Blitzer apologised on air for the slip .
" I 'm going to be making a call to him later this morning to offer my personal apology , " he said .
Mr Obama , tipped by some to become the country 's first black president , admitted in October that he was considering a White House run in 2008 .
He has always been ready to deal with questions about his unusual name .
" When I first started to work in public life ... people would ask : ' Hey brother , what 's with your name ?
You called Alabama or Yo' Mama ? ' "
He has also acknowledged that his full name , Barack Hussein Obama , is not ideal for someone involved in politics .
A lot of lives are just plain clogged up with goo .
I ’m not talking about actual gunk that you can see , feel , or even wash off .
If it were only that easy , the goo would be gone from most people ’s lives … well maybe .
You ca n’t see the plaque that clogs up your arteries without special medical equipment , but you believe that it ’s there when the chest pain starts and your doctor explains what ’s causing the pain .
Most people will take that conversation very seriously and do what their doctor tells them to .
Some wo n’t .
Some will keep eating the wrong foods , sitting around and not exercising , and some will even keep smoking .
Even when we ’re faced with actual pain that we can identify , and the actual possibility of death , some of us will not change our habits and try to improve our situation .
That ’s bad , really bad .
It ’s bad in and of its own , but even more so because the goo that I ’m talking about you ca n’t see at all , you ca n’t directly feel or measure .
There are no x-rays , or sophisticated tests to make the goo , or its effects readily visible .
Although a small percentage of people can easily see the goo ’s presence and its effects , most people are blind to it and to them it ’s completely invisible .
This means that even fewer people will actually take it seriously and try to rid it from their lives .
If we could create a special pair of glasses , perhaps as in a science fiction movie , that would allow anyone to see this goo , what would they see when they put on the glasses ?
What would their reaction be ?
Would they do anything about it ?
Or would apathy win again ?
If they put on the glasses , they ’d see every self - doubt , every second guess , every fear , every negative thought , every spiteful thought , every hateful act , every passed up opportunity to help someone else , every missed or passed up chance to foster growth in someone else , and every passed up opportunity to build up someone else ’s spirit creating more of the most disgusting , foul , revolting , suffocating goo you ’ve ever seen .
This stuff is so bad it makes vomit look good .
I mean it ’s nasty .
It literally oozes from every pore of the body .
With these special glasses , they would see themselves practically drowning in it .
They ’d see it dripping from their hands , face , ears , arms , from every part of their body .
You ca n’t wash it away , wipe it off , or hide it .
It slows you down and pulls at you with its stickiness .
You slosh through it as you walk from room to room , spreading it everywhere you go , and boy is this stuff contagious .
When you open your car door to get out , it flows out in an endless flood like some infected alien mucus into the street .
Not everyone has this goo .
A small percentage of the population is immune to its effects and resistant to its infection .
Why ?
I ’m not sure .
Just as some people have natural gifts for things like running , singing , painting , etc .
I think some people are naturally positive , giving individuals , who even in the darkest of circumstances continue to give off goodness and grace and lift those around them .
My wife is one of these people .
When we started dating , I would tell her that she was like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty and had little birds singing around her head when she woke up in the morning .
Soon after telling her that , when I would do something to hurt her feelings or disappoint her , she would tell me that I had killed one of her birds .
I think this was the beginning of my ability to understand and see the effects of this goo .
Being able to understand and see the effects of this goo is so important when dealing with children .
Our jobs as a parent or teacher is to mold , shape , and guild , not drown our children in our own goo .
It ’s easy to see : go to a few sporting events for kids like soccer or baseball .
Watch for the bulling parent yelling at their kid and telling them how bad they are .
All that goo from the lousy parent just killed the birds flying around their child ’s head .
Their spirit is completely gone , suffocated by the slimy goo that their parent is spewing all over them .
Hopefully you ’re not one of those type parents .
Learning to recognize your own goo gushing attitudes , behaviors , and habits is critical to achieving your goals and dreams .
One attribute of goo that I have n’t mentioned is that it ’s very dense and highly magnetic and will therefore attract more goo !
In order to have room to attract positive things you have to reduce the amount of goo in your life .
Just like you ca n’t have up without down , a front without a back , a top without a bottom , hot without cold , you ca n’t have good without bad , and goo is the bad part .
Pay close attention and you can begin to see its effects and its presence .
To remove the goo , you have to change things about yourself and your life .
Some people require only a small change ; other people need a massive overhaul .
In the most extreme cases , a person will need to completely walk away from almost everything and everyone in their life .
It ’s hard to change and each step requires conscious thought and effort .
You ’ll catch yourself slipping over and over ; however , a change eventually becomes a habit .
Do n’t give up .
The more goodness you exude , the less goo you have clogging up your life .
Remove the goo and you ’ll be free to achieve anything you set your mind to .
Sincerely ,
Fred

The other day I read an interesting article on MSN ( courtesy of Oprah.com ) which talked about ways for people to discover their “ true passions . ”
While the article itself was worth reading , once I looked at it from a business standpoint , I found it completely fascinating .
In going down the ten items listed in the article , I think that each one is something that every entrepreneur has considered , even if they did n’t know it at the time .
Here are three items off the list that I ’d like to discuss at length :
Listen to your inner voice .
There ’s really no point in starting a business if you ’re going to run it half - heartedly , or if it ’s something that you ’re not truly passionate about .
Sure , you ’re going to have plenty of great ideas along the way , but if there ’s some lingering doubt as to whether or not you believe in it , you ’re probably better served to let it go and wait until you find something that really “ moves ” you .
Tune out the voice of the world .
In order to become a successful entrepreneur you have to have some pretty thick skin because along the way you ’re going to have a lot of people doubting you and your idea(s ) .
Do n’t get me wrong , there are going to be instances when the naysayers are right .
That being said , if you truly believe in your idea and believe that you have the ability to make it a success , continue to go after it .
Be patient .
Out of all the obsticles to becoming a successful entrepreneur , I believe that that being patient is the most difficult .
We live in a very NOW oriented society , and many of us expect to reap the rewards of our business once we get it up and running .
Chances are that ’s not going to happen .
For example , they say that for most people who make money off of their websites , it takes at least one year before you start to see all of your hard work pay off .
From experience , I can say that this is 100 % true .
Obviously , following these steps wo n’t guarantee that you ’re going to succeed at your business .
I ’m sure there have been plenty of people who listened to their instincts , tuned out the rest of the world and patiently waited for their business to become a success , only to have to close up shop .
That being said , I believe that more often than not , business that ultimately do end up succeeding did follow many of the items pointed out in the MSN article .
User generated content is all the rage but most of it totally sucks .
That is why sites like YouTube , MySpace , CNN , and HuffPost are all embracing the mullet strategy .
They let users party , argue , and vent on the secondary pages , but professional editors keep the front page looking sharp .
The mullet strategy is here to stay because the best way for web companies to grow traffic is to let the users have control , but the best way to sell advertising is a slick , pretty front page where corporate sponsors can wistfully admire their brands .
Stop him before he kills again .
That is the judgment of the American people , and indeed of the entire world , as to the performance of our president , and no State of the Union address can erase that dismal verdict .
President Bush has accomplished what Osama bin Laden only dreamed of by disgracing the model of American democracy in the eyes of the world .
According to an exhaustive BBC poll , nearly three - quarters of those polled in 25 countries oppose the Bush policy on Iraq , and more than two - thirds believe the U.S. presence in the Middle East destabilizes the region .
In other words , the almost universal support the United States enjoyed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks has been completely squandered , as a majority of the world ’s people now believe that our role in the entire world is negative .
“ The thing that comes up repeatedly is not just anger about Iraq , ” said Steven Kull , the director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland , which helped conduct the global poll .
“ The common theme is hypocrisy .
The reaction tends to be : ‘ You were a champion of a certain set of rules .
Now you are breaking your own rules , so you are being hypocritical . ’ ”
More depressing , that judgment is shared by those who know us best : our allies in Britain , the only country still willing to share our sacrifices in Bush ’s once ballyhooed “ Coalition of the Willing . ”
Despite British Prime Minister Tony Blair ’s dogged support of his American chum , fully 81 percent of Britons told the BBC they are opposed to U.S. actions in Iraq , while a scant 14 percent still believe the United States is a stabilizing force in the Mideast .
But it is not just our failure in that all - important region that disgraces us .
Those around the world who still believe we play a positive global role has dropped to a miserable 29 percent , strikingly similar to Bush ’s overall performance numbers at home , according to the most recent CBS poll .
So it ’s true : Bush is “ a uniter , not a divider ” — uniting people across the world in their opposition to his policies .
With a whopping 71 percent saying in an ABC - Washington
Post poll that the country is seriously off track , the Post called it “ the highest such expression of national pessimism in more than a decade . ”
And that ’s at a time when the economy , presumed to be the all - important bellwether , is in halfway decent shape .
It ’s the war , stupid , and ending it is the major concern of most Americans , while all other issues are in single digits of importance to them .
In a shocking twist , Americans are now turning to the Democrats in Congress for leadership on foreign policy .
“ Three in 5 Americans trust congressional Democrats more than Bush to deal with Iraq , and the same proportion want Congress to try to block his troop - increase plan , ” reported the Post .
That is a mandate the Democrats ignore at their own peril .
Even an increasing number of congressional Republicans , most recently Sen.
John Warner of Virginia , have made it clear that ending this disastrous adventure is vital to their electoral future .
Warner , along with several moderates in both parties , proposed legislation on Tuesday opposing Bush ’s sending of 21,500 additional troops to Iraq .
In fact , it seems as if everyone gets it except the president and those still hunkered down with him in the White House .
“ They ’ve backed themselves into a tough corner , ” GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio told the Post , “ and the problem is his continued insistence for the troop increase , which flies in the face of what 70 percent of Americans want . ”
He added that it makes Bush seem to say , “ I ’ll listen to you , but I ’ll do what I want anyway . ”
Hardly the message that the leader of the world ’s greatest experiment in representative democracy should be sending to the world .
It is a message voters in the midterm election soundly rejected , along with the association of this great country with torture and chicanery , and it is the basis of what the Post calls a mainstream America “ honeymoon ” with the Democrats .
Americans understand in their gut that the long - term consequences of disillusionment with democracy , here and abroad , would be disastrous .
In the same way Congress repudiated an out - of - control president three decades ago , the House and Senate must show the world today that our celebrated system of checks and balances is not just a fanciful mirage .
Spreading the ideal of democracy throughout the world remains a compelling obligation of those who enjoy freedom , making this an excellent occasion to demonstrate that we still possess a system capable of holding a deceitful and egomaniacal leader accountable .
Web developers working with Javascript and the Document Object Model will know that development can often be a longwinded process .
The large selection of standardised tools we have available at our disposal , as stipulated by the W3C , allow us to manipulate the DOM with an unprecedented level of precision .
However this precision comes at the expense of time , and unfortunately the W3C were not so generous in providing tools which could forfeit precision for speed and ease of use .
Enter Microsoft with it 's non-standard innerHTML function .
innerHTML benefits for all the latter reasons ; it is easy and incredibly quick to use .
Despite lacking in precision it remains a popular tool of choice for many DOM scripters .
Even its exemption from the W3C 's specification has not deterred many web developers from utilising it .
innerHTML enjoys good cross - browser support , but like all non-standard aspects of web design this is unlikely to remain so come future advancements in browser technology .
Such change will no doubt render all script using innerHTML inoperable .
We need to find an alternative ; a standardised innerHTML .
What is innerXHTML ?
innerXHTML is a glorified DOM read / writer .
It is my answer to the non-standard innerHTML , the result of too many late nights in front of the computer screen and the aspirin to many of my DOM scripting headaches .
It utilises existing functionality , all supported by the W3C , to read and write to the DOM .
In doing so , innerXHTML gains all the benefits of innerHTML without the baggage ; speed and ease of use , whilst keeping within the boundaries of global standardisation .
innerXHTML is not a document copier ; it does not fetch exactly what the document contains , character for character in a zombie - like fashion .
innerXHTML reads the document node tree , returning a text string of markup to the document 's equivelent .
Likewise , innerXHTML writes to the DOM with the correct approach ; intelegently , node by node , not as one big string .
You wont find any document . write ( ) here !
How does innerXHTML work ?
It is split into two functions .
The first function innerXHTML acts as the interface between the two .
It reads the document node tree and returns markup in plain text to the source that called it .
The second function translateXHTML serves the purpose of translating XHTML and XML code from a plain text string into nodes for insertion into the document object model .
translateXHTML is the more processor - heavy function and is additionally more complex in structure .
You can operate translateXHTML independently from innerXHTML , though I do n't recommend this .
Using innerXHTML to read from the DOM
I have built innerXHTML to work much like innerHTML .
Once the .js file is referenced by your markup document using a < script src= " " > you can use innerXHTML like any other function :
var container = document.getElementById(' container ' ) ;
var code = innerXHTML ( container ) ;
This snippet of script above , will find the node with an id attribute of ' container ' and , using the innerXHTML function return it 's entire content in a plain text string - markup 'n all .
The one and only parenthesis is the mandatory source element from which we are reading .
Remember , innerXHTML will return the markup of whatever nodes the source element contains .
Data returned will not include the source element 's own tag and attributes , mirroring the non-standard innerHTML .
Lets take a quick look at the aforementioned innerHTML for execution comparison :
var container = document.getElementById(' container ' ) ;
var code = container.innerHTML ;
As you can see innerXHTML takes a slightly different approach , but ultimately remains just as easy to use .
Using innerXHTML to write to the DOM
Whilst reading has its benefits , innerXHTML really comes into its own over regular , hand - written document.createElement ( ) techniques when writing to the DOM .
Traditionally every element , and sub-element , and sub - sub - element has to be individually created by you the developer , in addition to each element 's potentially multiple attributes and contained text nodes .
This is a labouring process to say the least .
Using innerXHTML all you are required to provide is the plain string of markup .
The function will do the hard work of reading and translating the markup into DOM nodes and inserting them into your document for you .
Let 's take a look :
var container = document.getElementById(' container ' ) ;
var markup = ' < div id =" content " >< p class = " text " >
Hello world !</p></div>';
var code = innerXHTML ( container , markup ) ;
Our innerXHTML function accepts two parentheses this time ; the mandatory source element in which we are writing , and secondly the string of text markup to replace any existing content therein .
The above code fragment finds the element with an id of ' container ' and , via innerXHTML , inserts into it a < div > with an id attribute of ' content ' .
Into that it appends a < p > paragraph element with a child text node of ' Hello World ! ' .
Do n't worry about any document.createElement ( ) ; messing about ; innerXHTML takes care of this all for you .
The variable code here is optional and will now contain exactly the same text markup as you put into the function .
Some people use innerHTML for the purpose of quickly emptying an element of its children .
This is a perfectly good use of innerXHTML with a command such as innerXHTML ( container , ' ' ) ; .
Just be aware that a value must be passed for the second parenthesis ; ideally , a space .
Technically this means you are not emptying the source element completely , but rather replacing its content with a single space text node .
However for practical use this should serve the purpose .
Additional Information
I have repeatedly streamlined innerXHTML to run as efficiently as possible , and from earlier ( you could call them alpha ; ) ) , development versions the results do show .
innerXHTML is quick in operation and can construct full pages from markup easily , depending on the computer and browser speed .
It is naturally not as fast as the non-standard innerHTML , but the differences are in miliseconds , again depending on the quantity of code .
Speed tests coming soon .
Please remember that this function expects only code adhering to web standards .
Passing the function non-standard markup or trying to read an invalid document will likely result in process failure !
Additionally I have taken time to ensure innerXHTML is as cross - browser compatible as possible , hence some structural changes along the development line .
Below is a table of browser support information .
Please note that the browsers listed below are the only ones that I have tested innerXHTML on .
If a browser you are looking for is not listed here then it will not mean that innerXHTML does not run , it simply means I have not tested it as yet .
If you do undertake any further testing and have feedback then please get in touch with me .
It 's all good :)
Browser Supported ?
Additional Comments IE 7 Windows Full support ( Minor proprietary characteristics )
Some elements , such as < img /> , are given extra attributes when read with innerXHTML .
However , further testing has found this causes no fracture to the functionality and the differences are likely to go unnoticed .
IE 6 Windows Full support ( Minor proprietary characteristics ) ' on ' events ( onclick , onmouseover , etc. ) do not work when translated from text into document .
Fixed in v0.4 +.
See IE7 ( above ) .
IE 5 Windows Virtually full support
In addition to the IE6 / 7 proprietary characteristics ( detailed above ) IE5 does not translate <!-- comments -->.
However markup created on - the - fly with JS does not appear in the source document anyway , so unless you plan to insert markup then read it back into a string , you 're not going to notice a thing :) FF Windows Full support Flock Windows Full support FF Mac Full support Safari Mac Full support Camino Mac Full support Opera Windows
Full support ( Minor proprietary characteristics )
Writes elements using uppercased tag and attribute names , and enters unnecessary attributes such as shape = " rect " .
However , further testing has found this causes no fracture to the functionality and the differences are likely to go unnoticed ..
Important : innerXHTML translates and inserts XML into the DOM without a problem in all browsers .
It reads and returns XML correctly in most browsers too ; every one except Microsoft Internet Explorer 5&6 .
This is entirely down to poor DOM support by IE .
For the same reason IE 5&6 will not read any part of the document node tree containing element ( s ) it does not recognise .
In practical use this basically means by example that innerXHTML will not read any part of the document tree containing the < abbr > element in Internet Explorer 6 or less .
Internet Explorer 7 has corrected the problem .
Callin ' it a do
Take a copy of the innerXHTML script and feel free to leave any comments or thoughts you may have .
At 150 lines innerXHTML weighs in at just under 6 kb and shouldnt burden your website much .
I 've released this software under the Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 3.0 License .
It is intended only to reduce DOM script development time , and I hope this is what it achieves .
If you do happen to uncover any elusive bugs I have missed then please drop me an email .
Otherwise enjoy :)

As tempting as it was after the Iraq Supplemental Bill to lump Democrats and Republicans together , let 's give credit where credit is due .
The Democratic majority is the only reason we have to be hopeful of restoring this basic right taken away from us by the Bush Administration and their enabling Republican majority .
Potentially , the entire Military Commissions
Act could be dismantled .
Ari Melber at The Nation has more :
Today the Senate Judiciary Committee passed an important bill to restore habeas corpus , the sacrosanct Constitutional right to challenge government detention in court , by a vote of eleven to eight .
Habeas corpus was revoked by last year 's Military Commissions Act , which has been assailed as unconstitutional and un-American by leaders across the political spectrum .
Today 's habeas bill was backed by the Judiciary Committee 's Democratic Chairman , Patrick Leahy , and its Republican Ranking Member , Arlen Specter .
" The drive to restore this fundamental right has come from both sides of the aisle , " said Sharon Bradford , an attorney at the bipartisan Constitution Project , in response to today 's vote .
" Restoring America 's commitment to the rule of law is not a partisan cause ; it is a patriotic one , " she added .
Today 's vote means the habeas bill can now be brought to the Senate floor at any time .
One source with knowledge of the legislative plan said Majority Leader Harry Reid has committed to bringing the bill to a vote within the month .
Some Democrats are pushing Reid to go further , advocating more comprehensive human rights protections and a repeal of the entire Military Commissions Act .
So lately I 've heard everyone going absolutely bonkers about this whole Net Neutrality issue .
For those of you who are n't aware of it , you can get more information about it at http://www.savetheinternet.com.
Call me naive , but this does n't worry me as much it seems to be worrying others ?
Why , you may ask ?
Because free market capitalism has an overwhelming capacity to remedy its problems through competition .
As one smart man put it " the day that telecoms start insisting people charge fees for ' premium access ...' is the day that smart companies will absolutely decimate those telecoms in the marketplace . "
Companies like Google , Amazon , Skype , Earthlink and others are absolutely huge .
Even if the COPE act is passed , do you honestly believe that companies which support Net Neutrality wo n't become ISPs and openly offer net - neutral surfing as one of their primary features ?
A COPE internet service provider which had to compete against others which offered free and open services would be absolutely decimated , and that is where capitalism would solve the problem on its own .
Well , I 'm done ranting for now .
Gonna go back to bed .
I 've come down with a serious case of strep throat , so I need all the rest I can get .
Wish me a speedy recovery , everyone .
Among the many things one can do to make China “ lose face ” in the international eye :
1. Distribute toxic playthings to small children the world around
2. Kidnap and enslave hundreds of your countrymen and their children and force them to work in subhuman conditions
3 . Crop the edges off a map
All three offensives have been committed in the last year , and all three were met with swift punishment .
Granted , the map offenders have it a little easier than Zheng Xiaoyu ( former director of the State Food and Drug Administration who will be executed for his role in the this year ’s tainted export debacle ) .
Six hotel chains have been found in violation of map standards regulated by the Shanghai ’s Mapping and Survey Management Office for failing to show the entirety of China — in all its island - speckled , Taiwan - including glory — on maps purporting to depict the nation .
And by “ purporting to depict the nation , ” we mean anything that is not clearly labeled to explain what it lacks .
The Shanghai Daily gives on example :
The Wuyi Road outlet of the discount chain Home Inn was found providing maps that only showed one - third of China , neglecting to show the vast western part of the country .
According to a receptionist at the hotel who declined to be identified , the maps simply show the part of China where Home Inn has hotels .
That is illegal , according to Zhu , because the map was designed in a way that suggests it is showing the whole country .
If it was labeled properly to indicate it only showed eastern China , and it included Taiwan Province , it would be alright .
Publishers of incomplete maps can be fined up to 10,000 yuan ( US $ 1,315 ) .
Does that mean Google is in trouble ?
Shanghai Daily : Incomplete Maps Illegal

During Gonzales ' testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Gonzales refused to answer Sen .
Schumer 's question , who sent you to visit Ashcroft in the hospital , to try to gain his approval of the Terrorist Survelience Program :
Schumer asked him point blank : " Did the President send you ?
Did the Vice President send you ? " and to both questions , Gonzales answered " We were there on behalf of the President " , meaning he refused to say who sent him .
Both men seem to believe it is not public knowledge who sent Gonzales to strong - arm the weakened Ashcroft .
I must admit , when I heard the " Did the Vice President send you , " question , it sounded like fishing to me .
It sounds like nobody knows who sent Gonzales , and Gonzales should really be telling this oversight committee who it was that sent him .
Then , in a related editorial last week , the NYTimes called for Gonzales ' investigation and impeachment ( see also this diary by mcjoan .
Talkingpointsmemo.com pointed out this passage today , where it states in the most matter of fact ways that Vice President Dick Cheney sent Gonzales to Ashcroft 's hospital room .
Unwilling to accept that conclusion , Vice President Dick Cheney sent Mr. Gonzales and another official to Mr. Ashcroft ’s hospital room to get him to approve the wiretapping .
This leaves us with some questions : ( 1 ) Why did Schumer , during Gonzales Testimony , hit on whether the Vice President asked him to visit Ashcroft ?
Does he know something which is not public ?
( 2 ) Does someone on the NYTimes Editorial Board know something we do n't ?
More importantly , does the NYTimes fact - check its OpEd pieces , and can we get them to either source the statement which has already appeared in their press ?
If it really was Vice President Cheney who sent Gonzales to try to force Ashcroft to approve the TSP , we now have the face for who was trying to gain the barest thread of legitimacy for the illegal program .
UPDATE : Note that NC
Dem mentioned this very point in a comment yesterday .
Here .
UPDATE II : Additional discussion on this topic taking place in a later story by the fabulous MissLaura Here .
UPDATE III ( Aug 2 ) .
Following this , on July 31 , Larry King had Cheney on CNN where he put this question to the VP directly , " Did you send them ? " .
Cheney dithered , " I do n't recall " .
CNN commentator Wolf Blitzer and Larry King , reviewing the issue , all but implied Cheney was lying , as you can see in the White House transcript or in this complete video .
And , today , Dan Froomkin reviews this meme at the WaPost .
I 've now written the NYTimes twice , asking them to confirm their initial statement in the July 29th Editorial , which seems to have launched the meme .
The statement remains unsourced ; but , now , it seems everyone believes the Vice President sent Gonzales and Card to Ashcroft 's bedside .

Sen . John McCain - October 19 , 1993
There is no reason for the United States of America to remain in Somalia .
The American people want them home , I believe the majority of Congress wants them home , and to set an artificial date of March 31 or even February 1 , in my view , is not acceptable .
The criteria should be to bring them home as rapidly and safely as possible , an evolution which I think could be completed in a matter of weeks .
Our continued military presence in Somalia allows another situation to arise which could then lead to the wounding , killing or capture of American fighting men and women .
We should do all in our power to avoid that .
I listened carefully to the President 's remarks at a news conference that he held earlier today .
I heard nothing in his discussion of the issue that would persuade me that further U.S. military involvement in the area is necessary .
In fact , his remarks have persuaded me more profoundly that we should leave and leave soon .
Dates certain , Mr. President , are not the criteria here .
What is the criteria and what should be the criteria is our immediate , orderly withdrawal from Somalia .
And if we do not do that and other Americans die , other Americans are wounded , other Americans are captured because we stay too long -- longer than necessary -- then I would say that the responsibilities for that lie with the Congress of the United States who did not exercise their authority under the Constitution of the United States and mandate that they be brought home quickly and safely as possible .
. . .
I know that this debate is going to go on this afternoon and I have a lot more to say , but the argument that somehow the United States would suffer a loss to our prestige and our viability , as far as the No. 1 superpower in the world , I think is baloney .
The fact is , we won the cold war .
The fact is , we won the Persian Gulf conflict .
And the fact is that the United States is still the only major world superpower .
I can tell you what will erode our prestige .
I can tell you what will hurt our viability as the world 's superpower , and that is if we enmesh ourselves in a drawn - out situation which entails the loss of American lives , more debacles like the one we saw with the failed mission to capture Aideed 's lieutenants , using American forces , and that then will be what hurts our prestige .
We suffered a terrible tragedy in Beirut , Mr. President ; 240 young marines lost their lives , but we got out .
Now is the time for us to get out of Somalia as rapidly and as promptly and as safely as possible .
I , along with many others , will have an amendment that says exactly that .
It does not give any date certain .
It does not say anything about any other missions that the United States may need or feels it needs to carry out .
It will say that we should get out as rapidly and orderly as possible .
Sen Strom Thurmond ( R - SC ) - October 5 , 1993
It is past time for the Congress to come to grips with this sorry spectacle and force the administration to find a way out of the quagmire -- before Somalia becomes the pattern for future United States missions with the United Nations .
Sen . Phil Gramm ( R - TX ) , October 7
The President 's decision to extend our presence for 6 more months is totally unacceptable to me and totally unacceptable , I believe , to the Congress .
If the people of Texas - - who are calling my phones every moment , who are sending me letters and telegrams by the hour -- are representative of the will of the American people , the American people do not believe that we should allow Americans to be targets in Somalia for 6 more months .
I cannot see anything that we would achieve in 6 more months in Somalia
Sen .
Dirk Kempthorne ( R - ID ) , October 5
Mr. President , it is time for our troops to come home .
I would give this directive to the military leadership and that is that they are to use whatever means they determine necessary to secure the release of American POW 's in Somalia , because to leave them behind would be to issue adeath sentence to those Americans , and that is absolutely unacceptable .
But , Mr. President , the longer we leave United States troops in Somalia under U.N. command , the longer we leave United States troops in unjustified danger .
I owe my allegiance to the United States , not to the United Nations .
It is time for the Senate of the United States to get on with the debate , to get on with the vote , and to get the American troops home .
Sen .
Slade Gorton , October 6,1993 ( R - WA )
We are in a disaster , Mr. President .
If we had retreated earlier , we would have left fewer dead Americans behind .
It is time to retreat now and leave no more dead Americans behind and to learn the lesson that American power should be used only where we have a clear stake in a conflict , a clear goal to be achieved , the clear means to reach that goal , and the potential of clear support on the part of the American people .
As none of those exist in Somalia today , it is time to leave .
And for this body , it is time to debate this issue and not the nomination of an Assistant Attorney General .
Sen .
Jesse Helms - October 6 , 1993 ( R - NC )
Mr. President , the United States has no constitutional authority , as I see it , to sacrifice U.S. soldiers to Boutros - Ghali 's vision of multilateral peacemaking .
Again , I share the view of Senator Byrd that the time to get out is now .
We can take care of that criminal warlord over there .
We have the means to do it and the capacity to do it .
But it ought to be done by the United Nations .
I do not want to play in any more U.N. games .
I do not want any more of our people under the thumb of any U.N. commander -- none .
As a matter of fact , while we are at it , it is high time we reviewed the War Powers Act , which , in the judgment of this Senator , should never have been passed in the first place .
The sole constitutional authority to declare war rests , according to our Founding Fathers , right here in the Congress of the United States , and not on Pennsylvania Avenue .
I voted against the War Powers Act .
If it were to come up again today , I would vote against it .
I have never regretted my opposition to it .
Sen .
Alan Simpson ( R - WY ) - October 6
Let me close by saying I am willing to support our President , our Commander in Chief , if we have a policy either for decisive , potent , and powerful military action , without quarter , without reservation -- or obviously for us instead to withdraw from Somalia .
What I cannot continue to support is the continuing endangerment of Americans in the service of a policy that remains absolutely mysterious and totally muddled .
Sen .
Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) - October 4
And , thus , I hope that we , as a Senate , will proceed to discuss the issue of Somalia in the near future , in the immediate future , before any more American lives are lost ; and that we shall put into definition and some focus what is our purpose there and , most importantly , how we intend to disengage or , if it is our decision , how we intend to engage pursuant to the laws which we , as a nation , have as a constitutional democracy .
Sen .
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) - October 5
In February , I declined to cosponsor the Senate resolution which was introduced and passed in 1 day because I thought the resolution was too vague in terms of the United States mission and duration of our commitment in Somalia .
It was also because of the War Powers Act , because of a lack of congressional approval for this specific mission , that I , with six of my colleagues , voted against that resolution in the DOD bill .
It turns out , I believe , that the original resolution , w hich mandated a withdrawal of U.S. troops within 30 days unless continuation was authorized by a specific act of Congress , was probably the correct position .
I join several of my colleagues who have spoken today to say that we should leave Somalia now : we should not increase the American troop level or increase our involvement .
Our continued presence risks not only more American lives but also the possibility that the worldwide broadcasting of the mistreatment of U.S. prisoners will so inflame our national pride that it will be increasingly difficult to leave .
responsibilities for that lie with the Congress of the United States .
Russ Feingold today is chairing a Committee hearing in order to demonstrate that Congress has the Constitutional authority to compel the President to withdraw troops from Iraq , a power that is not merely confined to cutting off appropriations .
Sen .
Feingold is holding the hearing in the face of claims -- mostly from Congressional Republicans and their supporters -- that only the President has the power to make determinations about troop deployments , and Congress ' only power is one of appropriations .
Back in September , when Chris Wallace falsely accused Bill Clinton of emboldening the Terrorists by prematurely cutting - and - running from Somalia ( a favorite right - wing meme ) , it was documented here ( as Clinton himself pointed out to Wallace ) that it was actually Republican Senators whoClinton to withdraw troops by imposing troop withdrawal deadlines on him and threatening further restrictions on his ability to keep troops there .
But if one goes back and reviews that debate , it is quite striking that Republicans back then certainly did not seem to believe that Congress lacked the ability to restrict the President 's power to deploy troops .
They argued exactly the opposite - that they had that power -- and theyto force Clinton out of Somalia ( all excerpts are available here , by searching " Somalia ) : John McCain 's stirring pro-withdrawal Senate speech about why it was urgent that the SenateClinton to leave Somalia is particularly interesting in light of all of hisclaims today about Iraq :
In fact , one of the very few politicians who has been consistent in his views on this question is -- unsurprisingly -- Russ Feingold , who argued then what he argues now : namely , that the Constitution vests war - making power in the Congress and that Congress can ( and , in both cases , should ) restrict the President 's use of military force :
When Bill Clinton was President , most of the country 's leading Republicans did not seem to have any problem at all with Congressional " interference " in the President 's decisions to deploy troops ( really to maintain troop deployments , since President Bush 41 first deployed in Somalia ) .
There was n't any talk back then ( at least from them ) about the burden of " 535 Commanders - in - Chief " or " Congressional incursions " into the President 's constitutional warmaking authority .
They debated restrictions that ought to be legislatively imposed on President Clinton 's military deployments and then imposed them .
And Sen. McCain in particular made arguments in favor of Congressionally - mandated withdraw that are patently applicable to Iraq today .
And he specifically argued with regard to forcible troop withdrawal that " " The Constitution has n't changed since 1993 , so I wonder what has prompted such a fundamental shift in Republican views on the proper role of Congressional war powers .
WITH money scarce , you would have thought public schools would be grateful to receive any computers lying unused around the office or home .
Not so .
On average , it costs them around $ 400 to bring a geriatric computer up to snuff for the classroom .
Better to have your obsolete machines recycled commercially , or to find a charity that will refurbish them for a worthwhile cause .
Both will probably charge a small fee for handling the disposal .
But that 's better than consigning them to a landfill , where toxic chemicals used in their manufacture can leach into the water table .
Before computers became throwaway items , machines that were no longer powerful enough to do the job or broken beyond repair were kept as backups or cannibalised for spares .
Your correspondent has a handful of superannuated computers lying around the home .
The sprightliest of the bunch — a 400 - megahertz Pentium II that came loaded with Windows NT4.0 — has found a new lease on life as a Linux server .
That aside , it 's time for the rest to go .
But how to prepare a computer for reincarnation , if not final rights ?
Obviously , the first thing to do is remove all your old personal files from the hard drive .
People can be surprisingly negligent about such things .
Over a third of the hard drives resold on eBay are said to contain personal data such as credit and medical records .
Alas , wiping a computer clean is not as easy as it may seem .
Just deleting the personal files and emptying the recycle bin is next to useless .
The delete function only removes file names from a directory list and makes the sectors that the files occupy on the hard drive available for future use .
In the meantime , the files continue to exist and can be retrieved by basic recovery programs such as Norton UnErase or freebies like Brian Kato 's elegant Restoration .
The same happens when you empty the recycle bin .
How about reformatting the hard drive and re-installing the operating system ?
That does n't do much good either .
Again , the data are n't actually deleted , but remain there waiting to be plucked by some nosey parker seeking your identity and your bank account .
Actually , there is no fool - proof way to delete data stored in a computer .
Government agencies effectively take a sledgehammer to the hard drive itself when disposing of highly classified information .
The Pentagon even removes the platters from their hard drives and minces them in a mechanical shredder .
If physical destruction is n't practical , defence officials recommend that you use “ multiple block overwrites ” .
Overwriting a 100 - gigabyte drive ( modest by today 's standards ) at least three times and verifying the result will take several days .
But even then , the process can miss lots of blocks of hard - drive space that have been reassigned for other uses .
Experts say there 's only one way to drive a stake through a hard drive 's heart .
First , run the low - level destruction routine called Secure Erase that 's hidden inside most hard drives these days ( but never mentioned in the manuals because it 's such a loaded gun ) .
Second , blast the drive with a humongous magnetic field .
Third , grind the platters to dust .

Still hoarding information
But even this may be not enough .
Scientists at the Centre for Magnetic Recording Research at the University of California , San Diego , have put shards of ground - up platters under a scanning magneto - resistive microscope and reconstructed traces of the original data .
And despite the crew 's valiant efforts to destroy all the hard drives aboard the EP3 spy plane after an emergency landing on Hainan island in 2001 , to this day no one knows whether the Chinese were able to reconstruct the aircraft 's highly sensitive information .
You have to assume they did .
That said , what allows most cloak - and - dagger folks to sleep easy at night is knowing that , though fragments of confidential data can always be recovered from hard drives , it takes an inordinate amount of time and effort to achieve anything worthwhile .
That 's what spooks mean when they talk about “ security by exotic time - consuming technology ” .
In the real world , the answer is to use a protocol that , while far from perfect , makes reconstruction too tedious a chore to undertake , and yet remains simple enough to use in the first place .
Generally , that means buying a proprietary program such as PC Inspector 's E - Maxx , Iolo's DriveScrubber , Webroot 's Window Washer , Symantec 's Norton Utilities and Jiiva 's SuperScrubber ( for Macintosh ) .
For about $ 30 , any of these will wipe a typical hard drive to military triple - overwrite standards within a couple of hours .
The truly paranoid can always download a more user - friendly version of Secure Erase , called HDDerase , that 's available for free from the utility 's original author at the Centre for Magnetic Recording Research .
But remember , there 's no recovery from HDDerase .
It overwrites every single track on a hard drive , including directories , bad blocks , partly overwritten blocks — you name it .
Unfortunately , that means the operating system gets obliterated as well .
So if you want to donate a computer , sanitised but in working condition , then use something like Windows Washer to remove your confidential files but not the operating system .
The charity will thank you profusely , especially if you remember to include the original disks , the manuals and , above all , the licence numbers of the proprietary software installed .
And you can rest easy knowing that your personal files are safe — or at least relatively so .
Written by : femhundra Category : kortspel Published : 22 juni , 2018
American 500 är en variant av det något mer välkända kortspelet femhundra och skiljer sig en del från det australienska grundspelet .
Det vanligaste är att en omgång av denna variant spelas av tre spelare istället för fyra , i alla fall om man ska tro regelböckerna .
Syftet med American 500 är detsamma som i femhundra och går helt enkelt ut på att samla ihop femhundra poäng eller mer .
Den spelare , eller det lag , som lyckas med det först går vinnande ur partiet .
Det gäller även att bli av med de kort man har på handen och detta görs genom att skapa och lägga ut värdefulla kombinationer .
Spelet kan ta sin början
Korten i American 500 delas ut på följande sätt : 3 - widow - 4- 3 .
Widow - korten är de kort som i andra versioner av femhundra kallas för kitty och ligger i en hög i mitten av bordet med summan nedåt .
Utifrån korten på hand bestämmer sig spelarna för vilka satsningar de vill göra och sedan kan spelet ta sin början .
American 500 innehåller bara en satsningsrunda och alltså bara en chans att satsa eller lägga sig .
Att göra en satsning innebär att satsa på hur många tricks , det vill säga drag , du som spelare tror du kommer behöva göra för att vinna samt med vilken färg du kommer göra det .
Nullo
Om du lyckas satsa rätt kommer du få ta upp högen med widow - kort och välja ut de tre minst användbara korten och sedan placera dem med summan nedåt .
De utgör då inte längre en del av handen .
I American 500 är det inte alltid till åtet att göra en nullo , det vill säga misere .
Misere innebär att du som spelare försöker att inte vinna några tricks .
Om du spelar i lag kommer din medspelare lägga sig under den tid som detta pågår .
Om misere tillåts i den amerikanska varianten måste satsningen ligga på över åtta spader eller under åtta klöver .
Administrators at a Los Angeles charter school forbade students from reciting a poem about civil rights icon Emmett Till during a Black History Month program recently , saying his story was unsuitable for an assembly of young children .
Teachers and students said the administration suggested that the Till case -- in which the teenager was beaten to death in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman -- was not fitting for a program intended to be celebratory , and that Till ’s actions could be viewed as sexual harassment .
The decision by Celerity Nascent Charter School leaders roiled the southwest Los Angeles campus and led to the firing of seventh - grade teacher Marisol Alba and math teacher Sean Strauss , who had signed one of several letters of protest written by the students .
The incident highlights the tenuous job security for mostly nonunion teachers in charter schools , which are publicly financed but independently run .
California has more than 600 charter schools , and their ranks continue to swell .
According to the California Teachers Assn. , staff at fewer than 10 % of charter schools are represented by unions .

“ I never thought it would come to this , ” said Alba , who helped her students prepare the Till presentation , in which they were going to read a poem and lay flowers in a circle .
“ I thought the most that would happen to me [ after the event was canceled ] is that I ’d get talked to and it would be turned into a learning and teaching experience . ”
School officials refused to discuss the particulars of the teachers ’ firings but said the issue highlights the difficulty of providing positive images for students who are often bombarded by negative cultural stereotypes .
“ Our whole goal is how do we get these kids to not look at all of the bad things that could happen to them and instead focus on the process of how do we become the next surgeon or the next politician , ” said Celerity co-founder and Executive Director Vielka McFarlane .
“ We do n’t want to focus on how the history of the country has been checkered but on how do we dress for success , walk proud and celebrate all the accomplishments we ’ve made . ”
McFarlane said details of the Till case were too graphic for an assembly that included kindergartners .
The principal , Grace Canada , could not be reached for comment .
McFarlane , speaking for the school , said her review of the incident did not support the teachers ’ allegations that Canada had used the term sexual harassment to describe Till ’s behavior .

But Alba said that when the principal informed the class that they could not recite their poem , she gave the example of a construction worker whistling at her as she walked down the street .
“ She said that she would be offended by that and that what Emmett Till did could be considered sexual harassment , ” said Alba .
“ She used the phrase a couple of times and when I objected , she said ‘ OK , inappropriately whistled at a woman . ’ ”
Many parents said their children affirmed that account .
Marcia Alston , mother of a seventh - grader , called the school to say she was appalled at its interpretation of history and the treatment of the teachers .
She said that in the conversation , the principal used the term “ rude ” to describe Till ’s actions .
“ Mr. Strauss and Ms. Alba were excellent teachers , ” said Alston .
“ The fact that they and the students had signed a letter , I thought , was good ; it was something they were passionate about and it could be used as a learning tool . ”

Verna Hampton , whose daughter was in Alba ’s homeroom and signed a letter , said she was especially offended that the incident occurred during Black History Month .
Hampton said her daughter told her there was nothing offensive in the letter she signed .
“ Those teachers should not have lost their jobs for standing up for what they felt was right ; that sends the wrong message , ” Hampton said .
“ The kids did n’t even get a chance to say goodbye . ”
Alba , 30 , began teaching at Celerity when it opened in the fall of 2005 shortly after she received her credential .
She taught social studies and science and is now looking for another job .
She is writing to the school ’s board of trustees to request a hearing , and Strauss has drafted a letter to the board complaining that his firing was unjustified .
Under the contract signed by the teachers , they can be fired with or without cause .
In the letter terminating his employment , dated March 6 , Strauss was said to have been “ disparaging the school to students and parents and authorizing by physical signature a nonsupportive message to the administrative staff . ”

According to Alba and Strauss , individual students wrote 10 to 15 protest letters , some of which were signed by other students .
Neither the teachers nor the students made copies , they said .
“ The kids felt strongly about this , and because these are my students , I felt one of my jobs was to pay attention to them , ” said Strauss , who is earning a credential at Cal State Dominguez Hills .
“ It ’s important anywhere a teacher works that the employer be willing to listen and keep an open mind and maybe even be willing to change their mind if they learn something new . ”
Frank Wells , a spokesman for the California Teachers Assn. , said the Celerity incident highlights the importance his group has placed on organizing charter school teachers statewide .
“ This points out the vulnerability of teachers in some charters where they do n’t have safeguards and can be fired for any or no reason , ” Wells said .

Celerity Nascent ( the name is derived from words meaning swift or accelerated development ) opened in the Jefferson Park area last school year as a K - 6 charter campus with about 330 students .
Seventh grade was added this year , and there are plans to add eighth grade next year .
Of its nearly 500 students , 80 % are African American and about 19 % are Latino .
McFarlane , who is black , said 65 % of the staff members live in the neighborhood and that part of the school ’s mission is to create jobs in the community .
Most students are below grade level in reading when they enroll , and many have behavioral problems , school officials said .
McFarlane , who worked for 14 years as a teacher and principal in the Los Angeles Unified School District , said that with its focus on project - based , “ culturally responsive ” learning , student achievement is rising and parents are more involved in their children ’s learning .
Gary L. Larson , a spokesman for the California Charter Schools Assn. , said Celerity is well - run and its administrators highly regarded .
He defended the school ’s right to judge the appropriateness of the Till presentation and to dismiss teachers .
Advertisement
“ If they felt that it was too sensitive in nature , and as long as they are following approved procedures , they have the authority , ” Larson said .
Many parents agreed with the school ’s decision to omit the Till presentation .
During February ’s Black History Month program , the seventh - graders ’ poem , based on the book “ A Wreath for Emmett Till , ” was replaced by a reading on the civil rights struggle as a whole .
“ There ’s no celebration in the Emmett Till story , ” said Stephen Weathers , president of the school ’s parent organization .
“ He was beaten for whistling at a white woman , and I do n’t want my daughter to know that in the fourth grade .
I do n’t think a celebration of Black History Month is a forum for that story .
It ’s important , but that was n’t the stage for it . ”
Scot Brown , associate professor of history and African American studies at UCLA , said it was unfortunate that school officials and the teachers did not find common ground .
Advertisement
“ I ’m surprised that the teachers and principal could not work out a way for students to do this presentation in a way that highlights the significance and importance of Emmett Till ’s loss to the larger black freedom struggle , ” said Brown .
“ It ’s much bigger than the acts of violence you do n’t want kids exposed to ....
“ It sounds to me that by laying a wreath and saying a poem , the students and teachers were working through the meaning of his sacrifice to the black freedom struggle , and that ’s very important . ”

I saw some discussion recently about using JSON for secured data , and I 'm not sure that everyone understands the risks .
I believe that JSON is unsafe for anything but public data unless you are using unpredictable URLs .
There are 2 problems .
CSRF ( Cross Site Request Fogery ) allows attackers to bypass cookie based authentication .
I blogged about it a while ago .
Wikipedia talks about it .
CSRF allows you to invoke cookie protected actions on a remote server .
It allows Mr. Evil to trick Mrs. Innocent into transferring money from her bank account into his .
Far less known perhaps , is the JSON / Array hack that allows a user to steal JSON data on Mozilla and any other platform with a modern JavaScript interpreter .
There are many ways to fetch data from a server , but the interesting cases here are : XHR , iframe and script - tags .
Without knowledge of the JSON / Array hack it 's easy to reason like this :
XHR : Browser cross -domain rules prevent the attacker from making the request in the first place .
iframe :
The attacker can embed an iframe that points at some remote server ( the bank in the above example ) and ask to be sent some JSON , but browser cross - domain rules prevent scripts from the attackers domain from reading the reply , so the JSON is safe because it will never be eval ( ) ed .
. Script - Tags :
The attacker can embed a script tag pointing at a remote server and the browser will effectively eval ( ) the reply for you , however it throws away the response and since JSON is all response , you 're safe .
It 's the last of these arguments that is suspect .
The dynamic nature of JavaScript will let you redefine how the browser evaluates the JSON .
Here 's how it works , and you can follow along with any JavaScript console :
Redefine the Array constructor :
function Array ( ) { alert ( " hi " ) ; } Verify that this constructor is called when arrays are created :
var a = [ 43 ] ;
Use the new feature to manipulate the array :
function Array ( ) { this [ 1 ] = 50 ; } var a = [ 40 ] ; alert ( a [ 0 ] + a [ 1 ] ) ; // Gives 90
So we can call secure JSON data using CSRF with a script tag to by - pass the cookie authentication , and then use the JSON / Array hack to steal the JavaScript data from the browser as it processes the script - tag .
So we 've redefined the Array constructor , how do we actually get the data out ?
The syntax below works in current versions of Firefox , although from my reading of the spec proposals , it 's not a part of Javascript 2 , and it appears to fail in IE / Safari / Opera .
Create a web page at evil.com , with a couple of script tags like this :
< script type=' text / javascript '> function Array ( ) { var obj = this ; var ind = 0 ; var getNext = function ( x ) { obj[ ind ++] setter = getNext ; if ( x ) alert ( Data stolen from array : " + x.toString ( ) ) ; } ; this [ind ++] setter = getNext ; } </script > < script type='text/javascript ' src='http://bank.com/jsonservice'> </ script >
The long and short is that JSON is not safe in any system that uses cookies for authentication .
With DWR we use full JavaScript which is as vulnerable as JSON , however DWR 's CSRF protection automatically uses the doubly - submitted cookie pattern to provide extra safety .
I 'm by no means the first person to think of this ; Jeremiah Grossman used it to break GMail over a year ago .
Update :
If you are doing JSON 100 % properly , then you will only have objects at the top level .
Arrays , Strings , Numbers , etc will all be wrapped .
A JSON object will then fail to eval ( ) because the JavaScript interpreter will think it 's looking at a block rather than an object .
This goes a long way to protecting against these attacks , however it 's still best to protect your secure data with un-predictable URLs .

No fences make good neighbors / Berkeley residents combine their backyards -- and a community is born 1 / 7 Back to Gallery
The first time that painter Wanda Westberg and her husband , Richard Pettler , looked at the Berkeley brown shingle house they bought in 1997 , Westberg hated it .
But , she loved the openness of the backyard , even though it was a tangle of trash , concrete and crabgrass choking in a forest of plum trees .
Westberg imagined a yard that might look more like a park than a garden .
But first , she thought , the metal - mesh fence that delineated her backyard from the five yards that met her property line would have to come down .
" Nobody had fences in South Dakota , where I grew up , " she said .
" My backyard was an oasis of safety that gave me perfect freedom as a kid .
One neighbor had a tree house , one a tire swing and another a playhouse .
It did n't make sense for each parent to go out and buy the same things when we could share . "
After talking to her neighbors , Westberg used wire cutters , pruning shears and determination to remove the rusty 4 - foot - tall fence and its snarled mass of ivy and blackberry brambles .
Out came the fence and in came the expanded views .
Taking down the fence had another outcome :
She established a more communal relationship with her neighbors .
No longer playing in tree houses , Westberg , Pettler and their neighbors share barbecues , garden tips and a glass of wine at sunset , all accomplished without the formality of front doors .
" When Wanda called to tell me she wanted to take down the fence , I thought it was a strange idea , " said Sally Sklar , Westberg 's neighbor to the right .
" I did n't want to be rude and say no , but I did n't want to say yes , either .
I told her , ' Good fences make good neighbors . ' "
Sklar and her husband , Bernie , have lived in their house for more than 30 some years , but Sklar had never paid much attention to her backyard .
Having grown up in apartment buildings in Philadelphia , she did n't have an interest in gardening and had n't given a second thought to the fence .
But Westberg eventually persuaded Sklar that the removal of the fence would be an asset .
" Wanda has increased the pleasure of our lives by taking down that fence , " Sklar said .
" When Bernie and I sit on our patio , we see a scene straight out of Provence . "
A bit of strategic thinking and shared planning was needed before the fence on Westberg 's left side could come down .
Her neighbors -- Austene Hall , Bob Archibald and Eleanor Gibson -- liked the idea , but there were two problems :
They owned a dog and they maintained an English - style garden that the deer would munch to nubs in a week .
Together , they came up with a plan to build a low , welcoming fence with a gate .
Gibson , Hall 's 80 - year - old mother , is a New York master gardener who moved into a cottage overlooking the garden .
They all aspire to Gibson 's knowledge and know - how .
Though Hall and Gibson often work in the garden together , Gibson frequently works in the steeply sloped garden and Westberg feels good knowing that she could easily assist Gibson should she fall .
Westberg also removed the fence that ran along the back of her property , where her neighbors Bill and Polly Halloran plan to remove the trellises between the yards .
The Hallorans enjoy the connected gardens from their second - floor deck .
When Westberg and Pettler moved in , the sloped section of the yard was barely accessible .
For the garden 's hardscape , they found inspiration in a 1938 National Park Service design book and installed natural - looking Coldwater Canyon rock steps that now lead to a small lawn surrounded by mounds of manzanita , Mexican sage and yarrow .
A second set of steps was installed to meander up to the gate , which is covered by variegated jasmine and California Dutchman 's pipe ( which Gibson calls Dutchman 's britches ) .
Clusters of yellow roses hover on the pergola above the gate .
A walnut tree and a hawthorn tree anchor the back of the yard , and a healthy magnolia , once choked by a plum tree that Westberg has since removed , spreads out " like a harp . "
To reflect her preferred palette as a tonalist painter , Westberg planted California natives .
" I like the muted colors of a California landscape .
In my paintings , I rarely apply cadmium red or ultramarine blue directly to a canvas .
Most earth tones have to be mixed , " she said .
The colors in her yard also harmonize with the inside of her home , which she and Pettler have restored and furnished in the Arts and Crafts style .
( She now loves the inside of her home , too . )
The Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association awarded the couple its 2005 Preservation Award for their restoration efforts .
Westberg gave her backyard room to breathe and grow , and it sounds as if she 's doing the same with her neighbors .
" My neighbors and I are close , but a situation like this would n't work without respecting each other 's property and privacy , " she said while ushering a visitor into her kitchen .
She had work to do .
The next day she was having an outdoor potluck that her neighbors were , of course , attending .
What community has the highest per-capita use of solar energy in Ohio ?
None other than the Amish .
It might sound strange to people who think of the Amish as 19th century holdovers , but that 's an oversimplification .
Instead , after considering the impact to their values and way of life , Amish communities decide communally whether to adopt new technologies .
Stoltzfus is an Amish traditionalist .
He works with his hands at a sawmill , wears plain clothes and the requisite straw hat , and does n't care much for the conveniences of the mainstream world .

In the early 20th century , the Amish rejected the enticements of the public power grid , deciding they did not want to be too directly linked to , or dependent on , the outside world , said Donald Kraybill , a senior fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist & Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania .
But they never dismissed electricity wholesale .
Over time , the Amish have turned to a range of energy sources – water , wind , batteries , gasoline , diesel fuel , kerosene , propane gas , coal and wood .
The application of solar energy has increased rapidly in the Amish community in the past five years , Kraybill said .
Not all Amish people approve , but many do – particularly if solar energy is used for business and home use is kept to a minimum .
Solar electricity fits into the Amish self - sufficiency model .
It is convenient , safe and , unlike some Amish - sanctioned alternatives , there are no noxious fumes or noise and no fuel costs .
" There 's so much free sun and free air , and if we could harness it , we would n't need any more power plants , " said Andrew Hertzler , an Amish farmer selling flowers and plants outside the local library here on a recent afternoon .

ERBIL , Iraq , May 2 — Kurdish and Sunni Arab officials expressed deep reservations today about the draft version of a national oil law and related legislation , misgivings that could derail one of the benchmark measures of progress in Iraq laid down by President George W. Bush .
The draft law , which establishes a framework for the fair distribution of oil revenues , was approved by the Iraqi cabinet in late February after months of protracted negotiations .
The White House was hoping for quick passage to lay the groundwork for a political settlement among the country ’s ethnic and sectarian factions .
But the new Kurdish concerns have created doubts about the bill even before Parliament is to pick it up for debate .
The issue comes at a sensitive moment for Mr. Bush , who today began negotiations with Congressional Democrats over a new war - spending measure .
The president vetoed a $ 124 billion bill on Tuesday because it included timetables for troop withdrawals , and a House vote today fell short of the two - thirds majority needed to override the veto , with 222 voting in favor and 203 opposing the override .
In a speech to a construction industry trade group in Washington , Mr. Bush said he is “ confident that with good will on both sides , that we can move beyond political statements ” and agree on a new measure .
But he continued to criticize Congress for trying to use the bill to dictate timelines for withdrawal .
Researchers have conjured up a trickle of electricity by zapping tiny nanowires with ultrasound .
If they can grow that trickle into a stream , the technology might turn everyday vibrations into power for miniature sensors that could be sprinkled in the environment or implanted in the body .
Everyone knows that nanotechnology means really small stuff , such as sensors that could be placed inside the body to monitor blood sugar or on the battlefield to sniff out poison gas .
But as sophisticated as these devices are , they are still burdened because they rely on an outside power .
" The size of the entire device is determined by the size of the power source , " says nanotechnologist Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology .
On top of that , he says , batteries require toxic chemicals and have to be replaced periodically .
Looking to make a nanotech power source , Wang started from the fact that nanothin wires of zinc oxide are piezoelectric , meaning they develop a charge when bent .
He and his team grew a forest of these wires on a semiconductor substrate and placed a corrugated silicon electrode closely above them [ see image ] .
Ultrasound passing through the device rattles the electrode back and forth , Wang says , which in turn bends the wires to and fro like bristles on a toothbrush .
The resulting charges transfer to a metal layer coating the electrode — and , voilà , a 500 - nanowire array produces a nanoampere of current , the team reports in this week 's Science .
Wang says that to actually power a simple electronic device such as a diode or a transistor , he has to raise the charge on the device from its current millivolt to at least half a volt .
He says he plans to make the nanowires more uniform and stack multiple arrays as well as add capacitors , which accumulate charge .
More than 25 years ago , Allen Wirfs - Brock created one of the early implementations of Smalltalk .
He was working at Tektronix at the time , as was Ward Cunningham who became the first user of Tektronix Smalltalk .
Allen later served as chief scientist of Digitalk - ParcPlace and CTO of Instantiations , then joined Microsoft four years ago .
His original charter was to work on future strategies for Visual Studio , but recently -- in light of growing interest in dynamic languages at Microsot -- he 's returning to his roots .
In this conversation we review the history of Smalltalk , and trace the evolution of the techniques that it ( and Lisp ) pioneered , from the early implementations to such modern descendants as Python and Ruby .
I 'm always looking for ways to explain why dynamic programming techniques are so important , and a great explanation emerged from this conversation .
A Smalltalk system is , among other things , a population of continously evolving objects that communicate by passing messages .
That same description applies to another kind of system : the Internet .
I suggested -- and Allen agreed -- that this congruence is driving renewed appreciation for dynamic languages .
Daily Show : Tubercular , leprous molesting immigrants will flood US with disease
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 29 , 2007 Print This Email This
The Daily Show on Thursday took a sardonic look at the immigration debate in this country , noting the inherent racism and fear mongering used by immigration opponents mirrors tactics used against Irish and other ethnic immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century .
Daily Show contributor John Hodgman , speaking with host Jon Stewart , noted fellow immigration " experts " John Gibson , the Fox News host , and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan , who were scaring viewers with tales of diseased immigrants illegally crossing the border .
" Professor Gibson and Dr. Buchanan have it exactly right .
The immigration debate was at heart a public health issue , " Hodgman said .
" I 'll be blunt Jon : Illegal aliens have tuberculosis and leprosy . "
Stewart was flabbergasted , and in utter disbelief that leprosy was being used as a scare tactic , until Hodgman played two more clips -- one from Fox News and another from CNN -- specifically mentioning leprosy among illegal immigrants .
Noting the same attacks were used against Irish immigrants , such as Buchanan 's ancestors , Stewart asked what the message of the immigration debate was .
" Hope , Jon , " Hodgman said .
" Simple , pure hope that one day these tubercular , leprous , molesting immigrants can repeat the uniquely American journey of the fiendish , green - blooded Irish , from unwanted immigrants to not wanting immigrants . "
Israel pledges to press on with Gaza offensive despite humanitarian crisis JERUSALEM ( AP )  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pledged Sunday to press ahead with Israel 's offensive in northern Gaza , brushing off international calls to halt the fighting and Palestinian complaints of dwindling supplies of water , food and other staples .
The death toll in Israel 's five - day sweep through the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun rose to 48 on Sunday , when four Palestinians , including two Hamas militants , were killed , according to Palestinian health officials .
Israel launched the drive last week to try to stop to daily rocket barrages aimed at Israeli towns .
The Vatican and European Union have expressed grave concerns about the offensive , but Olmert told his Cabinet on Sunday it was necessary to " considerably reduce the ( rocket ) fire and prevent terror . "
He said Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza after last year 's pullout .
" When we reach the conclusion that the effectiveness of the operation is bringing us closer to reaching the goals , we will definitely pull our forces out of Gaza , " he said .
Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh called the Israeli offensive a " massacre , " and Beit Hanoun residents warned of a burgeoning humanitarian crisis .
" We have electricity , but no drinking water , " said one 28 - year - old woman , who declined to be identified because of the military presence in town .
She said there were shortages of staples like milk and diapers and residents were being forced to share food .
She also said tanks were visible from her home , and her husband was taken away by Israeli troops for questioning .
" I do n't know what 's happened to him , " she said .
Col .
Nir Press , head of Israel 's liaison team dealing with Palestinian authorities and international aid organizations , said Sunday that shops in Beit Hanoun were open for a few hours Sunday and would be open again Monday .
Press said U.N. agencies and the Red Cross were shipping in food , water , baby formula and other supplies and would continue to do so .
He added that Palestinian technicians would be allowed to repair water mains on Monday .
On Sunday , AP Television News showed images of ambulances and taxis rushing Palestinian casualties to the small Beit Hanoun hospital , dodging potholes gouged by Israeli shells .
A young man , writhing from a chest wound , was pulled out of a yellow taxi and carried into the hospital .
Despite the offensive , Palestinians fired six rockets at Israel on Sunday , the military said .
Nobody was hurt .
Israel said its attacks are focused on militants who launch the rockets .
While most of the dead have been militants , several civilians — including a 4 - year - old girl , a 72 - year - old man and two paramedics — have been killed .
Two women who attempted to help a group of militants besieged in a mosque also died .
On Sunday , about 100 paramedics marched through the streets of Gaza City to protest the deaths of their two 17 - year - old colleagues , both volunteers .
They were killed in an Israeli missile strike last week in the town of Beit Lahiya , next to Beit Hanoun .
The International Red Cross harshly criticized Israel , saying the paramedics and their vehicle were clearly marked .
" The ICRC is appalled by this failure to protect personnel engaged in emergency medical duties , " a statement released Sunday said .
At the Vatican , Pope Benedict XVI said he was worried about the " grave deterioration " in the Gaza Strip , and called on all sides to work to stop the bloodshed and immediately resume " direct , serious and concrete negotiations . "
In a weekend statement , the EU called on both Israel and the Palestinians to halt the violence because of the casualties , but aimed its sharpest barb at Israel .
" The right of all states to defend themselves does not justify disproportionate use of violence or actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law , " the EU said .
Vice Premier Shimon Peres said Israel was doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties .
" We have to get directly to the people who do the shooting and that is what we are trying to do , " he told reporters .
Israel withdrew all troops and Jewish settlements from Gaza last year .
But it sent forces back into the area after Palestinian militants tunneled into Israel and abducted a soldier in June .
A Palestinian militant group claiming to hold Gilad Shalit , the captured soldier , said it has no plans to kill the serviceman , despite the Israeli offensive .
However , Abu Mujahid , a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees , said the soldier could be harmed by Israel 's military activity .
" Gilad Shalit 's life is in danger through the incursion and bombing of houses , " said Abu Mujahid .

Lightsaber combat occurred when two or more opponents using lightsabers , or at least one of the combatants used a lightsaber while the other used a different bladed weapon , engaged in a duel .
Such opponents were often , though not always , Sith and Jedi .
Though lightsaber combat decided the results of some important conflicts throughout the galaxy , often when two Force - sensitive opponents were nearly evenly matched , they had to resort to other means to settle the conflict , such as drawing on other Force powers .
There were seven known forms of lightsaber combat : Form I , Form II , Form III , Form IV , Form V , Form VI , and Form VII . [ 1 ]

Upon the advent of the Clone Wars , however , pushed by the militant stance of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine ( secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious manipulating matters for his own ends ) , " aggressive negotiations " through lightsaber combat became commonplace . [ 7 ]
Skilled duelists in lightsaber combat fighting on the side of the Jedi and the Galactic Republic included Agen Kolar , Plo Koon , Kit Fisto , Obi-Wan Kenobi , [ 7 ] Anakin Skywalker , Ahsoka Tano , [ 8 ] Shaak Ti , Saesee Tiin , Luminara Unduli , Mace Windu and Yoda . [ 7 ]
Those fighting against the Jedi , either for their own reasons or in support of the Sith and / or the Confederacy of Independent Systems included General Grievous , [ 6 ] Darth Maul , [ 9 ] Savage Opress , [ 10 ] Darth Sidious , [ 6 ] Count Dooku , [ 7 ] and Asajj Ventress . [ 11 ]
Still others fought at one point for the Jedi , but later fell to the dark side of the Force .
These included Pong Krell , [ 5 ] Barriss Offee [ 12 ] and Anakin Skywalker , who became the feared Sith Lord Darth Vader . [ 6 ]

During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and Galactic Civil War , Kanan Jarrus trained Ezra Bridger , a young Force - sensitive from Lothal , in the ways of the Force and to use a lightsaber , [ 13 ] and he later trained his fellow rebel the Mandalorian Sabine Wren in using Tarre Vizsla 's darksaber . [ 14 ]
There were many Jedi survivors who used their lightsabers in combat to battle the empire or protect themselves from Inquisitors , for example , Cal Kestis utilized his lightsaber to defend himself against inquisitors when he was discovered on Bracca and Vader . [ 4 ]

There was no formal indication from the police about the identity of the people who left a silver - green Mercedes outside the club or their intention .
But British news organizations referred to the alert as a botched car bomb attack , and it added to a catalogue of summertime security alerts ascribed to jihadists since the July 2005 London bombings and a major airline scare last August .
“ We heard an announcement on the tube , ” said Sheila Porter , 73 , a retired psychologist visiting London from Ireland , referring to the London subway by its nickname .
“ I tried not to think about what it would be but it did seem to imply that the incident was in the street and not on the tube so that kept us all calm .
To be honest , it did n’t worry me because they did n’t tell us what it was and they distinctly said it is not the station [ but ] it was in the street .
We did n’t know about this when we started out but you do n’t have any choice but to keep going . ”
The alert closed off streets around the Haymarket thoroughfare and brought some people out of nearby offices to find out what was going on .
“ It ’s only when I got to work that I realized what was happening , ” said Renee Anderson , 32 , a New Zealander from her country ’s nearby diplomatic representation .
“ I feel surprisingly all right about it , ” she said .
“ We all kind of thought , well you could be hit by a bus anyway and the English mentality must be such that they have coped with this for such a long time with all the bombings so they just get on with it .
You can see that . ”
Travelling via the US is a bit of a trial for the evolutionary biologist , thanks to security gone mad .

Whenever I suffer through an airport these days , I hear the mocking laughter of Osama bin Laden .
Murdering 3,000 innocent men and women with loved ones to weep for them ( Allah be praised ) was only the start ( swamped by road accidents and domestic murders , 9/11 made no noticeable blip in the US violent death statistics for a typical September ) .
No , bin Laden 's lasting achievement , the one that has him sniggering daily into his beard , is to have created the Office of Homeland Security , risible monument to belated stable - door closure .
The payoff for bin Laden has been mayhem and chaos , costly delays and maddening inconvenience to millions of travellers , in every hour of every day , in every airport of every country ( except some Third World ones with the good sense to ignore the whole charade ) .
That useless plastic cutlery was nothing but a signal to the home electorate :
We 're gonna kick some ass , and these plastic knives show it , you better believe it .
And did some bearded loon once pack explosives into his shoes ?
Right then , we 'll show those folks we mean business .
We 'll smoke 'em out and teach those terrorists who rules this town , yessirree .
From now on nobody - and Ah mean nobody - boards a plane without first removing their shoes , anywhere - and Ah mean anywhere - in God 's own country .
And we all like sheep refuse to go astray .
We know that , if we so much as joke about exploding brassieres being the next scare , we risk being locked up until rescued by a harassed British consul .
Better bite our tongue and endure the joke that Osama bin Laden is playing , through his Keystone Cops - like agents in the Office of Homeland Security .
Not that we here have anything to be proud of .
In the Britain presided over by Bush 's loyal friend and co-religionist , our security services were surfing the web when they spotted what looked to their fevered imaginations like a plot to make a ' binary ' explosion on a plane by mixing two otherwise harmless liquids .
For a hilarious explanation that this is , and always was , totally unrealistic ( you need large quantities of ingredients and buckets and buckets of ice ) see www.theregister.co.uk.
Yet , as a direct consequence of what seems to have been an elementary misunderstanding of chemistry , we all have to dump even the tiniest bottles of liquid on our way through security .
Gateway to Galapagos is the airport of Miami , and I had to pass through it going both ways .
You might think a passenger in transit from Ecuador to Britain would be allowed to stay airside and not formally enter the US .
But that would be too simple and convenient : insufficient chest - beating by Homeland Security .
Since 9/11 - universal American pretext for inconveniencing the public ( over here , Health and Safety does the job ) - the rules have changed .
Homeland Security insists the passenger from Ecuador ( me ) has to pick up his luggage , queue to clear it through the Miami customs , queue to enter the US ( fingerprints , photograph , passport stamp , green form and all ) , then queue to leave the United States again , queue to remove shoes and laptop ... and consequently ( it happened to me last time I made the journey ) miss the connection to London .
This time I made it - just .
But enough of moaning .
No traveller should moan who has just visited the Galapagos .
It was good to be alive as I swam among the marine iguanas and the breathtakingly tame Galapagos sea lions , or walked among the flightless cormorants ( unique to Galapagos ) hanging their useless stubby wings out to dry .
This week I came within touching distance ( I did not touch ) of nesting wave albatrosses , and of boobies , high - stepping their powder - blue feet in the slow - motion ballet of their surreal courtship .
I have watched , spellbound , as boobies and pelicans rained down like arrows into the water , in a feeding frenzy that must strike the fish below with the fishy equivalent of shock and awe .
Our impressive Ecuadorian guides told us that boobies eventually go blind , the consequence of years of repeated high - velocity impacts of their eyes on the water .
As Darwin would have realised ( The Origin of Species is rich in such economic insights ) , this accords with natural selection .
Eventual death by blinding is the price paid for successful reproduction earlier in life - successful passing on of the genes that laid down this ultimately suicidal behaviour .
I went to Galapagos as guest lecturer of the Centre for Inquiry ( CFI ) , an American charity devoted to secular humanism and critical thinking , whose members paid handsomely to enable the CFI to book a whole ship , the Santa Cruz , and explore Galapagos in Darwin 's footsteps .
As you 'd expect , this was an intelligent crowd , who gave me a lively time in the questions after my three lectures .
American atheists today walk with a spring in their step , a new confidence that they have not known since the lights went out on their Enlightened secular foundation .
They are coming out of the closet in droves , and I like to credit the series of recent bestselling books , by Sam Harris , Christopher Hitchens , Daniel Dennett and others .
For a zoologist , Galapagos is an enchanted , near - sacred place .
Partly because Darwin walked those lava fields in the springtime of his genius .
But also because we all can see , as if through Darwin 's deep - set eyes , life 's difference - engine at its simplest .
Then there is the ingenuous tameness of the animals , pursuing their evolved business in prelapsarian innocence of the gawping , camera - snapping human traffic in their midst .
Mortally threatened by commerce and cheap aviation fuel , how long will this scientific Eden last ?
It 's been a time of nonstop travel .
Time magazine had invited me to New York for a posh celebration , a dinner to celebrate their ' 100 Most Influential People of The Year ' and I built the diversion into my route to Galapagos .
Then I was offered an unexpected lift to New York in the private jet of the entrepreneur Elon Musk , en route to Los Angeles .
Greatly looking forward to my trip , I discovered a snag .
British citizens can enter the US without a visa , but not if they arrive on a private plane .
The prospect of queuing for a visa at the Grosvenor Square embassy drove me to desperate lateral thinking .
Canada , of course .
Mr Musk might even prefer Toronto to New York as his refuelling stop , it being closer to the great circle from England to California .
And I could please my Canadian publisher with a day of interviews .
Everything fell into place .
I could kill at least three birds with one stone .
Elon Musk turned out to be delightful .
One of the most remarkable men I have ever met , he had made his first fortune by devising PayPal .
Then he invested it in two other enterprises , both of which made inspired use of his genius as a design engineer .
His SpaceX company builds wholly re-usable spacecraft ( the Nasa space shuttle is only partially re-usable ) .
And , coming down to earth , his Tesla company ( Teslamotors.com ) is about to market affordable electric cars with a running cost of one penny per mile and the potential ( I hope , though Elon is more cautious ) to kill the internal combustion engine stone dead .
If only he could kill the oil trade too , and hence the undeserved power of infamous countries such as Saudi Arabia .
The first production model Teslas will be high - performance sports cars with an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in four seconds , assembled by Lotus in Britain but available only in America at first .
Later models will broaden the range and the market .
I 'm putting my name down for one as soon as they appear over here .
My Toronto visit was strenuous : five television interviews and one radio , all in one day beginning before breakfast .
I had never really believed in authors ' publicity tours , and was astounded to be told that this one day of jet - lagged freneticism boosted my book from number 20 to number 3 on Canadian Amazon 's bestseller list .
Next day before breakfast , off again to New York , this time on a commercial plane - no visa .

KWin , KDE 's window manager , has been around since KDE 2.0 ( replacing KWM in KDE 1.x ) and has grown to be a mature and stable window manager over the years .
For KDE 4 , however , there were a few people rumbling about visual effects , and perhaps KWin was feeling a little envious of its younger cousins Compiz and Beryl .
While these new effects have created a lot of buzz around Linux and UNIX , long - term KDE users have wished they can enjoy the effects of Compiz / Beryl while still having the tried and tested window manager that is KWin .
As a result , for KDE 4 , KWin has received a huge graphical upgrade , with composite and GL support .
Read on for more details .
KWin has implemented effects in a way that allows a number of different rendering methods to be used , depending on your specific combination of hardware and drivers .
These features have brought KWin rapidly into the era of dazzling eyecandy , along with some pleasant surprises on the usability front .
This effort has been spearheaded by Lubos Lunak ( a man known for his efficient code ) and his team , with special mention to Rivo Laks and Philip Falkner for their contributions .
Effects are disabled by default at the moment , although that may change before KDE 4 ships , and distributions may decide to alter this setting anyway .
When enabled , the effects are designed to degrade gracefully .
If GL is not available , KWin disables GL effects but still allows Composite effects where possible via XRender .
If XRender is not available , it falls back to plain X , running in the same fashion as the present KDE 3 version .
To get the full array of effects , you need to have a video card ( and driver ) that supports AIGLX , XGL or use the proprietary Nvidia driver .
Once the effects are enabled , it 's simply a matter of choosing which effects you 'd like to activate .
So far , Rivo Laks has been working on the effects plugin selection interface ( see the screenshot below ) .
The new plugin selection widget shown is making its way into various parts of KDE - it does automatic dependency checking , so once the dependency tree is known , it will intelligently enable or disable dependent plugins .
This widget is also showing up in other parts of KDE 4 .
( as you can see in the image , this dialog is quite new - less than a week old - and is missing all the icons ... )
Lubos has been periodically blogging about the effects that KWin is now capable of , and has recorded a number of videos showing them off .
Since video capture on my system is rather chunky , I will present his recordings instead .
So , without further ado , I present some of the more popular of his flash videos , hosted by YouTube .
If you are interested in more , please visit his YouTube User Page
The Present Windows Effect - a very useful effect that falls into both eye - candy and usability categories ...
The Desktop Grid Effect - those familar with the Cube effect may note that this is not quite as flashy , but probably more useful .
Does n't mean there cannot be a Cube effect for KWin though .
This one shows the above two effects , as well as the Alt - Tab thumbnails , but it shows that the effects work great , even when the windows contain active videos .
Zoom Effect and Magnifier Effect : some accessibility related features that everyone may find useful , depending on your specific needs .
Effects like this one make people go " Wow " .
The first part of this video features the Fall Apart Effect , which basically has a window blow up .
It 's amazing how well this effect can be demonstrated in a low quality flash video ...
Aside from Lubos , many of the new effects and underlying core components were programmed by Rivo Laks and Philip Falkner .
They are responsible for many of the effects you see in the videos , including the Present Windows Effect , and the improved Alt - Tab dialog .
There have been a number of contributions from others as well , and they are always looking for new and interesting ideas .
In addition , KWin for KDE 4 builds on the already existing KWin version which has had dozens of people contribute to it over the years .
The window decoration shown above is called ' kwin3_crystal ' and is still set as the default in SVN .
It is simply a port of the existing KDE 3 Crystal window decorations , however , a new KWin window decoration is still in the works for KDE 4 - it has n't been made the default yet , so I have n't been featuring it .
When it does eventually become the default , you 'll be sure to hear about it here ( and likely in Danny 's KDE Commit - Digest as well ... ) .
KWin for KDE 3.x implemented a very simple composite manager , allowing simple effects such as window transparencies , fading menus , shadows , and so forth .
The code was not too complex , but the infrastructure was not in place to seriously extend the effects to GL powered goodness .
When the KDE 4 development series opened , it was seen as an excellent time to rewrite some of KWin 's internal structures in order to support such effects .
There were initial considerations of implementing support for the existing Compiz and / or Beryl system of effects via plugins , but there were technological hurdles that prevented this .
I wo n't go into the technical details as to why this decision was made , however , it is important to note that KDE 4 will still work with Compiz / Beryl should the users choose to use that software instead of KWin .
Additionally , while KDE 4 will be supporting a number of platforms with libraries and applications , KWin is one of the applications that will not be making the switch as it is inextricably tied to X .
This should be considered to be a Good Thing ( tm ) , as it ensures that KDE will always be the best looking when used with Linux / UNIX , and hopefully it ( and related KDE Workspace technologies , like Plasma ) will remain a unique benefit of using a more open operating system .
KWin promises to ensure that KDE get the graphical boost it needs to keep the eye - candy folks happy , while providing new and usable features for the desktop environment that would not have otherwise been possible .
Yet , it maintains the rock - solid foundation that a long history as an integral part of KDE has provided .
It will still work ( with reduced levels of effects ) on any system that KDE 3 ran on , so no - one is left out in the cold .
It is already the default for KDE 4 in SVN , and will be showing up in future beta releases .
On a personal note , I 've found that KWin on my system was dropping down into XRender mode due to some X settings I need to fix , but it has been perfectly stable for me over the last two weeks .
In fact , every week when I 'm rebuilding KDE 4 to write these articles , I am more amazed at how quickly it is becoming stable and useful .
If you are interested in testing it out for yourself , check to see if your distribution has packages available .
I am aware of the existence of at least one live CD ( where you do n't have to risk messing with your system ) that is available at the KDE Four Live website .
They update the Live CD every few weeks , and currently has the KDE 4.0 Alpha 1 packages .
Additionally , if you are brave enough to test the Composite features , and are having problems , have a quick look at the Composite HowTo ..
If you have problems , please report bugs using the the KDE Bug Tracker by selecting the KWin program , and the " composite " component .
Until next time .
Maybe if Bush speaks sloooooowwwweeeeerrrr and loooouuuuddddeeeerrrr , they might understand , no ?
Do n’t be surprised if that ’s what the right actually thinks about their message .
No surprises here .
The US comes in for sharp criticism .
“ Global distrust of American leadership is reflected in increasing disapproval of the cornerstones of US foreign policy , ” the survey says .
“ Not only is there worldwide support for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq but there is also considerable opposition to US and Nato operations in Afghanistan …
The US image remains abysmal in most Muslim countries in the Middle East and Asia and continues to decline among the publics of America ’s oldest allies . ”
Nine per cent of Turks , 13 % of Palestinians and 15 % of Pakistanis take a favourable view of the US .
In Germany , the figure is 30 % , in France 39 % and in Britain 51 % – all down on previous surveys .
Only in Israel , Ghana , Nigeria and Kenya do majorities believe US forces should stay in Iraq .
The good news in this otherwise predictable but still sad study is that there is a world leader who even even less trusted , so at least Bush has that going for him .
Break out the Champagne , errr , the non-alcoholic beer , Putin is worse !

Last April , UC Berkeley , one of the premiere universities in the country , announced its plan to put complete academic courses on iTunes .
Fast forward nine months , and you can already find 59 full courses available as podcasts .
Simply click here to access Berkeley 's iTunes site ( or here for the Rss feed ) .
No matter where you live , you can access at no cost the very same courses attended by students paying full tuition .
And , given the critical mass of courses being offered across a range of disciplines , you can put together your own personalized curriculum and expand your horizons on the fly .
If the humanities are your thing , you can take US History : From Civil War to Present , Existentialism in Literature & Film , or European Civilization from the Renaissance to Present .
If you 're into the social sciences , you may want to consider World Religions , Peoples and States , US Foreign Policy after 9/11 , Human Emotions , or Introduction to Statistics .
Turning to the hard sciences , you can take your pick from Physics for Future Presidents , Introduction to Chemistry , General Astronomy , and General Biology .
Finally , for those with a technology bent , you can consider listening in on An Introduction to Computers , The History of Information or even The Foundations of American CyberCulture .

Ground astronomy could be compromised if trends continue , experts say
Aircraft condensation trails - known as contrails - can dissipate , becoming indistinguishable from other clouds .
If trends in cheap air travel continue , says Professor Gerry Gilmore , the era of ground astronomy may come to an end much earlier than most had predicted .
Aircraft along with climate change will contribute to increased cloud cover .
You either give up your cheap trips to Majorca , or you give up astronomy .
You can't do both
Gerry Gilmore , University of Cambridge
The timescale is based on extrapolating air traffic growth figures .
The BBC has learned that the calculations were made as part of preparations for an upcoming observatory project called the Extremely Large Telescope ( ELT ) .
The ELT is intended to probe planets around nearby stars and look for extremely faint objects in the Universe .
Vision impaired
" It is already clear that the lifetime of large ground - based telescopes is finite and is set by global warming , " Professor Gilmore , from Cambridge 's Institute of Astronomy , told reporters recently in London .
" There are two factors .
Climate change is increasing the amount of cloud cover globally .
The second factor is cheap air travel .
" You get these contrails from the jets .
The rate at which they 're expanding in terms of their fractional cover of the stratosphere is so large that if predictions are right , in 40 years it wo n't be worth having telescopes on Earth anymore - it's that soon .
" You either give up your cheap trips to Majorca , or you give up astronomy .
You can't do both . "
Climate change is also expected to increase the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere through evaporation , contributing to overall cloudiness .
The increase in cloud cover would affect both optical and infrared astronomy , which would have to be carried out from space .
Radio astronomy would continue to be ground - based .
Identical appearance
Contrails often present little more than a transient nuisance to astronomers ; but when certain weather conditions prevail , they can break to look like natural clouds .
Holger Pederson , an astronomer at the Nils Bohr Institute in Copenhagen , Denmark , who has studied contrails , explained : " You can recognise the jet contrails when they are young .
So you can stop your observation and then restart as soon as the contrail has passed the field of view of the telescope .
Satellite imagery can be used to monitor contrail evolution
In pictures
Dr Hermann Mannstein , of the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) , agreed astronomy would become more difficult , but said there was an upper limit on the contrail problem .
Contrails form where the air is highly saturated with water vapour , but will not form if the air is too dry
" You do n't clog the whole sky .
You have a certain proportion of the sky , in time and space , that can be affected , " he said .
Restriction zones
But Professor Gilmore countered : " There are places where you get relatively fewer clouds - that 's where we put our telescopes - but there is nowhere on Earth that you do n't get clouds and aeroplanes .
" Already , around the major observatories , there are local laws to prevent aeroplanes flying within quite large distances , " he told the BBC News website .
Professor Gilmore said sites where observatories are located , such as the Canary Islands , Hawaii and South America , are also attractive holiday destinations , and likely centres for future air traffic growth .
He added that the projections did not factor in the effects of global warming , which are likely to exacerbate the problem .
Mr Pederson said too few satellites built up image data on how contrails evolved over time .
" We may underestimate the amount of contrail - derived cirrus clouds , " he said .
" We know from satellite imagery that clusters of contrails can last for two days .
If carried by the upper jet stream through the troposphere , they can travel hundreds of kilometres . "
There are several concepts under consideration for the European ELT , but the preferred design seems to be converging on a telescope that is some 30 - 60 m in diameter .
A location has not been decided ; but , despite the difficulties of access , Antarctica may become an option .
The icy region has relatively clear skies , with a climate that is somewhat separate from other continents , and , crucially , is free from overflying commercial jets .
The " credit crunch " that started on Main Street with the U.S. housing market has now spread to Wall Street .
But the next question is how bad this liquidity squeeze will get :
At it worst , it could terminate the buyout wave that 's been a big part of the reason U.S. stock prices have achieved record highs this summer – sending U.S. shares into a tailspin .
And that , in turn , would turn into a bear - market contagion that spreads to international market .
Programming in Java can be tiresome .
The language itself is pedantic , famously knowing better than its users when exception handling code is necessary .
But its users are worse , always fretting over their best practices and how to avoid dreaded anti-patterns ( as if the word “ pattern ” applied only to good things ) .
The Java contingent ’s corporate mindset , tolerance for unwieldy syntax , and lack of creativity have lead to mockery in the programming world at large .
In numbers Java dominates that world , but like Microsoft ’s dominance of operating systems , the elite have moved on .
Yet somewhere between the best practices and the anti-patterns of Java scolds , we ’ve found there is still some interesting programming to be done .
The JVM gives us access to a variety of libraries , some of them useful .
A few , like Wicket , are so good they would have changed the whole internet by now , but for the craven conformity of Java masses ( and the aloofness of post - Java types who refuse to consider the happenings in our pidgin language ) .
For this reason we ’ve had an idea in the back of our heads for a while now : attempting to implement a Wicket derivative in some better language before someone else does it first .
This would require moving from Manhattan to a shack in the hinterlands where we could live off of savings for several years , but sometimes you have to make sacrifices .
Sometimes you do n’t have to make sacrifices
Hey everybody !
Have you heard of this language called Scala ?
It ’s both functional and object oriented , and it can call into Java libraries .
We first heard of this scaly thing a few months ago , from a colleague .
We were talking about how Groovy might be the answer to Java ’s woes , except that some of the concepts it eschews , like anonymous subclasses , can make it hard to work with Java libraries , like Wicket .
The colleague suggested that I look at Scala .
My awful internet -y short - attention - span evaluation of the language proceeded as follows :
Where the heck is its web site ?
It ’s not even in the top ten for “ scala ” .
Google does n’t know scala , and neither should I !
[ Update : a fortnight later , it ’s number four . ]
Okay , here ’s the web site .
It ’s not pretty .
If these scala people cared about the web , or about me , or about their supposed “ language , ” they would have better looking web site .
No one ’s using this .
There must be a good reason for that .
It ’s not like people are n’t aware of it .
One Java smart -y - pants does n’t seem too impressed .
Thus Scala stayed hidden from this weblog ’s gaze , until Marcus showed us “ how a Tapestry page looks like in Scala ” .
It looks easy , that ’s how !
And if it ’s that easy in Wicket ’s curmudgeonly predecessor Tapestry , it could n’t be very hard in Wicket .
So we checked out Scala , for reals this time .
An important point about Scala is that it is statically typed .
Yes , we ’re aware that all the cool languages right now are dynamically typed .
But unlike the question of whether or not Java is a verbose , awkward , limited , and generally unfashionable language , the static versus dynamic war is far from over .
You can reasonably be on either side of it .
That is , unless you ’re integrating with Java libraries .
In that case , dynamic typing is a waste of time for both the programmer and the processor .
Dynamic languages beg specific optimizations that the JVM does not provide , forcing Groovy and JRuby to run on treadmills .
Furthermore , we ’re extending class hierarchies from Java libraries and we want the code to mesh easily .
Dynamic typing and all the debatable advantages it has are not worth the complications of integration with statically typed code .
( This goes both ways , of course . )
Scala interfaces beautifully with Java libraries including , it turns out , Wicket .
Therefore it is n’t necessary to rewrite Wicket in a pure object - oriented , functional language because you can already use Wicket perfectly well in one of those .
Cynics might assume that Scala is linguistically compromised by the JVM or tainted by its very proximity to The Java .
We are n’t qualified to counter that argument ( the language programs real nice ! 11 ) , but those who think they ’re qualified to make it should consult Scala ’s high - minded documentation section .
Writing a Wicket and Hibernate application in Scala
If we wanted this post to be linked from popular Java sites , this would have been its only section .
And that would have been its title , except with “ in ten steps ” at the end .
And a subtitle of “ Java is not doomed — Myths EXPOSED . ”
Anyway !
package example import net.databinder._ import net.databinder.models ._ import net.databinder.components._ import javax.persistence._ import org.hibernate.cfg._ import org.apache.wicket.markup.html._ import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.basic._ import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form._ import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.list._ class Scale extends DataApplication { def getHomePage = classOf [ Home ] override def configureHibernate ( config : AnnotationConfiguration ) { super.configureHibernate ( config.addAnnotatedClass(classOf[ Weight ] ) ) } } @ Entity class Weight extends java.io.
Serializable { @ Id @ GeneratedValue var id : Int = _ var value : Float = _ } class Home extends WebPage { add ( new DataForm ( " form " , classOf [ Weight ] ) { override def onSubmit ( ) { super.on Submit( ) clearPersistentObject ( ) } }.add ( new TextField ( " value " ) ) ) add ( new PropertyListView ( " weights " , new HibernateListModel ( " from Weight " ) ) { def populateItem ( item : ListItem ) = item.add ( new Label ( " value " ) ) }) }
That is the entire application .
In Scala you ’re allowed to put whatever classes you want in a source file .
You usually would n’t want every class in one file , but the freedom is there .
Starting from the top , we have the package declaration and then the familiar buzzkill of import statements , except with a _ instead of a * .
No less ugly though .
Let ’s move on .
Scale is the application class .
If Wicket were written in Scala it would be a Scala singleton object , but this works fine .
See that one line getHomePage method ?
This is how much fun it would be to write in Java :
@ Override public Class getHomePage ( ) { return Home.class ; }
You could write all that on one line , but people would wring their hands over it in code review .
Plus it really would be ugly .
Let ’s look at the Weight class .
It maps to a database table storing rows of a floating point number and an integer primary key ; both are public variables in its class definition .
Public variables !?!
Yes , but the reference and assign operations are overridable methods so it is okay .
There ’s an interesting discussion about how it works if you want to read it .
Hibernate Annotations uses field mapping for a thusly defined Scala class , making us wonder what exactly would happen with a _= override , but in practice we ’re often wishing Hibernate would bypass whatever weird stuff we sometimes have to do in a set method .
There ’s enough play in Scala and H.A. that unexpected adjustments should be possible without having to change schema or outside code .
We ’re just thrilled to be able to dispense with those hideous “ getters ” and “ setters ” for the very common base case .
Note that the standard numeric and boolean types in Scala can not be set to null .
In our class the values are initialized to _ which maps to 0 .
To be able to null the value field ( for the database and the user interface ) we could set it instead to java.lang .
Float .
Finally , the Home class is the real meat as far as Wicket is concerned .
Wicket likes constructors and , conveniently , in Scala constructing statements go right in the body of the class .
In this case we ’re using only the default constructor but alternate constructors are supported .
The class adds a Databinder DataForm , which by default wraps its model object in a compound property model and saves or updates it in onSubmit ( ) .
By clearing the model after each submit we allow an new one to be added on the next request .
The TextField maps to the Float field as it would with bean - style property methods .
This does n’t look much different from how it would in Java .
To list the existing Weight values we can implement populateItem ( ) in one line .
Most lists have more than one component per item , but we ’ll take our terse syntax when we can get it .
There are plenty of anonymous subclass overrides in Wicket programming requiring only one statement ; Scala lets us implement them with half the bloat .
This is Home.html , where the fabulous entry and display components are told where to render themselves :
<! DOCTYPE HTML > < html > < body > < form wicket : id= " form " > < input type =" text " wicket : id= " value " /> < input type =" submit " /> </ form > < ol > < li wicket : id =" weights " >< span wicket : id= " value " >
1.75</span></li> </ol > </ body > </html >
What this all means
It is easy to learn enough Scala to code with Java libraries .
As in this example , the finished product might still be utterly procedural , but it benefits significantly from the abbreviated structures that Scala provides .
Translating from Java to Scala is not difficult : rename the file and start fixing compilation errors .
( Deleting a ton of semicolons and curly braces is optional . )
Some people have petitioned Sun to bring things like implied types and traits ( mix-ins ) from Scala to Java .
That is n’t likely to happen in the Java quagmire .
Significantly improving this or any decade ’s corporate programming language in ways that would break existing code is impossible .
There is too much money behind the Java status quo .
Or , as contented Java programmers like to say , “ Java pays my bills . ”
But Scala transcends Java .
It makes clever use of the JVM to enable modern coding for efficient execution in an environment that is present on almost every computational device .
( iPhone , damn you . )
Because of Scala , we do n’t have to worry about Sun ’s corporate gridlock .
We can unsubscribe from Neal Gafter ’s blog and not even care if he ever gets a closure proposal past Java committees .
We can just use Scala instead .
And , as we have time , we can explore the unfamiliar constructs that Scala allows and incorporate them into code that we write , rewrite , and wrap .
In Wicket , perhaps we ’d like to make it dead simple for a Label to dynamically render with a functional IModel ?
That would be easy enough to make :
class Fodel( value : ( ) => Object ) extends AbstractReadOnlyModel { override def getObject = value }
And to use :
new Label ( " status " , new Fodel ( ( ) => { if ( some_comp isEnabled ) " :) " else " :( " } ) )
It is obvious that Databinder will be rewritten in Scala .
We ’ll be careful to keep essential interfaces simple enough for the Java compiler to understand , but there will be better interfaces for Scala code .
Like modern web sites just working on Internet Explorer 6 and shining on less hunchbacked browsers , we hope to be the first of many JVM libraries escaping from Java to a better world .
Anybody got a hammer ?
We wish we could say it ’s as easy to compile and package Scala code as it is to write it , but Scala ’s toolset has reached only the point that motivated people can get work done in it .
Now that motivated people are getting work done in it and its popularity is growing , the masses will soon be clamoring for tools that do everything and do it perfectly , and frazzled unpaid toolset programmers will accomodate them in time .
Later is the time to start in Scala if you insist on things being easy .
As we saw in the Weight class , Scala handles JDK 1.5 annotations perfectly — but you have to tell it to target 1.5 of course .
The Scala Eclipse plug - in has such an option , but it does n’t seem to work .
The good news is that there is a Scala Eclipse plug - in in the first place !
It compiles on save and highlights errors .
It ’s able to replace code in debug mode ( there it helps to have classes in separate source files ) .
Breakpoints are supposed to work , and sometimes do .
And there is a Scala Maven plug - in , but — ha ha— it ca n’t target JDK 1.5 either .
We tried to remedy that for an hour or so , and then tried some other Scala Maven plug - in that seemed even more neglected — this was the sign we were waiting for to abandon Maven .
Good bye Maven .
Buildr is what we ’re using for this and future projects .
There ’s a lot to be said about Buildr , but for now let ’s just say that it gives you a hammer to work with ; Maven assigns you a construction contractor .
After the contractor let us down we took the hammer and made a Rakefile that is probably horrendous and we wo n’t dare publish here , but it compiles Scala sources to JDK 1.5 code .
Sometime we will nicely ask the Buildr people if they want to support Scala directly , because it is probably not hard for them .
For the brave , the example above is available to download .
If you run rake inside it will try to download a bunch of jars to your Maven repository and build itself .
If that works you could try rake scale : run to run the demo with Jetty against an in -memory HSQLDB .
( A MySQL config is provided in hibernate .
properties commented - out lines . )
With a crowbar in addition to that hammer you can edit the Eclipse . project file that Buildr generates to make it a Scala project file , and have Eclipse output its compile to something besides target / classes .
Then , set the project to execute rake on every auto - build .
That will update the compiled classes , page templates , and property files in target / classes to which you can point your Eclipse Jetty plug - in , if you have one .
Whew !
It ’s not as bad as it sounds , and the environment is productive once you have it set up .
We just made an actual web site in it .
Yes , the first Databinder site in Scala is already live !
Calling it Scala is kind of funny since Scala is the tip of the iceberg and Java is the rest of the iceberg , but it does establish that this crazy business we just went over actually works , and does n’t immediately try to serialize the entire class hierarchy ( which we feared it would ) .
Now , please excuse us as we have to go shower off twelve years of boilerplate code .
The news that Gov. Eliot Spitzer will soon introduce a bill to legalize same - sex marriage  what he calls “ a simple moral imperative ”  is welcome and could give new national momentum to this important cause .
Mr. Spitzer would be the first governor in the nation to introduce a gay marriage bill .
But if he is going to make a real difference , rather than simply checking off a box to fulfill a campaign promise , he will have to fight for the law vigorously .
Even in a progressive state like New York , this will be a steep political climb .
So far , only Massachusetts has enacted a gay marriage law  after its highest court held that gay couples had a right under the State Constitution  and while there is a similar bill working its way through the Connecticut legislature , its prospects are uncertain .
Civil unions or domestic partnerships involving same - sex couples are now recognized by a small but growing number of states , including Connecticut , New Jersey , Vermont , California , Hawaii and Maine .
It is an indication of how big a challenge Mr. Spitzer faces that New York is not , and has n’t come close to being , on this list .
Mr. Spitzer is right to be fighting for gay marriage .
Civil unions and domestic partnerships are an important recognition of gay relationships by a state .
But they still represent separate and unequal treatment .
One federal study identified more than 1,100 rights or benefits that are accorded only to the legally married .
That means that even in states recognizing civil unions and domestic partnerships , gay couples often have to use legal contortions to protect their families in ways that married couples take for granted .
Gay couples may also be discriminated against when it comes to taxes and pension benefits .
The next step in building momentum for gay marriage in New York will be to get the State Assembly , which has a Democratic majority , on board .
Speaker Sheldon Silver has said he will not take a stand until he talks with his fellow Democrats .
But most of those Democrats have already publicly expressed support for gay marriage , so Mr. Silver has no excuse to delay .
He should make it clear that he will join Governor Spitzer and press for the legislation ’s swift passage .

It is a " conspiracy to rig the presidential election , " says angered Democratic presidential contender and Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , after hearing a verbal exchange between Sen.
Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Sen. John Edwards ( D - NC ) suggesting that future debates should include fewer candidates .
Says Kucinich , " [ I ] n a democracy people get exposed to ideas and they make the decision for themselves . "
" Fox ' News , ' who filed the report during Brit Hume 's Special Report on Thursday , included sub - titles for the ' overheard ' post - forum conversation between Clinton and Edwards , " Alan Breslauer wrote for Brad Blog .
According to Fox , Edwards said , " ... at some point ...( unintelligible ) ... maybe the Fall ... We should try to have ... a more serious and a smaller group . "
" Well ...we ... we've got to cut the number ... because they are ... because they are just being trivialized , " Clinton responded .

EXCERPTS :
While campaigning in Iowa today Mr. Edwards confirmed the topic of his discussion with Mrs. Clinton and sought to clarify his remarks , saying that he does not favor excluding candidates from the debates , but would prefer breaking up the field into smaller groups .
Mrs. Clinton , who was campaigning in New Hampshire today , declined to be specific about what she meant by her comments on Thursday .
 I think he has some ideas about what hed like to do ,  she said , referring to Mr. Edwards , according to a dispatch from the Associated Press .
A Clinton campaign spokesman said he would not comment on a private conversation between the two candidates .

Paid search ads , responsible for the barrels of cash that have fueled Google ’s meteoric growth , could be one of the worst - spent marketing dollars on the Internet , according to an eye - catching audit of search results to be released this week .
Most executives , with little regard to how well their companies fare in the more important natural search results – the top sites that come up after an Internet search – overspend on paid search because it is the one area of the search market they understand , said a director with London - based ISM ( Internet Search Management ) , which will release the audits .
“ Executives know the battleground for business success today is being fought on the search engine but they know very little about how well their companies are faring on natural search or if their paid search advertising dollars are well spent , ” said Phil Millo , an ISM director .
As a result , Millo said , companies are pouring money into paid search – with a good deal of the cash not improving their marketing muscle .
Just this month , in a spat , eBay angrily pulled all of its advertising money from Google – and saw little drop - off in traffic .
The move and its results have opened a lot of eyes .
“ It ’s gotten to the point that if they ’re spending $ 100 million a year on paid links , maybe it ’s time to start reassessing where it ’s going , ” said Mark Simon , of Did-it Search Marketing , a firm that helps companies with their search marketing plans .
Indeed , eBay spent some of the money they withdrew from Google with Yahoo ! and other sites .
Steve Grossberg , the president of the Internet Marketers Association , which represents some of eBay ’s biggest sellers , said the day eBay launched a Web banner campaign on the homepage of Yahoo ! was his biggest sales day of the month .
Whether other large Google advertisers – like Amazon.com , Bizrate.com and Target.com – will follow suit remains to be seen .
ISM ’s audits track the top 4.5 million search phrases on Google and Yahoo ! , a total of 7.3 billion searches a month , to determine which companies across 50 business sectors pop up most frequently in the top three or four positions in natural search .
Natural search results are based mostly on a site ’s traffic , relevance and how many other sites link to it .
The ISM audits , to be released in London , break down which of 50 business sectors are locked up – that is , have large chunks of natural search dominated by a handful of companies – and which are wide open .
The digital camera sector is pretty well locked up , the audit found , meaning it would be very hard to create a Web site or Internet marketing campaign that would successfully steal market share .
DPReview.com , a site with news and reviews of digital cameras , the ISM audit found , was the leader , turning up in the top three or four search results on Google and Yahoo !
73.7 percent of the time .
It was purchased last month by Amazon.com , which was looking to sell more cameras .
“ It ’s quite interesting that Amazon.com did n’t look to mount an Internet marketing campaign and purchase search ads to gain market share but rather bought a company few people [ had ] heard of but which produced excellent natural search results , ” Millo noted .
Google ’s own research shows surfers look toward natural search over paid search by a ration of 4 - to - 1 , Millo said .
ISM is working with Wal - Mart , Staples and Mercedes - Benz to sharpen their Internet marketing strategies .
IRAQ : Environmental Nightmare Drags On
“ We inherited a terrible situation when it comes to the environment , ” Narmin Othman , Iraq ’s environment minister .
By Stephen Leahy
Mar 21 ( Tierramérica ) – Four years after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq and despite 22 billion dollars spent on recovery and reconstruction , Iraq ’s environment remains in disastrous shape .
“ The Tigris and Euphrates rivers are essentially open sewers , ” Azzam Alwash , head of Nature Iraq , a conservation group based in Baghdad , told Tierramérica .
Industrial waste , hospital waste , fertiliser run-off from farming , as well as oil spills plague the two rivers that define the Mesopotamia region and which provide much of the irrigation and drinking water .
“ We inherited a terrible situation when it comes to the environment , ” Narmin Othman , Iraq ’s environment minister , said in a Tierramérica interview .
The natural environment of Iraq has been devastated by three wars since 1980 , and decades of neglect and mismanagement under the Saddam Hussein regime ( 1979 -2003 ) .
“ The environmental laws were laughable under Saddam .
State - owned industries polluted at will , ” Alwash said .
Many of those industries were devoted to producing military material , and have been bombed and looted , leaving the country dotted with highly toxic industrial zones .
Other contaminated sites belong to the oil and metal industries .
The ongoing conflict — launched by the United States on Mar. 20 , 2003 , and which has fuelled anti-occupation sentiment and sectarian violence — also means growing mountains of debris , including demolished buildings , vehicles and military equipment , have to be cleaned up and stored somewhere .

exec " %s = %d " % ( raw_input ( ) , input ( ) )
Example of dynamic variable names in action .
To a pythoner , obviously not pythonic .
d = {}
d[ raw_input ( ) ] = int( raw_input ( ) )
Less bad .
This is why dictionaries exist , so we use them .
Also , we remove the potentially dangerous and frivolous use of input ( ) in favor of int( raw_input ( ) ) .
[ foo ( ) for i in range ( 10 ) ]
An obvious abuse of a list comprehension as a for loop one - liner .
( We know this , because the resulting list is thrown away . )
Update : I added some examples the day after initially posting this .
There is a question I often see from Python newbies :
How to use the contents of a string as a variable name .
In other words , to dynamically create a variable based on some runtime - found name .
A lot of these users come from more static backgrounds and have heard the benefits of dynamic languages .
I have to wonder if these are signs of their over - eagerness to exploit that dynamic nature .
There are a lot of things that different programming languages are good for and things they are bad for .
There are times when their negative points can be exploited , of course .
There are far more times when their positive points can be exploited , and turned into disaster .
Pointers in C , for example , are useful in the cases where they are used properly and smartly , but terrible when wielded by the wrong hand with evil or ignorant intent .
The same can be true for a lot of a dynamic language 's features .
People trying to avoid knowing the names and number of variables they have , create classes on the fly with runtime information , and build and evaluate python code in strings are looking at the flexibility of the language and really want to use that for their own good .
The problem is that great power requires great responsibility , as we all know .
What most of us do n't realize , is that great responsibility requires great wisdom , and we can't buy , read , or request on IRC for wisdom .
That means the great power that lures these new comers to the language is inevitably what will always keep them from fully experiencing the gifts it bestows .
This is not a flaw or a unique attribute of the language , of any language , or of anything at all which benefits mankind and requires knowledge .
Just do n't exert yourself .
Do n't do anything for the sake of paradigms or languages or buzzwords .
Solutions are neutral , so solve them for solution 's sake , not implementation 's sake .
What I find the most odd is the reactions these individuals give when you tell them what they are doing wrong , and what to do instead .
If they want dynamic variable names , we tell them to use a dictionary ; they complain about the inefficiency of hash table lookups versus variable names ( from a C perspective , often ) .
The simple thing I cannot understand with this is how they expect the dynamic variables work , if not a hash table .
If they think they work like C stack locals , yet can be dynamic , why would they think that magical technique would not be applied to dictionaries .
In other words , if they recognize they achieve the same end , why do they think they are such wildly different routes ?
Police officers would be able to stop and question people
The proposal , allowing police to ask people about their identity and movement , is among measures being considered by Home Secretary John Reid .
The new legislation would be similar to that already used in Northern Ireland .
Police are still likely to need a " reasonable suspicion " a crime may be committed .
Anyone refusing to co-operate could be fined up to £ 5,000 .
At present , under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , officers already have the power to stop and search people or vehicles in an area seen as being at risk from terrorism even if they are not suspected of any breach of the law .
A Home Office spokeswoman said that the new proposals would give officers an automatic right to stop and question anyone in the UK about suspected terrorism .
Alienated Muslims
Critics including civil liberties campaigners , Muslim groups , opposition parties and Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain expressed their concerns about the effectiveness of the proposals .
Peter Hain , the Northern Ireland Secretary , warned that Britain must take care that its anti-terror legislation does not alienate whole communities , such as Muslims .
If he [ a foreign national ] abuses our hospitality and threatens us , I feel he should take his chance back in his own home country
Tony Blair
The deputy Labour leadership contender told BBC1's Sunday AM programme : " We 've got to be very careful that we do n't create the domestic equivalent of Guantanamo Bay , which was an international abuse of human rights , acted as a recruiting sergeant for dissidents and alienated Muslims and many other people across the world . "
He would wait to see the details of the proposals but insisted they should be clear in balancing civil liberties with protecting people 's security .
' Popular consent '
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , told the same programme that the Conservatives would consider the proposals on merit .
" If they are measures that are truly necessary to combat terrorism ... then we will support them but these things should be done on a basis of trying to get some consensus across political parties , " said Mr Hague .
The ex-Tory leader warned that the proposals must be " consistent with popular consent " and not " alienate the people we need in the fight against terrorism " .

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg accused the government of seeking a " police state " and warned it would only increase radicalism .
Ahmed Versi , editor of Muslim News , a newspaper for British Muslims , warned that extending police powers would be " counter - productive " to improving relations with Muslims and could drive some towards extremists .
Massoud Shadjareh , chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission , said it was essential to separate security issues from the " politics of fear " and warned that ethnic minorities , especially Muslims , were already more likely to be stopped by police .
A Home Office spokeswoman said : " We are considering a range of measures for the Bill and ' stop and question ' is one of them . "
' National security '
When it emerged on Thursday that three men suspected of wanting to kill UK troops had disappeared , Mr Reid criticised his political opponents and judges for stopping the use of tougher measures against terror suspects .
He promised new anti-terror measures and told MPs that the government could consider suspending some parts of the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) so it can impose tougher control orders .
Stopping and questioning anyone you like will backfire because people will be being criminalised
Shami Chakrabarti
Director of Liberty
Should police have more powers ?
The Home Office would not comment on suggestions the new laws were to be rushed through before Tony Blair steps down as prime minister on 27 June .
Greater powers to remove vehicles and paperwork for inspection are also believed to be part of the measures .
Writing separately in the Sunday Times , Mr Blair said the disappearance of the three suspects under control orders was a symptom of a society which put civil liberties before fighting terror .
The prime minister described this as " misguided and wrong " and said prioritising a terror suspect 's right to traditional civil liberties was " a dangerous misjudgement " .
He said : " If a foreign national comes here , and may be at risk in his own country , we should treat him well .
But if he then abuses our hospitality and threatens us , I feel he should take his chance back in his own home country . "
' Political machismo '
The Sunday Times claims police minister Tony McNulty told Mr Blair the new " stop and question " measures would be " very useful UK wide " .
It quoted a letter sent to the prime minister which said the measures would be " a less intrusive power " than stop and search , which are widely seen as unpopular with the public .
Campaign group Liberty also criticised the proposals and said the police should not have powers to question people " willy - nilly " .
Director Shami Chakrabarti said : " This looks like political machismo , a legacy moment .
" Stopping and questioning anyone you like will backfire because people will be being criminalised . "
Solar too mainstream for you ?
Bored with windpower ?
Do n't worry -- there are plenty of other ways to harness a watt .
( They might not be viable right now , but do n't you worry ; they will be . )
Check out these super - alternative energy sources , courtesy Inhabitat .
Kinetic Wind Power
Fusing art , architecture , and renewable energy , California - based Michael Jantzen 's Wind Shaped Pavilion is literally head - turning .
The pavilion is a proposal for a large fabric structure that rotates in segments around a central support frame , generating enough electricity as it moves to light the pavilion at night .
Just think of the opportunities available in building the pavilion large enough that every level becomes an apartment or a commercial space , and the view from inside changes at the whims of the weather !
Poo
Yes , poo .
Twenty times more potent than C02 , cow emissions contain massive amounts of methane , which can also be harnessed and turned into a viable energy source .
" While they have n't yet produced a specific module for bovine emissions , Velocys , a company in Ohio , has come up with a method to refine the methane gas that is the byproduct of a number of industrial processes .
The methane is moved through microchannels , mixed with carbon and then frozen , allowing the nitrogen that is in the compound to pass through , thus purifying the gas , so that it may be used as a power source . "
Sounds like a load of ... oh , never mind .
Human and other kinds of poo also have some of the same potential , by the way .
People power
We 've mentioned the tube station in Britain powered by footsteps , and the gym in Hong Kong powered by people burning calories on treadmills and Stairmasters .
Now there 's also the Sustainable Dance Club in Rotterdam , the lights and speakers of which are kept abuzz by the pitter - patter of ravers ' feet .
Can this technology be harnessed for use in the home ?
Certainly -- though your household 's ratio of occupants - to - square - footage ( and the age / rambunctiousness of those occupants ) may ultimately decide the cost - worthiness of such an option .
Can Cognitive Neuroscience Tell Us Anything About the Mind ?
[ Photo by ClintJCL ]
Cognitive neuroscience – essentially brain scanning – has become all the rage in psychology and related fields .
Given the headlong rush by , well , practically everyone , into cognitive neuroscience I still entertain a quaintly unfashionable stance : I ’m sceptical .
My scepticism is not total though , many cognitive neuroscientists claim that there are many exciting findings to come .
They ’re probably right , but while neuroimaging can certainly tell us much about the brain , there ’s reason to believe it has n’t told us much about the mind .
To understand what I mean by this we need to go back to basics by asking what research is for .
“ Does cognitive neuroscience really have the power to distinguish between psychological theories ?
” Like all scientists , psychologists are continually knocking out new theories to explain the way we think and behave .
One of the most important functions of research is its ability to differentiate between two theories .
If research does n’t at least provide a clue one way or the other then theoretically , and so practically , it ’s a waste of time .
Does cognitive neuroscience really have the power to distinguish between psychological theories ?
Is it any use to a cognitive psychologist ?
A critic ’s view
Max Coltheart is Professor of Psychology at Macquarie University in Australia and in a recent journal article he wonders whether cognitive neuroscience has really told us anything useful about the mind so far ( Coltheart , 2006 ) .
It ’s important to realise that his emphasis is on the mind , as in cognitive processes , as distinct from the brain , as in physiological processes .
“ Neuroscience ’s strength is in physiological processes … ” There ’s no doubt the mind ’s cognitive processes are a function of the brain ’s physiological activity but these two things are nevertheless ( currently ) separate questions .
Cognitive neuroscience ’s strength is in physiological processes , and as imaging technology improves , so will the importance of its findings in this area .
But , again , why should a psychologist care that much which part of the brain lights up in a scanner , if the mind ’s functioning is still so far removed from our understanding of its physiology ?
An example
All this can be difficult to grasp in abstract .
Take one of Coltheart ’s examples .
Suppose you ’re a psychologist interested in how people work out what other people are going to do .
Their intentions .
Suppose there are only two competing theories that you ’ve got to choose between :
‘ Simulation theory ’ : I literally run a crude simulation of your mental state in my own mind .
From this I try and work out what you ’re going to do next .
‘ Theory theory ’ : I create a theory about you , then try to work out what you ’re going to do from that .
A recent neuroimaging study claimed to be able to distinguish between these two theories .
Ramnani and Miall ( 2004 ) put people in the brain scanner , got them to carry out certain tasks and predicted that if a particular part of the brain was activated it supported the first theory , and if another , then it supported the second .
What actually happened was nowhere near this simple .
Despite the claims of the study ’s authors , Coltheart argues that actually neither theory was substantially supported or refuted by the findings .
“ …evidence from cognitive neuroscience fails to distinguish between theories .
” This is just two theories and one study – not exactly a scathing criticism of the whole of cognitive neuroscience .
But Coltheart does run through four other examples where evidence from cognitive neuroscience fails to distinguish between theories .
Again , remember that we ’re talking about relatively high level psychological theories here , not low - level physiological processes .
Coltheart goes on to pull quotes from a range of people who argue that , in principle , neuroimaging is useless for psychological theory and understanding of the mind .
Here ’s a good computing metaphor :
“ No amount of knowledge about the hardware of a computer will tell you anything serious about the nature of the software that the computer runs .
In the same way , no facts about the activity of the brain could be used to confirm or refute some information - processing model of cognition . ”
( Coltheart , 2004 , p.22 )
I personally do n’t know enough about cognitive neuroscience to argue whether or not this statement is true , but it certainly has intuitive appeal .
Considering the enormous quantity of money going into cognitive neuroscience right now , it seems unlikely this would be a majority view amongst psychologists .
Not that scientist are slaves to money , of course … Ahem …

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is prepared to spend an unprecedented $ 1 billion of his own $ 5.5 billion personal fortune for a third - party presidential campaign , personal friends of the mayor tell The Washington Times .
“ He has set aside $ 1 billion to go for it , ” confided a long - time business adviser to the Republican mayor .
“ The thinking about where it will come from and do we have it is over , and the answer is yes , we can do it . ”
Another personal friend and fellow Republican said in recent days that Mr. Bloomberg , who is a social liberal and fiscal conservative , has “ lowered the bar ” and upped the ante for a final decision on making a run .
The mayor has told close associates he will make a third - party run if he thinks he can influence the national debate and has said he will spend up to $ 1 billion .
Earlier , he told friends he would make a run only if he thought he could win a plurality in a three - way race and would spend $ 500 million — or less than 10 percent of his personal fortune .
A $ 1 billion campaign budget would wipe out many of the common obstacles faced by third - party candidates seeking the White House .
“ Bloomberg is H. Ross Perot on steroids , ” said former Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael Toner .
“ He could turn the political landscape of this election upside down , spend as much money as he wanted and proceed directly to the general election .
He would have resources to hire an army of petition - gatherers in those states where thousands of petitions are required to qualify a third - party presidential candidate to be on the ballot . ”
Senior Republican officials — including those supporting declared Republican presidential nomination contenders — and several top Democrats told The Times they take the possibility of a Bloomberg candidacy as a serious threat in November 2008 .
The Bloomberg team is studying the strategies of Mr. Perot , the Texas billionaire whose 1992 presidential campaign helped President Clinton to win the White House with 43 percent of the popular vote .
“ Mike has been meeting with Ross Perot ’s most senior people about how they did an independent run in 1992 , ” the Bloomberg business adviser said on condition of anonymity so as to avoid appearing to speak for Mr. Bloomberg .
Talk of Mr. Bloomberg as a third - party candidate comes as Republican voters are deeply divided over their top - three declared candidates — Arizona Sen . John McCain , former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney — and are casting longing glances at former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
“ Some of the people on McCain ’s [ presidential campaign ] staff have been calling me to see if Mike is running because they are ready to leave the McCain campaign , which is a biplane on fire and spiraling down , ” the Bloomberg adviser said .
Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel , another independent - minded Republican , dined recently with Mr. Bloomberg and suggested on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” over the weekend that he and Mr. Bloomberg might make an independent run for the presidency .
But in Albany , N.Y. , yesterday , Mr. Bloomberg downplayed that suggestion .
“ I think he was probably joking , ” the mayor told reporters .
Mr. Hagel “ speaks his mind . …
He ’s not happy with the same things that I ’m not happy about . ”
Republicans who say they are girding for a Bloomberg entry note Mr. Bloomberg has a 68 percent share of his privately owned company , Bloomberg LP .
The company is worth $ 20 billion ( and about $ 30 billion if put on the block for public bidding ) and earns $ 1.5 billion annually in after - tax profits .
“ If Bloomberg runs , he could have more money on hand than either of the two major party nominees , ” said Mr. Toner , the former FEC chairman .
“ It would be the first time that happened in the modern era . ”
A New York Daily
News poll of the city ’s voters finds that Mr. Bloomberg , twice elected mayor as a moderate Republican , is far more popular than Mr. Giuliani , the former mayor who leads in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination .
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday he was flattered by that result but downplayed it at his Albany press conference , saying , “ The current mayor always has a real advantage . ”
Social conservative leaders have told The Times they are determined to block Mr. Giuliani from becoming the Republican presidential candidate but that they ca n’t stop Mr. Bloomberg from making a third - party run .
“ This much I know , if Giuliani gets the Republican nomination , that is the ticket for the Democrats to get the White House in 2008 , ” said Tony Perkins , president of the socially conservative Family Research Council .
“ Many pro-life voters who have been voting Republican will not vote for the top of the ticket if it ’s Giuliani . ”
Other top social and religious conservative leaders , in separate interviews and discussions last week , told The Times their movement has decided to support Mr. Thompson for the Republican nomination .
They said he has satisfied them that he is reliably supportive of religious - conservative positions on key issues .
“ A third - party candidacy is almost inevitable ” in 2008 , said former Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Paul Goldman , who pointed out that third - party candidacies have affected the outcome of five of the past 10 presidential elections — including George Wallace in 1968 , John Anderson in 1980 , Mr. Perot in 1992 and ‘ 96 , and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 .
“ If the Republicans nominate someone the press can tag as a pro-war social conservative and the Democrats pick an anti-war liberal , Bloomberg will run up the center , ” Mr. Goldman said .
“ If conservatives do n’t rally to stop Giuliani they will get a third party socially conservative candidate who will only help elect the Democrat . ”

A young mother who cried rape by inventing a story that she had been forced into sex , has been jailed .
Kerrie Doyle , aged 22 years , was led sobbing to the cells after the judge who sentenced her was told that the man she had accused of rape had been arrested by police .
See also ...
• The woman driven to suicide by the Da Vinci Code
She admitted that Jay Slade had not forced her into having sex and had phoned him to apologise for making the false claim , not knowing he was being interviewed by police at the time and had put the conversation on loudspeaker .
Officers then charged Doyle with perverting the course of justice and she was found guilty by a jury at the end of a four - day trial in February .
Judge Christopher Critchlow , who jailed her for nine months , heard how Doyle maintained she was raped and that she only made the call to make her now ex-boyfriend happy .
Kathryn Hirst , defending , told the court : " She still maintains that she was the victim of the rape . "
However , she added that her client had apologised
for the " mess she had got into . "
The judge , sitting at Reading Crown Court , had heard how within days of the alleged attack , Doyle had begun texting Mr Slade .
One message read : " I love you loads , will be dreaming of you all night .
Miss you loads .
Ca n't wait to see you , you horny little devil . "
Doyle 's best friend , Mary Tucker , told the jury the defendant had asked her to make a false statement to police and to say that that they had been on a night out in Windsor when they bumped into Mr Slade and he asked Doyle to go back to his mother 's flat .
It was only after they left the police station , said Ms Tucker , that Doyle revealed that no rape had taken place .
" We came out and she was like ' ha ha , I think we 've got away with it .
They believed us , it was all lies , " she said .
Mrs Hirst said that imposing a custodial sentence would be especially difficult to bear for Doyle , because she would have to be separated from her 16 - month - old son .
" The separation from him is something she would find extremely hard , " she said .
Despite the plea concerning the young defendant , who had hopes of becoming a vet , Judge Critchlow sentenced her to nine months behind bars .
" You were convicted by the jury of perverting the course of justice by making a false allegation of rape .
" It happened in March 2005 , two years ago .
You were clearly going through a difficult period in your life for one reason or another , " the judge remarked .
" You were involved in a relationship with a much older man .
" But such an offence as this must result , in my judgement , in an immediate custodial term . "
The judge imposed the sentence , bearing in mind that as a result of her actions , a man had been arrested on suspicion of rape and held in custody .
Doyle , of Gordon Road , Ealing , West London , wept uncontrollably as she was led down to the cells from the dock , clutching her coat and a pre-packed bag .
Relatives in the public gallery sobbed and waved to her .
Hundreds boo former Bush chief of staff at University of Massachusetts commencement ceremony Adam Doster
Published : Saturday May 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
In video , booing is at 1:52 remaining in the video Andrew Card , President George W. Bush 's former Chief of Staff , was showered with a chorus of boos and catcalls from students and faculty of the University of Massachusetts while receiving an honorary degree Friday .
Protesters , who caught the embarrassing scene on video , attached anti-Card signs to their robes and drowned out Provost Charlena Seymour 's remarks about Card 's " public service . "
Even faculty sitting on stage joined in on the action , screaming their disapproval while holding signs that read " Card : No Honor , No Degree . "
Card , obviously shaken by the commotion , managed a slight grin while Seymour spoke .
He later raised his hand in recognition but sat down without speaking at any length .
After the ceremony , he refused to acknowledge the protests , only saying , " It was a great honor and a privilege to be here . "
The university community was upset with the school 's decision to award Card an honorary degree , given his involvement in spinning intelligence in the lead up to the war in Iraq .
Even before the ceremony began , 100 faculty members and students sang anti-war songs , handed out leaflets and waved signs outside the arena where commencement was held .
A graduate of the University of South Carolina , Card was a supporter of UMass in his days as a Massachusetts lawmaker .
He served as Bush 's chief of staff from the president 's first inauguration through 2006 .
The video below was created by the protesters .
If you are a Mac user and do n't want to fork over a ton of money for Photoshop CS3 , I have some good news .
Pixelmator ( unreleased ) is a true Mac OS X image editing software due out for public beta at the end of July .
The software features an unbelievable UI ( probably influenced by the HUD in Aperture from the looks of it ) and is set to be priced at a mere $ 59 US !
My source for the pricing and public beta release is an interview with the 2 developers [ Salius and Aidas Dailide ] behind the project over at wphj blog .
Not only is Pixelmator priced to please the masses , it boasts a wide variety of “ Photoshop - like ” features including batching , a ton of editing and retouching tools , iSight and iPhoto integration , just to name a few .
The Dailide Brothers claim that Pixelmator is not meant to be a Photoshop rival at this point .
I would say this little app has definitely caught my attention and I 'm gonna check out the public beta for sure .
Why ?
Well , yes I already have Photoshop CS3 but Pixelmator is built around OS X and claims to be a true image editor built for the Mac .
I 'm curious to see how the performance pans out , and the overall user experience .
If you head on over to the Pixelmator website , you can sign up for email updates to keep on top the release dates , and read more about the features of the soon - to - be - released software , look at screenshots , get tech - specs , and more .

Women have grown their own breast implants through pioneering stem cell treatment , it emerged yesterday .
Scientists harvested the stem cells from the women 's own fat and encouraged them to form breast tissue .
They say the result gives a more natural look than many of the synthetic implants used by showbusiness stars like Pamela Anderson .
The Japanese teams have carried out trials on dozens of women and say they have had no problems .
They say the treatment will be routinely available from plastic surgeons within five years .
British surgeons said yesterday they were convinced by the technique and found it " appealing " .
Stem cells can turn into different tissues in the body and this technique involves taking them from fat .
Dr Kotaro Yoshimura of the University of Tokyo and his team then mix these with general fat cells and inject them back into patients ' breasts .
The hope is the stem cells will lead to the formation of new fat cells and coax blood vessels to grow into new breast tissue and nurture it .
The technique was first used in 2004 and since another 38 women have been treated without any major side effects .
The long - term effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated fully , however , and further tests are needed .
To date the technique can boost breast size by only half as much as existing synthetic implants , and slender patients may not have enough fat to spare .
However Dr Yoshimura believes the effect is more natural - looking and should avoid any problems such as the leaking which occurred with older silicone implants .
Doctors can already use fat to create " natural implants " , but they can shrink over time because of a lack of blood supply .
The new technique aims to overcome this problem .
Dr Yoshimura said : " I believe that within five years my procedure will be available as plastic surgery and that it will prove very popular . "
Similar work is being carried out in the U.S. Dr Jeremy Mao told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Washington in 2005 that using stem cells could eliminate the need for extra surgery and produce long - lasting and more shapely implants .
In his tests , scientists at the University of Illinois turned stem cells into fatproducing , or adipose , cells which were put into plastic moulds to create different shapes and sizes of implants .
These were grown in the laboratory and then placed under the skin of laboratory mice .
They were removed four weeks later and found to be still the same shape and size .
Some British plastic surgeons have expressed an interest in using the new technique .
Venkat Ramakrishnan , a specialist in plastic and reconstructive surgery at Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS
Trust said : " I 'm newly convinced .
" A lot more people have to use it and prove it , but it does seem to have something to it . "
Eva Weller - Mithoff , a consultant at Canniesburn Hospital in Glasgow , said the technique could be particularly beneficial to cancer patients who have a mastectomy .
" The most distressing effect of radiotherapy is that the blood vessels shrivel up , " she said .
" Stem cells can differentiate into new blood vessels which could mean that more fat cells will survive . "
Fox Sports and Chevy teamed yesterday to deceive millions of people during the Major League Baseball All - Star game .
They did such a good job of it that many of you viewing probably did n't even notice .
As Fox came back from a commercial break in the bottom half of the third inning , many viewers caught sight of a very long , flashy banner draped over an equally ostentatious advertisement picturing a yellow Corvette .
The banner read HHRYA.com with the letters done in pseudo Asian design - clearly the work of professionals .
However , the Fox Sports broadcasters Joe Buck and Tim McCarver played off the ad like it was the work of a goofy sports fan , dangling his banner in the hopes of securing a moment of TV glory .
Here 's the chatter as Fox panned across the outfield and then held on the supposed fan 's sign for between 10 and 20 seconds .
" Welcome back to Detroit , " Buck said .
" A lot of banners and signs around the ballpark .
No surprise there .
Somebody just unfurled a big banner behind left field . "
You 'll love the next bit , as Buck devolves into a second grader .
" H- H - R- Y - A . Tim , you 'll have to tell me what that means .
I am not sure , but someone went to a lot of trouble , obviously , to put it up out in left center field . "
You'd think that would be the end of the stunt , but no .
Fox returned to the action to see baseball 's best pitcher Roy Oswalt face off against Johnny Damon .
After one pitch , McCarver brought all the weight of his formidable intellect to bear on the puzzle :
" I do n't know what that sign means , but ' hooray ' is the first thing that comes to my mind . "
Funny you should mention that , Tim .
Hooray is exactly the sound Fox executives made as they cashed their checks from the largest advertiser of the day .
Chevy , the sponsor , must have been disappointed as it failed to prepare its HHRYA.com website for the traffic it expected to receive .
Visitors to the site were unable to reach the page for about thirty minutes after the " I do n't know what that is " ad appeared .
Today , you could see the website runs one of those cheesy take a photo with your cell phone campaigns .
Chevy wants people to place themselves in shots with the letters HHR - the name of an upcoming vehicle .
Now the site is rolling over here .
Is this a huge deal ?
Well , in the big scheme of things , maybe not .
It is , however , one of the most blatant examples of companies trying to pass off an advertisement as reality .
Anyone watching the game would have sworn that Buck and McCarver really seemed not to know what was going on .
But their ruse was easily discovered once you realized that Fox would never hold its camera on an unknown website and read the URL on air .
" Buck might have been saying that tongue in cheek , " Fox Sports spokesman Dan Bell told The Register .
" For sure , it was planned .
It 's not like we did n't know about it .
Both parties knew about it . "
Chevy 's PR staff is on forced vacation this week and had n't found anyone who could answer questions about the incident at the time of writing .
Buck certainly did not sound " tongue in cheek " to us at all .
Both he and McCarver sat there debating the sign like marketing automatons , wondering if it was real and how much time some true fan of baseball spent hammering it out .
They most certainly wanted all the saps watching to believe in the sign 's authenticity and go hunting for this mysterious website .
" Yet another Chevy ad " probably would not have worked as well .
It 's sad that Buck and McCarver were willing to sacrifice whatever credibility they had as journalists in this way .
Beware of what they point out next during a game .
It may be a real fan out in the stands ... or just some cardboard figure dressed up as a Coke can . ®

Australians will be hoping and praying for more rain
Some areas recorded their best rainfall in years , but farmers warned that much more was needed to end the six - year drought - Australia 's worst on record .
The rains , which began on Thursday , have raised hopes for a successful winter harvest in the region .
PM John Howard warned last month of an irrigation ban if rains did not come .
Rains have so far bypassed most of South Australia and the Murray - Darling river system , the country 's main agricultural system .
Water storage in the basin was only at 6 % capacity , local officials said .
The basin , which covers an area the size of France and Spain combined , accounts for 41 % of Australian agriculture and usually provides about 85 % of the nation 's irrigation supply .
' Still raining , going good '
At least 25 mm ( one inch ) of rain has fallen in much of eastern Australia in the last 24 hours , with some areas of New South Wales and Victoria getting up to 70 mm .
" Absolutely fantastic .
Went to the pub last night , had a couple of beers with some blokes , every five minutes sticking your head out the door , still raining , still raining , going good , " a New South Wales farmer told the BBC .
Another farmer , Wayne O'Mally , told Reuters news agency from his farm near Bourke , 800 km ( 500 miles ) north of Sydney : " It 's certainly put a smile on a lot of faces and created some optimism for the future .
Things have been so dry out here for the past seven years . "
Mr Howard said much more was still needed .
" We can't overestimate the morale boost that this will represent , " he said .
" But we have got to keep hoping and praying for more rain because they will need more than the falls of the past 24 or 36 hours to break the drought . "
The prime minister announced in April that unless heavy rainfall fell in south - eastern Australia within a month , there would only be enough water for drinking purposes .
Farmers warned that Australians could face major food price rises if no water was allocated to irrigators .

Please note : this is a parody .
The following is a statement released by Mr. Reginald B. Pasingas , special assistant to Michael Chertoff , Secretary of Homeland Security .
" I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Lew Rockwell for giving me this opportunity to respond to the scurrilous attacks made by Representative Ron Paul against the Department of Homeland Security in his utterly futile campaign to become President of the United States .
" Representative Paul , you have repeatedly stated that the Department of Homeland Security is a huge and wasteful bureaucracy , which has done nothing to add to the security of the American people .
Congressman you are either blind to reality or you are purposefully misstating the facts .
" Let 's look at the record :
" Have you forgotten the color - coded Terror Alert Chart , Congressman ?
The American people depend on Homeland Security to keep them informed of the correct level of fear to feel at any given time .
It would n't do to have Americans experiencing yellow fear when the appropriate response to conditions is red or orange .
None of the independent agencies now under the aegis of Homeland Security had thought of that .
" What about Hurricane Katrina ?
Had the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) not been under the crack oversight and supervision of Homeland Security , do you think FEMA would have responded with the alacrity and precision it demonstrated after the New Orleans flooded ?
I think not , Congressman .
I think not .
" The border .
You never mention the border , Congressman .
Is it because you know that after five years under the control of Homeland Security , the border is still there separating the United States from Mexico ?
And what about the other border between Canada and the United States ?
Under Homeland Security , neither border has gone anywhere .
They are still in the same places they have always been .
You can thank Homeland Security for that .
" Now , in one of the greatest leaps forward ever in the field of national security , Secretary Chertoff has unveiled the latest tool in detecting enemy threats against the homeland and the American people .
" For most of recorded history , leaders had to rely on spies .
The spies were human .
This was human intelligence ( HUMINT ) .
In the 20th Century , we developed the ability to detect their communications .
We intercepted their signals .
This was signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) .
" On Tuesday , July 10 , 2007 , Secretary Chertoff unveiled the newest means of detecting the enemy 's plans and threats .
He described it as u2018a gut feeling ' about a new level of increased risk .
This is an example of gastro - intestinal intelligence ( GASINT ) .
Show me one instance before in American history , Congressman , where a cabinet secretary steered a multi-billion dollar organization on the basis of GASINT .
" You can't do it , Congressman .
You know you can't because Homeland Security just developed GASINT .
" But there 's more .
By fortifying the diets of all senior leaders in the executive branch of the Federal Government with copious quantities of hardboiled eggs , beans , broccoli , and beer , we are extending the benefits of GASINT .
The terrorists wo n't stand a chance .
Every move the terrorists make will be captured by GASINT and show up as a u2018 gut feeling . '
Again you can thank Homeland Security .
" So , there you have it .
Your puny efforts to besmirch the Department of Homeland Security have all gone for naught , Congressman Paul .
" So why do n't you …
" Wait … I 'm feeling something … in my gut …
" Ahh , yes , you are a doctor , are you not , Congressman Paul ?
A medical doctor ?
I have a gut feeling that our agents are going to want to talk to you .
Were n't those terrorists in England all doctors ?
Medical doctors ?
Coincidence , you say ?
Maybe  maybe not .
We 'll see .
Just stay where we can find you .
I have this gut feeling .
" GASINT really works .
You can thank Homeland Security . "

Russia plunged relations with the West into a new low as President Putin tore up a landmark arms control treaty .
The Kremlin chief 's announcement that he was suspending Russia 's participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty came as Britain 's relations with Moscow are expected to return to the Cold War days of the 1970s this week .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband is expected to announce punitive counter - measures against Moscow over its refusal to hand over former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi wanted in Britain over the poisoning of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko .
It is thought the measures will include the expulsion of Russian diplomats from London in a move that is bound to prompt tit - for - tat expulsions of British officials from Moscow - plunging Britain 's relations with the Kremlin to their lowest point since the 1970s and giving new Prime Minister Gordon Brown a major international crisis in his first month in office .
NATO officials have expressed alarm over Russia 's sudden withdrawal from the arms control treaty - seen as a warning shot to Washington over President Bush 's plans to station missile interceptors in Europe .
" The allies consider this treaty to be an important cornerstone of European stability and they would like to see it ratified as soon as possible , " a NATO spokesman said .
" NATO regrets this decision by the Russian Federation .
It is a step in the wrong direction , " he added .
He said the treaty had boosted stability in Europe by providing unprecedented transparency in military matters on the continent .
NATO officials said the treaty called for a 150 - day notice period before any member could withdraw , and that it remained unclear whether Moscow had invoked that provision .
The CFE was signed in 1990 and extensively amended in 1999 to reflect changes created by the disintegration of the Soviet Union , and the fact that many former Warsaw Pact allies of the U.S.S.R. had by then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
It added the requirement that Moscow withdraw troops from the former Soviet republics of Moldova and Georgia .
Russia ratified the amended version , but the United States and other NATO members have refused to do so .
Russian troops have since left Georgia , although some of their equipment remains to be repatriated .
But Moscow has refused to withdraw its troops from Moldova 's breakaway Trans - Dniester province , saying they are there as peacekeepers preventing a resumption of hostilities between the two sides .
Still , NATO nations have insisted that because Moscow did not have " host nation consent " from Moldova , it should withdraw its forces from the region .
President Vladimir Putin signed a decree at the weekend freezing Russia 's participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty , citing " extraordinary circumstances ... which affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures , " the Kremlin said in a statement .
Russia in the West are already at odds over U.S. plans to build a radar site in the Czech Republic and missile interceptors in Poland , Russia 's conflicts with its neighbors , including Georgia and Estonia , and Western criticism of Russia 's democracy and human rights record .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia could no longer tolerate a situation where it was complying with the treaty but its partners were not , and he expressed hope Russia 's move would induce Western nations to ratify the updated treaty .
The White House said it regretted the Kremlin 's move .
" We 're disappointed Russia has suspended its participation for now , but we 'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area - that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in Europe , " the U.S. National Security Council said in a statement .
Withdrawal from the treaty would allow Moscow to build up forces near its borders .
But Russian military analysts have said Russia 's move was a symbolic raising of the ante in the missile shield showdown more than a sign of impending military escalation .
Russian officials have staunchly protested U.S. missile plans , saying the U.S. system is aimed at its nuclear arsenal , and would upset the balance of strategic forces in Europe .
The U.S. insists that the anti-missile system is aimed at future nuclear threats from Iran .
Last fall , for example , a Berlin opera house canceled performances of a Mozart opera because of security fears stirred by a scene that depicts the severed head of the Prophet Muhammad .
Stung by charges that it had surrendered its artistic freedom , the house staged the opera three months later without incident .
To some here , the judge ’s ruling reflected a similar compromising of basic values .
“ A judge in Germany has to refer to the constitutional law , which says that human rights are not to be violated , ” said Günter Meyer , director of the Center for Research on the Arab World at the University of Mainz .
“ It ’s not her task to interpret the Koran .
It was an attempt at multicultural understanding , but in completely the wrong context . ”
Reaction to the judge ’s decision has been almost as sulfurous as it was to the cancellation of the opera .
“ When the Koran is put above the German Constitution , I can only say , ‘ Good night , Germany , ’ ” Ronald Pofalla , general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union , said in the mass - market newspaper Bild .
The 26 - year - old woman in this case was born in Germany to a Moroccan family and married in Morocco in 2001 , according to her lawyer , Ms. Becker - Rojczyk .
The couple settled in the Frankfurt area and had two children .
In May 2006 , the police were summoned after a particularly violent incident .
At that time , Judge Datz - Winter ordered the husband to move out and stay at least 55 yards away from the couple ’s home .
In the months that followed , her lawyer said , the man threatened to kill his wife .
Terrified , the woman filed for divorce in October and requested that it be granted without the usual year of separation because her husband ’s threats and beatings constituted an “ unreasonable hardship . ”
Veterans protesting the war ?
That 's not honorable , military says Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 5 , 2007 Print This Email This Military ' pussed out , ' says anti-war veteran
An anti-war veteran who wore his uniform during a protest of the Iraq war would not receive an honorable discharge from the military reserves under recommendations delivered by a Marine Corps panel Monday night .
In a case that former Marine Sgt. Adam Kokesh and his supporters say could become a landmark in defining the free - speech rights , the panel recommended that Kokesh receive a general discharge under honorable conditions from the Individual Ready Reserves .
The panel stopped short of recommending the " other than honorable " discharge that Kokesh appeared before the panel to protest .
Kokesh said the military recommended the general discharge , which allows him to keep benefits afforded to veterans , in an attempt to make the case disappear .
Kokesh and his supporters say that will not happen , and he said he is willing to take the fight all the way to federal court if necessary .
" They pussed out and took the easy way out .
They could 've taken a firm stance one way or the other , " Kokesh told RAW STORY Tuesday .
" If they really believed in what they believed , ( an other - than - honorable discharge ) would 've been appropriate . "
The case hinged on military regulations that prohibit active duty troops from wearing their uniforms during political demonstrations .
Kokesh argued that he was n't subject to regulations in the Uniform Code of Military Justice because of his membership in the Individual Ready Reserves , rather than the active duty Marines , and the Marine panel agreed he was n't subject to those regulations .
Members of the military who have served less than eight years have to complete their military commitment in the IRR , which requires they keep in touch with military superiors and be ready to serve if called upon .
In March , Kokesh participated in a demonstration in Washington organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War .
Wearing his desert fatigues , with his name , rank and the Marine Corps logo removed , Kokesh and other demonstrators performed mock patrols of Washington in an effort to show visitors to the nation 's capital what life is like in Iraq .
When he was informed in an e-mail from a superior officer of the possible violation of uniform code , Kokesh was offended at what he viewed as an attempt to silent dissent among veterans .
He replied to the e-mail and expressed his opinion that the military should have more important things to worry about and signed off with an expletive .
Following that exchange , Kokesh was informed that he faced an other than honorable discharge , and he and his supporters chartered a bus for Kansas City to appear before the panel yesterday .
The general discharge he received is one step below the honorable discharge Kokesh received when he left active duty .
Freecycle
Getting new stuff can feel really good .
Most everybody knows that .
Most everybody also knows — particularly in the aftermath of the consumption - frenzy holiday season — that utility can fade , pleasure can be fleeting and the whole thought - that - counts thing is especially ephemeral .
Apart from the usual solution to this problem ( more new stuff ! ) , it ’s worth pondering whether getting rid of stuff can ever feel as good as getting it .
A few years ago , a self - described tree - hugger in Tucson named Deron Beal was working for a nonprofit that focused on recycling as a way to minimize what was going into local landfills .
While plenty of people were willing , even eager , to get rid of things they no longer wanted but that were n’t really trash , finding people who wanted those things was a challenge .
Beal set up a Yahoo Groups mailing list , hoping to create a giveaway marketplace where people could list usable items and others could lay claim to them and then come pick them up .
The mailing list became the basis for Freecycle , a Web - enabled network of about 3,900 such e-mail groups , each dedicated to a local community and managed by a volunteer moderator , and claiming 2.9 million participants in more than 70 countries .
One of the largest Freecycle groups , with 25,000 members , is for New York City .
Save - the - earth types make up only a fraction of Freecycle users .
Like any successful marketplace , this one works because it links people with widely disparate motivations .
Some participants want to declutter .
Some see it as akin to a charity .
Some just do n’t want to lug items to the dump .
And of course , many people are looking for free stuff .
As Freecycle has become a bigger and bigger de facto brand —
Beal prefers “ movement ” — its sheer scale no doubt attracts people who are n’t tree - huggers or “ simple living ” fanatics but just have some item they ’d like to unconsume and in the process see what all the fuss is about .

Whatever attracts people to join , part of what keeps them involved , Beal says , is something they probably did n’t expect : the moment when someone thanks you backward and forward for giving him something you planned to throw away .
“ There ’s a sort of paradigm shift in your brain : ‘ Wow , that feels really good , ’ ” Beal says .
“ That ’s what I think is fueling this absurd amount of growth we ’ve had . ”
Does the time of year in which a child is conceived influence future academic achievement ?
Yes , according to research by neonatologist Paul Winchester , M.D. , Indiana University School of Medicine professor of clinical pediatrics .
Dr. Winchester , who studied 1,667,391 Indiana students , presents his finding on May 7 at the Pediatric Academic Societies ' annual meeting .
Dr. Winchester and colleagues linked the scores of the students in grades 3 through 10 who took the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress ( ISTEP ) examination with the month in which each student had been conceived .
The researchers found that ISTEP scores for math and language were distinctly seasonal with the lowest scores received by children who had been conceived in June through August .
Why might children conceived in June through August have the lowest ISTEP scores ?
" The fetal brain begins developing soon after conception .
The pesticides we use to control pests in fields and our homes and the nitrates we use to fertilize crops and even our lawns are at their highest level in the summer , " said Dr. Winchester , who also directs Newborn Intensive Care Services at St. Francis Hospital in Indianapolis .
" Exposure to pesticides and nitrates can alter the hormonal milieu of the pregnant mother and the developing fetal brain , " said Dr. Winchester .
" While our findings do not represent absolute proof that pesticides and nitrates contribute to lower ISTEP scores , they strongly support such a hypothesis . "
" I believe this work may lay the foundation for some of the most important basic and clinical research , and public health initiatives of our time .
To recognize that what we put into our environment has potential pandemic effects on pregnancy outcome and possibly on child development is a momentous observation , which hopefully will help transform the way humanity cares for its world , " said James Lemons , M.D. , Hugh McK.
Landon Professor of Pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine .
Dr. Lemons is director of the section of neonatal - perinatal medicine at the IU School of Medicine and at Riley Hospital for Children of Clarian Health in Indianapolis .
Nitrates and pesticides are known to cause maternal hypothyroidism and lower maternal thyroid in pregnancy is associated with lower cognitive scores in offspring .
" We have now linked higher pesticide and nitrate exposure in surface water with lower cognitive scores .
Neurodevelopmental consequences of exposure to pesticides and nitrates may not be obvious for many decades , " said Dr. Winchester .
Collaborating with Dr. Winchester on this study , which was funded by the Division of Neonatology of the Department of Pediatrics of the IU School of Medicine , were Jun Ying , Ph.D. of the University of Cincinnati , Wesley Bruce , M.S. of the Indiana Department of Education and Janetta Matesan , B.S. , of the IU School of Medicine .
The May 7 meeting is sponsored by the American Pediatric Society , the Society for Pediatric Research , the Ambulatory Pediatric Association , and the American Academy of Pediatrics .
Police in Visalia , California arrested a woman suffering from Parkinson 's disease for driving under the influence ( DUI ) -- even though she had not been drinking .
Arleen Avila , 46 , had been waiting in line at the In - N - Out Burgers drive - through when she fell asleep in her 2002 Mercedes .
Although another driver got out to wake her , a police officer arriving on the scene ordered Avila to get out of the car .
" The officer told me to get out of the car , but I could n't , " Avila told the Visalia Times - Delta newspaper .
" I spend most of my time in a motorized wheelchair , and it's hard and painful for me to get out . "
The police yanked Avila out of the car , put her in handcuffs and took her to a hospital to obtain medical clearance so that she could be booked on charges of DUI .
Police refused her requests for a wheelchair , kept her hands cuffed behind her back and impounded her SUV .
" They were asking me all kinds of questions and trying to get me to admit I had been drinking , " Avila told the Times - Delta .
" I was not drinking .
I do n't drink .
They never gave me a breath test or anything . "
After being released by police , Avila went to Tulare District Hospital for treatment of contusions she received from the police treatment .
She is considering taking legal action against the city .

Conversation with Kip Hawley , TSA Administrator ( Part 1 )
This is Part 1 of a five - part series .
Link to whole thing .
In April , Kip Hawley , the head of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , invited me to Washington for a meeting .
Despite some serious trepidation , I accepted .
And it was a good meeting .
Most of it was off the record , but he asked me how the TSA could overcome its negative image .
I told him to be more transparent , and stop ducking the hard questions .
He said that he wanted to do that .
He did enjoy writing a guest blog post for Aviation Daily , but having a blog himself did n’t work within the bureaucracy .
What else could he do ?
This interview , conducted in May and June via e-mail , was one of my suggestions .
Bruce Schneier :
By today ’s rules , I can carry on liquids in quantities of three ounces or less , unless they ’re in larger bottles .
But I can carry on multiple three - ounce bottles .
Or a single larger bottle with a non-prescription medicine label , like contact lens fluid .
It all has to fit inside a one - quart plastic bag , except for that large bottle of contact lens fluid .
And if you confiscate my liquids , you ’re going to toss them into a large pile right next to the screening station — which you would never do if anyone thought they were actually dangerous .
Can you please convince me there ’s not an Office for Annoying Air Travelers making this sort of stuff up ?
Kip Hawley : Screening ideas are indeed thought up by the Office for Annoying Air Travelers and vetted through the Directorate for Confusion and Complexity , and then we review them to insure that there are sufficient unintended irritating consequences so that the blogosphere is constantly fueled .
Imagine for a moment that TSA people are somewhat bright , and motivated to protect the public with the least intrusion into their lives , not to mention travel themselves .
How might you engineer backwards from that premise to get to three ounces and a baggie ?
We faced a different kind of liquid explosive , one that was engineered to evade then - existing technology and process .
Not the old Bojinka formula or other well - understood ones — TSA already trains and tests on those .
After August 10 , we began testing different variants with the national labs , among others , and engaged with other countries that have sophisticated explosives capabilities to find out what is necessary to reliably bring down a plane .
We started with the premise that we should prohibit only what ’s needed from a security perspective .
Otherwise , we would have stuck with a total liquid ban .
But we learned through testing that that no matter what someone brought on , if it was in a small enough container , it was n’t a serious threat .
So what would the justification be for prohibiting lip gloss , nasal spray , etc ?
There was none , other than for our own convenience and the sake of a simple explanation .
Based on the scientific findings and a do n’t - intrude - unless - needed - for - security philosophy , we came up with a container size that eliminates an assembled bomb ( without having to determine what exactly is inside the bottle labeled “ shampoo ” ) , limits the total liquid any one person can bring ( without requiring Transportation Security Officers ( TSOs ) to count individual bottles ) , and allows for additional security measures relating to multiple people mixing a bomb post - checkpoint .
Three ounces and a baggie in the bin gives us a way for people to safely bring on limited quantities of liquids , aerosols and gels .
BS : How will this foil a plot , given that there are no consequences to trying ?
Airplane contraband falls into two broad categories : stuff you get in trouble for trying to smuggle onboard , and stuff that just gets taken away from you .
If I ’m caught at a security checkpoint with a gun or a bomb , you ’re going to call the police and really ruin my day .
But if I have a large bottle of that liquid explosive , you confiscate it with a smile and let me though .
So unless you ’re 100 % perfect in catching this stuff — which you ’re not — I can just try again and again until I get it through .
This is n’t like contaminants in food , where if you remove 90 % of the particles , you ’re 90 % safer .
None of those false alarms — none of those innocuous liquids taken away from innocent travelers — improve security .
We ’re only safer if you catch the one explosive liquid amongst the millions of containers of water , shampoo , and toothpaste .
I have described two ways to get large amounts of liquids onto airplanes — large bottles labeled “ saline solution ” and trying until the screeners miss the liquid — not to mention combining multiple little bottles of liquid into one big bottle after the security checkpoint .
I want to assume the TSA is both intelligent and motivated to protect us .
I ’m taking your word for it that there is an actual threat — lots of chemists disagree — but your liquid ban is n’t mitigating it .
Instead , I have the sinking feeling that you ’re defending us against a terrorist smart enough to develop his own liquid explosive , yet too stupid to read the rules on TSA ’s own website .
KH : I think your premise is wrong .
There are consequences to coming to an airport with a bomb and having some of the materials taken away at the checkpoint .
Putting aside our layers of security for the moment , there are things you can do to get a TSO ’s attention at the checkpoint .
If a TSO finds you or the contents of your bag suspicious , you might get interviewed and / or have your bags more closely examined .
If the TSO throws your liquids in the trash , they do n’t find you a threat .
I often read blog posts about how someone could just take all their three - ounce bottles — or take bottles from others on the plane — and combine them into a larger container to make a bomb .
I ca n’t get into the specifics , but our explosives research shows this is not a viable option .
The current system is not the best we ’ll ever come up with .
In the near future , we ’ll come up with an automated system to take care of liquids , and everyone will be happier .
In the meantime , we have begun using hand - held devices that can recognize threat liquids through factory - sealed containers ( we will increase their number through the rest of the year ) and we have different test strips that are effective when a bottle is opened .
Right now , we ’re using them on exempt items like medicines , as well as undeclared liquids TSOs find in bags .
This will help close the vulnerability and strengthen the deterrent .
BS : People regularly point to security checkpoints missing a knife in their handbag as evidence that security screening is n’t working .
But that ’s wrong .
Complete effectiveness is not the goal ; the checkpoints just have to be effective enough so that the terrorists are worried their plan will be uncovered .
But in Denver earlier this year , testers sneaked 90 % of weapons through .
And other tests are n’t much better .
Why are these numbers so poor , and why did n’t they get better when the TSA took over airport security ?
KH : Your first point is dead on and is the key to how we look at security .
The stories about 90 % failures are wrong or extremely misleading .
We do many kinds of effectiveness tests at checkpoints daily .
We use them to guide training and decisions on technology and operating procedures .
We also do extensive and very sophisticated Red Team testing , and one of their jobs is to observe checkpoints and go back and figure out — based on inside knowledge of what we do — ways to beat the system .
They isolate one particular thing : for example , a particular explosive , made and placed in a way that exploits a particular weakness in technology ; our procedures ; or the way TSOs do things in practice .
Then they will test that particular thing over and over until they identify what corrective action is needed .
We then change technology or procedure , or plain old focus on execution .
And we repeat the process — forever .
So without getting into specifics on the test results , of course there are times that our evaluations can generate high failure rate numbers on specific scenarios .
Overall , though , our ability to detect bomb components is vastly improved and it will keep getting better .
( Older scores you may have seen may be “ feel good ” numbers based on old , easy tests .
Do n’t go for the sound - bite ; today ’s TSOs are light - years ahead of even where they were two years ago . )
Part 2 : When can we keep our shoes on ?

Wealth
Over the past decades , wealth has become more concentrated worldwide , and the gap between rich and poor has widened .

Mark A. Norell , a dinosaur paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History , said the find was “ pretty unexpected ” and showed “ how little we know about the diversity in the dinosaur world . ”

Dr. Xu’s group said Gigantoraptor was about 300 times as heavy as other similar dinosaurs and stood , at hips and shoulders , twice the height of a man .
An examination of marks in the bones indicated that the young animal ’s growth rate was considerably faster than that of North American tyrannosaurs , which the scientists said contributed to its giant size .
The scientists reported that “ the animal reached its young adult size within seven years and was still at a relatively early young adult stage at the time of death , ” which was probably in the 11th year of its life .
Their analysis also revealed “ several salient features previously unknown in any other dinosaur , ” such as in the vertebrae and the limb bones .
The hind limbs were more slender than usual in such robust dinosaurs .
Although no traces of feathers were found , the discovery team noted that smaller oviraptorosaurs are known to have had arm feathers and possibly other types of feathers .
It is possible , the scientists said , that Gigantoraptor also retained some arm feathers , “ given that the primary function of arm feathers is not to insulate the individual and their development is probably not related to size . ”
As Dr. Dodson of Penn explained , large - body animals tend to be naked .
Their big concern is not heat loss , but the fact that they generate more heat that must be dissipated .
If Gigantoraptor had feathers , they were sparse , as on an ostrich , and also like the ostrich , it might have used them in another heat - related function : courtship displays .

Taiwan 's first prediction market tapped into the `wisdom of the masses ' to forecast the results of recent mayoral polls
By Max Hirsch / STAFF REPORTER
While media polls failed miserably in predicting the results of the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections , one group of academics and political soothsayers prophesied the outcome with stunning accuracy .
Their nearly dead - on predictions were no accident , they insist , nor were there any crystal balls involved .
Just good science was behind their forecasts , they said , adding that they would soon unveil more on - the - mark political predictions -- including the winner of next year 's presidential election .
" It 's like a futures exchange market , " said Academia Sinica political analyst Lin Jih - wen ( 林繼文 ) , referring to the Center for Prediction Markets , run jointly by National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) and Swarchy Co , at a press conference touting the center yesterday .
" The same market mechanisms as in a bourse are harnessed to integrate biases and diverse outlooks on the future and produce a specific prediction , " he said .
Prediction market
Like prediction markets in the US , which boast steady track records of accurately predicting everything from the next president to the next Oscar winner , Taiwan 's first prediction market is a speculative bourse whose assets ' final cash value is tied to a specific future event .
Speculators bet on various possible outcomes whose market value is interpreted as the probability of that outcome occurring , said Swarchy Co official Liu Chia-kai ( 劉嘉凱 ) .
The final market projection for Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) Taipei mayoral candidate Frank Hsieh 's ( 謝長廷 ) share of the vote in December 's election , for example , was off by merely a few percentage points , said panelists .
The market 's predicted winner of the Taipei mayoral election -- Chinese Nationalist Party ( KMT ) candidate Hau Long - bin ( 郝龍斌 ) -- was similarly pegged by speculators as earning a vote share that missed the mark by only one percentage point .
" Contrast that with media polls , " Liu said .
" They were all off in their forecasts of voting shares by around ten percentage points , and even failed to predict the winner . "
So why was the prediction market so accurate ?
Informed individuals
Center director and NCCU economics professor Lin Hsin - yi ( 林馨怡 ) told reporters that when a large group of informed individuals with a material stake in how the event that their betting on , unfolds , they tend to actively and squarely assess the circumstances .
Liu called such statistical accuracy " tapping the wisdom of the masses . "
Polls , on the other hand , rely on the responses of often apathetic or even untruthful participants , said Academia Sinica researcher Hsu Yung- ming ( 徐永明 ) , adding that media should analyze both polls and prediction market trends in sizing up political developments .
" Polls are useful because they can roughly tell us the political thinking among certain segments of society , while prediction markets can tell us , with a reasonable degree of accuracy , what 's going to happen , " Lin Jih - wen said , adding that prediction markets ' weakness lies in their inability to demonstrate why they have reached certain conclusions .
11 Points to look when looking for a web host
1 . The quality and stability of the hosting company .
Search the internet to check if they have got a rating and review .
2. Space provided at least 5 GB
3 . The no limit for the mysql db , even if it is one database .
Remember the database increases as time passes .
4 . The number of consecutive connections permitted , at least 10 .
In the even digg decides to kiss you 😀
5 . If you are going for a personal website then look below $ 6 .
6 . The bandwidth provided is for decoration .
You will not need the said bandwidth unless you are having over 20,000 hits a month , if this is the case the you make enough money from google adsense to fund a dedicated server .
7 . Dont buy the gimmick of 12 months of pre-paid hosting and you get 12 % off , as you might change your web host after 4 months , if you are not satisfied with the current .
8 . The number of emails does not play a role if you are a small business .
Web hosts say they will provide you with 1000 emails .
Just a question , what are you going to do with this many emails anyway ?
9 . Some web host provide the same price for linux and windows hosting , check the features and go for what is convenient .
10 .
The support response will be 12 or 12 hours or minutes , but when you really need the support you will never get one .
11 . Do not fall for the SSL certificate shit , as you will not require them unless you are doing credit card transaction .
Assuming you are doing one too , you will have a link clicked to forward the details to a page that will have a SSL certificate .
Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards has been trying to put poverty reduction back on the national agenda .
During an 11 - city tour , Mr. Edwards spelled out his goal to eradicate poverty by 2036 .
He would do this not merely through economic growth , but with direct measures , such as healthcare for all , the creation of 1 million one - year transition jobs , housing vouchers , and eliminating tax benefits for the rich .
His lamentations over the poor have been echoed by the two leading Democratic contenders : Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
Their efforts , accompanied by greater public awareness of the growing gap between the rich and poor in the United States , may even result in congressional action .
" We could even take some baby steps in the next couple of years " – that is , before President Bush leaves the White House , suggests Jared Bernstein , an economist at the liberal - leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
If Democrats win the White House in 2008 and retain Congress , laws to deal with poverty and income inequality could multiply .
" I 'm hopeful that in 2008 we will see some changes , " says Heather Boushey , an income expert at the Center for Eco­­nomic Policy and Research in Wash­­­ington .
She 's troubled by the fact that the productivity of American business has been increasing steadily , but little of that new wealth and income reaches the poor – or even the middle class .
The richest 0.01 percent has grabbed most of the gains , enjoying a 250 percent increase in income between 1973 and 2005 .
The entire economy grew by 160 percent during that period .
In 2005 , 37 million Americans – 12.6 percent of the population – lived below the official poverty line .
It was a slight improvement from 12.7 percent in 2004 , but well above the 11.3 percent level just before the 2000 recession .
The Census Bureau is scheduled to release official poverty numbers for 2006 on Aug. 28 .
With continued growth in the economy , the percentage of Americans who are officially poor may have dropped again last year , Mr. Bernstein figures .
Nonetheless , the US probably will continue to have a much higher proportion of its people ranked as poor than almost all other rich industrial nations .
At the turn of this century , it ranked 24th among 25 countries in the proportion of its population having incomes below half of the median income – the level where half of the people have a bigger income , and half have a smaller income .
The US is not alone in experiencing high levels of income inequality .
Earlier this month , the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in York , England , published a study finding that the gap between the rich and poor in Britain has reached its highest level in more than 40 years .
Over the past 15 years , more households have become poor , but fewer are very poor – " breadline poor . "
Finance ministers of " Euroland " ( the 11 nations that have adopted the euro as their common currency ) noted after a meeting last winter that rising inequality increasingly poses a danger to " social stability . "
What that means exactly was not spelled out .
In the politically stable US , it probably does n't mean demonstrations in the street , or worse .
A Wall Street firm , Goldman Sachs , released a paper July 6 about the unequal distribution of income in Euroland , Japan , and the US .
Rising inequality , the paper notes , " can affect the long - term growth prospects of an economy , as well as the way an economy behaves throughout the [ business ] cycle . "
It sees a risk that more inequality could lead to protectionism , which would hurt global trade , and thus do " more damage than good . "
The best medium - to - long - term answer to rising inequality is better education , the firm suggests , something that can't be engineered overnight .
Bernstein hopes that Mr. Bush will not veto legislation moving through Congress that would expand the State Children 's Health Insurance Program to cover more low - income children and more adults .
Healthcare costs are often a major burden for poor families .
He also hopes that the president will allow a tax boost for super - rich hedge - fund managers , providing an extra $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in revenue that could be used , for example , to raise the Earned Income Tax Credit that helps the working poor .
Last week , a modest boost in the federal minimum wage went into effect , helping out some working poor .
One unresolved issue is how to measure poverty .
When last year 's poverty numbers came out , for example , Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute noted that today 's officially poor ( versus those of four decades ago ) are more likely to have access to credit , spend relatively less on food , and have more housing space .
They also receive better healthcare .
Many own cars , televisions , telephones , microwaves , and VCRs or DVD players .
The argument over a definition of poverty gets complex .
A basic point Bernstein makes is that poverty is not just about material deprivation , but relative to the prosperity of the rest of the nation .
" Today 's poor are increasingly left behind the mainstream , " he argues .

The Normalised Google Distance
I love the idea of a lowercase semantic web , when you use “ brute force ” statistical analysis of the growing corpus the world wide web offers .
Brute force is dumb by definition , but ironically I find this kind of dumb works best for Artificial Intelligence .
Just think of the 20 questions game , which also simply ( correct me if I ’m wrong ) matches patterns of previous games and still manages to get to look so smart .
One of the most powerful recent approaches is the so - called Google Mindshare , or Googleshare algorithm .
I use a similar idea for my Centuryshare application at FindForward.com , by relating different years to a specific word to see when this word was most “ popular ” .
Instead of googling for meta - data ( which there is relatively little of , even though what exists is easily machine - readable ) flat text is enough ; very often , just the Google page count reveals all we need to know .
Now , as the New Scientist reports , the two scientists Paul Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam , Netherlands , used Google to find what they call the “ Normalised Google Distance . ”
Basically this NGD quantifies the strength of a relationship between two words .
For example , “ speakers ” and “ sound ” are more related than “ speakers ” and “ elephant . ”
Instead of creating this manually , of course , they find the Google PageCount when both words are used together in a search .
( “ Speakers ” and “ sound ” would have a relatively high number of result pages when compared to “ speakers ” and “ elephant . ” )
Now when you repeat this process of finding the NGD for a lot of words , you can build a multi-connection word map .
According to the New Scientist , Paul Vitany says “ This is automatic meaning extraction .
It could well be the way to make a computer understand things and act semi-intelligently . ”
You can read all the details of this approach in Vitany ’s and Cilibrasi ’s paper “ Automatic Meaning Discovery Using Google . ”
I do believe the future of AI will evolve along these lines , but it might not be quite what we expected .
After all , we may never really understand what we built , and possibly , are n’t able to fully control it .
Just image a scientist ’s suprise if he was successful in creating real Turing test intelligence , and as soon as he ’d pose his first question , the automate replies : “ I could answer this easily , but tell me , what ’s in it for me ? ”

Now you can disable your Caps Lock key in Windows ... without any special software , and without having to pry the key off with a screwdriver .
Read on to find out how .
I also have a page on how to disable the Windows key .
And , if you 're more interested in something fun , you can turn your Caps Lock key into a Billy Mays key .
Background
Accidentally hitting the Caps Lock key when typing up an email or coding can be maddening .
Most people never use it anyway , so why not disable it ?
In Windows , you can by adding some keyboard scancode mapping information to your Windows registry .
A full list is available from Microsoft in this DOC file .
To make it even easier , I decided to add some .REG files so you can disable your shift key yourself without needing to muck around with the registry .
Compatibility
This method of disabling the Caps Lock key works with all modern Windows variants : Windows 2000 , XP , Vista , 7 , 8/8.1 .
It will not work with Windows 95/98 / Me .
As with any HKLM registry changes , you 'll need administrator priviledges to make them .
Warnings
These files are provided without warranty .
Use them at your own risk .
These files will overwrite any keyboard mappings you currently have .
. REG files update your Windows registry .
Incorrect changes to the registry may damage Windows or other installed software .
Be sure you know what a given .REG file contains before merging it into the registry .
These files are unsupported , please do not contact me with questions on their use .
Installation / Files
The following files are .reg files .
They modify the Windows registry directly .
You should download them to your PC ( right - click the link and select to Save As or similar ) .
Be sure they save as a .reg file and not as .reg.txt .
( If they save as a .reg. txt , just rename them .
You may have to disable Windows ' helpfully ' hiding extensions . )
Next , double - click them to add them to your registry .
After saying YES to the message box , reboot your machine and enjoy freedom from Caps Lock annoyances .
Change Caps Lock into a SHIFT key : caps_lock_to_shift.reg

Farmers do not want the animals they care for being killed by wolves
Anna Davies ,
National Farmers ' Union Scotland
The demise of wolves in Scotland
Wolves , which were hunted to extinction in Scotland in the late 1700s , would help control the numbers of red deer , the team from the UK and Norway said .
This would aid the re-establishment of plants and birds - currently hampered by the deer population , they write in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
But farmers say more livestock would be killed if wolves are reintroduced .
The researchers ' findings used a predator / prey model to assess the probable consequences on the Highland 's red deer population .
" There has been an ongoing debate about the possibility of reintroducing wolves to Scotland for some time , " said co-author Tim Coulson , from Imperial College London .
" So we thought that we would start the ball rolling by looking to see , using mathematical modelling approaches , what the possible impact of reintroducing wolves into Scotland would have on the red deer population . "
Attempts to get forests to come back are going to be hindered by the fact that there are too many deer
Dr Tim Coulson , Imperial College London
The researchers found that the red deer population was close to reaching the maximum capacity that the ecosystem could support , and that costly culls were not proving to be economically effective .
Since Scotland 's wild wolf population died out , the UK 's largest wild land animal has not had any natural predators to help control its numbers .
" For example , many sheep farmers argue for fewer deer because they are concerned the deer compete with sheep for grazing , " Dr Coulson told BBC News .
" Many of the conservation organisations , especially those trying to reforest areas , also believe their numbers should be reduced .
" Attempts to get forests to come back are going to be hindered by the fact that there are too many deer , which will munch away merrily on any young trees . "
Other groups , Dr Coulson added , were concerned that excessive deer numbers were having an impact on bird species , such as the capercaillie .
The study found that the wolves would prey on the deer and would help rebalance the ecology , giving other tree and bird species a chance to establish themselves .
Livestock worries
But farming groups voiced concern and said that the introduction of wolves would hit their members .
One bird that could benefit from wolves in Scotland is the capercaillie
Anna Davies , a spokeswoman for the National Farmers ' Union in Scotland , said : " The reintroduction of wolves into the wild would present significant problems in terms of sheep predation , and that is the reason why it is not widely popular among farmers . "
Dr Coulson agreed that farmers would be affected but he added : " Typically , wolves do not go through and take out an entire flock ; they will take individuals when they are hungry . "
The study also assessed people 's attitudes towards the idea of releasing wolves into the wild .
While the public were generally positive , people living in rural areas were more sensitive .
" Although the farmers were slightly negative , they were not completely adverse to the idea provided they were adequately reimbursed for any lost stock , " he said .
But Miss Davies disagreed : " Any implication that farmers are simply concerned with support payments and not with the welfare and predation of their animals is unjustified .
" Farmers suffer emotional as well as financial losses when they lose stock , as was demonstrated during the foot - and - mouth outbreak . "
Dr Coulson said he believed that any reintroduction plan was still a long way from becoming a reality .
" Our research is just one of the first steps towards understanding the consequences of a wolf reintroduction in Scotland , " he added .
Biofuels Boom Spurring Deforestation
By Stephen Leahy
Mar 21 ( IPS / IFEJ ) – Nearly 40,000 hectares of forest vanish every day , driven by the world ’s growing hunger for timber , pulp and paper , and ironically , new biofuels and carbon credits designed to protect the environment .
The irony here is that the growing eagerness to slow climate change by using biofuels and planting millions of trees for carbon credits has resulted in new major causes of deforestation , say activists .
And that is making climate change worse because deforestation puts far more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire world ’s fleet of cars , trucks , planes , trains and ships combined .
“ Biofuels are rapidly becoming the main cause of deforestation in countries like Indonesia , Malaysia and Brazil , ” said Simone Lovera , managing coordinator of the Global Forest Coalition , an environmental NGO based in Asunción , Paraguay .
“ We call it ‘ deforestation diesel ’ , ” Lovera told IPS .
Oil from African palm trees is considered to be one of the best and cheapest sources of biodiesel and energy companies are investing billions into acquiring or developing oil - palm plantations in developing countries .
Vast tracts of forest in Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand and many other countries have been cleared to grow oil palms .
Oil palm has become the world ’s number one fruit crop , well ahead of bananas .
Biodiesel offers many environmental benefits over diesel from petroleum , including reductions in air pollutants , but the enormous global thirst means millions more hectares could be converted into monocultures of oil palm .

Some of the comments in the Barrier To Entry post bring up the point that maybe the Smalltalk IDE itself is one of those barriers .
It 's an interesting thing , the Smalltalk browser .
Unlike most IDEs , it 's optimized for reading code rather than writing code .
Other IDEs allow you to see any number of methods all at once , cutting and pasting text giant chunks at a time , they sure make you feel like you 're working .
They do n't however , allow you to navigate the semantic structure of the code very well nor do they encourage the writing of well - organized code .
Modern IDEs are getting better at this , but they 're doing it by copying Smalltalk .
Smalltalk 's various code browsers ( hierarchy , method , inheritance , senders , implementors , protocol , category , package , refactoring ) let you explore the structure and relationships between existing code and its tools ( transcript , workspace , method finder , message names ) make finding and using existing code , or understanding existing APIs vastly easier than any other language I know of .
Seeing the structure of code is always but a context menu or hotkey away .
Smalltalk 's browser is rather opinionated , luckily , thanks to Rails , opinionated software seems to be having somewhat of a revival .
When it comes to writing code , the browser forces you into a certain mindset , one that other languages do n't force you into .
When I create a method in Java / C# / Ruby , I have to choose little more than what file and class it belongs in .
I can organize the code well , but there 's little incentive to do so and my unit of work is rather undefined , I could be slicing and dicing methods , classes , namespaces , etc. , usually with the full screen devoted to code across various files or even god forbid in one giant file .
This encourages a code now and organize later approach .
Sadly , later often never comes , and the code is left functional but messy .
Smalltalk on the other hand defines my unit of work as the method and by doing so forces me at every turn , to continually organize my code in semantically meaningful ways .
When I create a method , I have to choose a class category , a class , and a method category to put the method in .
If I do n't , Smalltalk kindly categorizes the method for me in a protocol called " as yet unclassified " .
It 's almost an insult , but it 's also a not so subtle reminder than I 'm writing code sloppily , faster than I 'm thinking .
It reminds me to slow down , think for a second , where does this thing belong .
It only takes a second to pick a meaningful category name , and these names are idiomatic , I see them all the time when I 'm looking for code .
Aha , we 've linked writing code to reading code .
By taking the time to properly categorize my methods I also learn where to look for code later , when I 'm in reading mode .
It 's a feedback loop , the more I read the better I write and the better I write the more I learn to read with accuracy , looking only where necessary .
It 's as if the code itself is a concise form of documentation hyperlinked by semantic meaning using things that Smalltalkers call browsers .
Browsers and hyperlinks , bah , that 'll never work !
And RDoc , what the fuck is that , looks curiously like a Smalltalk browser to me , but why should class comments be anywhere except on the class itself ?
Oh , that 's right , Ruby does n't have a Smalltalk browser , they code in files , how quaint .
As for editing the method itself , I work on and view only one method at a time , and only the lower half of the browser is for editing code which punishes me if I write long methods that can't fit into that tiny pane .
Smalltalk at every turn encourages me to read more code than I write , reuse more code than I otherwise might , and write smaller simpler methods than I likely would in a text editor .
Writing smaller methods forces me to give them meaningful names .
Giving them meaningful names and putting them in meaningful places makes the code easier to read and easier to find .
Code that is easier to read and easier to find , is easier to reuse , easier to understand , and easier to compose into new solutions .
It 's called bottom - up programming , the foundation of which is small composable methods .
I keep using the word small , maybe that 's a mistake on my part , what I really mean is concise .
Methods with a single purpose that is clearly summed up by their name .
These kinds of methods happen to be short in general , but that 's a side effect of their being focused on a single task .
The Smalltalk browser encourages these kinds of methods by making writing long methods or paying attention to too many methods painful .
Text editors are general - purpose editor aimed at text , that could be anything from a blog post to a novel .
Surely an editor intended only for code , and only for a particular style of code , can be made much more domain - specific .
The Smalltalk browser is such an editor , its domain is highly factored heavily structured bottom - up style object - oriented code .
If that 's the style of code you like to write , you 'll find the Smalltalk browser wonderful , if not , you 'll find it painfully opinionated and rude .
Take a peek at decompiled .
Net framework sources , or Ruby sources and what you 'll find , are average line per method counts in the 50 + to even 100 + ranges .
In Smalltalk , around 10 or so .
To me , this is a clear indication that text editors are the wrong interface for writing clean simple well - factored reusable code .
Sure , I just pulled these numbers out of my ass , but they reflect my experiences and even then , I 'm being polite , 1000 line methods are not at all uncommon in .
Net .
Maybe adjusting to the Smalltalk browser is similar to adjusting to Lisp 's parenthesis .
It 's something you desperately want to fix as a newbie and make it work like other languages .
In Lisp 's case , trying to design an infix Lisp while in Smalltalk it 's a text and file - based editor .
In both cases , once you stop fighting the language and realize the difference is actually a great strength of the language rather than something that needs to be fixed .
You realize it's you that needs to change , you open your mind , accept that sometimes different is good , and take advantage of the new power these tools give you .
Experienced Lispers love their parenthesis and experienced Smalltalkers love their browsers .
Rather than seeing the Smalltalk browser as a barrier , maybe , just maybe , you'd be better off seeing it as a new toy to play with .
Something new to learn .
UPDATE : Here 's a few admittedly cramped screenshots of the various browsers .
They do of course look much better maximized on your monitor .

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes has given Microsoft nine days to comply with court requirements that it provide rival firms with interoperability information .
Kroes said yesterday : " I do n't have eternal life . "
She told The Guardian newspaper that the information should have been available a couple of months ago .
She said : " I am not impressed if someone says 90 per cent of the information is already there when we need 100 per cent .
It 's a jigsaw and some parts are missing ...
In my opinion , this information should have been here a couple of months ago . "
Microsoft has until 23 November to make the information available .
The commission said in a statement that Microsoft had submitted a revised set of documents on 19 July but , after checking them with the help of monitoring trustee Neil Barrett , decided they are not sufficient .
The statement says : " The commission expects the remaining omissions and deficiencies in the technical documentation to be remedied by 23 November so that by the end of November the entire set of technical documentation will be available for potential licensees to review . "
The statement reminds us that Microsoft was originally asked to provide the information within four months of the verdict in March 2004 - by July 2004 .
Microsoft missed that and subsequent deadlines .
Because of this , the commission imposed a penalty of € 280.5 m for non-compliance from the 31 July 2006 .
Microsoft also faces fines of € 3 m a day .
Anti-virus companies have complained that Microsoft has failed to provide enough information for them to ensure their products interact properly with Vista . ®
Before I begin I would like to state , for the record , that I am not trying to incite a language flame war ( at the moment ) .
I ’m not asking here which language will be the next popular language , but what programming style will be popular .
Will functional programming make a comeback ?
Will OOP refuse to die ?
Or will it be something we have n’t seen before ?
One thing I am sure it wo n’t be is natural language programming .
Attempting to program using complete sentences is the opposite of what you want a programming language to be , namely concise and powerful .
Have you ever heard someone tell you that the code is the documentation ?
This is because for the most complicated algorithms pseudo - code is a shorter and a more accurate description than words could ever be .
As programmers we want our languages to be concise and precise , and natural language is neither .
The rise of a given programming style , historically , can be correlated with what kinds of problems were popular .
For example when systems programming was the hot topic C ( and the imperative style ) became dominant .
Functional programming had its heyday with AI researchers , because passing functions around makes algorithms in AI research much simpler .
Most recently OOP has become popular with the rise of GUIs , because objects and messages are a natural fit for window controls .
So to predict what will be next we should look at the kinds of problems that programmers deal with most , and I think it is obvious that the “ hot topic ” in programming is distributed applications , specifically web services , AJAX applications , and collaboration software .
From this list it seems likely that the next popular programming idiom will need to have concurrency , state , security , and errors as its strongest points .
Concurrency means that the idiom needs a transparent way to deal with threads and synchronization .
If you ever need to explicitly create a thread or lock a mutex then the idiom has not solved this problem .
State means that the idiom must support the ability to maintain unique data for any number of clients in a natural way , and possibly the ability to unwind state when necessary ( much like a continuation ) .
Security means that stupid programmer mistakes , like passing the user name from a text field directly to an SQL query are n’t possible .
Tainting is currently a way to “ solve ” this kind of problem , but I ca n’t say that it is a very good solution .
Another way might be to do away with the ability to pass strings directly to library functions .
Finally , errors mean that there must be a transparent way to deal with the unexpected , either by correcting the error in place or exiting from the part of the program that raised the exception .
Once again , having an explicit try - catch construct is a sign that errors are a problem that has n’t been solved as part of the idiom .
Web apps have been around for a while now , so you may be wondering why the next big thing has n’t arrived already .
I think the delay is because in this generation of problems we have several strengths required of new idiom that are at odds with each other , while in previous generations there was the real problems were closely related to each other , and thus easier to solve all at once .
What I mean by all at once is that it ca n’t be simply be four solutions glued together , it needs to be one solution that solves all four problems , much like how OOP solved data encapsulation and message passing at the same time .
And of course they must be transparent solutions , meaning that the best solutions with respect to these problems are also the easiest solutions , and require the least amount of programmer effort possible .
OOP enthusiasts will of course tell you how well OOP deals with these problems ( try - catch , thread objects , synchronization objects , yadda yadda ) .
These solutions are not transparent at all , and more tellingly the fact that you are expected to use a framework in many OO languages to create large scale web apps ( java , ruby , ect ) shows that the solutions provided by this idiom are n’t really up to solving all the problems .
However , because its replacement has n’t arrived on the scene yet programmers are stuck with OOP , resulting in buggy and insecure applications .
Yes , you can make an OOP project thread safe , resistant to errors , and secure , but it is a radically different kind of task than throwing together a GUI , so why should programmers be using the same techniques ?
Unfortunately functional programming is n’t the solution either .
Although functional programming handles concurrency well ( assuming there are no side - effects ) , it suffers when you try to implement an error handling system , or synchronization when you absolutely must have side - effects .
A solution to the threading and state problems might be event based programming .
In event based program the application is structured around a number of events , each of which is called asynchronously .
Also each event is called in a “ context ” ( local state ) .
With respect to this context some events are exclusive , meaning that only one can be invoked at a time , while others can be running simultaneously with each other .
Event based programming solves the state and concurrency problems , but not those of synchronization or error handling , meaning that it will not be the next idiom , since all of these problems must be solved in one fell swoop .
I mention it simply to show that the idioms we currently work with are n’t the end of all language development .
The only conclusion I can provide unfortunately is that whatever the next idiom is that I have n’t seen it yet .
If you think that you have feel free to leave a message here .
Behold , this bizarre demographic .
Behold this odd and simmering and rather shockingly large hunk of the American population because chances are very good that at least some of them live right next door to you and breathe the same air and steal your parking spaces and often do n't shower for six days at a stretch .
And maybe , just maybe you should be painfully , dreadfully aware of them because they are -- in their quiet , seemingly innocuous way -- far more deadly than any gay evangelical preacher or meth - lab gang - bangers and far more frightening than chicken - flavored soap bubbles for dogs and far more disconcerting than Britney Spears ' barren skull .
They are , in short , the deeply uninformed .
The inexplicably ignorant .
The wondrously numb , the disconnected , the way , way out of touch .
And they are , apparently , legion .
Let me be clear .
I am not speaking merely about the ideologically lopsided and the intellectually misshapen .
I am not speaking of , say , those armies of happy blank - eyed red-state ' Merkins who only read NASCAR - themed Harlequin romance novels and only drink Hooters - branded energy drinks ( real products , both ) and who like to bury their gay sex fantasies under mountains of happy homophobic sing - along God- fearin ' megachurch denial .
Nor am I speaking of your average Bush - lovin ' bobbleheads who appear to get their worldly information by way of licking the stuff found on the bottom of the rocks in front of Fox News HQ and then tripping for three days while watching " The O'Reilly Factor " from the bathtub .
Everyone knows about them .
And no one really takes them seriously anymore .
No , I am speaking of a group far more mysterious and far more bewildering .
And they number , in fact , in the tens of millions , or fully 13 percent of the American population , if this recent , 46 - nation poll is to be believed .
Here is one way you shall know them :
They have never heard of global warming .
You read that right .
According to this ACNielsen poll , there are , right now , upwards of 40 million bipedal adult Internet - using Americans living in this nation who have never , not even once , seen a program about the most dire issue facing the planet today .
They have not read about it in a newspaper or seen photos in a magazine or heard about it via an award - winning documentary or seen monkey - like Republican presidents deny its existence and spit on science and mock the simply insurmountable pile of evidence in the name of oil profits and flagrant cronyism .
Who are these people , you ask ?
Are they , say , millions of forgotten , heavily medicated shut -ins across the land ?
Are they the disregarded elderly ?
People living in the backwoods of Louisiana or Appalachia and therefore we can't expect them to actually read or watch television or care much about the health of the planet ( except , of course , to take part in a broad , 46 - nation Internet survey ) because they 're simply too busy hunting squirrels and making fire and picking their teeth with dinosaur bones ?
Or perhaps they are the very young and the desperately teenage , so packed to the skullcap with screaming hormones they can barely navigate the lousy American education system much less name the current president or flirt well on MySpace or understand how many tons of greenhouse gases are pumped into the sky to crank out one PlayStation 3 .
You think ?
Does this explain it ?
Verily , it does not .
Not by a long shot .
Not when , for example , fully 95 percent of Latin America has heard of global warming , and 75 percent think it 's a " very serious " issue .
Not when the United States ranks dead last among all 46 nations in its concern for the issue of dire climate change .
No , there is something more sinister at play here .
Something darker and just a little disquieting .
Do you know what it is ?
I do n't , either .
Do you ask , as I do , How the hell can this be ?
What sort of people are these ?
How can this survey be accurate ?
How can anyone even moderately attuned to the culture not have heard of global warming , even once ?
Is it not part of the popular lexicon ?
Is it not being used to sell sexy white jeans , fer chrissakes ?
What , pray tell , gives ?
Here is what we do know :
The United States is , by far , the world 's worst contributor to the root causes of global warming , and yet we are the least concerned about it .
Read that again : Despite how the United States pumps more pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than China or India or Russia , a scant 42 percent of us see the problem as " very serious . "
Even China and India , those irresponsible mega-polluters of the developing world we like to scoff at for their flagrant industrial waste , are far more concerned and more universally informed .
It 's enough to make you look at George W. Bush and want to slap him across the face with the razor - sharp paw of a dead polar bear .
It 's enough to make your heart shudder as you wonder who the hell we are , really , as an ostensibly proud people , as a supposedly " unified " nation , a global leader , a role model to the planet .
Is the great United States really just some sort of moral joke ?
Are we really leading the world in anything except warmongering and defense spending and sexual hysteria and cool iPod accessories ?
Sure , the overall lack of concern is understandable .
After all , the vicious GOP spin machine has been working like a rabid dog for the last six years to demonize science and mock environmentalists and sneer at the Kyoto protocol and force eminent scientists to bury their dire findings lest Dick Cheney visit them in the night with a box of rat poison and a shotgun sneer .
And then there 's this :
Only 13 percent of congressional Republicans see global warming as a human - caused issue , compared to 95 percent of Dems .
That 's right , despite the National Academy of Sciences , despite the AAAS and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , despite the U.N. , despite every reputable ( and often , very conservative ) scientific body on the planet , half of our own Congress snickeringly denies humans have had anything to do with global warming .
Ah , how proud they must be .
But while that level of willful , greedy ignorance is relatively easy to explain , this weird hunk of gaping blindness , this intellectual black hole , is n't quite so easy to figure out .
Except for this :
Maybe it's the end result of the great , chronic dumbing down of the American mind .
Possible ?
Maybe our 13 percent blindness rate is simply the brutal upshot , the logical conclusion of all the endless stripping of school textbooks of fact and perspective , of the push for silly literalist Christian dogma at the expense of true awareness , of the systemic neoconservative drive to get Americans to stop asking questions and stop thinking for themselves and to hate and mistrust the media ( except , of course , Fox News ) , and would n't you be better off just enjoying your Wal - Mart candy corn and your " Everybody Loves Raymond " DVDs and just turn off your brain because it's all just far too complicated and messy and suspicious anyway , so really , why care at all ?
And oh , those dark storm clouds ?
Pay no attention to those .
Those are just God 's happy lint balls .
Go back to sleep .

Specimen of Attenborough 's long - beaked echidna
Enlarge Image
On a recent visit to Papua 's Cyclops Mountains , researchers uncovered burrows and tracks made by the Attenborough 's long - beaked echidna .
The species is only known to biologists through a specimen from 1961 , which is housed in a museum in the Netherlands .
The team will return to Papua next year to find and photograph the creature .
The month - long expedition by scientists from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) involved travelling to parts of the mountain range , covered by thick jungle , which had remained unexplored for more than 45 years .
Lone specimen
Jonathan Baillie , ZSL's Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered ( Edge ) programme manager , said : " We hope that Sir David Attenborough will be delighted to hear that his namesake species is still surviving in the wilds of the Papaun jungle . "
As a result , it was widely assumed that the shoe box - sized species ( Zaglossus attenboroughi ) was extinct .
But while the Edge team were in the area , they spoke to local tribespeople who said that they had seen the creature as recently as 2005 .
The scientists also discovered " nose pokes " , holes in the ground made by the echidnas as they stuck their long noses into soil to feed .
In the programme 's blog , Dr Baillie wrote : " Attenborough 's echidna is one of five monotremes ( egg- laying mammals ) that first inhabited the Earth around the time of the dinosaurs .
Parts of the Cyclops Mountains were unexplored for more than 45 years
" This group includes the duck - billed platypus , which helps demonstrate how different these are from all other mammals . "
Very little is known about the animal 's ecology .
It is thought that it is nocturnal , foraging for earthworms among the forest litter , then spending the day resting in shallow burrows or hollow logs .
When threatened , it is believed the solitary living echidna erects its spine - covered coat to protect it from predators .
The team is planning to return to the Cyclops Mountains next year to carry out further research and to also install camera traps in order to photograph a living Attenborough 's long - beaked echidna .

As a humble columnist , I am puzzled .
I have been writing on Israeli realities for a decade , and I find writing ever more difficult : nothing changes .
How often can you write something different about the same things ?
The international media , on the other hand , has had no difficulty filling pages and screens , making the very … Continue reading “ Israelis Sick and Tired – but of What ? ”
A few people have recently been tolling the bell for the skinny jeans trends , on the way out they tell us .
Joining them today is A Socialite ’s Life who says “ about time ” .
Their proof ?
But two A - list celebrities ( Penelope Cruz , Katie Holmes , Gwyneth Paltrow , Jessica Alba are pictured ) do n’t make a trend , especially when they all look so bloody terrible in them .
But what ’s really going on ?
People are simply experimenting with their denim .
It ’s not the first time in recent memory either .
Hypermodel Kate Moss tried high - waisted denim last year and the same people rushed to tell us skinny jeans were dead , and we saw where that went .
Few people wore them , and each looked as bad as the other .
Moss herself has gone back to skinny jeans , Siwy in particular .
So do n’t pack away your skinny jeans .
They ’re still very much on the legs of the best fashionisers .
Stomach ulcers can be treated with antibiotics
Robin Warren and Barry Marshall showed the bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a key role in the development of both stomach and intestinal ulcers .
Thanks to their work these ulcers are often no longer a long - term , frequently disabling problem .
They can now be cured with a short - term course of drugs and antibiotics .
In 1982 , when H. pylori was discovered by Dr Marshall and Dr Warren , stress and lifestyle were considered the major causes of stomach and intestinal ulcers .
HELICOBACTER PYLORI H. pylori is found in the stomach of about 50 % of all humans
In developing countries almost everyone is infected Infection is typically contracted in early childhood , and the bacteria may remain in the stomach for life
In most people there are no symptoms
However , it can trigger ulcers in 10 - 15 % of those infected
It is now firmly established that the bacterium causes more than 90 % of duodenal ( intestinal ) ulcers and up to 80 % of gastric ( stomach ) ulcers .
Dr Warren , a pathologist from Perth , paved the way for the breakthrough when he discovered that small curved bacteria colonised the lower part of the stomach in about 50 % of patients from which biopsies had been taken .
Key observation
He also made the crucial observation that signs of inflammation were always present in the stomach lining close to where the bacteria were seen .
Dr Marshall became interested in the findings and together they initiated a study of biopsies from 100 patients .
After several attempts , Dr Marshall succeeded in cultivating a hitherto unknown bacterial species - H. pylori - from several of these biopsies .
Together they found that the organism was present in almost all patients with gastric inflammation , duodenal ulcer or gastric ulcer .
Even though stomach ulcers could be healed by inhibiting gastric acid production , they frequently relapsed , since bacteria and chronic inflammation of the stomach remained .
Dr Marshall and Dr Warren showed patients could only be properly cured when H. pylori was eradicated from the stomach .
Infected himself
The work produced one of the most radical and important changes in the last 50 years in the perception of a medical condition
Lord May of Oxford
Dr Marshall proved that H. pylori caused gastic inflammation by deliberately infecting himself with the bacterium .
The Nobel citation praises the doctors for their tenacity , and willingness to challenge prevailing dogmas .
" By using technologies generally available they made an irrefutable case that the bacterium H. pylori is causing disease .
" By culturing the bacteria they made them amenable to scientific study . "
It is thought that H. pylori infection can trigger an ulcer by stimulating increased acid production in the stomach , leading to damage to the stomach or intestinal lining .
Lord May of Oxford , President of the Royal Society , said : " The work by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren produced one of the most radical and important changes in the last 50 years in the perception of a medical condition .
" Their results led to the recognition that gastric disorders are infectious diseases , and overturned the previous view that they were physiological illnesses . "
Remember when your dad used to tell you that he had to walk 10 miles to school , uphill , in a blizzard ?
Well , your dad 's got nothing on the kids of China 's Nujiang Great Canyon .
With no money to build a bridge spanning the river that separates their homes from their school , kids as young as 7 strap themselves to a rope tied between two trees and " fly " across the river on a homemade harness - and - pulley system .
It looks like a cross between a thrill ride and a death trap ; in other words , the best kind of thrill ride .
If nothing else , those kids are getting a big set of balls from their education .

" Have you ever been doing something , some lengthy , repetitive , dull task , and found your hands start working all by themselves and your mind begins to wander elsewhere ?
He was like that with videogames .
He was into Buddhism .
I 'm not sure he bought or even understood all of it , but he really liked that whole meditation thing .
He said that when he sat down in front of a television screen , he found that the concentration focused just a small part of his mind , while releasing the rest of it .
So he started meditating while playing Tetris .
It sounded crazy at first , but the more I thought about it , the less dumb it sounded .
I actually tried it out once .
Did n't quite get the hang of it , but I got the point .
" What I did n't get was how meditating made him so darned good at videogames .
I mean , he must have been receiving distilled wisdom of the ancient gamers direct from Buddha or something , ' cause he could beat us at any game .
Even if we ganged up on him .
Quake : he'd walk into a room full of rocket - toting veterans and rail them all to hell .
Walk out without even getting singed .
This probably does n't mean anything to you , does it ? "
" So this one day he got this parcel in the mail , from America .
Said it was the fastest version of Tetris ever created .
He got it customised from one that was already on the market in Japan .
Got a programmer acquaintance to take a look and modify it , take out all the speed restrictions .
This thing would run to the limits of the console 's hardware and beyond .
He was very excited about this .
I knew he was .
Tetris is his favourite game .
' A combination of white - hot concentration and detached bliss ' he said about it once .
Probably trying to be deep . "
" Yeah , I can tell you who the programmer was , but listen , he is n't a suspect here .
I know what happened and I 'm about to tell you , and it was n't his fault .
... All right , all right .
Got a pen ? "
" That 's his number , I forgot his address , but I can find out for you .
It 's in Michigan somewhere .
So my mate was all excited , he cleared an entire weekend , got a whole load of food and drink and settles down on his bean bag to play a single , solid run of one - player Tetris , from Saturday night to as far into Sunday as he could manage .
That 's a hefty whack of gameplay you 've got there . "
" No , it 's not unusual .
He 's done forty - eight hour stints before now . "
" Well I decided to sleep through the slow early stages , and turned up at his house Sunday morning .
Score was already somewhere in the hundred thousands .
The tetraminoes were moving very fast - thunk , thunk , thunk , pretty rapid , but he was keeping on top of it , he was doing okay .
We had a short conversation , I had some breakfast .
He did n't want to stop playing , so I fed him some fruit and water while he played on . "
" No , at the time I did n't see anything unusual .
That was about ten in the morning .
By noon the blocks were going thunk - thunk - thunk - thunk , three or four a second .
I was having difficulty following the blocks as they fell .
Certainly I could n't see how he was keeping one eye on the current block and another to see what the next one was .
His hands were jittering about the joypad too fast to follow .
He was n't responding to questions until I repeated them two or three times .
Obviously his concentration was being eaten up .
After he got half a million points I stopped asking him questions , so he could keep his concentration .
Sat behind him eating popcorn .
" By one o'clock Sunday afternoon , he was landing something like ten blocks a second .
Thunkthunkthunkthunkthunk , I could n't understand how he was even seeing individual blocks , let alone moving his hands fast enough .
I thought he might have got himself a customised , ultrasensitive joypad , meaning he only has to twitch his fingers very slightly to activate the buttons .
The screen was a blur .
I could just about make out individual states in the playing field as they went past , and I could tell that despite the pressure he was still getting Tetrises . "
" You know , when you drop the four - by - one down the side and get four rows at once ?
So by this stage I figured he was pretty near the end , so I cued up the videotape and started recording .
I went upstairs and got his camcorder too , so I could film him playing live .
Yeah , that film .
Did you see the point where I went in for a close - up of his eyes ? "
" Yeah . "
" Do n't ask me .
I have n't a clue .
All I know is , by this time his score meter was a permanent blur .
He kept going .
The blocks went faster .
The sound of them falling accelerated until it was like a continuous rumble , then a whirr , then a whine .
By this time , the blocks are falling about as fast as the processor can handle ...
The game , I then realised , had been reprogrammed to handle this .
First it cut out the 3D animated backdrops .
Gradually it started cutting out visual effects and sound effects and backdrops until there was nothing but monochrome lines , rising and falling like a graphic equalizer .
No sound effects , the only sound in the room was the sound of his fingers on the pad .
" At five in the afternoon , the tape I 'd shoved in the VCR ran out .
He was still playing so I stuck a new one in .
It was obvious to me by now that he was in some kind of trance .
He was playing far beyond anything I 'd ever seen before .
The framerate on the screen topped out at about 60 Hz .
I watched the score skyrocket and figured that he was landing at least five blocks a frame , which , even if I bought the rest , was categorically impossible .
By this time I was definitely starting to realise that something was up .
Something I 've not met before . "
" I did n't really know what I was expecting to happen .
I do n't know that much about deep meditation .
For the record , I certainly did n't know there was any risk involved . "
" So six o'clock comes and he thunders towards the one million mark .
I 've still got the camcorder running , to catch the momentous score on tape .
Did I say that the world record was only about five hundred and ten kay ?
One million flashes past .
Forty - five seconds later the thing which nobody ever , EVER thought possible happens .
The score tops out , at one million , forty - eight thousand , five hundred and seventy - five lines .
The game freezes , locks up solid , and so does my mate . "
" No , I was nowhere near him .
You can watch the tape .
I was holding the camcorder .
I had him and the screen in line of sight the entire time , you can see I never touched him while he was playing . "
" Well , the first thing I did after he collapsed was roll him off the pad and check his pulse .
Nothing .
Fumbled my phone out of my pocket and I was calling an ambulance within about thirty seconds of the game freezing .
Gave him CPR as best I could - my last lesson was a long , long time ago - but by the time the medics arrived it had already been about eight minutes and he still was n't responding .
I stood back to let them try to jumpstart his heart , but by that time I was beginning to think .
Cogs were whirring . "
" No .
It was n't hunger , it was n't thirst , I kept him topped up the entire time .
There was nothing in the water I gave him .
He was n't anorexic , or diabetic , or epileptic .
He definitely was n't on any drugs .
Not even caffeine .
The post mortem will tell you that .
I did nothing to him , I swear .
The autopsy will tell you all of this . "
" Listen to me .
You asked me to tell you what happened , and I 'm telling you what I think happened .
He did not die , officer .
He is not DEAD . "
An artist 's rendering of an " air extraction " prototype being developed by Global Research Technologies and Klaus Lackner from Columbia University .
© Global Research Technologies , LLC
Global Research Technologies , LLC ( GRT ) , a technology research and development company , and Klaus Lackner from Columbia University have achieved the successful demonstration of a bold new technology to capture carbon from the air .
The " air extraction " prototype has successfully demonstrated that indeed carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) can be captured from the atmosphere .
This is GRT ’s first step toward a commercially viable air capture device .
This technology debuts at a critical juncture where recent findings of an esteemed array of global experts — including former Vice President Al Gore , Sir Nicholas Stern , and the eminent scientists and practitioners serving on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — have concluded that man-made climate change is indeed upon us .
One of the most critical challenges we face is the dramatically increasing and completely unprecedented level of carbon dioxide in the earth ’s atmosphere .
The air extraction device is one critical solution to help the world reduce dangerous amounts of CO 2 in the air .
The carbon capture technology was developed by GRT and Klaus S. Lackner , a professor at Columbia University ’s Earth Institute and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences .
The Tucson - based technology company began development of the device in 2004 and has recently successfully demonstrated its efficacy .
The air extraction device , in which sorbents capture carbon dioxide molecules from free - flowing air and release those molecules as a pure stream of carbon dioxide for sequestration , has met a wide range of performance standards in the GRT research facility .
" This is an exciting step toward making carbon capture and sequestration a viable technology , " said Lackner .
" I have long believed science and industry have the technological capability to design systems that will capture greenhouse gases and allow us to transition to energies of the future over the long term . "
The GRT ’s demonstration could have far - reaching consequences for the battle to reduce greenhouse gas levels .
Unlike other techniques , such as carbon capture and storage from power plants , air extraction would allow reductions to take place irrespective of where carbon emissions occur , enabling active management of global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels .
The technology shows , for the first time , that carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles on the streets of Bangkok could be removed from the atmosphere by devices located in Iceland .
This could present a solution to three problems that until now have posed intractable obstacles for advocates of greenhouse gas reduction : how to deal with the millions of vehicles that together represent over 20 percent of global CO 2 emissions , how to manage the emissions from existing infrastructure , and how to connect the sources of carbon to the sites of carbon disposal .
" This significant achievement holds incredible promise in the fight against climate change , " said Jeffrey D. Sachs , director of The Earth Institute , " and thanks to the ingenuity of GRT and Klaus Lackner , the world may , sooner rather than later , have an important tool in this fight . "
A device with an opening of one square meter can extract about 10 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year .
If a single device were to measure 10 meters by 10 meters it could extract 1,000 tons each year .
On this scale , one million devices would be required to remove one billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
According to the U.K.
Treasury ’s Stern Review on climate change , the world will need to reduce carbon emissions by 11 billion tons by 2025 in order to maintain a concentration of carbon dioxide at twice pre-industrial levels .
Experts have long highlighted the potential of air extraction , arguing that it could have a vastly greater impact than the renewable energy sources that currently operate on a small scale .
To date , however , the transport sector has resisted many carbon - reducing technologies .
Although carbon capture is possible at power plants through flue - gas scrubbing , designing millions of cars , trucks , and trains to capture CO 2 from their exhaust streams is simply not practical .
Hauling a " trailer " behind every passenger car to collect exhaust emissions would exacerbate traffic congestion , reduce gasoline mileage and increase fuel consumption .
Simply put , CO 2 emissions from the transportation sector are going to end up in the atmosphere and can only be removed from the atmosphere with a device like the one GRT has developed .
Air capture devices are small and require much less land area than the wind mills that would be needed to offset an equal amount of CO 2 emission .
Indeed , if the CO 2 carried by the air streams used to drive wind mills were to be captured , then on an energy equivalent basis , the CO 2 capture would reduce emissions hundred times more than a wind mill of equal sweep area .
Like wind turbines , the GRT devices would be deployed in coordinated formations , but would extract the air ’s carbon dioxide , not its kinetic energy .
A major challenge facing scientists working to extract and sequester carbon from the atmosphere has been the fact that it is too expensive to re-outfit many of the world ’s existing power plants to make them more eco-friendly .
In general , building new technologies is easier and cheaper than adding retrofits to existing infrastructure .
Another exciting benefit of the GRT device is that it faces down this challenge by capturing the emissions from existing power plants without imposing retrofit costs .
Air capture offers a third important benefit .
The CO 2 capture device can be located at the point of CO 2 end - use or sequestration , eliminating the current need to match CO 2 sources with sinks .
For example , the CO 2 originating from all those vehicles in Bangkok can be captured in an oil field in Alberta , Canada , where it could be used on - site for enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) operations or it could be captured in South Africa to feed a growing demand in that country for feed stocks for petrochemical production .
If the goal is to sequester a given quantity of CO 2 in a specific geological formation , the air capture system could be located at that physical location .
Within the United States , formations in Ohio , Oklahoma and Michigan , among other sites , appear to hold promise for long - term CO 2 storage underground .
Air extraction could also offer a new window in negotiations between developed and developing countries over how to deploy carbon reducing technologies .
Going forward , GRT plans to begin demonstrating its air capture system on a larger scale .
Extensive deployment of the GRT air capture system makes it possible to envision an actual reduction of CO2 levels in the atmosphere , perhaps even to pre-industrial levels .
That is the exciting promise of air capture and precisely what has just been demonstrated by GRT .

News , hints , tips , and trivia to perq up your day
Yesterday , however , brought the news that Castro was undergoing surgery for intestinal bleeding , and " temporarily delegating " power to his brother Raul , who is a sprightly 75 .
All over the island there will be frenzied talk about a subject that amounts to a national obsession : with intimations of Fidel 's mortality , which way might his beloved " battle of ideas " go now ?
Towards the end of the 90s , there was talk of a subtle progress towards a managed kind of market economy , heralded by an embrace of joint ventures with foreign companies and a new liberal attitude to small businesses , like the paladares : restaurants that can remain in private hands as long as - and how's this for beautifully communist logic ?
- they have no more than 12 tables .
With an influx of money from Venezuela and China , however , the door to private enterprise has slammed shut .
Moreover , it is guarded by a breed of young apparatchiks , devoted to the party line and reportedly set on the approach known locally as " safeguarding the achievements of the revolution " .
So , as and when Castro exits , will the Cuban people let loose a bottled - up liberalising instinct and bang up against the Caribbean 's equivalent of the Red Guards ?
Could the ensuing clash snuff out the power of the hardline Castro-ites and finally open the economy for the US corporations that are presumably rubbing their hands already ?
Or might pragmatic minds - such as Carlos Lage Davila , the 55 - year - old de facto prime minister and architect of Cuba 's abortive flirtation with capitalism - shove dogma to one side , embrace the less threatening aspects of the free market , and nudge Cuba towards the kind of old - fashioned mixed economy that seems to be taking root in the countries with which Castro currently aligns himself - chiefly , Venezuela and Bolivia ?
One thing should certainly be kept in mind .
Cuba may look forlorn , all peeling buildings and pockmarked roads .
Its economy may have long since tumbled into creaking anarchy .
But unlike the old states of eastern Europe , the revolution has a few genuine jewels to defend : chiefly , its education system , and globally acclaimed healthcare .
I travelled to Cuba to make a film for Newsnight 's new series , The World 's Best Public Services .
We spent four days in Havana exploring a health system that emphasises preventive care , locks doctors into their local populations and is built around a simplicity from which the NHS would do well to learn .
Cuba has an average life expectancy of 77.3 against the US 's 77.4 .
The rates of infant mortality are similarly close .
The respective health spends , however , underline the Cuban miracle : in the US , the annual figure per head is $ 5,711 ; in Cuba , it 's $ 251 .
Gazing into the post - Castro future , few would deny the imperative for fair elections , press freedom , and the kind of liberalisation that would free up the initiative and ambition that currently finds its outlet in the country 's labyrinthine black market .
There is , however , one caveat .
As I discovered when I spoke to trainee doctors , dental patients and expectant mothers , anyone who would let loose a free - market hurricane and sweep away Castro 's public services would be in deep , deep trouble .
As the president goes under the knife , it is that thought that may be keeping his more enlightened supporters calm .

はてブで lighty のブログがあることを知ってブログを見てみました。lighty の中の人が書いてます 。
ナント、lighty 1.5 系が pre release されているではありませんか ！
なんでも 、1.5 系は いままでより 80 % のスループット向上が見込めると書かれています。激速の lighty が更に高速になるってわけですよ 。Σ( ﾟДﾟ；
- スポンサーリンク -
Using Async IO allows lighttpd it overlap file - operations .
We send a IO - request for the file and get notified when it is ready .
Instead of waiting for the file ( as in the normal sendfile ( ) ) and blocking the server , we can handle other requests instead .
On the other side we give the kernel to reorder the file - requests as it wants to .
Taking this two improments we can increase the throughput by 80 % .
On the other side we do n’t spend any time in wait in lighty itself .
64 kernel threads are handling the read ( ) - calls for us in the background which increases the idle - time from 12 % to 40 % , a improvement of 230 % .
高速化のキモは Async IO on Linux っていう kernel 2.6.9 以降の機能（libaio）にあるらしく、RedHat の libaio の説明によれば 、
Linuxネイティブの非同期I/O機構（「async I/O」、または「 aio」）は、単純な POSIX の非同期I/O機構よりも豊富なAPIと機能セットを備えています。
このライブラリ、libaioは、非同期I/O用のLinuxネイティブなAPIを提供するものです。
POSIXの非同期I/O機構は、カーネルによる高速な非同期I/O機能を提供するためにこのライブラリを必要とし、またLinuxネイティブの非同期I/O APIを要求するアプリケーションの場合も同様です。
とあります。ちなみに 、Oracle 10g でも libaio で非同期 I/O の仕組みを使って I/O 周りの高速化を図っています。（インストール時に libaio が入ってないとエラーになる。 ）
libaio についてのより詳しい情報は、 「 Kernel Asynchronous I/O ( AIO ) Support for Linux 」 に記載されています 。
まぁ、取りあえず kernel 2.6 系を使っているならば、
yum install libaio
とでもして、最新の libaio を入れておいて損はないかと思われます。lighty 1.5 系のインストールにも必須ですし。
で、最終的に 、「 PRE-RELEASE : lighttpd-1.5.0-r1435.tar.gz 」ってエントリーから tar - ball をダウンロードしてインストールしようとしたら、1.5 系ではその他にも大幅に変更がある模様。
What works and what does n’t ?
・mod_fastcgi , mod_cgi , mod_scgi , mod_proxy are removed
・mod_proxy_core is the replace for the above plugins
・ you have to spawn fastcgi processes with spawn - fcgi
・mod_cml is removed and mod_magnet is n’t included yet
fastcgi まわりが変わるみたいなので、開発環境でも作らないと気軽には試せないっすね。ベンチマークでは 512 Kb 以上の大きなファイルのスループットを計測してるのですが、小さなコンテンツを大量に返す場合のスループットを計測しなきゃと思う次第。
全体的に見て、遅くなる要素がなさそうなので動作検証がとれたら、自宅サーバをとっとと
1.5 系に乗り換えようと思ってます。
あぁ、あと、 「 mod - proxy - core and SQF 」 に書いてある、ロードバランスの機能がすごく気になりますね。Apache 2.2 系の mod_proxy_balancer あたりの影響受けてる？
調べることがいっぱいだ・・・

Amanda Baggs is a young woman with autism and she ’s created a powerful and articulate video that ‘ translates ’ from her world of environmental interaction to the neurotypical form of speech and perception .
As well as a stunning view into how she experiences and makes sense of the world , it ’s also a forceful philosophical argument concerning how the mainstream understands people who do n’t think or communicate in a conventional way .
Presumably speech - less ( either through choice or development ) , Baggs communicates to the viewer using a voice synthesiser and on - screen text .
She has also put many of her medical notes online , sharpening the contrast between our assumptions about autism , and the message she deftly communicates .
Well worth watching to the end .
A profound and exciting insight into an alternative humanity .

Hello .
I ’m a loyal reader / commenter who would like to remain anonymous .
I ’ve noticed a trend in recent guest posts , i.e. many people have submitted guest posts seeking advice .
I ’m hoping I can have the opportunity to get your advice , as I desparately need it .
I am a temple recommend holding , completely active , ultra - devout member of the Church .
I ’m a young single adult who is fresh out of college .
I should be loving life , but I ca n’t stand to be around myself .
Why , you ask ?
Because I feel dirty .
I feel like a whore .
A big whore .
Crass as this may sound , I do n’t know how much longer I ’ll be able to hold out .
To be blunt , I want to have sex .
Bad .
Really , really , bad .
I am so sexually frustrated that I could literally scream–and I almost did the other night when I was driving home from work .
I ’ve tried to get to the root of the problem .
I ’ve done everything I could think of to do .
I ’ve read “ The Miracle of Forgiveness . ” I go to church , read the scriptures , pray , all those Sunday School answers .
I serve in my calling .
I try to cut myself off from “ exciting ” material .
Heck , I hardly watch ANY TV , movies , or anything else , much less anything else .
I work long hours , and at work we listen to Elevator Music , so there ’s not much potential for excitement there , either .
It also does n’t help that I ’ve had zero opportunities for tension release .
I have n’t even been kissed , nor have I really held hands / cuddled / had any other forms of appropriate physical contact .
My dates are few , far between , and horribly disappointing .
I ’m deathly afraid that I ’ll fall into a quickie marriage because I ’m so out of control horny that a guy might ask me and I ’d think “ all right !
Here ’s someone I can do it with ” and jump on the chance without thinking about whether or not he ’d actually make a good eternal companion .
I do n’t even know where to begin to get help .
There ’s the classic suggestion of praying .
God knows I ’ve tried , and God especially knows I want to .
But it ’s difficult to say , “ please God make me less horny so I do n’t go out of control and defile one of your sons with my lust . ”
I have actually prayed that God would just let me get married so I could just relax .
I know that ’s not a sin to have a sex drive .
I know that if I do n’t act on it , I ’m still obeying the law of chastity .
I know there ’s more to life than sex .
But it ’s hard to feel good / pure / clean when I just want to get it on ALL THE TIME .
I really truly do n’t know what to do .
There ’s only two things I know for sure .
One is that I need help .
Advice .
Suggestions .
DESPARATELY .
The other thing that I know for sure is that it ’s only going to get worse .
A lot worse .
More friends of mine are getting married , and therefore getting that which I so deeply crave .
Added to the ranks of the engaged is my teenage sister .
She ’s only seventeen , but she ’s getting married next summer .
While the age factor is troubling , my parents are behind it 100 % because my sister and her boyfriend have absolutely no qualms with saying –sometimes not so subtly –that they just plain ca n’t wait to do it .
And it ’s better to marry than to burn .
So now I ’m faced with the ever - present knowledge that my youngest sister will ( relatively ) soon get what I want while I continue to be denied .
And I ’m going to have to hear , over and over again , about how the wedding CAN ’T be postponed because if it is , they wo n’t be virgins when they tie the knot .
And I have to watch them cuddle and touch while I can’t even get kissed .
I know it ’s wrong to whine , but it all seems so unfair .
I ’ve always tried so damn hard to be good .
It ’s so completely unfair that I should be trapped in this most cruel of ironies : that it ’s when I ’m trying hardest to be a good girl that I feel so despicably bad .
HELP ME PLEASE !!!
" We find that the successful assassination of autocrats produces institutional change - substantially raising the probability that a country transitions to democracy , " say the American economists Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olkin in a paper published yesterday by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
George Bush , Tony Blair and John Howard might have had the right idea in trying to obliterate Saddam by bombarding his palace on the eve of the Iraq war .
Their problem , or Iraq 's problem , is they missed .
Like so many idealists , they stumbled in the execution .
The Benjamins show in Hit and Miss ?
The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War that failed assassination attempts reduce the prospects of democracy , as gauged against a governance index called Polity IV .
" The successful assassination of an autocrat creates a highly significant 13 - percentage point increase in the probability of democratic transition , compared to the case where the assassination attempt failed , " they say .
The assassination gap is even greater , at 19 per cent , if democracy is defined simply by the nature of subsequent leadership transitions .
And political assassinations have always worked better with bullets than bombs , as our well - intended leaders should have known .
Idi Amin survived when a hand grenade bounced off his chest ( killing several bystanders ) but John F. Kennedy was felled by a bullet from 80 metres .
Democracy is more likely to be imposed through the barrel of a pistol than dropped from a stealth bomber - no matter how smart the bombs .
Explosive devices have succeeded in just 7 per cent of assassination attempts , while guns have a strike rate of 30 per cent .
Viewed through the democracy prism , the lives and deaths of 2440 world leaders over 130 years show that trying to kill dictators , on average , has not been worth the trouble .
" Since failures are much more likely than successes , the modest effects of failure and the ( less likely but larger ) effects of success tend to offset each other , " the authors say .
Assassinations , successful or otherwise , do not affect the likelihood of war .
But knocking off a dictator will tend to exacerbate a small , existing conflict - and yet hasten the end of a full - scale war .
The econometric innovation in Hit and Miss is that by tabulating assassination attempts , as well as successes , the researchers create a " natural experiment " that can identify causation as well as correlation .
The paper shows the frequency of assassinations is now at a historical high - but that is because new micro-countries are mushrooming everywhere , spawning more leaders .
For the average leader , the risk has fallen from about 1 per cent to 0.3 per cent since 1910 .
Risks are much greater for autocrats than democrats ( three strikes for the Dominican Republic ) .
Among democratic countries , the larger the population the higher the death rate ( Kennedy , Lincoln , McKinley and Garfield in the US ) .
Dr Olken , the report 's co-author , is a student of the " Great Man " theory of history .
He already knew that the death of a dictator tends to have a large effect on economic growth , for better and for worse , while the death of a democratic leader does nothing .
Hit and Miss shows that assassinating democratic leaders makes no difference to the evolution of a political regime , either .
It all goes to show , he says , that " if you want to make a difference , be an autocrat " .
No surprise here really .
The loyal Bushies were lying earlier this year .
We were told the Bush team would follow the law and obtain warrants when spying on Americans .
Wrong .
Instead , they 'll keep breaking the law if they want to .
Lying lawbreakers , that 's who is running our country :
Senior Bush administration officials told Congress on Tuesday that they could not pledge that the administration would continue to seek warrants from a secret court for a domestic wiretapping program , as it agreed to do in January .
Rather , they argued that the president had the constitutional authority to decide for himself whether to conduct surveillance without warrants .
As a result of the January agreement , the administration said that the National Security Agency ’s domestic spying program has been brought under the legal structure laid out in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires court - approved warrants for the wiretapping of American citizens and others inside the United States .
But on Tuesday , the senior officials , including Michael McConnell , the new director of national intelligence , said they believed that the president still had the authority under Article II of the Constitution to once again order the N.S.A. to conduct surveillance inside the country without warrants .
George Bush does n't have the authority to break the law .
He just thinks he does .
Not surprisingly , the House of Representatives today passed a bill that would give the District of Columbia voting representation in Congress :
The House today passed legislation to give the District a full seat in Congress , marking the biggest victory in nearly three decades in the city ’s quest for voting rights .
Members voted 241 to 177 for the measure , a political compromise that would add two seats to the House : one for the heavily Democratic District , and the other for the state next in line for an additional representative .
Currently , that state is Republican - leaning Utah .
Later , in a companion bill , they voted 216 to 203 to pay for creation of the two seats .
“ This legislation corrects a serious flaw in our democracy , ” declared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
Democrats managed to steer through the bill a month after having to suddenly pull it from the floor .
Last month , House Republicans tried to attach language overturning the District ’s strict anti-gun laws , forcing Democrats into retreat .
This time , the Democrats fashioned the bill in a way to prevent the Republicans from offering similar amendments .
The legislation still faces major hurdles .
Democrats do not appear to have enough votes to avoid a filibuster in the Senate .
And , if it clears that chamber , the White House has threatened a veto .
With the exception of persons such as Tom Davis , my Congressman I am embarressed to admit , who not only voted for the bill but was it ’s chief sponsor , the GOP leadership fought the good fight on this one :
The House Republican leadership strongly opposed the bill , saying it violates the constitutional requirement that representatives come from states .
“ This legislation was constitutionally suspect last month , and it is constitutionally suspect today , ” said Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) .
Many Republicans said they were not against voting rights for D.C. residents but believed that the best way to provide them was through a constitutional amendment or by ceding much of the District back to Maryland .
“ There are ways these individuals can receive representation without trampling on the Constitution , ” said Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R - Va . ) .
Some Republicans have also charged that Democrats will use it as a mechanism to eventually gain two D.C. Senate seats .
And we all know that this is the next step .
My opposition to this bill has been for one simple reason —- Davis , the Democrats , and the District are all ignoring the Constitution and trying to use this legislation as a means to circumvent the Amendment process , where they know they could not succeed .
The bill is unconstitutional on its face , and Davis and the Democrats deserve condemnation for even proposing it .
Hopefully , it will die in the Senate or , if not there , on the President ’s desk .

SOMETIMES when the earth shudders it does n’t make a sound .
That ’s what happened in Harrisburg , Pa. , recently .
On April 30 , a state Superior Court panel ruled that a child can have three legal parents .
The case , Jacob v. Shultz - Jacob , involved two lesbians who were the legal co-parents of two children conceived with sperm donated by a friend .
The panel held that the sperm donor and both women were all liable for child support .
Arthur S. Leonard , a professor at New York Law School , observed , “ I ’m unaware of any other state appellate court that has found that a child has , simultaneously , three adults who are financially obligated to the child ’s support and are also entitled to visitation . ”
The case follows a similar decision handed down by a provincial court in Ontario in January .
In what appeared to be the first such ruling in any Western nation , the court ruled that a boy can legally have three parents .
In that case the biological mother and father had parental rights and wished for the biological mother ’s lesbian partner , who functions as the boy ’s second mother , to have such rights as well .
The idea of assigning children three legal parents is not limited to North America .
In 2005 , expert commissions in Australia and New Zealand proposed that sperm or egg donors be allowed to “ opt in ” as a child ’s third parent .
That same year , scientists in Britain received state permission to create an embryo from the DNA of three adults , raising the real possibility that they all could be granted equal legal claims to the child if the embryo developed to term .
First , from me to Tapper at his home email address ( do n't ask how I got it - let 's just say that not everyone at ABC is happy with their right - wing tilt ) :
Mr. Tapper , My name is Mike Stark .
I 'm a fairly prominent blogger , activist and media gadfly .
If you google my name , you 'll get an idea of the type of things I 've worked on .
Anyway , a DailyKos diarist got in touch with me regarding your blog , " Political Punch " .
His concern was that in your post regarding " Air Pelosi " , you or your moderators refused to post his comment which included the press release issued by the House Sergeant At Arms - a press release which deflated the entire story and undermined the misleading nature your post .
After receiving that email , I went to the post in question and attempted to post the press release myself .
It did not appear on the blog .
So , I was wondering if you could answer some questions for me .
Do you moderate your own blog , and if not , who does ?
What is the criteria for determining what blog comments will be allowed ?
What is the overall purpose of the blog ?
Does it have an agenda ?
Is there a specific reason a comment containing a press release - that completed the picture and brought more " news " to ABC 's readers that would have allowed for more complete contextualization - was not approved ?
Best ,
Mike Stark
Tapper 's response :
mr stark i do n't moderate the comments , i do n't know anything about them until they 're posted .
there are certainly lots of posts from the left and right critical of my work and that of abc news , so i'm surprised to hear your complaint .
why do n't you email my work account - [ stricken , ed ] - with what you tried to post and i will forward to the dot - com people and ask what happened .
jt

Thank you ,
Mike Stark
Tapper to me :
There was nothing misleading about my blog entry
But I will inquire about the posting situation .
Me to Tapper :
It 's often astounding to me that some folks in the media elite seem to be uninterested in criticism of their work .
I understand that you folks are in a profession that draws an outrageous amount of criticism and if you paid attention to all of it , you 'd do nothing else .
That said , 10 minutes a day checking MediaMatters.com and , say , Bozell 's Media watchdog group would do each and every one of you a world of good without introducing a bunch of distracting chaff .
This is why your post was misleading :
You wrote : So .... THE BROUHAHA about the request by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , to use a larger military plane than the one afforded her predecessor , perhaps even a large luxurious C - 32 , But the Press release reads : For Immediate Release February 8 , 2007 As the Sergeant at Arms , I have the responsibility to ensure the security of the members of the House of Representatives , to include the Speaker of the House .
The Speaker requires additional precautions due to her responsibilities as the leader of the House and her Constitutional position as second in the line of succession to the presidency .
In a post 9/11 threat environment , it is reasonable and prudent to provide military aircraft to the Speaker for official travel between Washington and her district .
The practice began with Speaker Hastert and I have recommended that it continue with Speaker Pelosi .
The fact that Speaker Pelosi lives in California compelled me to request an aircraft that is capable of making non-stop flights for security purposes , unless such an aircraft is unavailable .
This will ensure communications capabilities and also enhance security .
I made the recommendation to use military aircraft based upon the need to provide necessary levels of security for ranking national leaders , such as the Speaker .
I regret that an issue that is exclusively considered and decided in a security context has evolved into a political issue .
This was clearly a case of a media story that was " juicy " to tell , facts be damned .
In fact , I laughed out loud when I saw this paragraph in your regular news report : On Feb. 1 , unnamed administration and congressional sources leaked to the Washington Times that Pelosi was " seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff but also for relatives and for other members of the California delegation .
A knowledgeable source called the request ' carte blanche for an aircraft any time . "
ABC now relies on news gathering by the Moonie Times .
How far you 've fallen ...
And to be clear , Mr. Tapper , I am not blaming you singularly .
I understand how conventional wisdom and group - reporting can lead to reporting and a blog post like this .
It is n't right though .
The Drudge to Moonies to Fox to ABC conduit has to be severed .
Halperin be damned , it 's not good for your industry .
Further , with competing interests and WWW3 on its way , your continued marginalization of yourselves by relying on this facts - be - damned , if it 's fun , it runs kind of news dynamic will result in the continuance of your vanishing ratings .
There 's a reason people do n't watch much news anymore - if it 's not news , they 've go tbetter things to do .
Best ,
Mike Stark
So ... I was a nice guy about it .
I did n't go through his entire blog and point out that 9 out of 10 posts bash Democrats - even though it 's true .
I did n't personally insult the man or besmirch his character ...
I simply raised some concerns - and even offered a suggestion that I 'd really like to see him follow - go to MediaMatters.org for 5 minutes a day .
Then visit Bozo 's media watchdog group .
It 'd truly be an eye opening experience for him and others in the media to compare the difference in the criticisms they receive from each side .
Which criticism is substantial , which is media hate for media hate 's sake ?
Anyway , you might think he'd take the email in stride .
Maybe even give it a little professional thought .
Or maybe he'd be a snippy and petulant elitist reporter that felt a little singed by a dirty fucking blogger and recoiled from the thought .
You be the judge .
This is his response :
I said I would look into the posting situation for you .
Please stop emailing me .
Well , needless to say , he did n't mention that he also wrote that his blog post was not misleading .
He did n't give an inch with regards to being totally fucking wrong .
But that 's our media .
Time and time again , that 's our media .
The e-mail system did not contain classified information
The e-mail system did not contain classified information relating to military operations , a spokesman said .
The Pentagon says it rebuffs hundreds of attempted attacks on its computer systems each day .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said that a " variety of precautionary measures " were being taken .
" Elements of the ... unclassified email system were taken offline yesterday afternoon due to a detected penetration , " Mr Gates said .
He said it was expected that the system would be online again very soon .
Few details were available about the exact nature of the attack .
A Pentagon spokesman said attacks could come from a variety of sources including : " recreational hackers , self - styled cyber- vigilantes , various groups with nationalistic and ideological agendas , trans- national actors and nation - states . "
Officials would not say whether the hacker was able to read e-mails sent on the system .
Asked if his own e-mail account was affected , Mr Gates said : " I do n't do e-mail .
I 'm a low - tech person . "
16 Bit vs. 24 Bit Audio
Discussion of the mysteries behind bit - depth ,
sample rates and sound quality
by Tweak
T his article is going to be kept as simple as possible .
It 's just designed to get the new person up to speed on the issues and provide a strong sense of perspective on what really matters .
We are going to talk about bit depth and sample rates , how these translate into storage requirements , and then talk about the subjective differences between the two methods of recording your music .
In short , what is the relation of 24 bit recordings to the " sound quality " we all want .
Never refer to 16 - bit or 24 bit audio as the " bit rate " .
Its properly called the bit depth and the pros will be so irked they 'll have to correct you .
When I first ventured into digital audio , it was a much simpler world .
Products that recorded and generated digital audio were all 16 bit .
Compact discs , the main method for music distribution , has digital audio that has a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1 kHz .
Gradually , products began to appear with a higher bit depth -- an 18 bit drum machine , 20 , then 24 bit effects processors .
Then recorders made the leap to 24 bit .
Today , your audio interface is probably 24 bit and allows you to select sample rate of your choice , 44.1 , 48 , 88.2 , 96 and even 192 khz .
Multi track recorders vary between 16/44.1 and 24/96 .
When you buy one you have to decide which way to go and get it right the first time .
So what do all these number mean and how important are they ?
That 's where we are going to go .
First , you have to have these definitions under control .
First of all , know that we are talking about data .
Ones and zeros .
That is what we are creating , folks !
Its all a game of numbers .
hat we are doing is putting the numbers into a format that sounds good .
Bit Depth refers to the number of bits you have to capture audio .
The easiest way to envision this is as a series of levels , that audio energy can be sliced at any given moment in time .
With 16 bit audio , there are 65,536 possible levels .
With every bit of greater resolution , the number of levels double .
By the time we get to 24 bit , we actually have 16,777,216 levels .
Remember we are talking about a slice of audio frozen in a single moment of time .
Now lets add our friend Time into the picture .
That 's where we get into the Sample Rate .
The sample rate is the number of times your audio is measured ( sampled ) per second .
So at the red book standard for CDs , the sample rate is 44.1 kHz or 44,100 slices every second .
So what is the 96 khz sample rate ?
You guessed it .
It 's 96,000 slices of audio sampled each second .
So lets put it all together now .
This brings us to the Bit Rate , or how much data per second is required to transmit the file , which can then be translated into how big the file is .
Your CD is 16 bit , 44.1 so that is 44,100 slices , each having 65,536 levels .
A new Audio interface may record 96,000 slices a second at nearly 17 million levels for every slice .
If you think that is a lot of data , well , you are right , it certainly is .
The Bit Rate is usually expressed in Mbit / sec .
But you do n't need to do all this math .
I 'm going to do it for you .
This is not an important area in the recording process to get sidetracked on .
What is important for you is how this translates to your hard drive storage .
Space required for of stereo digital audio
Bit Depth Sample Rate Bit Rate File
Size of one stereo minute
File size of a three minute song 16 44,100 1.35 Mbit/ sec 10.1 megabytes 30.3 megabytes 16 48,000 1.46 Mbit/ sec 11.0 megabytes 33 megabytes 24 96,000 4.39 Mbit / sec 33.0 megabytes 99 megabytes mp3 file 128 k / bit rate 0.13 Mbit / Sec 0.94 megabytes 2.82 megabytes
So you see how recording at 24/96 more than triples your file size .
Lets take a 3 minute multi- track song and add up the numbers .
Just to put the above into greater relief , I included the standard MP3 file 's spec .
Hard disk requirements for a multi- track 3 minute song
Bit depth / sample rate number of mono tracks size per mono track size per song songs per 20 gigabyte hard disk songs per 200 gigabyte hard disk 16/44.1 8 15.1 megs 121 megs 164 1640 16/48 8 16.5megs 132 megs 150 1500 24/96 8 49.5 megs 396 megs 50 500 16/44.1 16 15.1 megs 242megs 82 820 16/48 16 16.5 megs 264 megs 74 740 24/96 16 49.5 megs 792 megs 24 240
Note that these size do not count any out takes you may have recorded but did n't delete and they assume a linear recording method from beginning to end of the song for every track .
They also do n't account for hard disk sector size which will leave a lot of space on the drive empty .
Real world mileage may vary .
So you should be noting two things now :
1. Recording at 24/96 yields greatly increased audio resolution - over 250 times that at 16/44.1
2. Recording at 24/96 takes up roughly 3 1/4 times the space than recording at 16/44.1
End of technical discussion .
Are you still with me ?
Lets get into the thick of it .
Should you record at a high Bit Depth and Sample Rate ?
Now lets get to the subjective side of how music sounds at these different bit depths and sample rates .
No one can really quantify how much better a song is going to sound recorded at 24/96 .
Just because a 24/96 file has 250 times the audio resolution does not mean it will sound 250 times better ; it wo n't even sound twice the quality .
In truth , your non-musically inclined friends may not even notice the difference .
You probably will , but do n't expect anything dramatic .
Can you hear the difference between an MP3 and a wave file ?
If so , you will probably hear the difference between different sample rates .
For example , the difference between 22.05 kHz and 44.1 kHz is very clear to most music lovers .
A trained ear can tell the difference between 32 khz and 44.1 .
But when 44.1 and 96k Hz are compared it gets real subjective .
But lets try to be a little objective here .
or 32 bit float if available
Lets talk about sample rate and the Nyquist Theory .
This theory is that the actual upper threshold of a piece of digital audio will top out at half the sample rate .
So if you are recording at 44.1 , the highest frequencies generated will be around 22k Hz .
That is 2 khz higher than the typical human with excellent hearing can hear .
Now we get into the real voodoo .
Audiophiles have claimed since the beginning of digital audio that vinyl records on an analog system sound better than digital audio .
Indeed , you can find evidence that analog recording and playback equipment can be measured up to 50 khz , over twice our threshold of hearing .
Here 's the great mystery .
The theory is that audio energy , even though we do n't hear it , exists as has an effect on the lower frequencies we do hear .
Back to the Nyquist theory , a 96 khz sample rate will translate into potential audio output at 48 khz , not too far from the finest analog sound reproduction .
This leads one to surmise that the same principle is at work .
The audio is improved in a threshold we cannot perceive and it makes what we can hear " better " .
Like I said , it 's voodoo .
Advanced class :
What is 32 bit float point processing ?
Most major sequencers and many of the better multi track recorders will render audio temporarily in a 32 bit floating point format .
This should not be confused with 32 bit recording .
Basically , the extra bits are added onto the file after recording to allow generous headroom for audio mathematics in the digital domain .
Before the file is output it will go through the 24 bit converters on your interface .
I think of the " floating point " as a scalable decimal point in a calculation .
Having 32 rather than 24 registers for calculations is going to render a more accurate result .
Its also allows for some calculations that would be theoretically impossible with strings of 24 numbers .
Think of a 16 channel audio mixer summing i.e. , " adding " and matrixing 16 sets of 32 numbers 44,100 times every second .
That 's a lot of math !
Now add in all those nifty plugins doing their math on top of each channel and that super hard brick wall limiter at the end of your chain .
Yo !
We be kickin da numbers dude !
Yet when the data hits the 24 bit converter 8 bits are " truncated " or cut off .
But still , the mathematical result is more accurate .
This is all happening behind your back and you do n't need to think about it .
But should you record at a high sample rate ?
Alright !
Remember now that the sample rate in hugely different than the bit depth .
Its going to depend on who you ask .
Some people say " It 's all going to end up as 44.1 any way " when the cd is burned .
Others will tell you that when an audio interface processes and mixes sounds at 96 kHz the result is better and remains better even after the final conversion to 44.1 .
And just about every other position is taken too .
Some say 16/44.1 is good enough for CD its good enough for me .
Others say do 24/44.1 because it's not that much more space and it increases the signal to noise ratio .
There is one argument that says 24/88.2 is superior to 24/96 because it is an even number conversion going back to 44.1 .
Bit Depth .
Ok , this is the gospel according to Tweak !
Use 24 bit for every recording if you have this feature .
I was a believer for the past decade that 16 bit was the way to go and I have absolutely changed my mind .
No matter of what you are recording this is true .
If you have a nice mic , a very good preamp and a clean audio system and are recording highly dynamic instruments such as acoustic guitars , classical orchestras , acapella vocals , the difference will be there .
But !
Its not that 24 bits of data makes the sound better .
It actually does not .
What is does is give your audio more room to breathe in the numeric realm of digital audio .
Remember , we are talking about numbers , calculations , not analog waveforms .
With 24 bits of data demarcing your recording medium , its is possible to record extremely dynamic music , with very quiet soft passages and extraordinary loud passages .
Quiet passages will be less likely struggling to stay above the noise floor on your system .
One can record with no compression .
You can record at lower levels , with more headroom .
This ensures that the occasional peak is not truncated at the top and it will give converters some room the breathe .
Because you are not pushing the limits of your bandwidth , your instruments will sound clearer , and the vocals may sound " cleaner " , the song will mix better and there will be less noise .
So its not that 24 bit recordings sound better .
In fact they may sound just as bad or worse than 16 bit .
But 24 bits gives the recordist a noise floor and headroom to create an excellent recording .
Its a tool , and in the right hand , it can blow you away , audio wise .
Korg MR1000 1 - Bit 5.6MHz Mobile Recorder

Tweak :
The new DSD format promises to be able to spin off copies of our master recordings at any sample rate .
Read this article by Korg
Regarding the sample rate , unless you have a good reason not to , use a sample rate of 44.1 .
If you are doing audio for video you might want to use 48 khz as many editors only use that rate .
Some kinds of music seem to benefit slightly from the high resolution of 88.2 or 96 khz .
Acoustic instruments , like guitars , percussion , and of course vocals , i.e. , things with delicate high frequencies seem to benefit but its subtle .
Lets say you had a $ 399 audio interface with onboard preamps .
Replacing your preamp and converters with better ones will give you more of a sonic difference at 44.1 that recording at 96 khz will .
Once inside the sequencer , audio files may be converted to 32 bit for processing and converted back to 24 or 16 on the way out .
So , my advice is to record at 24 bits / 44.1 at minimum and go up to a sample rate of 88.2 or 96 if you think your material warrants it ( and you have the disk space . )
What about the 192 khz rate ?
Ok , let me get you to think of how audio interface manufacturers plan to get you to buy their products .
One company comes out with 192 then they all feel they have to or they will lose sales .
Its hype in my opinion .
If you want to fill up hard drives faster , go ahead and use it .
We have debated this long an hard on the forums .
In the end , no one can tell the difference .
So How do we achieve Sound Quality ?
People ask me all the time , and I wince every time they do : " What gear ( fill in the blank ... soundcard , preamp , cable , recorder , sequencer ) will give me the " best " sound quality ? "
I wince because I imagine the person going out , buying a $ 500 preamp and the stick it in their studio and connect the Mic and crestfallenly realize it " sounds the same " " maybe a little better " um , " hard to tell " .
Why the heck is that ?
The main reason is that it is all a big system and it is only as pure as its dirtiest pan pot .
One humming cable can obliterate the gains made by otherwise great sounding gear .
A pristine Mic preamp connected digitally to a soundcard with the jitters will be defeated .
Your whole chain has to pro quality , from preamps , in and out of the converters , into top quality monitors .
But if you do have a great signal chain , even your 16 bit recordings will sound better than 24/96 with average preamps and typical converters and monitors .
Lynx Studio Technology Aurora 16 16 - Channel Digital Audio Converter
The new Aurora line of digital audio converters from Lynx Studio Technology offers unprecedented audio quality and control in single - rack space eight and sixteen channel models .
The Aurora 16 features 192 kHz analog to digital and digital to analog conversion with front panel control of all routing and sample rate options .
Extended functions in Aurora are accessible via computer with the Lynx AES16 or by infrared using compatible laptops and handheld Pocket PCs .
The rear panel has Clock and MIDI In and Out connectors and an LSlot bay , for the optional use of ADAT , Firewire and other audio interfaces .
But lets be real clear : it is not just gear .
It 's technique .
Someone with a $ 2,700 Neumann U87 and a top of the line Great River preamp will still have an awful recording if the Mic is not placed well , or if the room brings out undesirable characteristics .
If you apply to much compression on a vocal while recording its going to sound bad no matter what gear you have .
This is all to say , positively , that when you know how to apply eq , processors and plugins you will be on your way to achieving a mix of high sound quality .
This brings me to the point .
A person who really knows and works with their gear can deliver greater sound quality at 16 bit with lesser gear than a person who just plugs in and goes on top of the line 24/96 recorders .
Technique is as important as gear which is more important than bits and rates .
And there is only one thing more important that technique and gear .
The most important point is saved for last , and I 've said it before , and will again .
Great music recorded on a crappy cassette deck will win more hearts than a turd polished at 24/192 .
Your talent is more important than anything else , and you can't buy that .
So remember to practice , work on your technique , when you can afford to , upgrade your signal path , and then when the pearly gates of Sound Quality open , then consider 24/96 as you would a nice finish on a well - crafted piece of art .
I remain

Tweak 's Articles on Essential Studio Concepts
We 've known for years that color laser printers can embed a series of tiny yellow dots on pages they print .
The dots — almost invisible under normal circumstances — can be used to determine which particular printer produced the image .
Essentially , each printer outputs its own serial number .
This is great for busting counterfeiters but raises all sorts of privacy concerns .
Now , MIT students are getting involved in the campaign against the dots with the new Seeing Yellow project .
Seeing Yellow is the brainchild of MIT 's Computing Culture research group , which " want to preserve the right to anonymous communication by fighting both printing dots and the government bullying used to sustain them . "
The project was conceived after the team received word that an anonymous hacker had called his printer manufacturer to complain and was subsequently visited by the Secret Service , who were curious to know why someone with nothing to hide would want to disable the tracking dots .
The dots ( image courtesy of Seeing Yellow )
Seeing Yellow now encourages waves of people to contact printer manufacturers , enough so that the Secret Service and other government agencies cannot simply single out those who call to complain .
The project is simple : suggest that people call manufacturers , then provide contact information and talking points .
That 's it .
So far , according to the site , 434 people have called .
Not sure if your printer is on the list ?
The EFF has a partial list of dot - printing machines .
The dots are nearly invisible to the naked eye , but Seeing Yellow points out that the easiest way to see them is to shine a blue light on one of the printed pages .
If the dots are there , they will show up as tiny black marks .

Court Raises Question About Census Counts of Prisoners
by TChris
TalkLeft has repeatedly ( e.g. , here , here , and here ) called attention to the Census Bureau 's unfair practice of counting prisoners as residents of the counties in which the prisons that house them are situated .
The practice boosts the population counts of the rural areas in which the prisons are located , which boosts their representation in Congress and state legislatures , and increases their share of government spending .
Rural areas tend to vote Republican , so Republicans have little incentive to change the system .
The good news is that courts may be willing to remedy the problem , even if legislators fail to act .

The dead in Haditha included members of whole families Haditha is an agricultural community of about 90,000 people on the banks of the Euphrates north - west of Baghdad .
It lies in the huge western province of Anbar , which became the heartland of the insurgency after US - led troops invaded Iraq in 2003 .
It was a dangerous place for the US marines who control this part of Iraq - and for the inhabitants , caught between insurgents and American troops .
On the morning of 19 November 2005 , the Subhani neighbourhood was the scene of an event that was then a regular occurrence - a roadside bomb targeting a US patrol .
It killed 20 - year - old Lance Corp Miguel ( " TJ " ) Terrazas , driving one of four Humvee vehicles in the patrol , and injured two other marines .
A simple US military statement hinted at the bloody chain of events that the attack started - though subsequent scrutiny showed it to be far from the truth .
It said : " A US marine and 15 civilians were killed yesterday from the blast of a roadside bomb in Haditha .
" Immediately following the bombing , gunmen attacked the convoy with small arms fire .
Iraqi army soldiers and marines returned fire , killing eight insurgents and wounding another . "
Video footage
The tragedy of Haditha may have been left at that - just another statistic of " war - torn " Iraq - a place too dangerous to be reported properly by journalists , where openness is not in the interests of political and military circles , and the sheer scale of death numbs the senses .
However , the following day a self - styled local journalist and human - rights activist , Taher Thabet al - Hadithi , got his video camera out and filmed scenes that - whatever they were - were not the aftermath of a roadside bombing .
Haditha is considered hostile territory for US marines
The bodies of women and children , still in their nightclothes , apparently shot in their own homes ; interior walls and ceilings peppered with bullet holes ; bloodstains on the floor .
A couple of months later , Mr Hadithi's tape was passed to the US newsmagazine Time , which published an account based on the footage .
The magazine also handed a copy of the tape to US military commanders in Baghdad , who initiated a preliminary investigation .
See differing accounts of Haditha deaths Following their findings , the official version was changed to say that , after the roadside bombing , the 15 civilians had been accidentally shot by marines during a gun fight with insurgents .
Nevertheless , on 9 March 2006 the top US commanders in Baghdad began a criminal investigation , led by the Naval Criminal Investigation Service ( NCIS ) .
On 7 April three officers in charge of troops in Haditha were also stripped of their command and reassigned .
' Pretended to die ' Eyewitness accounts suggest that comrades of TJ Terrazas , far from coming under enemy fire , went on the rampage in Haditha after his death .
A US soldier came in and shot at us , I pretended to be dead and he did n't notice me
Safa Younis
Twelve - year - old Safa Younis appears on video saying she was in one of three houses where troops came in and indiscriminately killed family members .
" They knocked at our front door and my father went to open it .
They shot him dead from behind the door and then they shot him again , " she says in the video .
" Then one American soldier came in and shot at us all .
I pretended to be dead and he did n't notice me . "
There were eight bodies in the house , including Safa 's five siblings , aged between two and 14 .
In another house seven people including a child and his 70 - year - old grandfather were killed .
Four brothers aged 41 to 24 died in a third house .
Eyewitnesses said they were forced into a wardrobe and shot .
In the street , US troops gunned down four students and a taxi driver they had stopped at a roadblock set up after the bombing .
According to a witness , they were shot by the side of the road , as they stood with their hands on their heads .
Trials and inquiries Events in Haditha have been the subject of several official investigations as well as criminal charges against some members of Kilo Company , 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment alleged to have carried out the killings .
Sgt Wuterich was the last man to have murder charges dropped
The alleged ringleader , Sgt Frank Wuterich , 28 , was charged with voluntary manslaughter while L / Cpl Stephen Tatum was changed with involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault .
Murder charges were dismissed against all the marines from Kilo Company , including Sgt Sanick Dela Cruz , who was granted immunity in exchange for giving evidence to the military court .
The defendants have stuck to their initial account , that the dead were either assailants or civilians killed unwittingly in the crossfire .
Their supporters in the US have accused Mr Hadithi of being an insurgent himself , and distorting or actually fabricating the evidence .
Meanwhile , the US - backed Iraqi government launched its own inquiry , saying there was a limit to the " acceptable excuses " by the US military for causing civilian deaths , in this as well as a string of other high - profile cases in Iraq .
A report by the US military in Iraq found that senior marine commanders had been negligent in their failure to properly investigate the Haditha killings , and four officers were initially charged with dereliction and failing to report and investigate the killings .
Two had their charges dismissed by a military court in the US , but Lt Col Jeffrey Chessani became the most senior US serviceman since the Vietnam War to face a court martial for actions in combat .
1 ) Marine Lance Corp Miguel Terrazas dies in attack on US convoy .
2 ) US military initially says bomb also killed 15 Iraqi civilians .
3 ) Eight insurgents killed after attacking convoy .
US later says the 15 civilians were not killed by bomb , but shot accidentally in battle .
1 ) Marine Lance Corp Miguel Terrazas dies in bomb attack on convoy of four Humvees .
Troops then " go on rampage " .
2 ) At roadblock , four students and taxi driver killed .
3 ) Eight people killed in one of three houses .
4 ) Seven killed in a second house .
5 ) Four brothers put in wardrobe and shot dead in a third house .

As you may or may not know , the Kansas GOP has been melting down .
Their former state party chair is now the Lieutenant Governor under Democratic Governor Kathleen Sebelius .
The Attorney General is also a Republican - turned - Democrat who ousted a crazy Republican from that job ... So now you have to sign a loyalty pledge -- no I 'm not kidding

BBC News , Mombasa
Prostitutes are known for their skimpy attire , but Kenya 's coastal port of Mombasa is witnessing a controversial fashion makeover .
The twilight ladies , as the city 's residents refer to the sex workers , have traded their revealing outfits for the more austere buibui - a loose , floor - length gown and head covering favoured by Muslim women .
Walking along the city 's main red - light streets at night , one comes across many of the buibui - clad prostitutes .
The buibui has lost its respect .
I feel so embarrassed
Mariam Salma
Mombasa resident
Although most shy away from speaking to the press , a few are willing to talk .
" I 'm better off wearing the buibui so I look respectable .
I can avoid arrest .
I am just trying to get some money to live on , " one says .
Another claims she wears her buibui to hide her identity .
" I know I am sinning , but I 'm forced to because I am looking for my livelihood .
So to me , it 's acceptable , " she says .
Most of her customers are local men , not tourists .
She says wearing a buibui helped them to more easily pick out women from the region .
But the phenomenon is causing a stir in the predominantly Muslim city where religious women are required to cover their bodies from head to toe .
Some female residents say it is a big disgrace .
" I feel so embarrassed that sometimes I contemplate removing my buibui and throwing it away .
The buibui has lost its respect , " Mariam Salma says .
Another resident , Asha Hussein , claims the sex workers are not native to Mombasa .
" They are not Muslims .
Most are from Somalia and Ethiopia .
They wear it to avoid public humiliation , " she says .
Crackdown
Wearing the buibui not only allows prostitutes to mingle freely with other women , black buibuis allow them to hide under the cover of darkness .
When night falls it is even easier for Mombasa 's prostitutes to hide
City authorities have mounted numerous operations over the years to get prostitutes off the streets , with limited success .
After the crackdowns , the prostitutes go underground for a while , creating the impression that the operation has succeeded , only to emerge later .
The newly adopted attire has ensured their trade is not disrupted .
However , it is not the first time the prostitutes have used this tactic .
It was popular in the 1990s until a religious vigilante organisation illegally rounded up the prostitutes hiding under buibuis and flogged them publicly .
The uniform of prostitutes is well known .
They should stick to their disgraceful attire
Sheikh Muhammad Khalifa
Council of Imams of Kenya
Religious leaders are now urging the government to take action .
" We can not arrest any of these women ; it is the government 's responsibility , " says the organising secretary of the Council of Imams of Kenya , Sheikh Muhammad Khalifa .
" We are saddened because the government is ignoring the problem . "
If the trend continues , police are likely to mistake respectable women for prostitutes , he says .
" For God 's sake , if one has decided to join this profession , the uniform of prostitutes is well known .
" They should stick to their disgraceful attire . "
Mr Brown said the proposals were a ' road map ' for reform
MPs would be given the final say on declaring war and on international treaties and would have a " bigger role " in approving public appointments .
Mr Brown also proposed Commons committees for each English region .
He added that election day could be moved to weekends and said he would create a national security council .
Linked to this he would " regularly publish " a national security strategy .
His proposals - in which he suggested a " bill of rights " could eventually be published after public consultation - were not a " final blueprint " but a " route map " towards change , he said .
Treaties
In his first address to the House of Commons as prime minister , Mr Brown said he would " surrender or limit " powers in 12 areas , including royal prerogatives such as declaring war without parliamentary approval .
KEY PROPOSALS
Give MPs power to decide whether to wage war Setting up national security council Parliament to ratify international treaties Commons committees for each English region New ministerial code PM no longer to choose Church of England bishops Elections moving from Thursday to weekends MPs to hold hearings on key public appointments
People to be consulted on possible ' bill of rights '
Potential lowering of voting age to 16
In full : Brown on constitution Proposals at - a- glance
But this must " never limit our ability to deal with emergencies ... or operational decisions " , he added .
The national security council , set up within government , would " coordinate military , policing , intelligence and diplomatic action and [ attempt ] also to win hearts and minds in this country and round the world " .
Mr Brown also said the prime minister should lose the right to choose Church of England bishops .
He added that MPs would hold US - style confirmation hearings for appointees to important public posts - such as the chief inspector of prisons and the local government ombudsman - and to ratify international treaties .
Mr Brown said he was publishing a new ministerial code , with an adviser appointed to scrutinise ministerial conduct .
' Two classes of MP '
He also suggested the possibility of lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 and changing the laws restricting the right to demonstrate in Parliament Square .
He said : " It 's possible to do more to bring government closer to the people ...
It can be enhanced by devolving more power to the people . "
He rejected the idea of only allowing English MPs to vote on English matters , saying that would create two classes of MPs .
HAVE YOUR SAY A bill of rights might be a good idea .
But if it 's going to last it should n't be too prescriptive
Sara , Edinburgh
Send us your comments Protest laws ' to change '
But Conservative leader David Cameron told MPs : " The British system of government needs real and lasting change . "
He added : " Surely he has to realise he 's been at the heart of a government that , more than any other in living memory , has damaged trust in politics . "
And ex-Tory leader Michael Howard said devolution in Wales and Scotland had already created two classes of MPs .
Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said reform was " long overdue " and called for a full " constitutional convention " to discuss changes .
' Sensible '
Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor Jack Straw will be responsible for seeing through any legislation needed for the changes .
Earlier , he told the BBC : " What we are looking at is sensible ways in which our overall constitutional arrangements can be improved , amended .
" It may sound like something rather technical and anoraky but is fundamentally about what kind of relationship people have with each other , in terms of the rights and responsibilities they have towards each other . "
The Hansard Society think - tank said : " Gordon Brown 's proposed reforms to make Parliament more accountable to the people are a welcome step towards a strengthened Parliament and a more vibrant representative democracy . "
Mr Brown has said a paper on the electoral system will be published at a later stage .
In the past , he has said he is not personally persuaded of the case for proportional representation in Westminster elections but would welcome a debate on reform .
KABUL , Afghanistan -- NATO said yesterday that it killed too many Afghan civilians during fighting last year against resurgent Taliban militants , but that the Western alliance was working to change that in 2007 .
The acknowledgment came one day after President Hamid Karzai 's latest plea for foreign forces to use maximum caution .
" The single thing that we have done wrong and we are striving extremely hard to improve on is killing innocent civilians , " Brigadier Richard E. Nugee , the chief spokesman for NATO 's International Security Assistance Force , told a news conference .
NATO forces were accused of killing dozens of civilians last year in airstrikes , battles , and other shootings , prompting Karzai to issue several pleas for international forces to use greater caution in their operations .
Still , Nugee said NATO forces had killed far fewer civilians than the Taliban , which launched a record number of roadside and suicide bombs last year .
" There is absolutely no comparison to be made , " he said .
" The Taliban are killing significant numbers of their own people and showing no remorse at all . "
Militants launched 117 suicide attacks in 2006 , about a sixfold increase over 2005 , killing 206 Afghan civilians , 54 Afghan security personnel , and 18 NATO soldiers , according to NATO numbers .
Karzai , in a statement Tuesday , expressed " deep regret " over the deaths of two civilians in Nangarhar province a few days earlier .
The Afghan Interior Ministry had said foreign troops were involved , although a NATO spokesman , Major Dominic
Whyte , said no NATO or US - led coalition soldiers were responsible .
" Once again , I urge the Afghan and international forces to ensure greater coordination between themselves and to practice maximum caution during their anti-terrorist operations so that civilians are not harmed , " Karzai said .
NATO airstrikes in the Panjwayi district of southern Kandahar province in October reportedly killed dozens of civilians , including 20 members of one family , according to Afghan authorities .
A joint Afghan - NATO investigation into those airstrikes has never been released .
The New York Times has reported previously that the investigation found that 31 civilians were killed .
After the October airstrikes , Human Rights Watch said NATO was n't doing enough to prevent civilian casualties in Afghanistan .

The False Altruism of Alumni Giving
Can a charitable act truly be called charitable when the contributor wants or expects a reward ?
In a new study , Princeton economics professor Harvey Rosen and Stanford graduate student Jonathan Meer examined this question using a specific case of incentivized charity : alumni donations .
They found that the size and frequency of an alumnus ’s contributions to his alma mater rise in direct correlation with his child ’s age and likelihood of applying to the school .
The data consisted of more than 32,488 donations given between 1983 and 2006 to an unnamed university , as well as information on the age and admissions status of each donor ’s children .
The numbers indicate that , after his child is born , an alumnus ’s chances of making a donation rises 13 % , and continues to increase as the child ages , reaching 17 % when the child turns thirteen .
For those with children ages 14 - 17 , the probability of giving increases if the teen ultimately applies .
After age 17 , giving by alumni whose children were admitted goes up a whopping 34 % , while those whose kids do n’t make the cut cease giving almost entirely .
Whether the giving actually affects a child ’s admissions chances remains unstudied ; for Rosen and Meer ’s purposes , “ the child - cycle of alumni giving requires only the perception of reciprocity . ”
The choice of school ( and its admissions exclusivity ) may have had a heavy influence on the data .
As noted in a Slate article by the economist Joel Waldfogel ( whose “ Deadweight Loss of Christmas ” paper Levitt and Dubner discussed in a New York Times Magazine article ) , the university “ looks like a pretty elite place , ” in that “ [ m ] ore than 40 percent of the students attended private schools before college , and 40 percent attain an advanced degree afterward . ”
As further indication that the school is among the more prestigious : the “ fields of education , finance , health care , and law are highly represented ” in alumni careers .
More than half of alumni ( 56 percent ) donate in any given year .
Their average gift is $ 466 , with distribution heavily skewed by large gifts . ”
While the results provide some insight into the reasoning behind charity , it ’s hard to believe that the donating patterns of likely upper - middle class parents ( particularly those facing a recent and much - hyped college admissions crunch ) can really “ shed light on the general issue of altruism , ” as the authors claim .
Though the findings do put a new spin on Steve Landsburg ‘s theories on charitable giving .
In the past quarter century , Russia and the United States each have come close twice to launching nuclear missiles to counter a perceived attack .

False Alarms on the Nuclear Front
by Geoffrey Forden
The Cuban missile crisis is the best - known example of narrowly avoiding nuclear war .
However , there are at least four other less well - known incidents in which the superpowers geared up for nuclear annihilation .
Those incidents differed from the Cuban missile crisis in a significant way :
They occurred when either the U.S. or Soviet or Russian leaders had to respond to false alarms from nuclear warning systems that malfunctioned or misinterpreted benign events .
All four incidents were very brief , probably lasting less than 10 minutes each .
Professional military officers managed most of them .
Those officers had to decide whether or not to recommend launching a " retaliatory " strike before possibly losing their own nuclear first strikes .
In three of the four incidents , the decision not to respond to the alarm was made when space - based early - warning sensors failed to show signs of massive nuclear attacks .
The fourth incident was caused by an inadequate early - warning satellite system that was fooled into thinking that reflected sunlight was the flames from a handful of ICBMs .
As the following brief history of those four incidents makes clear , space - based early - warning systems played a major role in avoiding nuclear war .
During the 1980s , a few specialized articles in the media hinted at the presence of those systems .
However , it was only during the Gulf War that the American public truly became aware of U.S. capability to detect missile launches using space - based assets .
During that crisis , U.S. Defense Support Program ( DSP ) satellites , first orbited in 1970 , detected the launch of every Iraqi Scud missile .
The satellites made the detections from their orbits by " seeing " the infrared light that the missiles ' motors gave off during powered flight .
The warning of launches was transmitted to Patriot air defense missile batteries in Israel and Saudi Arabia to support attempts to shoot down the incoming warheads .
The association with the fighting of conventional war has obscured the more important strategic role those systems have played : reassuring leaders of the United States and Russia that they were not under nuclear attack .
A review of the four nuclear crises will better highlight that role .
Early on the morning of November 9 , 1979 , control centers for American Minuteman missiles , such as the one above , went on high alert for a harrowing several minutes .
The training tape incident Shortly before 9 a.m. on November 9 , 1979 , the computers at North American Aerospace Defense Command 's Cheyenne Mountain site , the Pentagon 's National Military Command Center , and the Alternate National Military Command Center in Fort Ritchie , Maryland , all showed what the United States feared most — a massive Soviet nuclear strike aimed at destroying the U.S. command system and nuclear forces .
A threat assessment conference , involving senior officers at all three command posts , was convened immediately .
Launch control centers for Minuteman missiles , buried deep below the prairie grass in the American West , received preliminary warning that the United States was under a massive nuclear attack .
The alert did not stop with the U.S. ICBM force .
The entire continental air defense interceptor force was put on alert , and at least 10 fighters took off .
Furthermore , the National Emergency Airborne Command Post , the president 's " doomsday plane , " was also launched , but without the president on board .
It was later determined that a realistic training tape had been inadvertently inserted into the computer running the nation 's early - warning programs .
In the " training tape " incident , Defense Support Program early - warning satellites saved the day .
Above , a $ 256 million DSP satellite goes aloft in August 2001 .
However , within minutes of the original alert , the officers had reviewed the raw data from the DSP satellites and checked with the early - warning radars ringing the country .
The radars were capable of spotting missiles launched from submarines close to the U.S. shores and ICBM warheads that had traveled far enough along their trajectories to rise above the curvature of the Earth .
The DSP satellites were capable of detecting the launches of Soviet missiles almost anywhere on the Earth 's surface .
Neither system showed any signs that the country was under attack , so the alert was canceled .
The computer chip incident On June 3 , 1980 , less than a year after the incident involving the training tape , U.S. command posts received another warning that the Soviet Union had launched a nuclear strike .
As in the earlier episode , launch crews for Minuteman missiles were given preliminary launch warnings , and bomber crews manned their aircraft .
This time , however , the displays did not present a recognizable or even a consistent attack pattern as they had during the training tape episode .
Instead , the displays showed a seemingly random number of attacking missiles .
The displays would show that two missiles had been launched , then zero missiles , and then 200 missiles .
Furthermore , the numbers of attacking missiles displayed in the different command posts did not always agree .
Although many officers did not take this event as seriously as the incident of the previous November , the threat assessment conference still convened to evaluate the possibility that the attack was real .
Again the committee reviewed the raw data from the early - warning systems and found that no missiles had been launched .
Later investigations showed that a single computer chip failure had caused random numbers of attacking missiles to be displayed .
The autumn equinox incident On September 26 , 1983 , the newly inaugurated Soviet early - warning satellite system caused a nuclear false alarm .
Like the United States , the Soviet Union realized the importance of monitoring the actual launch of ICBMs .
However , the Soviets chose a different method of spotting missile launches .
Instead of looking down on the entire Earth 's surface the way U.S. DSP satellites do , Soviet satellites looked at the edge of the Earth — thus reducing the chance that naturally occurring phenomena would look like missile launches .
Missiles , when they had risen five or ten miles , would appear silhouetted against the black background of space .
Furthermore , when the edge of the Earth is viewed , light reflected from clouds or snow banks has to pass through a considerable amount of the atmosphere .
That view reduces the chances that clouds and snow may cause false alarms .
A Russian Oko early - warning satellite 's hypothesized view of U.S. missile fields at the time of the so - called " autumn equinox " incident .
A satellite has to be in a unique position to view a recently launched missile silhouetted against the black of space .
To get that view , the Soviet Union picked a special type of orbit that it had used for its communications satellites .
Those orbits , known as Molnyia orbits , come very close to the Earth in the Southern Hemisphere but extend nearly a tenth of the distance to the moon as the satellite passes over the Northern Hemisphere .
From that position high above northern Europe , the Soviet Union 's Oko ( " Eye " ) early - warning satellites spend a large fraction of their time viewing the continental U.S. missile fields at just the right glancing angle .
However , shortly after midnight Moscow time on September 26 , 1983 , the sun , the satellite , and U.S. missile fields all lined up in such a way as to maximize the sunlight reflected from high - altitude clouds .
Whether that effect was a totally unexpected phenomenon is hard to know .
That may have been the first time this rare alignment had occurred since the system became operational the previous year .
Press interviews with Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov , the officer in charge of Serpukhov - 15 , the secret bunker from which the Soviet Union monitored its early - warning satellites , indicated that the new system reported the launch of several missiles from the U.S. continental missile fields .
Petrov had been told repeatedly that the United States would launch a massive nuclear strike designed to overwhelm Soviet forces in a single strike .
Why did that false alarm fail to trigger a nuclear war ?
Perhaps the Russian command did not want to start a war on the basis of data from a new and unique system .
On the other hand , if the sun glint had caused the system to report hundreds of missile launches , then the Soviet Union might have mistakenly launched its missiles .
Petrov said that he refused to pass the alert to his superiors because " when people start a war , they do n't start it with only five missiles .
You can do little damage with just five missiles . "
The Norwegian rocket incident Early on the morning of January 25 , 1995 , Norwegian scientists and their American colleagues launched the largest sounding rocket ever from Andoya Island off the coast of Norway .
[ Sounding rockets collect data on atmospheric conditions from various altitudes . ]
Designed to study the northern lights , the rocket followed a trajectory to nearly 930 miles altitude but away from the Russian Federation .
To Russian radar technicians , the flight appeared similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile would take to blind Russian radars by detonating a nuclear warhead high in the atmosphere .
The trajectory of the Black Brant XII sounding rocket , which triggered the " Norwegian rocket " incident .
That scientific rocket caused a dangerous moment in the nuclear age .
Russia was poised , for a few moments at least , to launch a full - scale nuclear attack on the United States .
In fact , President Boris Yeltsin stated the next day that he had activated his " nuclear football " — a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his top military advisers and review the situation online — for the first time .
However , we can be fairly confident that Yeltsin 's football showed that Russia was not under attack and that the Russian early - warning system was functioning perfectly .
In addition to the string of radars surrounding the border of the former Soviet Union , Russia had inherited a complete fleet of early - warning satellites that , even by 1995 , still maintained continuous 24 - hour coverage of the U.S. continental missile fields .
In the early 1990s Russia had still managed to launch replacement satellites for its early - warning system as the previous ones died out — thereby retaining continuous coverage .
Because of those satellites , Yeltsin 's display must have shown that no massive attack was lurking just below the horizon .

Towards reliable early warning
The danger posed by those incidents was not the unauthorized or accidental launch of a handful of nuclear - tipped missiles but the possibility that either country might misinterpret a benign event — a computer training tape mistakenly inserted into an operational computer or sunlight glinting off clouds during a rare lineup of the sun , Earth , and satellite — and decide to launch a full - scale nuclear attack .
Each incident caused officials to take steps to solve a specific problem .
After the training tape incident , the U.S. Department of Defense constructed a separate facility to train operators so that a training tape could not again be inserted into the computer running the nation 's early - warning system .
Apparently , the Soviet Union launched a new fleet of early - warning satellites into geostationary orbit simply to provide a second angle from which to view U.S. missile fields .
That expensive and redundant system ensured that at least one satellite could search for missile launches free from sun glint .
After three of the four incidents , the U.S. government maintained that steps were taken that would prevent any future false alarms .
However , it had to wait only seven months after the first incident ( the computer tape incident ) to see that complex organizations , relying on even more complex machinery , can find new and unexpected ways to fail .
In fact , a comprehensive study of nuclear accidents has shown convincing historical evidence that , despite measures taken to prevent them , such accidents are inevitable .
Despite careful measures to insure nuclear accidents never happen , history reveals that such mishaps are inevitable .
Are we prepared for the next one ?
The most recent example of solving the " last problem " was the Clinton administration 's initiative to share early - warning data with Russia .
The jointly manned center has been presented by the American side as a solution to the decline of Russia 's early - warning facilities .
Russians familiar with the negotiations , however , maintain that the center has no military significance .
That view is underscored by the choice of the site for the center : an old schoolhouse nearly an hour away from downtown Moscow .
In fact , U.S. Department of Defense officials familiar with the Joint Data Exchange Center ( JDEC ) admit that , even if the center had been active during the Norwegian rocket incident , its only effect would have been to facilitate the launch notification issued before the NASA launch .
Any assistance the United States provides must increase Russia 's confidence in the validity of its own early - warning systems .
The JDEC fails that test .
Russia would never believe that the United States would pass along launch indications if a U.S. nuclear attack had been launched .

Repeat : do not start in the top third of the chart .
How to use this web service to measure equal loudness curves .
Minimise any background noise : turn off machinery , close windows etc .
If your computer has a fan , you may be able to put it under the desk .
Plug headphones into your soundcard output and put them on , making sure that they seal well around your ears .
In the 1 kHz column , choose a panel about halfway down .
Listen to it and check that ( i ) it is not uncomfortably loud and ( ii ) it is considerably louder than the background noise .
Go up or down the column if necessary until these conditions are satisfied .
Notice that the dB level chosen is now recorded at the bottom of the chart .
Once you have made a choice , this becomes your reference sound .
.
In the 750 Hz column , click the panel next to your reference panel .
If you find that it is less loud than the reference sound , click on the panel that is 3 dB louder , still at 750 Hz .
( Conversely , if it is louder , click on the panel below to make it softer .
And if it is equally loud , leave it where it is . )
Go back to your reference sound and compare .
Keeping doing this until you are satisfied that the the 750 Hz and the 1 kHz sounds are equally loud .
( You may find it difficult to judge equal loudness for different pitches , but because loudness is by definition subjective , there is no person or machine that can do it for you . )
Next find a sound at 500 Hz whose loudness equals that of your reference sound at 1 kHz .
.
Do the same for 375 , 250 Hz etc , all the way down to 30 Hz , at all times using 1 kHz as the reference .
.
Now find a sound at 1.5 kHz that equals the loudness of the 1 kHz reference .
Continue to 2 , 3 etc up to 16 kHz .
The chart will now show the sounds that you have chosen as having equal loudness .
We repeat that , while this curve roughly approximates the frequency response of your ears , it is modified by the frequency response of your sound card and headphones .
You can print this chart by right clicking on the chart , by going to the ' file ' menu of your browser and clicking ' print ' , or you can print the screen electronically ( ' print screen ' on a PC , Apple - shift - 3 for Mac ) .
You might like to compare your curve to the standard equal loudness curves ( below ) and to the dBA weighting curve given on What is a decibel ?
The dBA weighting curve is the response of a filter that is applied to sound level meters to mimic ( roughly ) the response of human hearing .
So a typical human equal loudness curve is somewhat similar to the dBA curve , but inverted .
The values on the graph you have made will be arbitrary ( unless you calibrate them – see below ) , because we do not know the properties of your sound card and headphones .
What does your hearing curve mean ?
Most people will find that their hearing is most sensitive around 1 – 4 kHz and that it is less sensitive at high and low frequencies .
Children usually hear 16 kHz moderately well .
The high frequency hearing of adults depends on age and exposure to loud sounds .
It is not uncommon for adults to have very low sensitivity for the highest frequencies .
( Your children may be complaining about that 16 kHz tone that you cannot hear . )
If you cannot hear the lowest frequencies , it 's probably because you are using loudspeakers .
As we mentioned above , you need headphones that enclose your ears for this .
How does your hearing response depend on loudness ?
The shape of your hearing response curve probably depends on loudness .
For most of us , the curve is flatter at higher sound levels * .
Choose a louder or softer reference signal and obtain a new curve .
( If you reload the page it will clear the old curve from the screen . )
Can you use this web service to measure hearing threshold curves ?
It is possible , but not likely .
Even if your headphones seal really well around your ears , they will probably only give you about 20 to 25 dB insulation from the external sound field .
Human hearing thresholds can be around 0 dB in the frequency range 0 – 4 kHz .
It is rare to find an office whose sound level is as low as 20 dB – i.e. an office in which 20 dB of insulation would reduce the sound level to near threshold levels .
For a start , your computer probably has a fan and a power supply that raise the sound level above 20 dB , even at these frequencies .
There may be other background noise as well .
However , under very good conditions ( a really quiet , still environment , no computer fan or other stray noises ) it might be possible .
If so , the method would be to find the lowest sound level audible at each frequency .
( How this level relates to the common standard of sound levels ( see What is a decibel ? ) is something that we cannot tell you : it depends on the gain of your sound card and headphones .
However , see the note about calibration below . )
Under normal conditions , if you seek the lowest sound level you can hear at each frequency , what you will find is the lowest level of a sine wave that is not masked by the background noise that you are hearing inside your headphones .
What do levels on the measured curve mean ?
Zero dB does not mean zero sound .
By definition , the reference level and is arbitrary .
For the hearing curve you make with the gadget above , it is the maximum output of your interface card , amplifier and earphones with the current settings .
( We do not know the specifications of your equipment , of course , and we do n't know how high you have set the ' volume ' knob . )
Because we see 0 dB as the maximum loudness , all measurements will have levels below that , i.e. negative dB .
See
What is a decibel ? for an explanation .
For the graphs shown immediately below , however , 0 dB is 20 µ Pa .
This graph , courtesy of Lindosland , shows the 2003 data from the International Standards Organisation for curves of equal loudness determined experimentally .
Plots of equal loudness as a function of frequency are often generically called Fletcher - Munson curves after the original work by Fletcher , H. and Munson , W.A. ( 1933 ) J.Acoust .
Soc.Am . 6:59 .
Calibration and improvements .
It is possible to improve the accuracy of measurements made using this service by calibrating the response of your sound card and headphones , using a small microphone with good frequency response .
( Microphones usually have much flatter frequency response than do speakers , so even a quite cheap electret microphone can be useful . )
Connect the microphone to an oscilloscope or to the input of the sound card of a second computer .
Using high but not painful sound levels , play sound files with the same amplitude ( i.e. click on panels in the same row ) and measure the variation in the recorded AC voltage for different frequencies .
This works at low frequencies , but for the highest frequencies the sound level varies considerably within the headphone itself .
Microphones often come with a calibration curve , or a sensitivity rating in volts / pascal .
Using this you can convert the values measured with the microphone to the standard expressions of sound level , in dB with respect to 20 µ Pa . *
The flattening of the hearing curve at high sound levels is sometimes referred to jokingly as the first law of hifi : if you turn it up it sounds better .
If ever you compare hifi systems in a shop , vary the volume controls ( and loudness control , if present ) .
The sales staff are usually aware of this law , so , before you buy , make sure that you try turning the expensive one down so that it slightly softer than the cheap one .
The flash script above was made by George Hatsidimitris with sound files by John Tann of the School of Physics , UNSW .
John has posted an array of sound files over a range of sound levels and frequencies .

Site ist eine Seite zum Vergleich und zur Unterstützung von Versionskontrollsystemen ( VCSes ) .
Als Better - SCM begann , war CVS das am häufigsten verwendete VCS in der Open - Source - Welt .
Es funktionierte gut und war relativ zuverlässig , hatte aber viele Einschränkungen .
Es führte keine Umbenennungen oder Kopien von Dateien durch , schickte die Dateien nicht an den Server , hatte keine Atomizität der Operationen und hatte keinen guten Umgang mit Binärdateien .
Um dieses Problem anzugehen , entstanden mehrere Alternativen , von denen einige entweder Open - Source waren oder der Gemeinschaft der Open - Source - Entwickler zur Verfügung standen .
Das Projekt Better SCM zielte darauf ab , sie zu befähigen , zu vergleichen und zu kritisieren , was hoffentlich dazu führt , dass jeder einzelne ein vollständigerer und besser zugänglicher Ersatz ist .
Heutzutage verwenden die meisten Open - Source - Projekte kein CVS mehr , und die zahlreichen Alternativen sind ausgereift .

Photograph of an aluminum foil lamp having a radiating area of 225 square centimeters .
The inset is a magnified view of several diamond - shapes microcavities .
Cheap , skinny aluminum foil lamps may soon illuminate our lives instead of big , bulky light bulbs .
Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign made the low - cost lamps by treating aluminum foil bought at the grocery store with an acidic bath .
The new light source , which is lighter , brighter , and more efficient than incandescent light , is described in the June issue of the Journal of Physics D : Applied Physics .
" We wanted to make this technology as inexpensive as we possibly could , " said physicist Gary Eden .
" Expensive technology can be interesting , but the opportunity for using it is limited . "
Eden 's team is just one of many around the world working on more efficient , longer - living , mercury - free alternatives .
Thomas Edison 's light bulb legacy is more than a hundred years old , and has remained essentially unchanged since its incandescent inception .
The slightly younger fluorescent tube contains low amounts of mercury , which accumulate into hazardous levels in landfills .
" There 's not a suitable alternative right now , but hopefully there will be soon , " said Eden .
The alternative light source developed by Eden and colleagues is built of foil bathed in acid so that its surface is full of tiny holes .
The acid also converts the foil into sapphire , a type of aluminum oxide , which creates a robust structure that allows volts to travel across the thin layer of aluminum without breaking it down .
The tens of thousands of cavities are filled with gas and wired together , and the whole device is sealed between two pieces of glass or something similar .
All assembled , the device is less than 1 millimeter thick , and most of that girth comes from the glass .
The light can be flexible and hang on curved surfaces .
Because aluminum is lightweight , the light is also .
The flexible lamps not only have potential to light up homes and businesses , they may help treat diseases too .
Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital have shown interest in using the light source as a treatment for psoriasis , a skin disease suffered by 5 percent of the world 's population .
Although there is no cure for the condition , ultraviolet light of certain wavelengths can drive it into remission .
Currently , treatments are costly , and can require a few visits to the doctor every week .
Aluminum foil lamps could cut costs and doctor visits .
" What we are envisioning is a phototherapeutic bandage sold over the counter , " Eden told LiveScience .
" Someone with the disease could go to the pharmacy , purchase the flexible lamps in a sanitary wrapper .
They 'd attach it around the affected area of their body with Velcro , plug it in , watch a movie , tear off the light , and throw it away .
In another 4 or 5 weeks , they 'd buy a new one . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
April 30 is the day that Americans can stop working to pay the taxman and start working for themselves , according to the Tax Foundation 's annual estimate dubbed " Tax freedom day . "
Tax freedom day is theoretical because it assumes we 've been working 7 days a week since the start of the year , and that we do n't spend anything we make .
The 120 days from Jan. 1 through April 30 represents the time it will take the nation as a whole to earn enough to pay off all of the taxes that will be levied against us this year .
Breaking that 120 days down , the Tax Foundation estimates it will take :
43 days of work to pay off federal , state and local income taxes
30 days to pay off payroll taxes ( for Social Security and Medicare )
16 days to pay off sales and excise taxes
14 days to pay off corporate income taxes ( This assumes that a tax on a business is passed on to its customers , employees and shareholders in terms of higher prices , lower paychecks and less shareholder value . )
12 days to pay off property taxes
4 days to pay off other taxes ( e.g. , customs duties )
1 day to pay off estate and gift taxes
Tax freedom day may not literally provide Americans with any relief .
But as a point of comparison it is a way to measure changes in the total tax burden of the nation from one year to the next .
This year 's tax freedom day comes four days later than it did in 2006 , representing the fourth increase in four years .
It 's taking Americans longer to pay their tax bill , according to the Tax Foundation , primarily because overall income has increased , property taxes are up and the annual cap on wages subject to the Social Security and Medicare tax has also increased
The total effective tax rate for the nation - a measure of all taxes as a percentage of all income - is 32.7 percent this year , up slightly from 2006 .
On a state - by - state basis , tax freedom day comes much sooner in some places such as Oklahoma -- where residents will have earned enough to pay their taxes by April 12 -- than in states with high taxes or high per-capita income , such as Connecticut , where residents have to work through May 20 to satisfy the total tax burden there .
See how your state ranks
Watching the clock - literally
The Tax Foundation also compares the time Americans work to pay taxes with the time we work to pay for life 's other expenses .
Based on an 8 - hour workday , the research group estimates that Americans as a whole work :

Introduction
The volume of a typical human brain is 1400 cm3 and its weight is about 1000 times that of a typical rat 's brain .
Mundane facts about brain data do little to give us insight into this amazing organ .
What is there about the human brain that seems to make possible so many wondrous things that humans can accomplish : oral and written language , producing of art and music , and doing mathematics .
Or is it really possible that dolphins have already resolved the status of the Riemann Hypothesis but we are unaware of it because we have found no way yet to communicate with them ?
As so often seems to happen , at first glance there might not seem to be much to say about this topic .
However , there are more facets to this subject than I can treat here or know enough about to say anything intelligent about them .
I will merely try to provide you with a " wire " to connect mathematics and brain .
Imaging the Brain
One of the reasons the brain was a mystery for so long is that it is encased in the skull .
Under ordinary circumstances one does not have easy access to seeing the brain .
Being able to see into the human body took a big leap forward when Wilhelm Roentgen discovered x-rays .
Shortly after his discovery of x-rays physicians were already using x-rays to see our bones .
However , being encased by the skull , the brain , and other soft tissues were still unknown territory for physicians and physiologists .
With contributions from science , engineering and mathematics , physicians have a growing array of imaging tools for seeing inside the skull .
At first these brain imaging techniques involved 2 - dimensional cross sections of the brain .
Many of these techniques are identified with the field of tomography .
The Greek word for a " cut " or " section " is " tomas . "
( Tomography has applications in fields other than medicine . , for example , geology . )
As the field of tomography has matured , it has been possible to generate three - dimensional medical imaging systems for the brain .
These systems allow static views of the brain ; increasingly it is also possible to make movies that show the dynamic behavior of the brain .
The systems that are now available both to medical practitioners and researchers are :
* CT or CAT ( Computed tomography or computed axial tomography )
* MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging )
* fMRI ( Functional MRI )
* PET ( Positron Emission Tomography )
* SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography )
* DOT ( Diffuse Optical Tomography )
" Vanilla " samples of some of these types of images are shown below :

Images of the kind shown above have become part of the lexicon of our society .
They show the brain using three different techniques that physicians have come to rely upon for insight and diagnosis .
The development of the CT - scans , computerized tomography , has proved to be one of the great leaps forward in diagnostic medicine and for medical research .
It is a also a wonderful story of the interplay of pure mathematics , applicable mathematics , and computer science .
The story , amazingly enough , starts in Czechoslovakia .
The mathematician Johnann Radon ( 1887 -1956 ) was investigating the idea of reconstructing the value of a function at a point in a plane region by computing the sums ( integral ) of the values of this function along lines that intersected this domain .
This work was published in German in 1917 .
Radon 's work evolved into what is known today as the Radon Transform .
It is unclear if Radon saw a future for a medical revolution in his work but in any case , the engineering and the computer science to implement the implications of his ideas were in the future .
Furthermore , his mathematical ideas also had to be amplified to make practical tomography a reality .
You can get the flavor of Radon 's idea by consider the example below which involves a discrete analog of the question Radon investigated .
The vertices of the " square head " have unknown density , represented by x , y , z , and w .
If one knows the sums of these unknown values along some ( all ) of the 6 line segments that are formed by the vertices of the square , can one reconstruct the unknown densities ?
For example , using 4 of the 6 lines suppose we get the equations :
x + y = 8
w + z = 10
y + z = 13
w + y = 7 .
Readers who know a little linear algebra may wish to see what happens for the general case here .
Readers who know high school algebra should be able to determine that the equations above have a unique solution .
Usually four equations in four unknowns will give rise to a unique solution .
However , it might be that these 6 equations are inconsistent and have no solution , or the solution might depend on which of the 4 out of 6 equations one selects .
Problems of this kind belong to the emerging field of " discrete tomography . "
Such problems ( the problem above involves the 2 - dimensional cube ) , like Radon 's original work , belong to the area of reconstruction of information from partial knowledge , or from " samples " of various kinds .
Radon showed that the unknown densities could be reconstructed from the " line integrals " that he was computing .
Whether he or anyone realized the value of Radon 's work for medical imaging at the time is unclear , but as noted previously , without significant computer power Radon 's work could not be put to use immediately .
The story of CT scans picks up in more modern times with the work of Godfrey Hounsfield ( 1919 - 2004 ) and Allan Cormark ( 1924-1998 ) .
Hounsfield was an English electrical and mechanical engineer and Cormak was a South African physicist .
The two men shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1979 for their work .
However , in initially implementing the creation of a scanner in 1971 ( based on earlier ideas ) no use was made of Radon 's work .
Larry Shepp , a mathematician at Rutgers University , heard a talk by Hounsfield in which he described his new device .
It emerged that Hounsfield was unaware of the possibility of using Radon 's work in conjunction with his new machine , and Shepp became involved in developing computer code to improve the image quality for the new technology .
( Larry Shepp )
As time has gone on , mathematicians have become increasingly involved with imaging technologies of many kinds .
The human visual system
One burgeoning area connecting mathematics and the brain is visual phenomena .
Human visual information is processed by the brain and uses our amazing eyes .
Mathematicians have been involved in a wide variety of problems involving vision :
* What is the geometry of our perceptual system ?
* How does the brain process visual information ?
It is well known that when humans look at ( straight ) railroad tracks they appear to converge in the distance .
A wide range of scholars are trying to understand the mystery of visual perception .
The way that the world looks to us was a challenge for artists who had to represent reality on canvas , and for philosophers who are trying to probe the relation between mind , physics , and perception .
Artists met this challenge with a theory of perspective and mathematicians ( some of them also artists ) transformed the insights obtained concerning perspective into what today is known as projective geometry .
In projective geometry , unlike Euclidean geometry , there are no parallel lines .
However , this is not where the story ends .
It has been suggested that the hyperbolic plane or other geometries might describe this system .
The challenge of understanding perspective from a mathematical point of view and being able to use computers to serve the needs of artists , photographers , and architects has been a source of much research .
Illusions and impossible figures
One interesting connection between mathematics and the brain is the reaction many people have to symmetric patterns and patterns which are deceptive ( visual illusions and impossible figures ) .
Many individuals including mathematicians find symmetrical designs very appealing .
For example , the works of M.C. Escher ( 1898 - 1972 ) hit a very sympathetic chord in the mathematics community .
Furthermore , these is a connection between Escher and interest in optical illusions and " impossible objects . "
This link is via Roger Penrose ( 1931 - ) , the distinguished mathematician and physicist , whose impossible triangle has inspired a large number of artistic efforts , including those of Escher , as well as mathematical and computer vision investigations .
However , it not as widely known as it should be that Penrose was not the first to create such images , though his version of the illusion is particularly appealing .

In the diagram above the version due to Roger Penrose is shown on the right but the illustration on the left shows a version of this object first created in 1934 by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutsvärd .
Reutsvärd 's work has been commemorated by a Swedish stamp and his version of the impossible triangle is but one of many such illusions that he created .
It turns out that another aspect of " impossible figures " is making real objects which look exactly like impossible ones .
There is more to illusions than meets the eye or the brain .
Illusions open up a window to explore the nature of our visual system , the way the brain processes visual information , and the geometry of our visual perception system .
Experts in computer vision , a subject which includes effective ways of manipulating images by computers as well as developing software to carry out various pattern recognition problems , are also interested in visual illusions .
Applications of work in this area might range from more effective face recognition software to scene recognition capability for software .
Here is a small sample of visual illustions which show some the range of phenomena that might be explored concerning why the brain is " fooled " and which can perhaps be modeled using mathematics .

Other mathematical windows on the brain
The small sample of ways that mathematics interacts with our knowledge of the human brain barely hints at the myriad of interfaces of these two subjects .
What follows is just an additional sampler of ways that mathematics is interacting with and providing a valuable tool for attempts to understand the brain .
* Neuronal organization and transmission of signals ( nerve conduction ) between the brain and other parts of our nervous system
* The use of dynamical systems in an attempt to understand epilepsy and to be able to try to predict the start of seizures
* Modeling various aspects of the brain using mathematics which tries to understand how " oscillators " coordinate their firings under various interaction assumptions
* Using new ideas about flattening complicated surfaces ( like the brain ) to understand how to map different parts of the brain to specific brain functions
* Using data mining and other tools to understand the implications of an increasing wealth of DNA and genomic information for brain chemistry
Mathematical ability
To the best of our knowledge humans are the only species that does mathematics .
Attempts to verify that other animals ( plants ? ) can " do " mathematics have so far not encouraged the belief that any mathematics is being produced by other species .
The famous story of " clever Hans , " a horse whose master had convinced himself that Hans could do mathematics turned out to be not a case of a horse with mathematical talent but a human master who was sending signals to the horse without realizing he was doing this .
What is unique about the human brain that makes this doing mathematics possible ?
Brain imaging techniques are being used to chart the differences in how humans might do calculations , visualize a polyhderon , try to prove a theorem , or brain storm a problem in number theory .
What are the ways that having a " good memory " makes mathematics easier ?
Many mathematicians describe themselves as having a good memory .
What can be said is that mathematicians are using their brains and mathematics to further mathematics ' domains and to get further insight into how mathematics gives insight into brains !

70 % of clubbers have symptoms of hearing damage after a night out , says RNID
The charity RNID found 90 % of pub , club and gig - goers experienced dullness of hearing or ringing in the ears after a night on the town .
More than half of the 1,381 surveyed visited a bar where they had to shout to be heard at least once a week .
A quarter said the music in these venues was too loud and a third thought hearing loss would affect their lives .
Most young people have experienced the first signs of permanent hearing damage after a night out , yet have no idea how to prevent it
Dr John Low , Chief Executive of RNID
New noise regulations come into force to protect employees in the music and entertainment sectors in April 2008 .
But the RNID is calling on the government to establish a recommended noise exposure level for audiences attending music venues and events , and educate young people about noise as a public health risk .
Dr John Low , Chief Executive of RNID , said : " Our research shows most young people have experienced the first signs of permanent hearing damage after a night out , yet have no idea how to prevent it .
" With regular exposure to music at high volumes in clubs , gigs and bars , it 's only too easy to clock up noise doses that could damage their hearing forever . "
He said music lovers , musicians and DJs could take simple steps to protect themselves from damaging decibels on a night out or while performing :
Taking a five minute rest period for every hour of listening to allow ears to recover
Standing away from loud speakers in pubs , clubs , gigs and concerts
Taking regular breaks from the dance floor and using chill out areas to give ears a rest from loud music
Wearing earplugs designed for use in clubs and gigs , which reduce the volume not the quality of the sound - available for the price of a CD
Carl Hill , 31 and from London , said a decade of running club nights had taken a toll on his hearing .
" I now have tinnitus , which means I have a constant ringing in my ears .
It can be quite annoying , especially at night .
Sometimes I have to go to sleep with the radio on for distraction .
Noise levels A quiet room at night - 20 decibels
An ordinary spoken conversation - 60 decibels A busy street - 70 decibels A pneumatic drill - 100 decibels Some personal music players ( at high volume ) - 105 decibels Aircraft taking off - 110 decibels
" With hindsight , I should have worn earplugs . "
Neil Williams of the British Beer and Pub Association said : " Steps are being taken to raise awareness .
" A new noise regulation is due in 2008 and will cover a range of measures including how to limit the sound exposure of staff and how speakers should be positioned .
" We are working on guidance for our members . "
In other workplaces , updated regulations are already in force and the level at which employers must provide hearing protection and hearing protection zones is now 85 rather than 90 decibels ( daily or weekly average exposure ) .
The level at which employers must assess the risk to workers ' health and provide them with information and training is now 80 decibels .
In a huge blow to Toshiba , Universal , and the rest of the HD DVD devotees , rental giant Blockbuster has decided to stock only Blu-ray discs in the vast majority of its nationwide locations , although HD DVD titles will continue to be offered online and in the 250 ( out of 1,450 ) stores that have been testing both formats since last year .
Blockbuster VP Matthew Smith revealed to the AP that the decision to go with Blu-ray -- which will reportedly be announced tomorrow -- stemmed from an overwhelming customer preference for those titles in the test markets , accounting for over 70 % of all HD discs rented .
Interestingly enough , it seems that content -- and not price -- was the deciding factor for consumers , with Blu-ray - only hits such as the Spiderman and Pirates of the Caribbean films apparently outmatching equivalent HD DVD exclusives .
While it 's still a little too soon to declare Blu-ray the outright winner , this Blockbuster decision only contributes to the momentum that Sony 's darling has had of late -- momentum that at this point , might be too difficult for the other guys to counter .

Last week , I released the first version of the BitPacket Python module which allows you to pack and unpack data like the struct and array modules , but in an object - oriented way .
At work I needed an easy way to create network packets and at that time I did not know the existence of the struct and array modules , so I googled a bit and I found out the BitVector class for a memory - efficient packed representation of bit arrays , which I decided to use for my purpose .
I implemented three classes , BitField , BitStructure and BitVariableStructure ( the lastest two are derived from BitField ) .
A network packet would be represented by the BitStructure class , which at creation does not contain any field , and the idea is that any BitField subclass might be added to it .
I ’ll will show you the most basic example .
Suppose , you need a simple network packet like the one below :
+---------------+-------------------+ | id ( 1 byte ) | address ( 4 byte ) | +---------------+-------------------+
You could easily create a network packet using BitStructure , like this :
>>> bs = BitStructure ( ' mypacket ' ) >>> bs.append(BitField( 'id ' , BYTE_SIZE , 0x54 ) ) >>> bs.append( BitField(' address ' , INTEGER_SIZE , 0x10203040 ) )
and print its contents :
>>> print bs >>> ( mypacket = >>> ( id = 0x54 ) >>> ( address = 0x10203040 ) )
In order to unpack an incoming packet , we could use the variable created above or a new one without default values :
>>> bs = BitStructure ( ' mypacket ' ) >>> bs.append( BitField( 'id ' , BYTE_SIZE ) ) >>> bs.append(BitField(' address ' , INTEGER_SIZE ) )
In order to unpack an incoming array of bytes , we would do the following :
>>> data = array.array ( ' B ' , [ 0x38 , 0x87 , 0x34 , 0x21 , 0x40 ] ) >>> bs.set_stream( data )
We can then access to the packet fields by their name :
>>> print ' 0x %X ' % bs [ ' id ' ] 0x38 >>> print ' 0x %X ' % bs [ ' address ' ]
0x87342140
There are a lot more possibilities to pack and unpack bit field structures by using BitStructure and BitVariableStructure .
You can see all of them in the module ’s online documentation .

The CSIRO has won a landmark US legal battle against Buffalo Technology , under which it could receive royalties from every producer of wireless local area network ( WLAN ) products worldwide .
The CSIRO brought the case against Buffalo before the US Federal Court of the Eastern District of Texas in February last year , claiming the manufacturer had failed to pay royalties on US patent 5487069 .
The patent , granted to CSIRO in 1996 , encompasses elements of the 802.11a / g wireless technology that is now an industry standard .
Turning to Neanderthal bones , they have already recovered considerable amounts of DNA sequence , which are derived from every chromosome in the Neanderthal cell , as judged by matching the Neanderthal DNA to the human genome sequence that was first fully decoded in 2003 .
The first goal of the project will be to sequence three billion units of Neanderthal DNA , corresponding to the full length of the Neanderthal genome .
This will require decoding 20 times as much DNA , because so much of the DNA in the Neanderthal bones belongs to bacteria .
Genomes must usually be decoded several times over to get a complete and accurate sequence , but the first three billion bases of Neanderthal should “ hit all the essential differences , ” Dr. Egholm said .
The researchers ’ hope is to recover the entire sequence of the Neanderthal genome , but that will depend on which they can recover enough DNA .
From sampling so far , no particular gaps in the sequence are apparent .
“ We are hitting all the chromosomes and getting good coverage , ” Dr. Egholm said .
If no single specimen yields a full sequence , the genome might be recovered by combining DNA from several individuals .
One of the most important results that researchers are hoping for is to discover , from a three - way comparison between chimp , human and Neanderthal DNA , which genes have made humans human .
The chimp and human genomes differ at just 1 percent of the sites on their DNA .
At 1 percent , Neanderthals resemble humans at 96 percent of the sites , to judge from the preliminary work , and chimps at 4 percent .
Analysis of the DNA at the sites at which humans differ from the two other species will help understand the evolution of specifically human traits “ and perhaps even aspects of cognitive function , ” Dr. Paabo said .
The degree of resemblance between humans and Neanderthals is fiercely debated by archaeologists and even issues such as whether Neanderthals had language have not been resolved .
Dr. Paabo believes that genetic analysis is the best hope of doing so .
He has paid particular attention to a gene known as FOXP2 , which from its mutated forms in people seems to be involved in several advanced aspects of language .
The human version of the gene differs at two sites from the chimp version .
Knowing whether the sequence of the Neanderthal gene is closer to chimps or humans would help decide whether they had advanced speech like people or some lesser form of communication , perhaps without syntax .
Sony is once again showing off their beautiful OLED TVs we first peeped at CES .
No surprise there , after all , we love to gawk at that incredible 1,000,000: 1 contrast ratio just as often as possible .
The real news is that Sony is finally ready to move an OLED TV into production .
Sorry , not that bad - azz 27 - inch model capable of Full HD 1080 p .
Nope , instead they 'll be pushing out the 11 - inch pup sometime " within 2007 . "
We 're talking 1024 x 600 pixels slathered across that wee 1M:1 contrast panel capable of 8 - bit RGB color and covering more than 100 % of the NTSC color gamut .
Oh , and the display itself measures just 3 - mm thick .
Hot - freakin ' - tastic .
Unfortunately , it will likely suffer from a high price tag and short display life .
Still , you 'll be tempted , especially after seeing the set 's razor - thin display in a profile shot after the break -- yeah , dramatic viewing angles too .

We tend to think of the Dark Ages as a bleak time when King Arthur was caught in the grip of lusty princesses and clashing knights .
But while Europeans were busy eating giant turkey legs and trying to act interested in converting pagans to Christianity , a great culture was flourishing in Southern Mexico and northern Central America .
Between 200 B.C.E. and 900 C.E. , the Mayan civilization was anything but dark .
Kings and queens rules over a huge empire of cities , palaces , and temples adorned with fine art and steeped in gold and gems .
Its people were highly advanced , mastering disciplines as varied as astronomy , engineering , architecture , and urban planning .
Today , however , these once - great Mayan cities lie hidden under dense rainforest .
To the average American , how this happened is a mystery .
We say the Maya “ disappeared ” and blame it on alien invaders .
But the Maya are n’t gone .
Millions of them still live in Guatemala and Honduras , and thousands more come to the United States to eke out livings as migrant laborers .
It did n’t take a supernatural force to put their civilization into decline , either .
In fact , archaeologists now blame the fall of the Maya on deceptively simple flaws that could topple any culture - even ours .
RAIN DROPS AREN’T FALLING ON MY HEAD
These days , so few people live in the region once dominated by the Mayan empire that researchers believed there were n’t a lot of Maya living there in the past , either .
But the landscape is deceptive .
Decades of research reveal that the Maya had completely transformed the land on which they lived by turning jungles into a vast area of plains filled with cities , farms , and an ever - growing population .
In fact , settlements around centers like Tikal reached population densities of up to 2,600 people per square mile .
That ’s more than half the population density of modern - day New York City .

( Image : Space Imaging , Inc. ) Archaeologists have even found evidence of a kind of Mayan urban sprawl .
In the spans between large cities , they ’ve uncovered thousands of house foundations connected by what were paved roads .
Even more spectacular , recent satellite imagery from NASA shows that may areas where the Maya used limestone plaster as floor and wall coverings can still be seen in the colors of the rainforest trees .
As the Mayan population grew , however , the society became vulnerable to the limitations of their environment .
They gobbled up the resources around them , but failed to develop new technologies that might have allowed them to adapt to changes in their natural surroundings .
So when change finally did arrive in the form of drought , catastrophe was n’t too far behind .
Archaeologist Richardson Gill blames the Mayan collapse on an extended period of drought that affected most of Mexico and Central America in the 9th century C.E.
Of the more than 15 million Maya inhabiting the region at the time , many lived far from major rivers , so people relied on water collected in reservoirs during the rainy season .
Of course , when climate changes caused these reserves to drop to dangerous levels , it became impossible to feed the huge Mayan population .
In 2003 , Gill ’s theories received support following the analysis of mud from lake bottom in the Yucatan .
Essentially , the find confirmed they spread of deforestation , soil erosion , and drought .
Sadly , famine and thirst appear to have contributed to widespread death and disease , eventually driving people out of the Mayan heartland .
While widely accepted , this theory of the Mayan collapse still leaves a lingering question .
Evidence shows that most ancient civilizations dealt successfully with drought at one time or another ; so why were n’t the Maya able to cope ?
The answer , according to recent research , was war .
AN OPEN WAR POLICY

At the same time the drought was taking hold , it appears the Mayan city - states had their resources and attention focused on something else - fighting .
In a way , some evidence of this has always existed in the form of smashed monuments and burned palaces found in the region .
In the early 20th century , the Bolshevik Revolution in Russian inspired a theory that rapid Mayan collapse was the result of a popular peasant revolt , fueled by the lavish lifestyles and oppressive rule of the theocratic Mayan kings .
Mayan revolutionaries , rejecting religions hocus - pocus from rulers who claimed to be able to bring rain for crops while stuffing their houses and tombs with expensive artwork and jewels , overthrew their priest - kings and , in the process , ruined everything .
It was n’t a bad theory , but it seems that the rulers , not the people , deserve most of the blame .
In the wake of new research , it appears that Mayan cities were locked in something similar to the Cold War , only hotter .
Hieroglyphs in the area reveal that two metropolitan “ super- powers , ” Tikal and Calakmul , were bitter rivals for centuries .
Skirmishes between the kings of each city grew increasingly violent , prompting both dynasties to build alliances with other cities via raids , conquest , and royal coups .
But , as more and more cities got involved , the warfare spread .
In 2002 , a few more clues came to light after archaeologists discovered a stunning new set of hieroglyphic texts carved into the steps of a palace staircase at Dos Pilas ( uncovered thanks to an earthquake that hit the region the previous summer ) .
The texts told the surprising story of renegade princes from Tikal , who tried to create an empire of their own by waging a full - force attack on their home city with the help of neighboring allies .
Unfortunately , their timing was poor .
The invasion occurred during the height of the drought , and the result was pure devastation .
Pyramids and temples were torn apart to build fortifications , and what few trees were left in the razed rainforest were cut down to build fences .
Eventually , farmers had to retreat to the fast - growing weeds .
The war destroyed the cities , leaving behind ruins and refugees .
The land could no longer support the population due to the drought , and the government was too weak to do anything about it due to the war .
Rather than to remain in the cities and face death , the people scattered , and the jungle eventually reclaimed the land .
NOT -SO - UNSOLVABLE MYSTERIES
In the end , it was neither laser beams nor a migration to Atlantis that destroyed the Maya , but a simple failure to plan .
Leaders put the majority of their resources into warfare , while simultaneously forgetting that those resources were n’t infinite .
Then , when a severe but conquerable drought crisis appears , they were unable to cope .
In his new book Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed , Pulitzer Prize - winning author Jared Diamond claims that the scenario is more common than you might think , and that it maybe responsible for the fall of many ancient cultures we deem “ mysterious . ”
Environmental destruction and the depletion of natural resources create vulnerability , especially in the face of natural disasters .
And just like the Maya , the ultimate fate is rarely disappearance or extinction , but usually a decline from opulence to poverty .
International Herald Tribune :
' What are we doing here ?
Why are we still here ? ' " said ( Staff Sergeant David ) Safstrom , a member of Delta Company of the 1st Battalion , 325th Airborne Infantry , 82nd Airborne Division .
" We 're helping guys that are trying to kill us .
We help them in the day .
They turn around at night and try to kill us . "
His views are echoed by most of his fellow soldiers in Delta Company , renowned for its aggressiveness .
A small minority of Delta Company soldiers - the younger , more recent enlistees in particular - seem to still wholeheartedly support the war .
Others are ambivalent , torn between fear of losing more friends in battle , longing for their families and a desire to complete their mission .
With few reliable surveys of soldiers ' attitudes , it is impossible to simply extrapolate from the small number of soldiers in Delta Company .
But in interviews with more than a dozen soldiers over a one - week period , most said they were disillusioned by repeated deployments , by what they saw as the abysmal performance of Iraqi security forces and by a conflict that they considered a civil war , one they had no ability to stop .

More than 1 million pages of historical government documents — a stack taller than the U.S. Capitol — have been removed from public view since the September 2001 terror attacks , according to records obtained by the Associated Press .
Some of the papers are more than a century old .
In some cases , entire file boxes were removed without significant review because the government 's central record - keeping agency , the National Archives and Records Administration , did not have time for a more thorough audit .
" We just felt we could n't take the time and did n't always have the expertise , " said Steve Tilley , who oversaw the program .
Archives officials are still screening records , but the number of files pulled recently has declined dramatically , he said .
The records administration began removing materials under its " records of concern " program , launched in November 2001 after the Justice Department instructed agencies to be more guarded in releasing government papers .
The agency has removed about 1.1 million pages , according to partially redacted monthly progress reports reviewed by the AP .
The reports were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act .
The pulled records include the presumably dangerous , such as nearly half an enormous database from the Federal Emergency Management Agency with information about all federal facilities .
But they also include the presumably useless , such as part of a collection about the Lower Colorado River Authority that includes 114 - year - old papers .
About 80 cubic feet of naval facility plans and blueprints — on microfilm , about 200,000 pages — were withdrawn since the agency said it did n't have time to go through each individual document .
In all , archivists identified as many as 625 million pages that could have been affected under the security program .
In their haste to remove potentially harmful documents from view , archives officials acknowledged many records were withdrawn that should be available .
The public can still request to see parts of withdrawn documents under the Freedom of Information Act and may in some cases be allowed to see whole files that were removed .
The archives program comes less than one year after the records administration came under fire for allowing public documents to be reclassified as secret under a separate program .
After the September 2001 attacks , the records administration signed a secret deal with the Pentagon and CIA to review and permit the removal of tens of thousands of pages from public view that intelligence officials believed had been declassified too hastily .
In the aftermath of disclosures about that program , archives officials promised they would not enter into any more secret agreements with federal agencies , would publicize withdrawals and would establish procedures for reclassifying documents .
A subsequent audit of the disputed program found one of every three sampled documents should not have been reclassified .
The newer program , however , has been operated wholly by archives officials , and its scope apparently dwarfs the removal of CIA and Pentagon records .
In a memo to employees , then - Archivist of the United States John Carlin said the records of concern program would " reduce the risk of providing access to materials that might support terrorists . "
A later memo explained that " relatively current , accurate and detailed information on a structure , organization or facility that is crucial to protecting national defense , the country 's infrastructure , symbolic monuments and personal identity are records of concern . "
The archives initially targeted six categories of documents for review , but the list was expanded to include 10 categories in early 2002 : • Plans , photos or maps of government facilities or other sensitive infrastructure • Emergency action , civil defense and continuity of government information • Nuclear technology materials •
Weapons technology information , including biological and chemical agents • Presidential protection records • Materials relating to intelligence gathering and studies • Studies on terrorism and counterterrorism • Information on natural resources , such as oil , uranium and water • Material that could be potentially useful to terrorists •
Materials relating to the Middle East with information on potentially current topics
The director of an online coalition for freedom of information issues , Patrice McDermott of OpenTheGovernment.org , urged officials to create a public registry of withdrawn documents .
She said officials should work toward releasing more than 400 million pages of backlogged files rather than removing smaller numbers of papers .
" This is a questionable use of tax dollars , " McDermott said .
Other researchers said the project , while well - intentioned , reinforces a culture of secrecy that became more pronounced after the September 2001 terror attacks .
" You want government to be vigilant when it comes to security , but you also want them to behave responsibly , " said Steven Aftergood , who runs the government secrecy project for the Washington - based Federation of American Scientists .
" You can't have a situation where secrecy becomes the default mode . "
Many of the removed records might be useful to terrorists , according to the AP 's review .
Archivists removed records from the U.S. Surgeon General 's Preventive Medicine Division , which studied biological weapons created between 1941 and 1947 .
Other records withdrawn do n't appear to be useful to terrorists .
Archivists removed information from a 1960 Bureau of Indian Affairs report on enrollments in the Alaska 's Tlingit and Haida tribes because it included Social Security numbers , which could be used for identity theft .
A 1960 map of the Melton Hill Reservoir in east Tennessee — now perhaps best - known as a spring training site for collegiate rowing teams around the eastern United States — was removed from view , as were 1967 architectural drawings for the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin , Texas .
In e-mails and memos obtained by the AP , archives employees made it clear they were trying to minimize the number and scope of removals .
In an internal e-mail , the No. 2 Archives official expressed satisfaction at finding fewer and fewer papers that should be removed .
" All quiet on records of concern front , " wrote Lewis Bellardo .
" Just the way we like it . "
Archives officials generally have received passing marks from secrecy experts who have been aware of the program , said Tom Blanton , director of the National Security Archive , a George Washington University - based research institute .
But Blanton also said the effort appears to be a case of misplaced priorities .
" Government 's first instinct is to hide vulnerabilities , not to fix them , " said Blanton .
" And that does n't make us safer . " Copyright 2007 The Associated Press .

Today ’s ruling in the campaign - finance case focused on the Supreme Court ’s decision in 2003 , when there was a different lineup of justices , upholding a key section of the McCain - Feingold law .
That section bars companies and unions from paying for ads even mentioning the name of a candidate for federal office in the 60 days before a general election or the 30 days before a primary .
The 2004 ads in question mentioned Senators Russell D. Feingold and Herb Kohl , both Wisconsin Democrats , and urged viewers to contact them and urge them to oppose their Democratic colleagues ’ opposition to some of President Bush ’s judicial nominees .
The ads directed viewers to a Web site critical of Mr. Feingold , who was up for re-election .
Mr. Feingold and Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , were the main sponsors of the campaign finance law .
Its supporters see it as a valiant attempt to regulate the spigots that pour oceans of corrupting money into political campaigns .
Its detractors see it as interference with free speech , and as unrealistic in view of the huge sums of money needed to run a political campaign .
The Wisconsin Right to Life organization sued the Federal Election Commission , seeking a judgment declaring that the pertinent McCain - Feingold section was unconstitutional .
A special three - judge federal court panel ruled in favor of the anti-abortion group , finding that the ads ’ text and images did not show that they were “ intended to influence the voters ’ decisions ” but were “ genuine issue ads ” that the government could not keep off the air .
Today , the Supreme Court majority concluded that the special judicial panel was right in holding that the ads should have been allowed .
“ Because WRTL ’s ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate , they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy , ” the majority said , using the term for ads that urge a candidate ’s election or defeat .
Today we 're re-excerpting from Cormac O'Brien 's terrific piece in mental_floss .
The First to Walk Like a Crab : Julia Dent Grant ( first lady , 1869 " “ 1877 )
Julia Dent Grant was cross-eyed her entire life .
While that never stopped her from being a tomboy in her youth , or — remarkably — from developing into an accomplished equestrienne , it did lead to some embarrassing White House moments .
At the galas she was fond of throwing , Julia had a habit of standing in the corner to avoid bumping into people .
When she did manage to move , she did so in a noticeably sideways gait that some likened to the motion of a crab , often knocking into furniture .
The First to Clean Her Clothes Long - Distance : Bess Truman ( first lady , 1945 " “ 1953 )
Upon finding out that she was going to become first lady , Bess Truman had the exact same reaction as her predecessor , Eleanor Roosevelt :
She wept .
Apparently , anything that kept Bess away from her home in Independence , Mo. , was cause for despair .
She had been in school in Kansas City when her father committed suicide in 1903 ( his drinking and debt had finally overwhelmed him ) , and thereafter had done everything possible to stay close to her family .
Despite her attempts , Bess never got used to life in Washington ; she even preferred the Laundromats back home .
Upon moving to D.C. , she was so unimpressed with the city 's cleaning establishments that she insisted on having her laundry mailed to Kansas City for washing .
The First to Sell White House Manure for Cash : Mary Todd Lincoln ( first lady , 1861 " “ 1865 )
During Abe 's re-election campaign in 1864 , Mary Todd Lincoln fretted — but not out of hope for her husband 's success .
An infamous shopoholic , Mary had run up tens of thousands of dollars in department store debt .
Should Abe win , she could sit on the expenses for a while .
But should he lose , the couple 's transformation into ordinary citizens would leave her no option but to tell him .
And , as it turned out , Mary knew all too well how Abe would react to her spending habits .
When she had overspent the congressional appropriation for White House furnishings within months of moving into the mansion , it left Abe fuming .
So , rather than turning to her husband for financial aid , Mary resorted to more creative tactics , such as selling off excess manure purchased for the fertilization of White House grounds and firing some of the mansion 's staff .

The First to Make Fun of the President 's Libido : Grace Coolidge ( first lady , 1923 " “ 1929 )
Calvin and Grace Coolidge did n't have one of the more romantic marriages on White House record .
Fortunately , they had a sense of humor about their love life .
According to biographer Carl Sferrazza
Anthony , the couple once visited a chicken farm in Maryland , where the first lady witnessed a rooster copulating with a hen .
Upon asking the farmer if the rooster did that often , Grace was informed that he did it several times a day .
" Tell that to the president , "  she responded , and the farmer did just that .
" To the same hen ? " 
Calvin inquired .
" No , Mr. President , "  said the red - faced farmer .
" Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge , "  said the president .
The First to Throw Glass in Stone Houses : Martha Washington ( first lady , 1789 " “ 1797 )
George Washington might have been America 's first president , but he could never claim the title of Martha 's first love .
Prior to Georgie , Martha had been married to a wealthy Williamsburg plantation heir named Daniel Parke Custis , who was a scandalous 20 years her senior .
While blissful for the most part , Martha and Daniel 's short marriage was saddled by the antics of Custis ' cantankerous father - in - law , John Custis IV , whom Martha absolutely abhorred .
Shortly after Daniel died ( only seven years into their marriage ) , she paid a not - so - friendly visit to the Williamsburg mansion that had been John 's main residence and auctioned off the remainder of her father - in - law 's valuable possessions .
Everything , that is , except for his priceless collection of hand - blown wineglasses .
Those she proceeded to smash in a spectacular act of vengeance .
The First to Don a Party Hat : Dolley Madison ( first lady , 1809 " “ 1817 )
One thing is certain about Dolley Madison :
The girl knew how to throw a party .
From the moment she stepped foot in the White House , the stiff , humorless receptions of her predecessors became a thing of the past .
At Dolley 's affairs , people mingled , joked , laughed , and treated themselves to ice cream .
Such graces were indispensable , but not only to her husband .
Dolley once got two congressmen , John Eppes and Thomas Randolph , to call off their duel over a nasty political argument .
When husband James died in 1836 , she moved back to the capital to resume her role as First Entertainer and was even granted an honorary seat in Congress ( by unanimous vote , no less ) .
In fact , until her death in 1849 , it was customary for newly inaugurated presidents to call on Dolley to receive her blessing .
The First to Be Suspected of Murder : Margaret Taylor ( first lady , 1849 " “ 1850 )
When Zachary Taylor passed away unexpectedly in 1850 , it hit his wife hard .
On several occasions , Margaret , saddened to the point of hysteria , pawed the preserving ice from his corpse so that she could gaze upon his frozen face .
She also did something slightly more questionable :
She refused to have him embalmed .
Such an unorthodox demand raised eyebrows , and a rumor quickly circulated that Margaret wanted to prevent anyone from learning that she 'd poisoned her husband .
Not until 1991 , when historians convinced Taylor 's descendants to exhume his remains , were the rumors finally put to rest .
The First to Show No Fear : Lou Henry Hoover ( first lady , 1929 " “ 1933 )
Lou Hoover was n't afraid to get her hands dirty .
Posted in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 , Lou actually joined in the action , delivering tea and other supplies to troops by bicycle .
In fact , on one trip , a stray bullet flattened her tire .
But even the Hoovers ' residence in China was n't safe from danger .
One day , Lou was playing solitaire when a shell burst through the window in the adjoining room and nearly blew the staircase apart .
When a group of witnesses rushed in to check on her safety , they saw her calmly sitting at the table with her cards .
She then asked them to join her for tea .
Not surprisingly , Lou 's obituary mistakenly appeared in a Peking newspaper .
Upon reading it , she was thrilled to discover that the editors had devoted three columns to her .
" I was never so proud in my life , "  she quipped .
The First to Lose a FiancÃ© to a Train : Nancy Reagan ( first lady , 1981 " “ 1989 )
If Nancy and Ronald Reagan are known for their intensely romantic relationship , it may be because of their decidedly tragic romantic pasts .
The two met when Ronald was recovering from his divorce from starlet Jane Wyman , and Nancy was coping with the loss of her fiancÃ© , who'd been atomized by a train while crossing a railroad track .
And even then , their relationship did n't get off to the most fairy - tale start .
Their courtship lasted two years , during which Nancy became pregnant with their first child .
Actor / friend William Holden and his wife Ardis were the only guests present at their 1952 wedding .
The First to Go Gray : Barbara Bush ( first lady , 1989 " “ 1993 )
Barbara
Bush got her trademark gray hair at quite an early age .
Unfortunately , the cause was tragic .
In 1953 , the Bushes ' first daughter , Robin , contracted leukemia .
The little girl spent eight months in a New York hospital , attended by her parents , until she died .
By the time of Robin 's death , Bar 's hair had gone gray .
The change likely did n't bother her much , though ; the former first lady had a great sense of humor about her appearance .
A master of self - deprecating humor , she once said of her predecessor , Nancy Reagan , " As you know , we have a lot in common .
She adores her husband ; I adore mine .
She fights drugs ; I fight illiteracy .
She wears a size three " ¦ so's my leg . " 

Trial date set for anti-war protesters
By Jennifer Golz Staff writer
Two anti-war protestors will have their day in court .
Sarah Hartfield , 45 , of Naperville , and Jeff Zurawski , 39 , of Downers Grove , are each facing up to a year in prison for hanging a sign that read “ Impeach Bush and Cheney – LIARS ” from the Great Western Trail above Interstate 355 .
Alongside the banner hung an upside - down American flag .
Neither were cited during the May 6 incident when an Illinois State Police trooper asked the duo to remove the sign as it could distract traffic , and even later when three DuPage County Sheriff ’s deputies arrived .
But three weeks later arrest warrants were issued for Zurawski and Hartfield on the charge of disorderly conduct .
Two more charges were brought against the war protestors in connection with the incident earlier this month : reckless conduct and unauthorized display of a sign in viewing of a highway , both misdemeanors .
Naperville environmental rights attorney Shawn Collins has taken on the case pro bono , as he believes the two are being prosecuted for their political beliefs .
Hartfield and Zurawski appeared Monday in DuPage County Circuit Court in Wheaton where their attorney , needing no pre-trial or status hearings , asked a jury trial be set for Oct. 15 .
“ These people need their day in court , ” Collins said .
Hartfield said she had hoped the charges against herself and Zurawski would have been dropped by now , but is ready to go to trial .
“ I ’m standing my ground , ”  she said .
“ I did nothing wrong and a jury will see that . ” 

The alone time zone 47 comments Latest by Joshua Volz
To Get Real , get alone .
37signals is spread out over 4 cities and 8 time zones .
From Provo Utah to Copenhagen Denmark , the five of us are 8 hours apart .
We embrace this constraint .
We ’re always looking to embrace constraints .
The presence of constraints make you creative .
The more constraints you lift , the less creative you become .
What ’s the side effect of being 8 time zones apart ?
Alone time .
There are about 4 - 5 hours during the day that we ’re all up and working together .
The other times we ’re sleeping while David is working .
And during the other times we ’re working while David is sleeping .
This gives us about half of the day together .
And half alone .
Guess which part of day we get the most work done ?
The alone part .
This is why many people prefer to work either in the early morning or the late nights — they ’re not being bothered .
And when you have a long stretch when you are n’t being bothered you can get in the zone .
The zone is when you are most productive .
It ’s when you do n’t have to mindshift between various tasks .
It ’s when you are n’t interrupted to answer a question or look up something or send an email or answer an IM .
The alone zone is where real progress is made .

On Monday July 15th 1907 an unusual bus picked up its first passengers at London 's Victoria Station before gliding smoothly off to Liverpool Street .
It was the beginning of what was then the world 's biggest trial of battery - powered buses .
The London Electrobus Company had high hopes that this quiet and fume - free form of transport would replace the horse .
At its peak , the company had a fleet of 20 buses .
But despite being popular with passengers the service collapsed in 1909 .
The history books imply that the collapse was caused by technical drawbacks and a price war .
It was not .
The untold story is that the collapse was caused by systematic fraud that set back the cause of battery buses by a hundred years .
London Transport Museum / Transport for London
Indeed , the London electrobus trial remained the largest for the rest of the 20th century .
Only recently has American interest in keeping city air clean encouraged trials on anything approaching the same scale .
For the past 15 years Chattanooga has had a dozen battery buses .
Today the world 's biggest fleet , excluding minibuses , is in Santa Barbara , California .
The city has 20 buses and is buying five more .
On any rational assessment of the technology the electrobus had a good chance of success .
The replacement of horses by internal - combustion engines may now look to have been inevitable , but it certainly did not seem so at the time .
At the beginning of 1906 there were only 230 motor buses in London .
They were widely reviled for their evil smells and noise .
At any one time a quarter of them were off the road for repairs .
In 1907 The Economist predicted “ the triumph of the horse ” .
The future of public - transport technology was up for grabs .
The paradox at the heart of the electrobus story is that the electrobuses themselves were well engineered and well managed .
All battery buses have a limited range because of the weight of their batteries .
The electrobus needed 1.5 tonnes of lead - acid batteries to carry its 34 passengers .
It could travel 60 km ( 40 miles ) on one charge .
So at lunchtime the buses went to a garage in Victoria and drove up a ramp .
The batteries , slung under the electrobus , were lowered onto a trolley and replaced with fresh ones .
It was an extremely slick operation that took three minutes .
“ It just goes to show there 's nothing new under the sun , ” says Mark Hairr , of the Advanced Transportation Technology Institute .
“ That 's almost exactly what we do here in Chattanooga .
And we knew nothing about this . ”
In April 1906 the London Electrobus Company floated its shares on the stockmarket .
It wanted £ 300,000 to put 300 buses on the streets of the capital .
On the first day the flotation raised £ 120,000 and the share offer was on course to be fully subscribed .
But the next day some awkward questions surfaced .
The company was buying rights to a patent for £ 20,000 ( £ 7.5 m , or $ 15 m , in today 's money ) from the Baron de Martigny .
But the patent was old and had nothing to do with battery buses .
It was worthless and a scam .
The investors sued for their money back .
The company had to return £ 80,000 .
The investors would have been even less impressed if they had had any clue about the identity of the “ Baron ” .
He was a Canadian music - hall artist living in theatrical digs in south London .
Martigny was only the front man .
The mastermind behind this and a clutch of subsequent scams was Edward Lehwess , a German lawyer and serial con-artist with a taste for fast cars and expensive champagne .
After this initial fiasco the London Electrobus Company struggled to raise money .
But Lehwess had set up a network of front companies to siphon off the company 's money .
Chief among these was the Electric Vehicle Company of West Norwood , which built the buses .
It was Lehwess 's private piggy - bank .
His personal secretary later said that Lehwess “ used the company 's banking accounts indiscriminately for his own purpose ” .
The London Electrobus Company paid the Electric Vehicle Company more than £ 31,000 in advance for 50 buses .
Only 20 were ever delivered .
The buses were extortionately overpriced — each one cost about £ 300 more than a motor bus .
On average Lehwess skimmed off £ 1 for every £ 3 that the company raised .
It was a rate of attrition that crippled the company and it went into liquidation .
Even then the scams continued .
Lehwess bought eight buses for £ 800 from the liquidators , saying they were only fit for spares .
He sold them to Brighton for £ 3,500 — a mark - up of 340 % — and they ran for another six years .
That was a testament to the electrobus 's reliability at a time when the life of a motor bus was measured in months .
Whether the fraud was truly a tipping point for electric vehicles is , of course , impossible to say .
But it is a commonplace of innovation — from railway gauges to semiconductors to software — that the “ best ” technology is not always the most successful one .
Once an industry standard has been established , it is hard to displace .
If Lehwess and Martigny had not pulled their scam when they did , modern cities might be an awful lot cleaner than they actually are .

Was there a White House plot to illegally suppress votes in 2004 ?
Is there a similar plan for the upcoming elections ?
This week NOW examines documents and evidence that points to a Republican Party plan designed to keep Democrats from voting , allegedly by targeting people based on their race and ethnicity with key battleground states like Ohio and Florida of particular interest .
“ It was a partisan , discriminatory attempt to challenge voters of color , ” Eddie Hailes , a senior attorney for The Advancement Project , a civil rights group , told NOW .
An investigator looking into claims of secret CIA prisons in Europe today said that people were apparently abducted and transferred between countries illegally .
Swiss senator Dick Marty told a news conference that he believed the United States was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in Europe but that claims about " extraordinary renditions " of prisoners , some of whom allegedly faced torture , had " credibility " .
He said he believes any prisoners who were held in eastern Europe - there have been claims about secret prisons in Romania and Poland - were moved to North Africa in early November , when reports about the secret detention centres appeared in the Washington Post .
In a written report , Sen Marty said that information gathered so far " reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transfer and temporary detention of individuals , without any judicial involvement , in European countries " .
" Legal proceedings in progress in certain countries seemed to indicate that individuals had been abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal standards , " he added in his findings presented in Paris to a committee of the Council of Europe , the continent 's human rights watchdog .
Sen Marty is investigating claims that the CIA transferred prisoners through European airports to secret detention centres , actions that would breach the continent 's human rights principles .
Poland and Romania have been identified by the New York - based Human Rights Watch as sites of possible CIA secret prisons , but both countries have repeatedly denied any involvement .
Sen Marty , in his report , added that it was " still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions " .
He was critical of the United States for not formally confirming or denying the allegations .
He said he " deplores the fact that no information or explanations " were provided by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , who faced repeated questions about the CIA prison allegations on her recent visit to Europe .
Sen Marty has requested air traffic log - books to try to determine flight patterns of several dozen suspected CIA aeroplanes .
He has also requested satellite pictures of the Sczytno - Szymany airport in north - east Poland and the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base in eastern Romania , after they were identified by Human Rights Watch as possible sites of clandestine CIA detention centres .
After hearing Sen Marty 's presentation , Tony Lloyd , a member of the Council of Europe committee , said , " The really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of Europe . "
Meanwhile today , a group of British MPs described as " worthless " the statements made by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , that there were no records of the CIA flying terror suspects through the UK to face torture elsewhere .
There have been claims that CIA flights carrying detainees had gone through UK airports , including RAF bases , on more than 200 occasions since the September 11 2001 attacks on the US .
Mr Straw insists , however , that extensive research indicates that there have been no requests from the Americans for such flights to pass through the UK during the presidency of George Bush , which started in January 2001 .
Sir Menzies Campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , is among a group of MPs who have set up the Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , which today criticised Mr Straw 's position .
The group said that an expert on international law who they had commissioned had said that Britain could not rely on US assurances that terror suspects sent to third countries do not face torture .
Professor James Crawford , of Cambridge University , said the UK must satisfy itself that " extraordinary rendition " of suspects does not put them at risk .
This afternoon , Mr Straw repeated his assurances that the UK was not complicit in torture and there was no evidence about any CIA flights .
He said there was no " secret conspiracy " and that unless people believed he and his US counterpart were lying , there was no truth in the allegations .
Mr Straw said there was no reason for a judicial - level investigation into the reports about renditions and said he did not know of the existence of any secret prisons in Europe .
Earlier , Andrew Tyrie , Conservative chairman of the Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , said Mr Straw 's words " should reassure nobody " .
He said : " It is crystal clear that the UK must investigate allegations that it has been complicit in torture .
Checking instances of the US requesting permission is simply derisory . "
French Finance Minister : Stop thinking while I sell this tax cut RAW STORY
Published : Saturday July 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Writes the New York Times in its Sunday edition , France 's government under Nicolas Sarkozy seeks to shift emphasis away from intellectualism and towards " working hard " with the hopes of getting rich .
Says Finance Minister Christine Lagarde : " Enough thinking , already .
Roll up your sleeves . "
# Excerpts : Ms. Lagarde knows well the Horatio Alger story of making money through hard work .
She looked west to make her fortune , spending much of her career as a lawyer at the firm of Baker & McKenzie , based in the American city identified by its broad shoulders and work ethic : Chicago .
She rose to become the first woman to head the firms executive committee and was named one of the worlds most powerful women by Forbes magazine .
So now , two years back in France , she is a natural to promote the program of Mr. Sarkozy , whose driving force is doing rather than musing , and whose mantra is work more to earn more .
 This is the sort of thing you can hear in cafe conversations from morons who drink too much ,  said [ philosoper - journalist Bernard - Henri ]
Lévy , who is so well - known in French that he is known simply by his initials B.H.L .
 To my knowledge this is the first time in modern French history that a minister dares to utter such phrases .
Im pro-American and pro-market , so I could have voted for Nicolas Sarkozy , but this anti-intellectual tendency is one of the reasons that I did not . "

Life goes in circles , or in spirals to be more precise .
Thus to get a glimpse of the future you perhaps should look in the past .
Computing has become an inseparable component of our lives and therefore is a subject to the same law of cycles and spirals .
So let 's start in the 1940s , at the dawn of electronic computing when ENIAC was a pinnacle of scientific engineering .
Initially occupying whole buildings , then scaling down to individual rooms and towering boxes computers of 1950s , '60s , and '70s were essentially mainframes : Large and powerful , special - purpose , accessible to few .
This centralized approach to computing changed dramatically in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s with the introduction of microcomputers such as Apple II and IBM PC .
All of a sudden computers ceased to be shared resources built for a particular purpose and instead became personal tools for facilitating general - purpose tasks and throughout ' 80s and '90s began to occupy our desktops , bedrooms and closets .
This trend of decentralized computing met a subtle reverse in '90s when the Internet and World Wide Web provided a means for integrating decentralized computational resources into a unified client - server environment .
In reality , what seems like 60 years of technological advancement represents a full evolutionary cycle :
We started with shared computational resources occupying rooms of equipment and through brief desktop detour arrived at shared computational resource model built on the backbone of intranet / Internet .
There is unquestionable numerical difference between what we 30 years ago and what we have now in the sense that computers now are used by much larger population and for a far wider range of tasks .
There is a characteristic difference too : we kept our desktop PCs and we use them for more then mere terminals .
In fact computing did not just come a full circle ; it came a loop of spiral :
We have not really come back to good old centralized computing but rather to arrived at distributed computing model .
Although a bulk of work may be done by centralized resources such as servers providing computational services , our desktop PCs and client workstations independently handle a multitude of tasks .
Our equipment rooms are different too from what we had decades ago : instead of one large computer modern day data centers are filled with hundreds and thousands of servers both rack mount and blades .
Such evolutionary change parallels that of the evolution of electronic components : Discrete elements were gradually replaced with integrated circuits just as individual mainframes are now replaced with blade server racks .
Extrapolating the parallel further we may expect even tighter - integrated " microblades " to arrive in the near future when we master computer integration to the same degree as we have mastered integrated circuits .

p :-> q
This is , as usual , a literate Haskell program .
So let me start withEveryone else is at it , so why not me ?
Here 's my approach to solving this problem .
Let 's warm up with a simpler menu .
Consider : Fries $ 3 Burger $ 5 What can I get that costs exactly $ 13 ?
My approach is going to revolve around rewrite rules .
I 'm going to find a set of rewrite rules that converts money into fries and burgers , and does so in such a way that it always eliminates the money , if it is possible to do so .
Let 's use D to represent a dollar , F to represent fries and B to represent a burger .
Here 's our first attempt at some rewrite rules :
DDD ->FDDDDD ->BNow we can take the string DDDDDDDDDDDDD and try to rewrite it .
We could start with the first rule : DDDDDDDDDDDDD->DDDDDDDDDDF->DDDDDDDFF->DDDDFFF->DFFFFBut now we 're stuck with a D and no way to get rid of it .
Before we go much further , however , it 's time to simplify our notation .
Firstly , unlike normal rewrite rules , we do n't care about the order of our symbols .
So let 's assume that we can reorder symbols any time we want in our strings and rules .
So FDD=DFD=DDF and so on .
Let 's also use Xto mean n copies of X in a row .
Now we can write our strings as mononomials in D , F and B .
That makes things much easier .
We can now write our rules as ->F->
BWe 've seen that just picking the first rule each time can get us stuck .
It seems that the solution should be to come up with an algorithm to generate the correct order .
But there 's another strategy - it's to modify the rules so that the order does n't matter .
A set of rules with this property is said to be confluent .
Amazingly you can turn any reasonable set of rewriting rules into a confluent one merely by adding in elements .
So let 's define a monomial type : Rewrite rules are simply pairs of monomials :
Now we can write code to apply these rules to a string .
The first function simply applies the rule to a term : searches for the first applicable rule in a list of rules : Andapplies it .
Note that it returns the result twice in a pair .
This is simply so that it works with the next function .
In the event that no rule is applicable it returnsrepeatedly appliesuntil it can be applied no more .
Repeatedly doing something untilis returned is best handled byNow consider our example rewrite rules .
Let 's find a simple example of where confluence fails to hold .
Consider two different ways to rewrite D . We could use the first rule and get D-> DF or use the second and get D-> B.
Either way we terminate - and get different results .
How can we get out of this impasse ?
There 's a really obvious solution , add in a new rule DF -> B .
Now if we start with Dand apply the first rule then we can get out of it by applying this new third rule .
Either way , we get B.
Before we generate new rules , we need to say something about how we can ensure termination .
If we have one rule that says X -> Y and another that says Y-> X then we 're going to get stuck .
So what we can do is insist on an ordering on our monomials .
We 'll restrict ourselves to rules where the left hand side is larger than the right hand side .
So here 's an ordering known to algebraists as lexicographic ordering .
The idea is that the symbols in the monomial have an ordering on them .
One monomial , a , is considered bigger than another , b , if the power of the least symbol ( in the symbol ordering ) in a /b is negative .
( BTW See postscript for a comment on this . )
What this means is that the rewrite rules will try to eliminate symbols earlier in the ordering and replace them with symbols that come later .
By making our currency symbol the first in the ordering the rewrite rules will tend to act so as to eliminate the currency .
And that 's what the original problem asked us to do .
Note that there are other orderings we could use so for generalityought to be a typeclass .
We also use a function to ensure that any rule is in canonical form with the greater term on the right :
If we find a complete confluent set of rules that respect the ordering in this way , how do we know the rules terminate ?
Suppose the complete ordered list of symbols in our rules is ( a , a , ... , a ) then any string a ... acan be written as a vector ( k , k , ... , k ) .
Each application of a rewrite rule replaces the corresponding vector with one that is lexicographically earlier .
It 's pretty clear that such a process must terminate .
( Aside :
You can think of this as using the fact that ωis well - ordered .
More general kinds of rewrite rules make use of more complex ordinals to prove termination .
This goes to show that ordinal arithmetic is actually a useful tool .
)
So back to what we were doing : finding how we can add new rules to ensure confluence .
Suppose we have two rules whose LHS ' overlap ' .
If we think in terms of monomials then we mean two monomials that have a non-trivial common factor .
If we form the lowest common multiple of these monomials then we now have a ' minimal ' term to which both rules can be applied .
In fact , that 's how I got the example above .
One rule has Pon the LHS and one has P .
The lowest common multiple of these is Pand I investigated how the two rules apply to this one term .
When we did this , we ended up with two different terms which we simply made into a new rule .
Here it is in Haskell : Given a rule , we also simplify the left and right hand sides with
The problem is that when we generate a new rule there now appear a whole bunch of new pairs that could be considered because you need to consider pairs made up of the new rule and all of the old rules .
Our strategy for dealing with this will be simple : take the list of all pairs of rules and generate new rules from those .
Every time we generate a new rule we need to add in the new rule pairs that are generated .
We maintain a list of pairs found so far , chewing pairs forfrom the front , and adding newly generated pairs to the back .
The first line is easy : We make all possible pairs .
We do n't want to consider pairs twice so we use the inherited ordering on pairs :
Here 's a little heuristic .
Things go faster if we use monomials that come lower in the ordering before higher ranking monomials .
So the completed set of rules is going to be sorted :
Now here 's a weird bit to explain .
This is n't essential to the mathematics but is is essential to this piece of code .
The local functionis going to return a pair that consists of the remaining list of rule pairs and the completed rules .
Butalso consumes rule pairs .
So this function is actually going to consume its own output .
There 's an important issue with this : eventually the rate of new rule creation will peter out so that it will consume its way to the end .
At this pointwill try to consume the very element it 's expected to generate and spin in an infinite loop .
( The dangers of unguarded recursion ! )
So we also maintain another list whose length is the same as the distance between the front and back of our pair list .
When this first list is empty , we know we can returnfor the second list .
It does n't matter what this list is , as long as it has the correct length .
This ' phantom ' list is the first argument to .
But for now I suggest ignoring it and coming back to it if you ever get to a second reading .
Here 's the base case I mentioned :
And here is the guts of the loop : is the first pair chewed off the front .
We generate a new rule from it and normalise it :
If we get a new rule we now need to add it to our list of rules , and add in all the new pairs it generates :
Note the use ofto maintain the order .
Otherwise we do n't need to generate anything :
Here 's where we tie the knot by feeding our output back in as input :
It 's not obvious at this point that the algorithm terminates .
It does , but you 'll have to trust me .
Anyway , that 's not all .
We also do a bit of tidying up by eliminating redundant rules .
In a confluent system , if there are two rules we can apply , it does n't matter which one we choose .
Now consider a pair of rules looking something like : ABC -> ... and AB -> ... .
If we can apply the second rule , then we could also apply the first rule .
But in a confluent system , it does n't matter which rule we choose .
So we can just throw out the second rule here .
So we tidy up our rules by eliminating rules made redundant by another .
Turns out that at this stage we have a canonical form .
For any given set of rules , any completion with the reducant elements deleted is the same as any other ( modulo reordering ) .
So our completion process is itself confluent !
This is n't hard to prove but I 'm not going to do it now .
And nowputs our rules into a complete canonical form : Back to the original problem :
Note that .
This is so that the lexicographic ordering above can work .
Now , some caveats .
I do n't claim that this is a fast method , just a different approach .
Completing a set of rules is an expensive operation and if you start with N rules , the worst case running time is something horrendous like O ( exp ( exp ( N ) ) .
On the other hand , once you 've found a set of canonical rules , reduction with them is very fast .
This makes it ideal for problems involving repeated use of the same menu .
Or for when you have a lot of spare cash :
And now I have a confession to make .
I 've really just described the Buchberger algorithm for Gröbner basis computation .
It 's not quite the Buchberger algorithm because I 'm only considering binomials , not polynomials - but you 'll notice my code is remarkably similar to the code at the other end of that link .
The rulerepresents the binomial p-q .
Unfortunately , the Buchberger algorithm is usually presented in its more general form - but understanding that requires a background in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry .
I hope I 've managed to present a form of it in a way that 's digestible by people without abstract algebra experience .
The binomial Buchberger algorithm has many applications , including a variety of applications in integer programming .
Note that this is also very close to the Knuth - Bendix algorithm .
However , the latter algorithm is for the noncommutative case , and it is n't guaranteed to terminate .
BTW I recommend playing with the completed rules by hand - at least for simple examples .
It 's interesting to see what steps are taken to reach the solution .
PS
My monomial ordering is the opposite of the usual lexicographic monomial ordering .
This is because I want my rules sorted with what is usually considered the largest monomial at the front .
PPS Can I get rid of that weird phantom list thing ?
You can replace the list with an integer for its length , but it 's not clear to me that this is an actual improvement .
Update : I forgot to mention this .
Check out David Amos 's implementation of the full Buchberger algorithm which you can use to solve many more problems than my simplistic monomial version .

The Supreme Court 's 5 - 4 decision in the Louisville and Seattle schools cases exposed one of the unspoken truths of American " constitutional law " : there is no law in this area .
Instead , there are only the justices ' naked political opinions .
Since 1954 's decision in Brown v. Board of Education , the Court has taken upon itself the task of superintending school assignment policies touching on race .
Yet , as the Court had said before 1954 , the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to ban race discrimination in school assignment — even racial segregation of schools .
In fact , the Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment established segregated schools in Washington , D.C.
The justices who wrote Brown , and thus " constitutionalized " the ban on school segregation , recognized this fact .
One of them , Justice Robert Jackson , called Brown " new law for a new day . "
The author of the Court 's opinion , Chief Justice Earl Warren , said the Court could not be bound by the intentions of people who had lived in 1868 .
But if the Court is not going to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause according to the intentions of the people who added it to the Constitution , how is it going to interpret it ?
This is one of the great fault lines in modern " constitutional law . "
Most conservative judges favor holding the Equal Protection Clause to be a general ban on race discrimination , with only limited exceptions .
Thus , Chief Justice Roberts said in this latest opinion that , " The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race . "
Roberts here is not applying an originalist interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause , which , again , clearly was not meant to ban all state government ( including local government ) race - conscious policies .
Instead , he is applying the understanding of Brown v. Board of Education that is current in conservative circles .
He is behaving , in other words , as if Brown itself were a constitutional amendment .
Liberal justices , led in this case by Clinton appointee Stephen Breyer , generally hold that Brown and its progeny committed the Court and the country to racial integration .
Ever since 1971's Swann v. Charlotte - Mecklenburg Board of Education decision , the Court 's liberal wing has supported race discrimination aimed at fostering integration .
( Beans must be counted before they can be sorted , that is . )
The liberal wing considers discrimination of this kind , whether in the form of busing , of racial exclusion , or of any of numerous other race - conscious policies , " benign . "
Thus , Breyer lamented that , " To invalidate the [ school - assignment ] plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown . "
Not " of the Fourteenth Amendment , " but " of Brown . "
Why ?
Because Brown had nothing to do with the Fourteenth Amendment .
Brown was an innovation , and the integrationist current in constitutional law is traceable to that decision , not to the Fourteenth Amendment — to the judges , not the people .
In this latest decision , Justice Anthony Kennedy followed former Justice Lewis Powell in holding to a middle view that would allow racial discrimination in the name of " diversity . "
Powell , a product of segregated Virginia , did not have any problem with government race discrimination , so long as the purpose was " good . "
As Kennedy put it , " A district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population .
Race may be one component of that diversity . "
What legal argument did Kennedy offer in support of this pronouncement ?
None .
In fairness , however , none was all he had .
In fact , none of these three views — the conservatives ' color - blind view , the liberals ' integrationist view , or the Kennedy / Powell diversity view — makes any mention of the original understanding of the Equal Protection Clause .
The reason for that is simple .
It is that Brown v. Board of Education was an instance of judicial legislation , plain and simple , and none of the three positions staked out by the current justices has any relationship to the Equal Protection Clause 's actual meaning .
Brown really was " new law for a new day , " and this revision of the Constitution was entirely the act of federal judges .
In a governmental system in which judges did not feel free to overturn the constitutional intentions of the people , the Equal Protection Clause would be held to be , as Jackson and Warren conceded it was intended to be , irrelevant to school assignment .
The Fourteenth Amendment , in other words , does not ban racial segregation , and it does not ban race - based school assignment in the name of " diversity . "
It simply does not speak to this issue .
In case the Court made this honest proclamation , the political process would soon yield a new amendment banning segregation of schools .
That new amendment 's legislative history , its actual language , would give the justices something to follow in considering race - conscious school - assignment policies other than their own naked political preferences .
Then , instead of being subject to the moral ruminations and political preferences of John Roberts , or Anthony Kennedy , or Stephen Breyer , Americans would be governed by constitutional law of their own creation .
If elected officials resolved this issue , in other words , Americans would have republican government in this area , and not arbitrary government by unelected , unaccountable , politically connected lawyers called Supreme Court justices .

Here ’s a cool picture of a Martian dust devil , captured by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
This little dust devil has nothing to do with the dust storm that ’s currently ravaging the Red Planet .
The image was captured about a month ago in the southern hemisphere , near Hellas Planitia during the Martian mid-afternoon .
Dust devils like this form when the temperature on the ground is much warmer than the air above .
The hot air rises , and then in the right conditions , starts to twist into a vortex that sucks in more warm air .
If the vortex can get strong enough , it ’ll suck dust off the ground , and create a dust devil .
From this vantage point , the dust devil appears to be about 200 metres ( 660 feet ) across , but it ’s probably much smaller where it touches the surface of Mars .
Seen from the ground , it would look like a dusty tornado reaching about 500 metres ( 1,600 feet ) high .

Links remain as important to SEO success as ever .
If not for SEO professionals , who would get a handle on how links help navigate the vastness of the internet , enabling new models of social and commercial engagement ?
SEO pros understand the importance of every link , but they also realize that all links are not created equal .
With internal , external , and backlinks in our toolbox , we are well aware that only the right mix of links results in higher search rankings and tons of traffic .
However , one question remains :
How much credit do nofollow links get ?
This article will try to answer this question and explain why nofollow links may be beneficial to a site ’s visibility in search engines .
Followed vs. Nofollowed Links :
What ’s the Difference ?
Search engines follow ( i.e. , crawl ) every link by default , unless you tell them otherwise .
You can tell search engines not to follow a certain link is by using the nofollow attribute , a snippet of HTML code that looks like this :
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
< a href = ” http://www.example.com/” rel= ” nofollow ” >
Google is n’t likely to punish you as long as the links you place in your content are useful , relevant , and valuable .
Should you put a thank - you post or a review of an impressive product on your site , nobody is going to report you .
However , there are times when you should nofollow links .
When to Nofollow Links
To avoid Google taking manual action on your site , make sure that you nofollow links in the following cases :
1. Paid Links
In the event you agree to put a paid link on your site , be sure to clarify that you will nofollow it .
Google advises against paid links ; thus , if you do n’t want to feel the wrath of Google , nofollow all paid links .
2. Product Links
It is pretty much the same story with links you agree to place on your website in exchange for a product or service .
Should you decide to use a few of these links , nofollow them .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
3. Paid Review Links
You should always nofollow links that are featured in paid reviews of products or services .
If you receive a product or service for review , failing to nofollow the links could be a costly mistake .
4. Affiliate Links
All affiliate links should be nofollowed by default .
Google recognizes that these links have the potential to generate revenue and they do not want to provide additional benefits to sites that engage in affiliate schemes .
5. Links from Untrustworthy Sites
Nofollow links to untrustworthy websites , sites in known spammy industries , or any poor content .
Linking to low - quality websites could hurt your organic search rankings .
6. Noindexed Links
If you noindex a link , make sure to nofollow it as well .
You do n’t want to allow low - quality link equity flowing to your site .
7. Links Used in Widgets & Images
Nofollow links featured in widgets and images you offer to embed on third - party websites , such as logos , icons , shareable design elements , etc .
Google will probably view this a link scheme .
8. Guest Post Links
Google has issued several warnings against guest posting for SEO over the years .
If you want to remain on Google ’s good side , nofollow is your best option .
9. Admin Pages
You do want or need Google to crawl your login , cart , privacy , terms of use , and other related pages .
Make sure that they are nofollowed by default .
10 . Social Media Buttons
Social media sharing buttons should also be nofollowed .
While Google wo n’t punish for it , you never want to drive valuable link equity to third - party websites ( especially if these sites are huge social media platforms ) .
Why Nofollow Links Matter
Google says it does n’t transfer PageRank or anchor text across links with a nofollow attribute .
However , the search giant does n’t always follow its own rules :
In general , we do n’t follow them .
This means that Google does not transfer PageRank or anchor text across these links .
Rumor has it that this “ in general ” remark indicates that sometimes Google makes an exception to follow and count links with a nofollow tag .
This may be the case with Wikipedia , for example .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
Though every link placed on Wikipedia is a nofollow link by default , my personal experience is that backlinks from Wikipedia can work miracles for a site ’s SERPs .
Most likely , Google ’s thought is that a high - quality website like Wikipedia cannot afford to link to spammy , low - quality websites ( which is true ) , and automatically counts its links to adjust SERPs .
Actually , Rand Fishkin has already tested this assumption and arrived at the very same conclusion : top - tier websites impact a site ’s SERPs , even though their links feature a nofollow attribute .
Apparently , links from trustworthy websites make a difference no matter what tag you put on them .
However , even if we assume that nofollow renders any link from any website useless in terms of visibility in search engines , links still function as paths to your website .
Links bring traffic and potential users who you still can try to convert into customers .

Nofollow Links : Case Study
Now it ’s time to prove the benefits of nofollow links with actual figures .
One of my SEO clients has experienced a steady growth of high - quality traffic flowing to their website , primarily due to a continuous growth of nofollow links .
Here are several stats to consider ( as of November 2017 — Ahrefs report ) :

Total links — 12,175
Followed links — 3,922
Nofollowed links — 8,151
Percent of nofollowed links — 67 percent
Top 3 positions — 91
4-10 positions — 250
11 -50 positions — 3,706
From January 2017 to July 2017 , where most of the efforts were put to use , the total number of sessions grew from 11 , 573 to 17,119 — 67 percent ; organic traffic increased by 69 percent and referral traffic by a staggering 340 percent .
The screenshots below demonstrate the dynamics :
Within this period , 90 percent of all marketing activities pretty much concerned content and nofollow links , and the client ’s site still enjoyed a considerable increase in organic search visibility ( the top 3 positions ticked up by 28 ) and traffic ( though there were several dips in organic traffic ) .

I ’m not the only one who believes that nofollow links have value , as long as you are building them the right way .
Fractl shared two case studies showing the awesome power of nofollow links .
And this Moz post makes another great argument for the power of nofollow links .
Conclusion
As SEO professionals , we strive to drive as much link equity to our websites as possible .
However , we do not live in a perfect world .
Some of our links get nofollowed .
But as this post shows , this is n’t the end of the world .
Nofollowed links have many virtues .
They :
Increase awareness .
Build trust .
Drive an audience to your website .
Moreover , every nofollow link proves that your site and your content are up to snuff .
Otherwise , nobody would place links to your site .
So next time you see a nofollowed link to your site , do n’t complain or get frustrated .

Even if nofollow links do n’t directly help your SEO , they are still a valuable engagement and conversion tool .
Just make the most of every nofollow link , and you will make a difference in traffic and ranking , one way or another .

Scarecrows work on people too
As a child , I first realized how dumb birds must be when I saw my first scarecrow .
How could the birds ’ behavior be so radically affected by something that is obviously fake ?
Now a new study suggests that humans ( at least psychology professors ) do n’t behave much differently .
From the writeup about the article :
Melissa Bateson and colleagues at Newcastle University , UK , put up new price lists each week in their psychology department coffee room .
Prices were unchanged , but each week there was a photocopied picture at the top of the list , measuring 15 by 3 centimetres , of either flowers or the eyes of real faces .
The faces varied but the eyes always looked directly at the observer .
In weeks with eyes on the list , staff paid 2.76 times as much for their drinks as in weeks with flowers .
“ Frankly we were staggered by the size of the effect , ” Gilbert Roberts , one of the researchers , told New Scientist .
A few thoughts :
1 ) These psychologists are a lot less honest on average than the Bagel Man ’s customers that we write about in Freakonomics .
They pay almost 90 % of the posted price on average .
For the payments to jump almost three - fold in the experiment here , the psychologists could n’t have been paying more than about 30 % of the posted price .
2 ) There is an earlier study that finds a similar result : when people play trust games in lab experiments using a computer , putting an eye on the screen has the same sort of effect .
3 ) The article goes on to say the following :
It could have far - reaching implications .
In previous experiments , people consistently appeared to behave more generously than they needed to for their own self - interest , even when told their actions were anonymous .
This has led an influential school of economists to argue that altruism in humans is innate , rather than being based on cynical self - interest .
But if just a photocopied pair of eyes can treble honesty , the Newcastle team suspects that these previous experiments may somehow have been spoiled by subliminal cues that made people feel they were being watched .
In other words , self - interest may play a large part after all , with people feeling the need to be seen as honest .
“ Those results might need to be re-examined , ” says Roberts .
Indeed , in a new working paper I have written with John List , we argue exactly this point .
We believe that both theory and evidence suggests that what we learn in the lab , in many cases , will not be readily generalizable to naturally - occurring environments .
The “ scrutiny ” of the lab is one reason .
We provide others as well .
Often on the internet , you find various vociferous and vitriolic critisims of the Bush / Cheney / Rumsfield policy towards their desperate and duplicitous wars .
While many of these make very valid points , they all fall victim to a single rebuttal .
We can sucintly describe the rebuttal as follows , " What the hell do you know ?
You are a receptionist at a dental office ! "
So I thought I would write an article but I ’d use someone else ’s arguments .
Perhaps someone with titles like " God of War " , " Master of Strategy " , and " Undisputed Greatest General in Human History who ’s Book is Nearly as Well Printed as the Bible ! "
A guy like that would bring some real credibility to the argument , you know ?
I ’ll stop belaboring the point .
Sun Tzu and his Art of War stand peerless in the domain of strategy .
If the Chinese cultural inertia did n’t value the past so highly and instead ran forward with his ideas , they would have perhaps found game theory , probability theory , baysean reasoning amongst other inventions 2000 years before their time .
We would all speak Chinese today , unquestionably .
Indeed the Chinese were so blinded by his brilliance that the aformentioned ideas have western names .
Rome +
Sun Tzu +
Oil = American Empire may be the historical lesion of the Twentith Century .
To almost any casual observer , America has lost the Sun Tzu part of the equation in the 21st century .
And from this observation , we get the critiques that fall to the above ad hominem .
To counteract this , I thought it may help to strengthen the argument by an appeal to an authority who ’s war logic has stood unquestioned and unmatched for thousands of years .
Of course , I jest .
It is his logic that I appeal to as well as yours .
This article will present quotes from Sun Tzu and will juxtapose them against the actions of the US administration to prove that they have marched America down the path to failure .
I implore you to read the Art of War and come to full understanding of these arguments .
They serve as THE most important weapon in proving the failure of the Bush policy .
Sun
Tzu said :
In the practical art of war , the best thing of all is to take the enemy 's country whole and intact ; to shatter and destroy it is not so good .
So , too , it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it , to capture a regiment , a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them .
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence ; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy 's resistance without fighting .
The title given to this chapter is " Offensive Strategies " or " Attack by Stratagem . "
The opening quote shows quite well that the American strategy of attack was doomed to failure from the beginning .
The basic strategy of the US was " Destroy all infrastructure and shatter the Iraqi army .
Remove Saddam as the head of the government .
Replace with Democracy .
Shake , do not stir . "
Sun
Tzu clearly shows us that the high level strategy of the Bush administration does not meet the standards of supreme excellence .
That which is without supreme excellence will soon fail .
By ruining Iraq and Afganistan , the Bush administration has sown the seeds of its own failure .
Sun
Tzu said :
Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy 's plans ; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy 's forces ; the next in order is to attack the enemy 's army in the field ; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities .
We again see that the Bush administration ’s plans fall into what Sun Tzu considered the WORST POLICY of warfare .
The Bush administration STARTED at the second worst strategy and then they DESCENDED into using the worst strategy , namely attacking and routing cities .
Sun
Tzu said :
Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy 's troops without any fighting ; he captures their cities without laying siege to them ; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field .
The Bush administration has failed on the first point .
They have failed on the second point .
They have failed on the third point .
In no way does the Bush form of warfare count as skillful by the standards of Sun Tzu .
Unskillful warriors may win some victories .
Anyone who has played a player vs player fighting game knows that a button masher can get some victories .
Especially if they are playing Eddie , the overpowered Tekken character that still fervors the dreams of button mashers everywhere .
The Bush administration can go a LONG way with button mashing , but eventually those without skill get defeated by those with skill .
Sun Tzu :
There are three ways in which the ruler can wreak havoc upon his own army .
Firstly , by not having a good grasp at the prevailing circumstances , he orders an attack or retreat when the real situation demands otherwise .
This action cripples the army .
Again .
Given that the current administration considers any tactical or strategic retreat as " cut and run " , they only have one option in the war , endless attack .
Sun
Tzu rightly points out that this cripples the army .
If you can only perform one action , you can never nimbly outfox your opponents .
Your opponents know what ’s coming , you have no tricks !
I feel it important to note that the Bush administration has committed an error here which Sun Tzu considers will " wreak havoc " on the army .
He contends that our army has been " crippled " by these actions .
As time goes on , this become more and more difficult to hide , but the course of events that we see unfolding come DIRECTLY from these failures .
Moreover , since the argument for war was the WMD fraud , we can say that the Bush administration could n’t possibly know when or where to properly attack , as their policy was based on lies .
Sun Tzu : Secondly , by being ignorant of the complexity of military internal affairs , he recklessly interferes with the administration .
This causes confusion within the rank and file .
We have heard countless complaints from the generals that the Rumsfield has interfered with the military ’s planning .
To a military novice , you may not really grasp the incredible importance of these news reports .
Those people hear , " Rumsfield did n’t plan the war correctly . "
Those with knowledge of military affairs think , " The politicians and policy makers are planning the WAR ?!?! "
Rumsfield may have spent a lot of time around the pentagon , but he is no soldier .
Neither is Bush , nor Cheney .
They in fact should have NOTHING to do with planning war .
Wars should be planned by generals and generals alone .
By interfering with the operation of the military , the Bush administration has found a second way to " wreak havoc " upon the US forces .
Sun Tzu :
Thirdly , by not knowing the importance of military expediency , he intervenes in the assignment of military forces .
This will beget uncertainty and distrust .
Again , Rumsfield and the Bush team have assumed direct control over a wide variety of military affairs and we do n’t even question WHY we allow them to assign where and what our troops are doing .
We see this very clearly in the movement away from the Bush administrations positions from former and even current troops .
Can anyone truly believe that this attitude will not " wreak havoc " upon the US ?
Sun Tzu :
Once your own army is confused , invasion from neighbouring states becomes dangerously imminent .
This is the classic case of sowing discord among your own army and giving away the advantage to your enemy .
Sun
Tzu could not have any clearer position on the outcome of the Bush policy .
Think about this ,
He lived 2500 years ago and this mistake had been committed so many times that he felt it was one of the CLASSIC ways of loosing in war .
We see more and more states rise up against the US as the Bush administration weakens US strength .
Tellingly , I ’ve also seen the last line translated as " This is simply bringing anarchy into the army , and flinging victory away . "
Sun Tzu :
Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory : ( 1 ) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight .
( 2 ) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces .
( 3 ) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks .
( 4 ) He will win who , prepared himself , waits to take the enemy unprepared .
( 5 ) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign .
Firstly we note that these five things are ESSENTIAL for victory .
You cannot have victory if you lack any ONE of these things .
I will show how the Bush Administration does not meet ANY of theses qualifications .
Bush claimed that he had to go to war because of Iraqi WMD’s .
All of the weapons inspectors , who were in a position to know , disagreed .
The US may have had to go to war for other reasons , but as the fight was pitched it shows that the Bush administration does not know when to fight .
He engages in optional wars and that means the Bush administration misses on of the ESSENTIAL properties of victory .
We knew how to handle the superior forces of Saddam and for that reason we find that part of the war went swimmingly well .
We however categorically did NOT know how to fight the " inferior forces " of gurella warfare .
Again , we failed to achieve another one of the ESSENTIAL factors of victory .
We have seen reports that because of the vauge and misleading reasons given for the Iraqi invasion , we have troops questioning the war .
We have generals and advisors critical of the plan for the very reasons Sun Tzu would feel critical of the Bush plan .
The critisim has a very valid justification .
And because that fact has validity that inflicts a mortal wound upon the Bush administration plan by causing dissention in the ranks .
The US itself did prepare very well .
We had 50 years of cold war prepairation just itching to get some use .
We nearly find an ESSENTIAL element that the Bush administration actually almost accomplished , or could at least take some small claim for .
However the Bush administration failed the latter part of the condition , as they trumpeted how they were going to " punk " Saddam .
Saddam ’s troops then hid large caches of the weapons and Saddam ’s Army put up a nominal resistance until the dispersing of his troops into the terrorist underground .
The US forces then easily won , and promptly dispursed the remainder of the Iraqi army into the terrorist underground .
Sun
Tzu describes this Bush administration mistake as well .
Sun
Tzu says :
The captives should be treated kindly and absorbed into the ranks .
This is the way of winning the battle and expanding your force at the same time .
As the aftermath has shown , the Bush administration was not prepared , they only though they were .
They prepared for the wrong thing .
And here we see the final ESSENTIAL failure of the Bush administration .
Their interference with everything has put the US forces in jeapordy .
Has anyone else noticed that things started to go downhill in Iraq right about the time that Bush showed up on that aircraft carrier ?
The postwar phase is repleat with examples of interference .
With this final failure , we find that the Bush administration ’s plans meet none of the requirements for victory .
Sun Tzu : 18 .
Hence the saying :
If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles .
If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat .
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself , you will succumb in every battle .
The Bush administration has failed to understand the enemy it faced .
From this , we can see that Sun Tzu would feel that the initial victory over Saddam would be replaced by a defeat at the hands of revolt .
Sun
Tzu said :
In waging a war one must always attempt to score a swift victory .
Protracted battles will frustrate the soldiers and diminish their morale .
Besieging a fortified city will sap an army ’s strength to exhaustion .
Sending an army on a long expedition will bankrupt the country .
Exhausted and demoralised troops coupled with depleted national resources presents an opportunity for neighbouring feudal warlords to attack you as you are now most vulnerable .
Even if you have the most able commander , he will not be able to avert the disastrous consequences under such circumstances .
I find myself taken again by the surprise of finding " There ’s nothing new under the sun ! "
The laws of war have not changed since Sun Tzu marched on field , only the weapons have .
The Iraqi war is not swift .
It has a grueling protracted daily battle .
It besieges cities .
It is on a long of a mission as possible .
Sun
Tzu sums it up , the Bush administration cannot avert " disasterous consequences . "
The Bush administration tried to sell this Iraqi adventure as " The Long War . "
Sun
Tzu would have laughed himself to death if he heard that expression !
It does not exits , this " Long War . "
Sun
Tzu clearly points out in the following quotes that " The Long War ’s " true name is " The Long Self - Destruction . "
Sun Tzu :
Thus , I have learnt that although an incompetent commander will try to score a quick victory , I am yet to witness a clever commander who deliberately prolongs a war .
To engage in an interminable war and simultaneously bring benefit to the nation is not possible .
Therefore , if one does not anticipate all the pitfalls of war , in particular the problems of protracted conflict , then one would not appreciate the benefits of military expediency and a swift victory .
Sun Tzu : 5 . Thus , though we have heard of stupid haste in war , cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays .
6 . There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare .
7 . It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on .
Sun Tzu :
Therefore , I have heard of military campaigns that were clumsy but swift , but I have never seen military campaigns that were skilled but protracted .
No nation has ever benefited from protracted warfare . ?
Therefore , if one is not fully cognizant of the dangers inherent in doing battle , one cannot fully know the benefits of doing battle .
The previous three translations leave little room for doubt in how Sun Tzu felt about any " Long War . "
A " Long War " does not exist and cannot exist .
The longer the Bush administration continues along its current path , the more " havoc " the US forces will see .
And it is important to point out that this does not come from a vested political interest but the cold logic of warfare itself , as embodied in a distant voice from our past .
By failing to recognize the cold realities of war , by engaging in fantasy , and by not listening to any critisims , the Bush administration CANNOT attain victory from this or any other war .
The Bush administration ’s mentality has no compatibility with a mentality for victory .
THEY HAVE CHOSEN THE PATH OF LOSERS !
Sun Tzu : 19 .
In war , then , let your great object be victory , not lengthy campaigns .
20 .
Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people 's fate , the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril .
Sun
Tzu has shown us that our leaders cannot achieve any lasting victory with their mentality .
In this quote , he speaks directly to us .
He says that because the decisions of these people cause either victory or defeat , that they then are the arbiter of our fate .
He cautions by letting us know that we are in peril as long as the Bush administration control the war .
Sun
Tzu said :
The ability to foresee victory as proficiently as an ordinary militarist ’s does not represent the pinnacle of excellence .
Nor does receiving universal acclaim for winning a war present the ultimate achievement .
It is as much to say that to lift a single hair is no sign of great strength , to be able to see the sun or the moon is no test of eagle eyesight , or to hear thunder is no mark of keen hearing .
The able commander of antiquity won the war with ease .
As a consequence the able commander ’s victory was so unremarkable ; and he was not renowned for his wisdom or his courage .
His victory was unerringly assured .
This means that the measured he had taken would definitely result in victory because he prevailed over an enemy that has already lost .
Hence the commander first creates and maintains his own invincibility .
He will not miss any opportunity to defeat the vulnerable enemy .
Therefore , the victor creates the conditions for victory before he enters the fray ; the vanquished fights first and then tries to work out how to win the battle .
The able commander follows the way of the Dao to boost army morale and uphold the rules and regulations .
This is why he is able to decisively determine the outcome of war .
By understanding the rules of war , a commander can determine victory or defeat even before the battle begins .
However Sun
Tzu says there exists a class of people called " the vanquished . "
These people fight first then try to determine how to win .
Sun
Tzu clearly shows us that the Bush administration belongs to " the vanquished . "
We follow them only to our ruin .
Sun Tzu :
Therefore , the adept warrior who is capable of initiating the enemy will either create a deception to precipitate his enemy into unnecessary action or offer a gambit , which his enemy simply cannot refuse .
In short , he provides the enemy with some apparent advantage to lure him into a deadly trap : an ambush by his overwhelming force .
The Bush administration took the bait of attacking a weak Iraq only to find itself fighting a growing insurgency .
The deal looked so good to the Bush administration , that they forgot the basic strategies for victory and hence brought about the ruin of US forces .
If the Bush administration had adeptness in warfare , they would have recognized this as many of the generals that disagreed with their plans did .
Sun Tzu : Utilising strategic potential in the deployment of troops is akin to setting logs and boulders rolling .
The tendency of the logs and boulders is to remain still on level ground but to keep rolling down a slope .
Square objects quickly come to a halt but round ones will continue to roll .
In the case of the victor , the momentum unleashed from capitalising on strategic potential coupled with the skilful deployment of troops is like setting huge round boulders tolling down a mountainous slops of great height .
The force generated by such momentum is truly awesome .
If we have understood anything about Sun Tzu ’s view on the Bush administration ’s plans it is that he feels they have very , very low strategic potential .
Hence the momentum he speaks of here is the momentum of the enemies of the Bush administration .
Iraq will and must spiral out of control as long as the Bush administration remains .
Like a law of nature , it crushes US troops and imparales the entire world .
Sun Tzu :
Therefore , when confronted by a general skilled at offensive manoeuvres , his enemy does not know how to mount an effective defence ; when faced by a commander proficient in defence , his enemy does not know where to attack .
The art is so subtle and obscure , it leaves no trace ; it is so mysterious and incomprehensible , it conceals all portents .
This is why the adept commander becomes the arbiter of his enemy ’s fate .
His advance cannot he stopped because he directs his attack at the most vulnerable area .
He can not be pursued because he bolts so rapidly that his retreat becomes unreachable .
Therefore , if I want to engage the enemy , even if he is safely housed in the strongest fortress surrounded by the deepest moat , he must come out and fight me .
I go for the strategic spot where he must come to wrestle .
If I decide not to fight , even though I only draw a line on the ground , the enemy will not cross it .
I have created enough mayhem to stop him from proceeding .
We find here that the enemies of the Bush administration do clearly understand Sun Tzu ’s point .
The previous description could have come out of any Iraqi newspaper about insurgency tactics .
This should frighten anyone remotely knowledgable about military affairs .
It seems obvious that the generals that have come out against the Bush administration know this , as well as the insurgency .
Remember this well , generals would not rag on a " war " president unless they felt critical and lasting mistakes were being made .
Sun
Tzu helps us understand why the generals feel this way .
Sun Tzu :
Therefore , if I can force my enemy to adopt a certain formation while I remain uncommitted , I will have an obvious advantage : my force is totally consolidated while his will be dispersed .
My force remains an integral whole while his forces are splintered into tenths .
By attacking with a force ten times more than the enemy ’s , I will enjoy an overwhelming superiority in number .
The end result is that I will face a much smaller enemy force , in comparison , in any conflict .
Where I choose to fight the battle is unbeknownst to the enemy ; thus he will have to make numerous contingency plans .
By making more plans and preparations , he will have fewer troops available to engage me in any single conflict .
We see newspaper article with quotes like " stretched thin " but unless we truly understand the art of war , we cannot know how critical these sorts of dangers are .
The troops have to go out of their bases , and they cannot do so as battalions due to the security nature of their mission .
We have seen that the insurgents make very good use of the laws of war to achive goals that would be impossible if the Bush administration had any clue as to what the laws of war are .
Fantasy is a poor strategy for warfare .
We forget this historical lesson at our peril .
Sun Tzu :
The nature of an effective military tactics is like the flow of water .
Water runs away from the higher ground and gravitates to the lower ; the essence of sound military tactics is to avoid the invincible and attack the vulnerable .
Water follows the contour to chart its course while consummate military tacticians capitalise upon the enemy ’s mistakes and weaknesses to achieve victory .
As such , sound military tactics has no fixed array or disposition , just like water , which his constantly changing its shape .
The ability to respond continually to changing enemy ’s tactics and achieve a final victory is truly marvellous .
Nothing is constant or absolute : as with the five elements , no single element can claim supremacy over the rest .
As with the four seasons , each comes and goes in turn .
Some days are long and some are short ; similarly , the moon waxes and wanes in a cyclic fashion .
dfdf
The Bush administration only deals in absolutes .
Their war policies come fixed from on high and never change .
If the Bush administration continues to control the course of the war , the insurgents will only achieve greater and greater victories .
This fact does not come out of any sort of misguided politics but the laws of war itself .
Sun Tzu : 21 .
The natural formation of the country is the soldier 's best ally ; but a power of estimating the adversary , of controlling the forces of victory , and of shrewdly calculating difficulties , dangers and distances , constitutes the test of a great general .
22 .
He who knows these things , and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice , will win his battles .
He who knows them not , nor practices them , will surely be defeated .
Sun
Tzu ’s words have shown that the Bush administration fails his test of generalship .
The Bush administration cannot win .
It can not win for the same reason that you cannot jump to the moon .
Jumping to the moon is n’t physically possible for humans nor is fighting " Long Wars " with none of the essential conditions for victory .
The Bush administration ’s defeat comes not from outside , but from within .
Sun
Tzu lays out the consequences very succinctly and shows us that the great generals have a human side .
Sun Tzu : 21 .
But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being ; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life .
22 .
Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful , and the good general full of caution .
This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact .
But no one ever accused anyone in the Bush administration of " enlightenment " or " heedfulness . "
If you retain this information , you will have the ability to show why the Bush administration policy towards war cannot succeed .
By retaining this information , you can overcome any objection when you present your case that the Bush policy makes the US much less safe .
You can prove that they in possess none of the essential elements for victory .
You can prove that the Bush administration ’s interference in the Army ’s business costs American lives .
You can prove that the Bush administration ’s plan can ONLY bring about more harm .
You can prove that every single day that Bush remains in power , the prospects for this world grow dimmer and dimmer .
I feel it important to note that you cannot construe this argument as " cut-and - run " .
Know well this one thing , the US administration has ALREADY LOST the war in Iraq .
They have lost it due to their lack of knowledge about warfare .
The only question we can ask is , " Do we want any of our troops there to return alive ? "
If you say , " Yes , we want them back alive , " then you must agree to help them return from their defeat .
It is not their fault that they were defeated , because an army is only as good as its leaders .
Will you prove these things ?
Will you wake those around you to this madness ?
Each day passed diminishes this world as these Bush administration failures cost lives .
Will enough people wake up so that the Democratic Empire of the Americas can return to the Constitutional Republic of the United States of America , where there is freedom and justice for ALL .
No nation in history has ever pulled back from the brink of its self - inflicted nightmare .
But I believe that the people in the US are a very special people .
The people of the US will be the first people in history to realize they are not special and the rules of history and warfare do apply to themselves .
We will be the first nation in history to pull back from the abyss and right the wrongs we have committed .
We will educate the world , uplifiting all societies .
We will respect all other cultures and teach tolerance and understanding .
We will do these things out of enlightented self - interest .
Because if we do not do these things , we will not survive the consequences of the Bush administration ’s policy .

In new research , male circumcision is found to be much less important as a deterrent to the global AIDS pandemic than previously thought .
The author , John R. Talbott , has conducted statistical empirical research across 77 countries of the world and has uncovered some surprising results .
The new study finds that the number of infected prostitutes in a country is the key to explaining the degree to which AIDS has infected the general population .
Prostitute communities are typically very highly infected with the virus themselves , and because of the large number of sex partners they have each year , can act as an engine driving infection rates to unusually high levels in the general population .
The study has a number of important findings that should impact policy decisions in the future .
First , male circumcision , which in previous studies had been found to be important in controlling AIDS , becomes statistically irrelevant once the study controls for the number of prostitutes in a country .
The study finds that the more Muslim countries of North Africa do indeed suffer much less AIDS than southern and western Africa , but this lower prevalence is not due to higher numbers of circumscribed males in these Muslim communities , but rather results from the fact that there are significantly fewer prostitutes in northern Africa on a per capita basis .
It appears that religious families in the north , specifically concerned fathers and brothers , do a much better job protecting their daughters from predatory males than do those in the south .
A history of polygamy in these Muslim communities does not appear to contribute to higher AIDS prevalence as previously speculated .
In a frequently cited academic paper , Daniel Halperin , an H.I.V. specialist at the Harvard Center for Population and Development and one of the world 's leading advocates for male circumcision , weighted results from individual countries by their population .
When this artificial weighting was removed Talbott found that circumcision was no longer statistically significant in explaining the variance in AIDS infection rates across the countries of the World .
Second , to date , there has not been an adequate explanation as to why Africa as a continent is experiencing an AIDS epidemic far in excess of any other region of the world with some African countries ' prevalence rates exceeding 25 % of the adult population and tens of millions dying from the disease on the continent .
Talbott 's new study suggests that the reason is that Africa as a whole has four times as many prostitutes as the rest of the word and they are more than four times as infected .
Some southern Africa countries have as many as 7 % of their adult females infected and working as prostitutes while in the developed world typically this percentage of infected prostitutes is less than .1 % .
If these 7 % of infected prostitutes in Africa sleep with five men in a week that means they are subjecting 35 % of the country 's male population to the virus weekly .

The virus is not easy to transmit heterosexually , but over time with multiple exposures , infection is inevitable .
These men then act as a conduit to bring the virus home to their villages , their other casual sex partners and to their wives .
The study has important policy implications .
Several international AIDS organizations have begun to provide funding for male circumcisions as a deterrent to AIDS .
While male circumcision may indeed reduce the risk of transmission by some 50 % to 60 % in each sexual encounter , reducing single encounter transmission rates alone cannot control the epidemic .
The reason is that individuals in highly infected countries have multiple contacts with the infected so reducing transmission rates only defers the inevitable .
The real question is what can be done with the prostitute community .
Outlawing the world 's oldest profession would most likely prove to be ineffective .
If the profession can be legalized and treatment and care provided to the practitioners , there would be much more reason to be hopeful .
But , and this is the key , programs of action can not just be voluntary .
Too many innocent people are dying and there is too much disregard for human life among infected prostitutes to leave treatment decisions solely up to them .
A program of testing and treatment for prostitutes must be mandatory and those that refuse treatment must be held liable .
Many international aid organizations are against such mandatory treatment programs for prostitutes as they find them to be discriminatory , violate the individual 's human rights and are perceived as an attack on female prostitutes who are viewed as victims of gender and income inequality .
Such organizations do not properly weigh the loss of human rights and life itself that this virus , unleashed on a community , is causing .
This virus , itself , is a violation of human rights and we must do everything in our power to stop it .
To argue we should do nothing about infected prostitutes during an AIDS epidemic because of a fear of creating a stigma against the infected would be like an animal rights activist claiming that a rabid dog must be allowed to run free in a neighborhood regardless of how many men women and children he infected and killed .
It is not surprising that computer models rarely show the virus reaching epidemic proportions ; it is very hard to transmit this illness heterosexually .
Only when model building researchers introduce a highly sexually active infected subset of " prostitutes " to their mathematical models does the infection spread exponentially to the general population .

Reform of Marijuana Laws .
NATION'S MARIJUANA LAWS WERE FOUNDED IN BIGOTRY
President Jimmy Carter once told Congress that " penalties against drug use should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself .
Nowhere is this clearer than in the laws against the possession of marijuana in private for personal use . "
That was in 1976 .
Today , despite the efforts of Carter and many others like him , laws prohibiting marijuana continue to carry penalties and consequences far more damaging than an individual 's actual use of marijuana .
Not only does marijuana prohibition harm the individual , but it is taking a grave toll on American society as well .
The damage done by marijuana prohibition far outweighs the good it is doing , and for this reason marijuana should be decriminalized .
To understand why marijuana should be decriminalized , we must first understand why it was made illegal .
Early in the 1900s , Mexico 's political conflicts sparked a surge of Mexican immigrants into America 's southwest region .
Although marijuana already existed in various forms in the U.S. , the new immigrants are credited with being the first segment of the population known for marijuana use .
The practice also became popular in African American culture around the same time .
The popularity of marijuana among minorities made racism a powerful tool for the opponents of marijuana .
Racist politicians used hate to push anti-marijuana legislation through .
One Texas senator claimed that " all Mexicans are crazy and this stuff is what makes them crazy . "
A 1934 newspaper complained that " marijuana influences Negroes to look at white people in the eye , step on white men's shadows and look at white women twice . "
Media sensationalism put forward blatant lies and misrepresentations of marijuana that misinformed the public and stigmatized the harmless herb .
The San Francisco Examiner went so far as to claim that " three - fourths of the crimes of violence today are committed by ( marijuana users ) . "
As a result of the pandemonium worked up by politicians and biased media about the marijuana " epidemic , " marijuana was made illegal at the federal level in 1937 .
Previous prohibition laws were reinforced in the '90s by the new " War on Drugs " ?
a campaign aimed at reducing the demand for and the supply of illegal drugs .
But the war has failed on its own terms .
Despite its legal status , 83 million Americans admit to having used marijuana .
Punishing smokers for their use has not decreased demand for marijuana , it has only increased arrests of otherwise law - abiding citizens .
In 2005 , marijuana arrests reached 786,000 , of which fully 88 percent were simply for possession ?
a completely non-violent crime .
This rise in arrests adds to the already heavy workload of the justice system .
According to a study by BBS News , at least 135,488 people were being incarcerated for felony marijuana charges in 2002 , not including another 20,000 being held while they awaited trial .
With overcrowding already being a serious problem for the U.S. prison system , the influx of these harmless offenders is making it harder to put and keep real criminals in prison .
But overcrowding is not the only problem .
It cost $ 22,174 a year to house a federal inmate and $ 16,600 a year to house a state inmate in 2002 .
By the end of 2002 , American taxpayers spent $ 1.8 billion to imprison marijuana offenders for that year alone .
This does not include costs associated with the new inmates from the next year , juvenile incarcerations , police salaries and equipment , legal investigations or lost economic productivity of the imprisoned .
In fact , a Harvard economics study , endorsed by over 500 economists , concluded that the U.S. stands to save up to $ 13.9 billion every year by ending marijuana prohibition .
Imagine how many under - funded social programs that could be revitalized by that kind of money .
In light of the futility and harmfulness of marijuana prohibition , decriminalization 's benefits are hard to ignore .
Space does not permit a discussion all of prohibition 's injustices ( the racial disparities of arrest rates , the unfair denial of education to marijuana offenders and the personal costs victims of marijuana arrests and their families , to name a few ) .
Still , it is plain to marijuana supporters - and hopefully now to you , as well - that not only is prohibition not working , it is causing our country and its citizens untold damages for almost no gain whatsoever .
Marijuana prohibition is a policy founded on hate , ignorance and distortion that is doing Americans no good .
The rational and responsible response to these glaring inadequacies in our county 's policies is change - change that will stop injuring innocent people , burdening our justice system and wasting valuable resources .
It 's time to finally take the hint that Jimmy Carter dropped more than 30 years ago .

“ I ‘m just lucky to be alive . ” Mark Zuckerberg , the 22 - year - old founder and CEO of social - networking site Facebook , is talking about the time he came face - to - face with the barrel of a gun .
It was the spring of 2005 , and he was driving from Palo Alto to Berkeley .
Just a few hours earlier , he had signed documents that secured a heady $ 12.7 million in venture capital to finance his fledgling business .
It was a coming - of - age moment , and he was on his way to celebrate with friends in the East Bay .
But things turned weird when he pulled off the road for gas .
As Zuckerberg got out of the car to fill the tank , a man appeared from the shadows , waving a gun and ranting .
“ He did n’t say what he wanted , ” Zuckerberg says .
“ I figured he was on drugs . ”
Keeping his eyes down , Zuckerberg said nothing , got back into his car , and drove off , unscathed .
Today , it is an episode that he talks about only reluctantly .
( A former employee spilled the beans . )
But it fits the road he has taken–an adventure with unexpected , sometimes harrowing , moments that has turned out better than anyone might have predicted .
Zuckerberg ’s life so far is like a movie script .
A supersmart kid invents a tech phenomenon while attending an Ivy League school–let ’s say , Harvard–and launches it to rave reviews .
Big shots circle his dorm to make his acquaintance ; he drops out of college to grow his baby and Change The World As We Know It .
Just three years in , what started as a networking site for college students has become a go - to tool for 19 million registered users , including employees of government agencies and Fortune 500 companies .
More than half of the users visit every day .
When a poorly explained new feature brought howls of protests from users–some 700,000 –the media old and new jumped to cover the backlash .
But Facebook emerged stronger than ever .
According to comScore Media Metrix , which tracks
Web activity , it is now the sixth most - trafficked site in the United States –1 % of all Internet time is spent on Facebook .
ComScore also rates it the number - one photo - sharing site on the Web , with 6 million pictures uploaded daily .
And it is starting to compete with Google and other tech titans as a destination for top young engineering talent in Silicon Valley .
Debra Aho Williamson , a senior analyst at eMarketer , says it is on track to bring in $ 100 million in revenue this year–serious money indeed .
Yet there is an undercurrent of controversy about whether Mark Zuckerberg is making the right decisions about the juggernaut he has created .
Late last year , a blog called TechCrunch posted documents said to be a part of an internal valuation of Facebook by Yahoo .
The documents projected that Facebook would generate $ 969 million in revenue , with 48 million users , by 2010 .
The New York Times and others reported that Yahoo had made a $ 1 billion offer to buy Facebook–and Zuckerberg and his partners had turned it down .
This followed an earlier rumor of a $ 750 million offer from Viacom .
Yahoo , Viacom , and Facebook would not comment on the deal talk ( and they still wo n’t ) .
But Silicon Valley has been abuzz ever since .
“ It ’s all been very interesting , ” deadpans Zuckerberg , sitting in a conference room in Facebook ’s Palo Alto headquarters .
He looks every bit the geek in his zippered brown sweatshirt , baggy khakis , and Adidas sandals .
He came into the room eating breakfast cereal from a paper bowl with a plastic spoon .
He still lives in a rented apartment , with a mattress on the floor and only two chairs and a table for furniture .
( “ I cooked dinner for a girlfriend once , ” he admits at one point .
“ It did n’t work well . ” )
He walks or bikes to the office every day .
Zuckerberg ’s college - kid style reinforces the doubts of those who see the decision to keep Facebook independent as a lapse in judgment .
In less than two years , the two reigning Web 2.0 titans have sold out to major corporations : MySpace accepted $ 580 million to join News Corp. , and YouTube took $ 1.5 billion from Google .
Surely any smart entrepreneur would jump at a chance to piggyback on those deals .
Poll : 72 percent of troops want out of Iraq in a year RAW STORY
Published : February 28 , 2006 Print This | Email This Seventy two percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe the United States should pull out within one year , a column by Nicholas Kristof in Tuesday 's New York Times reveals .
The poll was conducted by Zogby International and is the first poll to examine the attitudes of those currently serving in the wartorn nation .
The full poll is available here .
Excerpts from Kristof 's column follow .
Following Kristof 's excerpts are excerpts from Zogby 's poll .
#
When President Bush held a public meeting with troops by satellite last fall , they were miraculously upbeat .
And all along , unrepentant hawks ( most of whom have never been to Iraq ) have insisted that journalists are misreporting Iraq and that most soldiers are gung - ho about their mission .

Hogwash !
A new poll to be released Tuesday shows that U.S. soldiers overwhelmingly want out of Iraq -- and soon .
The poll is the first of U.S. troops currently serving in Iraq , according to John Zogby , the pollster .
Conducted by Zogby International and LeMoyne College , it asked 944 service members , " How long should U.S. troops stay in Iraq ? "
Only 23 percent backed Bush 's position that they should stay as long as necessary .
In contrast , 72 percent said that U.S. troops should be pulled out within one year .
Of those , 29 percent said they should withdraw " immediately ... "
While the White House emphasizes the threat from non-Iraqi terrorists , only 26 percent of the U.S. troops say that the insurgency would end if those foreign fighters could be kept out .
A plurality believes that the insurgency is made up overwhelmingly of discontented Iraqi Sunnis ...
By a 2 - 1 ratio , the troops said that " to control the insurgency we need to double the level of ground troops and bombing missions . "
And since there is zero chance of that happening , a majority of troops seemed to be saying that they believe this war to be unwinnable .
This first systematic look at the views of the U.S. troops on the ground suggests that our present strategy in Iraq is failing badly .
The troops overwhelmingly do n't want to " stay the course , " and they do n't seem to think the American strategy can succeed .
# Zogby excerpts :
The poll , conducted in conjunction with Le Moyne College ’s Center for Peace and Global Studies , showed that 29 % of the respondents , serving in various branches of the armed forces , said the U.S. should leave Iraq “ immediately , ” while another 22 % said they should leave in the next six months .
Another 21 % said troops should be out between six and 12 months , while 23 % said they should stay “ as long as they are needed . ”
Different branches had quite different sentiments on the question , the poll shows .
While 89 % of reserves and 82 % of those in the National Guard said the U.S. should leave Iraq within a year , 58 % of Marines think so .
Seven in ten of those in the regular Army thought the U.S. should leave Iraq in the next year .
Moreover , about three - quarters of those in National Guard and Reserve units favor withdrawal within six months , just 15 % of Marines felt that way .
About half of those in the regular Army favored withdrawal from Iraq in the next six months .
The troops have drawn different conclusions about fellow citizens back home .
Asked why they think some Americans favor rapid U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq , 37 % of troops serving there said those Americans are unpatriotic , while 20 % believe people back home do n’t believe a continued occupation will work .
Another 16 % said they believe those favoring a quick withdrawal do so because they oppose the use of the military in a pre-emptive war , while 15 % said they do not believe those Americans understand the need for the U.S. troops in Iraq .
The wide - ranging poll also shows that 58 % of those serving in country say the U.S. mission in Iraq is clear in their minds , while 42 % said it is either somewhat or very unclear to them , that they have no understanding of it at all , or are unsure .
While 85 % said the U.S. mission is mainly “ to retaliate for Saddam ’s role in the 9 - 11 attacks , ” 77 % said they also believe the main or a major reason for the war was “ to stop Saddam from protecting al Qaeda in Iraq . ”
Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is an extremely common but almost completely misunderstood condition where there are often intense bodily responses to things such as certain foods , stress and distension .
It is believed that a large number of people who are currently seeking help from gastroenterology clinics have IBS .
So , what is the relationship between IBS and fiber ?
Some of the varied symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain and discomfort and a change in bowel habit that usually ends up being either constipation or diarrhea .
For most sufferers , the pain associated with IBS is experienced during meals or during a bowel movement .
One of the biggest problems with IBS is that the same symptoms are sometimes associated with other bowel disorders , so the correct diagnosis of IBS is extremely difficult .
Other symptoms that have nothing to do with the bowels can also be linked to IBS .
One of the most common treatments associated with IBS is following a high - fiber diet , although there is almost no agreement among doctors that this is the way to go .
A recent synopsis of studies focusing on high fiber or bran- supplemented diets showed that only two of the eight patients had reduced symptoms .
Some symptoms , such as constipation , have been shown to decrease with the prescription of a high fiber diet , but at the same time , other sufferers that have symptoms such as distension , diarrhea and abdominal pain may end up worse off with the same high fiber diet that helped others .
Dietary fiber is usually classified into two different groups : soluble and insoluble .
Both kinds of fiber are present in all known plant food , with different amounts of each present depending on the plant .
The word insoluble refers to a fiber ’s ability to soak up water and not dissolve .
It ’s said that insoluble fiber has “ passive water - attracting properties ” that help to add mass to a bowel movement , softening the movement and giving some speed to the movement through the intestinal tract .
Soluble fiber , on the other hand , means that the fiber in the plant dissolves in water easily .
These simple definitions , however , can be limiting since soluble fiber can ferment in the intestinal tract and that can benefit the body in the long run .
One of the easiest ways to imagine the difference between what is soluble and what is insoluble , imagine a plum .
The thick , tough outer skin would be considered insoluble fiber , while the inner flesh , while still fibrous , would be considered soluble .
Other popular sources of insoluble fiber include whole wheat , corn bran , flax seeds and veggies such as carrots , celery , green beans and potato skins .
One of the best combinations of soluble and insoluble fiber is the husk from a psyllium grain .
It ’s been proven to help lower blood cholesterol when consumed on a regular basis .
The husk is 34 % insoluble fiber and 66 % soluble , which is considered to be an optimal balance that makes the grain a highly thought of food additive .
The impact of these fibers on the digestions of IBS sufferers is not conclusive .
Some sufferers say that eating particular types of food cause their symptoms to reduce .
But at the same time , getting rid of “ problem ” foods and eating more foods from another group can do more harm than good in the long run .
The link between IBS and fiber is clear , however its important not to try any sort of special diet when you suffer from IBS without consulting a doctor first .
If you remove one kind of fiber , your body may need to find a replacement source .

Story Highlights • Confession made to stop questioning , suspect says in transcript from Pentagon
• Abd al Rahim Hussein Mohammed al Nashiri held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba
• Suspect denies being member of al Qaeda
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen said he was tortured into admitting responsibility for that attack and others , according to a hearing transcript the Pentagon released Friday .
Abd al Rahim Hussein Mohammed al Nashiri , a Saudi Arabian detainee held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , denied participating in the Cole attack .
Al Nashiri said he " was tortured into confession , and once he made a confession his captors were happy and they stopped questioning him , " according to a statement read at his hearing .
" Also , the detainee states that he made up stories during the torture in order to get [ it ] to stop . "
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Defense Department would investigate al Nashiri 's torture allegation if the military was holding him at the time .
If another agency was detaining him then , Whitman said that agency would be responsible for the investigation .
The transcript was the ninth the Pentagon has released since the combatant status review tribunals began this month for 14 detainees whom the CIA once secretly held .
The hearings will determine whether a detainee should be classified as an " enemy combatant . "
If so , they then can be charged and tried under the military commissions law that President Bush signed in October .
Suicide bombers on a boat attacked the guided missile destroyer USS Cole on October 12 , 2000 , in the harbor at Aden , Yemen .
Seventeen U.S. sailors were killed and 39 injured .
The U.S. military 's summary of evidence against al Nashiri said an FBI source identified him as an important person in al Qaeda and " heard " he helped arrange the Cole bombing .
The evidence said al Nashiri bought a boat and explosives used in the Cole attack with his own money .
Al Nashiri said he is not a member of al Qaeda , according to the transcript .
However , he said he knew those who bombed the Cole because he had business dealings with them in the fishing industry .
" He did not even hear about the USS Cole bombing until many hours after it had occurred and was surprised by the incident , " according to the transcript .
Eight other review hearings have occurred for the 14 labeled as " high - value " detainees , including one for the suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Mohammed told a military panel he was responsible for those attacks and more than 30 others , according to a transcript released by U.S. military officials .
CNN 's Mike Mount contributed to this report .

Cosby's Media Lament
WASHINGTON -
Here 's a scoop for you , America : Bill Cosby has a hard time getting his message out .
" The media love to choose what they want to use , " he said .
" I ca n't go door - to - door to tell everyone what I really mean . "
But Dr. William H. Cosby Jr. , Ph.D. Ed. , did manage to get a hold of your humble scribe on my cell phone on a Friday afternoon during my vacation , scoring some rare cool points for me in the process by saying hi to my teenaged son .
Cosby 's like my 100 - year - old grandmother ; you never know what to expect from him .
My heart pounded .
Was he calling to praise ?
To complain ?
To sue ?
As it turned out , he was calling to complain , but not about me .
He appreciated my recent column about the national debate he ignited with his now - famous speech on the 50th anniversary of the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education .
Cosby was calling out of frustration , he said , over the failures of other media to report what he has been trying to say .
The Washington Post , which first reported the uproar over his 2004 speech , and other media have focused too much , in his view , on his sarcastic language .
Too little attention has been given to the problems about which he was speaking :
The crime , violence , school dropouts , out - of - wedlock births and other self - inflicted plagues among black youths left behind by civil rights reforms .
" Our children are trying to tell us something ( with their self - destructive behavior ) and we 're not listening , " he said .
I listened .
He talked .
I took notes .
Among those who missed his point , the last straw for Cosby appears to have been an op - ed essay by Michael Eric Dyson , a University of Pennsylvania humanities professor and well - known Cosby critic , in the July 21 Post .
Dyson lashed Cosby 's " blame - the - poor tour " for ignoring major political and economic forces that continue to reinforce black poverty , like low wages , outsourcing , capital flight , downsizing and substandard schools .
" None of these can be overcome by the good behavior of poor blacks , " Dyson declared .
But , of course , that statement is wrong , dangerously wrong in the disrespect it pays to the value of good behavior .
As generations of successful black families can attest , good behavior wo n't solve all of your problems , but it beats drugs , crimes , abuse , child neglect or other self - destructive behavior .
Cosby offered two stellar examples , Jachin Leatherman and Wayne Nesbit , who defied the usual young black male stereotypes by graduating at the top of their class from Ballou High School , which has one of the District of Columbia 's worst crime , poverty and dropout rates .
Having survived distractions that included the shooting death of one of Nesbit 's football teammates , the two athletes are headed for the College of the Holy Cross this fall .
At a July forum in Washington that featured Cosby , Harvard psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint and other experts on the state of black men in America , both of these bright young men were asked how they did it .
They praised their fathers and their coaches for " staying on top " of them .
( The forum , sponsored by the Post , Harvard University and the Kaiser Family Foundation , can be seen at Kaiser 's website : www.KFF.org.).
" There 's the answer right there , " Cosby said .
" Why wo n't the media cover that ? "
Alas , in newsroom terms , the lads are a heartwarming but play - it - inside local human - interest story .
As one cynical mentor told me years ago , " News is what happens when things are not going the way they 're supposed to . "
Want more attention for your honor students ?
Let them hold up a liquor store .
Some people think Cosby , who 's given millions to scholarships and black colleges , has come down too harshly on black parents who shun personal responsibility , blame police first for incarcerations and let their children exalt sports and dialect over books and proper English .
I suggested in an earlier column that Cosby might not have been harsh enough .
For all of the burdens that we African Americans have to bear from a legacy of historical and institutional racism , we also need to call each other to account from time to time for the damage we do to ourselves .
For starters , we could use a lot more fathers like those of the Ballou scholars .
Unfortunately good dads and good moms do n't grow on trees , as my own dad used to say about money .
If we as a society do not do all that we can to help families in crisis and encourage parental responsibility , we will reap the ugly dividends later in our streets .
That 's Cosby 's message .
At least , he has what some critics call his " bullying pulpit " to help get his message out - and he 's not afraid to use it .

COPENHAGEN ( Reuters ) - Denmark said on Friday it secretly airlifted out of Iraq about 200 translators and other Iraqi employees of its troops in Iraq and their relatives this week and most were expected to seek asylum in the Nordic nation .

Denmark said on Friday it secretly airlifted out of Iraq about 200 translators and other Iraqi employees of its troops in Iraq and their relatives this week and most were expected to seek asylum in the Nordic nation .
REUTERS / Henning Bagger / Scanpix
“ Out of concern for the interpreters and their families ’ security as well as the security of the Danish base in Iraq , the Defence Ministry has chosen to inform the public after the interpreters and others had left Iraq , ” the Denmark Defence Ministry said in a statement .
It said the airlift involved “ about 200 ” people .
A ministry spokesman reached by telephone could not provide an exact number but said most of the Iraqis brought to Denmark were translators and their families .
Danish Ambassador to Iraq Bo Eric Weber said the moved followed the killing in December of an Iraqi who had worked with the Danes as an interpreter .
Around 80 of those flown out of the country were employed and the rest were family members , he said .
“ They had been working for us for about four years , and those who felt their security in Iraq was threatened have been granted visas to go to Denmark ” where they can apply for asylum , Weber told Reuters .
Britain and the United States have been reluctant to take large numbers of Iraqi refugees , while some European countries have toughened their stance on taking them in .
Last month the Danish government reached a deal with the anti-immigrant Danish People ’s Party ( DPP ) to offer visas to Iraqi interpreters who have aided Danish troops in Iraq out of concern they will be targeted by insurgents when the Danish contingent withdraws in August .
Denmark ’s centre - right government had faced mounting pressure to find a way to help the Iraqis despite the small country ’s restrictive immigration policy and its increasingly problematic relationship with the DPP .
Denmark has about 470 soldiers in southern Iraq , serving under British command .
It will withdraw all of its ground troops from Iraq by August and replace them with a small helicopter unit of 55 soldiers .
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in May that it could accept as many as 7,000 refugees through the 2007 fiscal year , which ends on September 30 , after being criticized for accepting only 202 last year .
Sweden , which has more Iraqi refugees than any other country in Europe , tightened its policy earlier this month when its migration board ruled that Iraqis seeking asylum must prove they face personal risk in their homeland to avoid being sent back .
Germany earlier this year revoked the refugee status of more than 18,000 Iraqis it deemed criminals , endangering interior German security or able to return to the more peaceful northern Iraq .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that up to 2 million Iraqis have moved to neighboring countries before and since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , while 1.7 million are internally displaced .

" Can programming be reinvented ? " というタイトルでの発表。東工大と東大で似たような発表をしたのだが、ストーリーラインが比較的新しいため、先にやった東工大での発表には反省点がいろいろあり、それが東大での発表に生かされた形になったのは否めない、かもしれない。以下は、かなり再現性の低いメモ。詳細はさらに聞いてください。「私」はもちろんAlan Kayを指します。
近所の人から、 「 なんで新しいコンピュータのほう がWindowsの起動 やMS Wordの起動が遅いの ?」、「大きいディスクがついているはずなのに、なぜ使える容量が少なくなるの?」、「アップデートをしたら、何で再起動しなくてはいけないの？」という質問をされる。なかなか良い質問である。
私自身も、コンピュータに関する疑問がある。「なぜ、コンピュータの外側にあるインターネットは異機種接続されたノードが本物のメッセージを送りあって動いているのに、ある一台のコンピュータの中はそのように動かないのか」、「 Shannonの定理によれば、ノイズの上限がわかってさえいれば、どんなにノイズの乗った回線であっても、信頼性のある通信が可能である。なのに、なぜソフトウェアがクラッシュすることがあるのか」、「なぜ、今のソフトウェアは必要であると思われるよりも100倍も1000倍も多くのコードで書かれているのか 」、「 子供 が" agents of change " であるなら、なぜ本当の子供用コンピュータが無いのか」、というものである。

Windows XPは一億行のソースコードからなり 、Windows Officeはアプリは1.2億行くらいである。これを印刷して積み重ねると、大体エンパイヤステートの半分くらいの高さになる。アドビのものなどを足すとだいたい同じくらいの高さになるだろう。だが、本当にそれだけの意味がWindowsにあるだろうか。

このデモに使っているの はSqueakというソフトで、Xerox PARCで作っていたものの子孫である。当時はオーバーラッピングウィンドウも発明したが、複数のデスクトップを持つシステムも作っていた。新しい作業をするときは、新しいデスクトップを作り、それらが永続化されて、いったりきたりできる。( Project Sorterを見せて ) ここにあるのはそういうシステムだが、それぞれのデスクトップはウェブページのようにサーバーにおいてアクセスすることもできる。Power Pointをプレゼンテーションに使うというのは本来ばかげている。人々が作っているものは、Power Pointよりも強力なもの( powerful ) のはずなのに 、Power Pointというより弱いものに載せために、もともと持っていたパワーを捨ててしまわないといけない。なぜ、自分が作っているそのものを見せるようにしないのだろうか。
Altoは2.5MBのディスクを持っていたが、その時代のSmalltalkは10,000行くらいのコードで、印刷すると185ページくらいだった。今使っているのはその子孫のシステムだが、任意のオブジェクトを埋め込んでテキストのまわりこみができるDTPもあるし、子供向けのプログラミングシステムもあるし、動画のようなメディアも操作できるし、パーティクルシステムもある。
これはダイナミックなシステムなので、いろいろなことをシステム自身に問い合わせることができる。すべての実行コードサイズの和は3.5M程度、メソッド数は60000程度なので、1メソッドあたり平均で59バイトである。全体の行数は23万行程度だが、どの数字も必要よりは多くて、同じことが2万行程度でできるはずである。2万行であれば一冊の本に印刷することができるし、数冊の説明をつければ1人の人間がすべてを理解することができるはずである。我々がNSFからの資金を受けてこれからやろうとしているのは、2万行でOS、グラフィックスシステム、ネットワークシステムからエンドユーザーシステムまですべてを書いたようなシステムを作ることである。
アーキテクチャについて。ピラミッドは、ひたすら大量のごみを何十年もかけて積み重ねて、表面を大理石で覆ったようなものだった。まるで今のソフトウェアのようである。エンパイヤ・ステート・ビルディングは、3000人以下の人が11ヶ月(前に建っていたビルを破壊するところも含めて)で建てたもので、非常によく計画されていたので、ピッツバーグの製鉄所から運ばれてきた鉄がまだ暖かいうちに使われていたくらいだった。これこそが"engineering"というものであろう。engineeringという言葉を聴くと、吊り橋やジェットエンジンのことを思い浮かべるが、ソフトウェア作りはまだそこまで達していないと思う。1968年にソフトウェアエンジニアリングという言葉が作られたとき、作った人々はまだソフトウェアはまだエンジニアリングと呼べるまでに達していないということは理解していて、「そちらを目指すべきだ」という意図を持っていた。が、問題なのは、今の人は「ソフトウェアエンジニアリング」というものがちゃんと存在していると思ってしまっていることである。
ソフトウェアが達成できているのは、建築で言えばゴシック建築のようなもので、アーチの発明によって百万分の一くらいの材料によってピラミッドと同じ高さのものが作れるようになったというくらいである。いくつか良いアーキテクチャとアブストラクションはある。が、アセンブラに対するFortranやAlgol、Algolに対するSimula、Lisp、Smalltalkのように、その前にあったものに対して質的に違う抽象化を提供するというアーチのような新しいものは30年ほど出てきていない。
我々のプロジェクトで目指していることのひとつは、Mooreの法則のソフトウェア版である。インターネットは最初からscalabilityを念頭において設計されたので、14桁15桁以上の拡張をし、いろいろな機械やいろいろな言語で書かれたものが混じっていても、一度もシステムをリブートすることなく動かし続けることができた。ソフトウェアも、そのような拡張性を念頭において設計できないだろうか。インターネットは、実際にメッセージを送りあって動作している唯一のものだが、ひとつのノード上では、境界を越えた最適化が行われてしまっているために拡張性が失われてしまっている。最適化というのはほとんど定義からして境界を破ってしまうことになる。
Don Knuthのせりふとして、 「 このコードにバグが無いことは証明したけど、まだ試していない」というものがある。数学が取り扱うのは、本当に小さなカーネルなので証明ができる。が、コンピュータが取り扱おうとしているのは、数学が扱うよりも何百万倍も大きなものであるために、証明できる規模を超えてしまっていて実際に試さないといけないものであるように思う。プログラムの仕様検証や証明をする際に、私が思う良いアプローチは、仕様とプログラムを分けて2度書くのではなく仕様自体を最適化を徹底的に排除した形で意図が完全にわかるようにして実行可能なものとして書くことである。
この漫画は、黒板の前に二人の科学者がいて相談しているところで、左のほうにはいろいろな基礎的知識が書かれており、右のほうにはそこから導かれる興味深いものが書かれている。それらの間には、" and miracle happens " と書いてある 。
Energy QM Atoms Molecules Large M cells multi cells orgs intelligent civilization
という軸を考えると、400年前は物理的現象そのものが、物理学が無かったという意味で奇跡だった。なぜいろいろな現象が起こるのかということが判っていなかった。その後化学も発達した。私が生まれたころは、生物学も奇跡だったが、1953にDNAのらせん構造が解明されて、奇跡ではなくなってきた。多細胞生物、知的な多細胞生物、そしてその集合である行動学や、文明というがなぜ今のようになっているのか、ということはまだまだわかっていないことがある。
ソフトウェアで は
Power , Logic gates , Ops , Memory , OS , networking , graphics , word processing , Viewing
というような階層があって、電源や論理ゲート、命令やメモリというものはだいたい判っている。また、エンドユーザのコンピュータのビューがどうあるべきかということには少し経験があるのだが、OSがどうあるべきか、ワードプロセッサがどうあるべきか、言語が同あるべきかということはまだ判っていないと思う。これらのことはNSFの提案書を読んでもらった方が良い。その中には、13の原理が書いてあって、1から4までと、9から13まではどうあるべきかということはかなり判っていると思うのだが、5から8までのところはまだどうやればよいか判っていない。
デモはわかっていてもう作ったものしかできないので、まずエンドユーザのビューについて見せようと思う。
そのため にModel- Tについて話したい。Model-Tははじめて大量生産された車でだが、1940年代の田舎ではまだ使われていた。一番の理由は、本当に破壊してしまうのが難しかったからである。350個程度の部品からなっていて、10代の子供が週末に完全にばらしてまた組み立てることができたし、町の鍛冶屋が壊れた部品を作り直すことができた。スパークプラグの透き間は、10セントコインの暑さを使って測るようにできていた。Henry Fordにそれはなぜかを聞いたら、「みんなゲージはなくしちゃうだろうけど、ダイムはだいたいもっているからね」と言った。ソフトウェアでも、そういうものを作りたいと思っている。
車を書いて動かせるし、すべてのオブジェクトは同じタイプのものなので、スクリプタ用のスクリプトもかけるし、ビューワの中の部品も回せたりする。フィードバックを使って、道に沿って走る車が同じプログラミング環境で作れる。似た形で、鮭がふるさとの川の匂いをたどるシミュレーションも書けるし、それを数百、数万並列に拡張して、蟻がえさを仲間に教えるシミュレーションも書ける。
テキストのレイアウトも、同じように文字をパーティクルとみた並列プログラムとしても書ける。各要素は自分の前のやつについていくことだけを考えるが、単語の途中で切れたら、単語の先頭に次の行に行くように伝える。パラグラフエディターは10個ほどの短いスクリプトで書ける。
あとはincrease by をさまざまなメディアに使う例がいくつか。大事なのは、これらは別に新しい話ではないということだが、ただ動画もシンセサイザーもモデルの部分だけを捉えるようにすれば、どれも「数行のスクリプト+ディテイル」であるということである。
、エンドユーザー向けのプログラミング環境はそういう話であった。もうひとつは、下回りのほうで我々が判っていると思っていることの紹介である。まずは、Ian と Alex のGolen Box。こ のGolden Boxは、入力とし て150行程度のBNF的なものを食わせると、その言語からネイティブコードを生成して実行するシステムを作り出すことができる。さらに、1500行程度のそのGolden Boxのプログラムを入力として入れると、同じ働きをするGolden Boxを作り出すことができる。これによって、1700行程度でコンパイラ自身も含めてプログラミング言語の処理系を作ることができる。20000行のシステムを作ると言い出した背景には、Ianによるこのシステムが存在していたことが大きい。
もうひとつは、時間のモデルを持ったオブジェクトシステムである。ロックを使った同期はいろいろなやり方が提案されているが、もうひとつ別のやり方は、仮想時刻もモデル化して、微小時間ごとにトランザクションを繰り返すようなモデルである。これはDavid ReedのNETOSで提案されたものだが、David Smith とAndreas RaabのHedgeHogなどで実装されつつある。
google で" wiring mess " をイメージ検索するといろいろな絵が出てくるが、抽象的なレベルでは、一本のイーサーがあって、すべてのノードがそこからぶら下がっているだけである。これも、モデルとその最適化を分けて考えると良いだろう。
シアトル近郊 のTacoma Narrow Bridgeは、風速 が100 mile per hourを越えると共振するということを計算した教授がいたそのくらいの風が吹いたときに、その教授はカメラ屋に走ってその場で橋が落ちるところを録画した。ここから学ぶべき教訓は、late-bindingということである。Butlerが言ったのは、システム作りをするための学習曲線があるが、いろいろな問題点に当たってそれを解決して経験を得て、じゃあもう一度その経験を生かして新しいシステムをもう一度作り直そうと思ったときには、Mooreの法則が学んでいたパラメータをすべて変えてしまうので、結局新しいシステムを作っても良いものにはならない、ということである。late-bindingであれば、最初からすべてのことを知らなくてもシステムを作り出すことができて、新しい経験を得たときに最初から作り直すのではなく、そのシステムそのものを書き換えて、その経験を最初からしていたかのようなシステムに変えていくことができる。
Altoは当時の金額で 、$ 20,000、今日の価値ならおそらくは$ 80,000程度である。同世代のコンピュータと比べて、Mooreの法則3回分位速かったので、最適化をしなくてもいろいろな実験ができたし、最適化をすれば、10年くらい先のソフトウェアを作ることができた。75年のBravoは、88年のMS
Wordと同じようなものだった。今の人は車には$20,000払うが、コンピュータには$2,000以上は使わない。コンピュータに価値を見出してない。研究者なら自分で速いコンピュータを作るべきである。Altoを作ったChuck
Thacker は 、David Pattersonと共に2 cubic feet の最速コンピュータを作ろうとしている。これは筐体内の2/3くらいはFPGAである。LindaをFPGAで作ったりすることを考えると、メッセージングの処理などの性能ががらっとかわり、ソフトウェアの作り方が変わる可能性がある。
大事なのは 、Squeakも含めて今のソフトウェアは駄目だということである。特に東工大のほうでの講演はやや話し方にあいまいさが合ったともいえるが、Squeakはすでに大きすぎるし、中身もIanのやつのように柔軟性が無いのであまりよろしくない。Squeakを卒業して、もっと良いものを作るのがこれからの目標である。Susan Sontagが言うように、理解というのは現状をそのまま受け入れるのをやめることから始まる。
YouTube viewers will soon be able to watch some classic TV shows with commercialsunder an agreement inked with Digital Music Group .
Although specifics of the deal have not been announced , here 's the gist : DMGI will allow YouTube to show complete episodes of classic TV shows in its catalog .
In return , YouTube will share some of the ad revenue with DMGI and more importantly , provide the company with content filtering software to identify user - submitted videos that infringe on DMGI 's copyrights .
DMGI 's portfolio includes a number of TV classics from the 50s and 60s , including I Spy , The Cisco Kid , Daniel Boone , My Favorite Martian , and The Adventures of Robin Hood .
YouTube will also show some of the content from DMGI 's Kids Channel , including the eerie animation stylings of Clutch Cargo along with The Gumby Show and Molly and Roni's Dance Party .
In a first for YouTube , the videos themselves will contain embedded advertisements .
This marks a significant change for YouTube , which has so far kept its minimal advertising from interfering with video playback , much to the delight of users .
The embedded ads are likely necessary for YouTube to guarantee the level of ad revenues necessary to make the deal happen .
The other key is content filtering .
YouTube and Google have been working on a content filtering system that would make it easy for rights holders to easily identify infringing videos .
During its most recent earnings call , Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that his company is hard at work on audio and video fingerprinting software ; the deal with DMGI indicates that the software is at a state where the company feels comfortable with allowing its business partners to use it .
There have been accusations that Google is only offering the filtering tool to companies that have signed distribution and licensing agreements , forcing the likes of Viacom to rely on mass takedown notices .
MySpace is also beginning a massive video filtering effort at the behest of copyright holders .
MySpace will be using fingerprinting technology licensed from Audible Magic which uses audio track fingerprints to identify infringing videos .
Copyright holders will be responsible for uploading the fingerprints used to find problematic content .
MySpace already assists the record labels in filtering unauthorized music files .
Unlike YouTube , which relies heavily on copyrighted content to attract users , the availability of music videos is peripheral to MySpace 's success .
That has n't stopped the record labels from putting MySpace in the same category as YouTube and other video - sharing sites .
If Hollywood and the Internet are ever going to live in harmony , content filtering will be key .
Filtering not only enables rights holders to identify and notify websites of infringing content , it also makes deals like the one between YouTube and DMGI possible .
It may also hasten a new era for YouTube , one of more direct competition with broadcast and cable networks as YouTube expands its catalog from video clips to entire shows .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
It was one of the most talked about moments in the 2006 campaign : " Lets give a welcome to Macaca , here .
Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia . "
Former Sen. George Allen , R - Virginia , knows firsthand the effect YouTube has had on politics .
That was then - Virginia Republican Sen .
George Allen 's controversial remark to a young campaign aide working for Allen 's opponent , Democrat Jim Webb .
The comment was caught on camera by the Webb aide , and was put on YouTube .
It became a smash hit .
Allen was expected to cruise to re-election , but thanks in part to the YouTube video , Allen lost his seat by just a few thousand votes to Webb .
His loss , along with the razor thin defeat of Sen.
Conrad Burns , R- Montana -- who had his own damaging moments on YouTube -- helped swing control of the Senate to the Democrats .
Gotcha moments on YouTube , unauthorized campaign videos and hard - hitting debate questions from YouTube users are changing the political landscape .
The YouTube " Macaca moment " represents a broad new challenge for candidates , but speaks to the age - old problem of how to control the message .
" I think it really breaks down some of the traditional barriers we have seen in American politics , " Steve Grove , head of news and politics at YouTube , told CNN 's John King Monday .
" Time was , if you wanted to engage in a primary debate process , you had to be in New Hampshire or be in Iowa . "
CNN / YouTube Debates countdown
The CNN / YouTube Debates are coming up , but you can get a special sneak peak all this week .
Join John Roberts , Kiran Chetry and Paula Zahn .
Monday through Friday , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Grove said that CNN - YouTube 's Democratic debate next week in Charleston , South Carolina , is a game - changer .
The user - generated questions can touch any topic and come from anywhere in the world .
" Candidates do hate , genuinely hate , audience participation , because they like to control the environment , " said longtime television news anchor Dan Rather , now the global correspondent for HDNet .
Tell candidates people will ask them questions via a YouTube video , he says , and " they get the shivers . "
It 's those unscripted moments that have taken on a new life on the video - sharing Web site .
For Allen , that short YouTube clip , viewed millions of times , had far - reaching repercussions for his political career .
Allen also lost any immediate chance at making a run for the White House .
" If not for YouTube , Allen would most likely be one of the front - runners today for the GOP presidential nomination , " says CNN Political Editor Mark Preston .
When it comes to YouTube moments , the presidential campaign cycle is picking up where the midterm elections left off .
While candidates try to avoid a " Macaca moment , " the competing campaigns are busy dispatching video " trackers " to catch one .
A local stop on the campaign trail is suddenly a national story .
Sen . John McCain had a YouTube moment in April .
" Remember that old Beach Boys song , bomb Iran .
Bomb .
Bomb .
Bomb . "
That was the Republican presidential candidate having some fun with a friendly crowd in South Carolina .
But his comments got played over and over again on YouTube and became a story picked up by the mainstream media .
" You can not go to a 7 - Eleven or a Dunkin ' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent .
I 'm not joking , " said Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden last July .
The senator from Delaware was joking , but his comments made the rounds on YouTube , and Biden needed to clarify just what he was talking about .
YouTube is forcing candidates to deal head - on with their past .
The ease at which video can be posted and distributed on YouTube is giving old debate clips new life , forcing presidential hopefuls to explain conflicting positions .
" I believe that abortion should be safe and legal . "
That was former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from a 1994 debate with Sen . Ted Kennedy .
Romney has changed his position on abortion , but those old clips supported his critics ' charge that Romney flip - flopped on abortion .
Former senator and probable GOP presidential candidate Fred Thompson is facing a similar situation .
When Thompson was first running for the Senate in 1994 , he was asked during a debate whether he would support or oppose laws that prohibit abortions for convenience .
Thompson responded by saying , " I do n't believe that the federal government should be involved in that process . "
That video is now making the rounds on YouTube and probably wo n't help Thompson 's push to court social conservatives .
" Is YouTube having an impact ?
Of course , " says Amy Walter , editor - in - chief of the National Journal 's Political Hotline and a CNN Political Analyst , " but to me what 's more interesting is from the strategist point of view -- which is when to react and when not to react to YouTube . "
There is a flip side to the YouTube phenomenon .
It can also help campaigns looking for new ways to harness the power of the popular Web site .
In April , YouTube began spotlighting one campaign each week , allowing each candidate to ask anything they want .
" What do you think our campaign song should be ? " asked Sen. Hillary Clinton , the Democratic presidential front - runner .
YouTube users can talk back , or in the case of some Clinton supporters and opponents , sing back .
Sometimes the campaigns are getting help without asking .
" I got a crush on Obama " sings a young woman on a music video that was an instant hit on the site .
Sen .
Barack Obama 's campaign was n't behind the video , but the buzz probably did n't hurt the Illinois senator 's presidential bid .
Then there was the " Vote Different " Orwellian clip , uploaded anonymously on YouTube , which portrayed Clinton as Big Brother in a remake of an Apple Computer ad from 1984 .
Viewed millions of times on YouTube , the final frames pointed to Obama 's presidential Web site .
Those are two perfect examples of how YouTube is empowering average Americans to affect the political process like never before .
That in turn is affecting the campaigns .
The candidates do n't have total control over their message any more , and that 's forcing them to change the way they campaign .

Khadija al - Aktami : God has made women more patient than men
Fifty Mourchidat have graduated and have now begun their ministries .
However , not everyone agrees with the new appointments .
The Mourchidat will be allowed to lead religious discussions and give advice in their communities - particularly to women .
The only thing they will not be able to do is to lead prayers .
That role will still be reserved for male Imams .
In the courtyard of Rabat 's biggest mosque - the Sunna mosque - I spoke to Khadija al - Aktami .
She is one of the newly qualified Mourchidat .
I asked her why she thought women would be well suited to this new role : " Women make good preachers because God has made them more sensitive , merciful and more patient than men !
A woman is a mother , a wife , a daughter and a friend , so she will perform well in this role .
Besides , no one can understand a woman as well as another woman . "
Terrorism is the extreme example of a serious illness in society ...
There is an obligation to do this as a means of prevention
Ahmed Toufiq , Minister of Islamic Affairs
May 16 2003 , like September 11 , is a date etched in people 's minds and synonymous with terror in Morocco .
Forty - one people died in a series of suicide bombings by Islamic fundamentalists in Casablanca .
It was partly in response to the Casablanca attacks that the Moroccan government introduced women preachers - to promote a more liberal brand of Islam and to counter radicalism .
The Minister of Islamic Affairs , Ahmed Toufiq says the Mourchidat programme was necessary to maintain a healthy society as a preventative measure against terrorism .
" Society is like a human body and the body needs to be looked after : it needs to be fed and its health has to be preserved , " he said .
" Terrorism is the extreme example of a serious illness in society .
You cannot leave a body until it gets into a crisis .
You have to feed the body to avoid it falling into a state of crisis and disease .
There are all sorts of measures you can take to prevent a crisis and this is one of them .
There is an obligation to do this as a means of prevention . "
Control strategy ?
Abdelwahed Motawakil , is the secretary - general of the outlawed Islamist movement , Justice and Charity .
His office is constantly being watched by the secret police .
' Justice and Charity ' is highly critical of the establishment and is calling for the Moroccan monarchy to be abolished .
It also believes that the new women preachers are just instruments of government propaganda .
Moroccan women are taking an increasingly active role in public life
" If you take the idea in the abstract , I must say that it's an excellent idea , because it gives an opportunity for women to participate in an area that has been monopolised by men , " he said .
" But if you look a little deeper and analyse the motives , you will find out that it is part of a strategy adopted by the regime to control the religious field and not to leave that field open for their opponents - the Islamists .
So they want to control that area and convey their official view of Islam . "
Khadija al - Aktami is just starting on her new career as a Mourchidat but some of her colleagues will not be joining her .
They have been discovered to be supporters of Justice and Charity - something that will be viewed as a major embarrassment for the Moroccan government as it tries to combat Islamic extremism .
Reaction to the decision has been almost as sulfurous as it was to the cancellation of the opera .
“ When the Koran is put above the German constitution , I can only say , ‘ Good night , Germany , ’ ” Ronald Pofalla , general secretary of the main conservative party in the country , the Christian Democratic Union , said to the mass - market paper Bild .
Dieter Wiefelspütz , a member of Parliament from the more liberal Social Democratic Party , said in an interview that he could not recall any court ruling in years that had aroused so much indignation .
Muslim leaders agreed that Muslims living here must be judged by the German legal code .
But they were just as offended by what they characterized as the judge ’s misinterpretation of a much - debated passage in the Koran governing relations between husbands and wives .
While the verse cited by Judge Datz - Winter does say husbands may beat their wives for disobedience — an interpretation embraced by Wahhabi and other fundamentalist Islamic groups — most mainstream Muslims have long rejected wife - beating as a relic of the medieval age .
“ Our prophet never struck a woman , and he is our example , ” Ayyub Axel Köhler , the head of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany , said in an interview .
The 26 - year - old woman in this case , whose name has not been disclosed , was not so fortunate .
Born in Germany to a Moroccan family , the woman was married in Morocco in 2001 , according to her lawyer , Ms. Becker - Rojczyk .
The couple settled in Germany and had two children .
In May 2006 , the police were summoned to the couple ’s home after a particularly violent incident .
At that time , Judge Datz - Winter ordered the husband to move out and stay at least 50 meters ( 164 feet ) away from the home .
In the months that followed , her lawyer said , the man threatened to kill his wife .
６月２７日、ドイツで馬とシマウマの間に生まれた子馬が話題に。提供写真（２００７年
ロイター）
［ビーレフェルト（ドイツ） ２７ 日 ロイター］ 馬の父とシマウマの母の間に生まれた雌の子馬が、当地近郊のサファリ・パークで話題となっている。
この子馬は現在１歳で、名前は「エクリス」。同パークで飼われていた雌のシマウマがイタリアの牧場に一時的に移された間に、たまたまできたという。
エクリスは、頭部と臀部には母親譲りのしま模様がある一方、胴体と足は真っ白という外見。馬とシマウマの両方の特徴を併せ持っている。
Pac - Man ’s skeleton
Ever wonder what Pac - Man ’s skeleton would look like ?
Well apparently so did the artist that created this .
What do you think , did he capture the spirit of the true Pac - Man or is it just a circle with teeth ?
The Pac - Man skeleton was created by Le Gentil Garcon with help from paleontologist Francois Escuilie in 2002 .
They created it by observing the human skull and different predatory animal skulls .
It is 35 cm in diameter and made of plaster .
The artist has several works , all equally odd , but interesting nonetheless .
Pac - Man-skelett [ via smidigt ]
Two weeks ago the whole Hanselman Family moved over to Google Apps for Domains .
What 's the verdict ?
Well , there was some good , some great and some truly awful .
Here 's the results of our migration and our general experience as we navigate the Google of it all .
Bad : Email Attachments via Right Click|Send
To do n't work .
Dad Hanselman says :
Still not totally used to it .... want to send a picture of the fathers ' day rose from
Mo to you guys but the send to concept does n't connect to gmail yet .
It defers to my old email system .
That is the only gripe at this time .
- Dad Hanselman
I have n't been able to find a tool / plugin / whatever that will allow folks to Right Click on their files and email them from Gmail .
This is slowing our photo and file sharing amongst the Hanselman Clan .
Bad : Migration from Gmail accounts is tricky and sometimes incomplete
It 's almost unforgivable that one has to resort to email POP hacks to migrate from a Gmail account to a Google Apps account .
There should be a way to MERGE the two accounts .
Instead , I used gMove and POP , and while gXfer set everything up correctly , my wife is missing at least 20 % of her email and it 's unclear why .
The Google POP puller just stopped pulling .
Very frustrating .
This should be feature # 1 on the part of Google .
I tried it twice , and I 'm sure the problem is on the Google end , as it seems to stop around specific few messages .
gXfer ( free ) worked fine for other family members .
We did get all her contacts and calendar moved just fine by gXfer as well .
Bad : Migration from Thunderbird tricky because of SMTP lockdowns
We were able to move all my Dad 's email from Thunderbird using the Gmail Loader but a lot has happened with SMTP servers as spam has become such a problem and it took several tries to find an SMTP server that would accept me sending out 6000 emails in a short amount of time .
The days of unauthenticated SMTP are over .
Bad : iGoogle Codebase NOT the same as the Personalized Google Apps Homepage
Something is VERY wrong in Googleville .
It appears that Google Apps for your Domain ( GAFYD ) is a fork or a trailing branch of the actual public Google experience .
That means that the personalized home page that all my users get is n't as shiny and new and wonderful as the iGoogle page that everyone else gets .
I 'd have assumed the OPPOSITE .
If I 'm paying I think I 'd get the new hotness sooner , not later .
Also , there 's no published calendar that I can find that will let me know when there will be feature parity .
The Google Apps Groups are pretty quiet on the Google side .
Also shockingly there does n't appear to be a Google Apps Blog , so there 's a sense of quiet and a lack of conversation going on .
Bad : Google Split Brain - Google App Accounts are NOT Google Accounts are NOT Gmail Accounts
If you have a Google Apps for your Domain account , you cant use it to log into Google Code .
Same with a non-gmail Google Account .
You can only log into Google Code with a Gmail account , which means I have to maintain an unused email address that weighs on my psychically .
Horribly Bad : Google Calendars not Delete - able nor Migrate- able
This is the worst ( most irritating ) issue for me personally .
I started a Google Calendar account before using my regular email account .
Now , when I hit calendar.google.com ( rather than calendar.hanselman.com )
I see this wonderful screen .
Seriously , take a moment and drink deeply of this screenshot .
Look at the choices .
I have a calendar associated with my address that I made before .
OK , I can handle that .
BUT ALL my existing appointments are in it , and I 'm told by this screen WILL STAY THERE .
Only new invitations will go to my new Hanselman Calendar , and the only way I can keep using the existing calendar ( remembering that I 'm not interested in keeping it ) is to change my Google Account email address - something I do n't want to do because I use it for iGoogle and other things .
When I DO try to change it I 'm told " Sorry , a gmail address is not allowed to be the primary address of this account . "
Also , note the bugs on this screen .
I 'm not used to seeing bugs in Google code , but there really seem to be a LOT in Google Apps .
Notice the broken image in the upper corner , as well as the " start using a null calendar " and incorrect link for my Domain Calendar .
There is no way to DELETE a primary calendar in Google - this just kills me .
I just want to delete the fact that there 's a calendar associated with my Google account - that also happens to be my Google for Apps account - and have one calendar .
Bad : POP is flaky from multiple clients
POP support works fine and I still backup my Gmail account into Outlook once a week and some of the Hanselpeople still use Outlook or Thunderbird , but sometimes it seems that POP for Gmail gets confused , specifically when multiple client connect .
Like if you use Outlook at work and Thunderbird at home , you might get duplicate emails downloading , as if a counter or date stamp somewhere got boogered .
So , do n't do that .
Bad : Apps using Google APIs are n't smart about Google Apps for your Domain
I use Plaxo and they support syncing between Google Calendar and Outlook .
Wonderful .
However , Plaxo does n't support syncing with Google Apps for your Domain .
Further proof that there 's some kind of frankencodebase thing going on in the back , or at least that the apps that use the API have to be smart about the URI they use .
I have n't seen if SyncMyCal supports Google Apps for your Domain , but the word on the street is that it DOES .
The real question is why does n't the Google Calendar API just handle this using the logged in username ?
Probably because of this " split brain " issue that I 've run into with two calendars associated with one email address .
Again , a problem fixable if I could just DELETE the first calendar .
I 'm not the only one suffering .
Bad : Ca n't use Custom iGoogle Gadgets on the Google Apps Homepage
I 'm unclear if this is because of stupid Gadgets or hardcoded URLs or what , but many Google Gadgets will only install into iGoogle .
Good : Space and Searching
g Move from LimitNone worked great for moving my email from Outlook and I 'm happy I paid for it .
I moved 15,000 emails and decided against moving the other 20,000 .
It did take a few days , as the Google Mail Fetcher takes its time , but it did n't matter to me .
I stole this image from the LimitNone Blog as it clearly explains what you can use to get your email moved around depending on your situation .
Everyone likes the space and searching and no one so far as used more than 5 % of the 10 gigs .
Good : Google Talk
One unexpected benefit that all the Hanselmen have enjoyed is the Google Chat support .
Everyone in our domain gets a GoogleTalk account .
I initially thought this would be lame because I only chat on MSN messenger .
However , not all the family are on messenger and most do n't want to download it and have just a few contacts .
What 's cool about Google Talk is that even those who do not have the client install can still chat .
An ajax-y DHTML chat popup will present itself when someone within the Hanselman world chats you .
Also , presence is based on whether or not you 're reading email .
This has actually caused us to talk to each other MORE .
" Oh , Jack 's online , how 's he doing ... "
Just today I chatted with my brother - in - law in South Africa .
I used the Google Talk client and he was just logged in over dial - up .
Very smooth and very cool .
Good : BlackBerry ( and Mobile ) Support
The BlackBerry support is great .
I almost like the BlackBerry Gmail app ( note , there 's two apps , one for Gmail and one for GAFYD - again with the Google Split Brain ) better than the BlackBerry email itself .
You 're looking at a view of your email , so everything one on the BlackBerry really affects the actual Gmail account .
Also , if you login to any of the standard URLs with a mobile browser the websites will render Tiny HTML for small screens .
There 's also a BlackBerry Google Talk client where the Google Talk Chats appear in your standard BlackBerry Inbox .
Conclusion
Most of these problems are not total blockers , but some are very annoying .
We 're critical because we expect so much .
Will these bugs continue to irritate ?
Sure , until they are fixed , particularly the Calendar one , but I 'm the only Hanselman with that problem .
At this point everyone in the family has said they are thrilled with the move and no one regrets it .
My Wish List
Be able to delete Google Calendar from a Google Account , thereby resolving the split brain calendar issue .
Be able to use my GAFYD Account as a proper Google Account .
Have all the APIs , especially the Calendar API , work automatically with GAFYD so my 3rd party tools would just work .
Have iGoogle as my GAFYD home page , and not the crippled Google Partner Page I have not .
Have a Windows Mobile Gmail client .
Currently you can download the Java one and use it with a " this is unsupported " warning , but while it 's rocking awesome on a BlackBerry , the fonts and navigation are totally lame on a WM SmartPhone .
Together with comments from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , Putin upped the stakes in a war of words with Washington over US missile defense shield plans that have seen a sharp downward spiral in relations .
Lavrov shrugged off American insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in Poland and the Czech Republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle Russia militarily .
" If strategic components of the American arsenal appear in Europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " Lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state - run television channel Vesti -24 .
A threat to Russia ?
US officials say the system poses no threat to Russia
The US plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of American global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis -- just look at the map -- is being deployed along Russia 's perimeter , and also China 's , incidentally . "
After repeated warnings from Russia that the US proposals would set off a new arms race , Moscow tested a new multi- warhead missile last week that Putin said was a direct response to US actions .
And in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the Russian president has warned that Russia would once again target Europe with missiles like it did during the Cold War .
" The anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects American territory , " Putin said in an interview with newspapers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations .
" For the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to Europe .
" We will get new targets in Europe "
" If the US nuclear potential extends across the European territory , we will get new targets in Europe , " he said .
" It will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
The interview was due to be published on Monday but pre-released by Germany 's Der Spiegel magazine .
Putin and his peers are meeting for a three - day G8 summit which begins in Germany on Wednesday .
" We want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " Putin said .
Tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the Cold War .
NATO - Russian cooperation
Can NATO help diffuse the situation ?
In spite of the sharp words , Lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of Russian cooperation with the West on missile defence , saying : " It would be better to resume work within the framework of the NATO - Russia Council on creating theater missile defense . "
Developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the NATO - Russia Council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
Washington says the central European shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as Iran or North Korea .
Russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing Russia 's military strength .

Steve Jobs is speaking out .
A few weeks ago he said the music labels should eliminate DRM protection .
This week he said " I believe that what is wrong with our schools in this nation is that they have become unionized in the worst possible way " .
April Castro of the Associated Press wrote a story " Apple CEO lambasts teachers unions " , where Jobs said , " What kind of person could you get to run a small business if you told them that when they came in they could n't get rid of people that they thought were n't any good ? " he asked to loud applause during an education reform conference . "
My take ?
Steve got it half right .
I agree that You can't fire the bad ones .
The other half of the problem is that you can't reward the good ones .
That is what all unions do ... protect the incompetent ones .
Unions eliminate " pay for performance " and instead " pay by seniority " .
How do they get this seniority ?
Just breathe ... because they can't be fired .
About the only way a teacher can be fired is for sexual misconduct , some other crime , or obvious malfeasance .
Perhaps worse , unions do n't allow rewards for excellent individual performance .
Where is the incentive for teachers , or any union member , to work harder , take risks , and excel ?
: I wrote another post that explores the other side of the problem
Fire the bad students , and give rewards to both good teachers and students .
Robert Scoble agrees with me , while Dan Farber says the problem starts with teacher salaries .
Most of us work for businesses without unions , and most of us do just fine without the " protection " of a union .
In fact , we enjoy " pay for performance " and work hard to earn promotions and bonuses .
Yes , there are some large businesses that protect incompetent workers and refuse to fire them .
But at least they do n't hold back the star performers and do reward them for their efforts .
Pay teachers more money ?
Politicians always shout we need to pay teachers more money .
Have you ever researched how much the average teacher gets paid ?
Not the starting salary of a 23 year old first year teacher ... the average teacher .
The politicians always point out the starting salary , but the truth is that almost no one gets paid that amount .
The Hoover Institute published a paper on teachers salaries , citing the American Federation of Teachers effort to compare teachers wages to other professions .
The Hoover report responded ;
" Where , one wonders , are the comparisons with journalists , registered nurses , assistant district attorneys , FBI agents , military officers , and other not - so - highly compensated professionals and public - sector employees ?
Should n’t the average pay of a high - school English teacher be compared with that of writers and editors ?
One could make a case that the salaries of high - school physics or calculus teachers should bear some resemblance to those of computer system analysts , but does the AFT believe that the appropriate compensation benchmarks for 3rd - grade teachers are the salaries of engineers or attorneys ? "
Teachers only work about 180 days per year , so on an hourly basis they are making a very good wage .
The rest of us work about 240 days per year , or about 33 % more .
Does n't it make sense that teachers should be paid 33 % less than the average worker with similar responsibility ?
Take a look at this chart from the Hoover Institute that compares average hourly wages of many different professions .
Teachers make a higher average hourly wage than accountants , computer programmers , auditors , and even more than architects and engineers who work in State and Local governments .
Steve Jobs said that putting more technology into schools will not significantly improve the results .
This is a bold statement for the Apple CEO to make after decades of subsidizing the purchase of Apple computers for use in public schools .
But once again , I think Steve Jobs is right .
Until we solve the problem of how to reward great teachers and remove poor teachers we will not see significantly better results .
The problem is not money .
Schools already get more than 50 % of the local budgets in most cities and towns .
Health care is the same deal .
We spend more per capita on health care than any country in the world .
The problems with education and health care are not lack of funding .
The problem is lack of incentive .
But now our company has grown a lot , and we are now addressing $ M+ projects that have strong requirements in terms of performance , availability and integration into our clients ’ information systems .
Over the past 6 years , we have worked hard trying to push Zope past its natural limits to meet the needs of our customers .
We had to work on all levels , including many infrastructure components ( object database , document model , index engine , workflow engine , programming tools … ) , while seeing more and more compelling components appearing in the open source Java world ( Jackrabbit , Lucene , jBPM , Eclipse… ) .
We also had worked on rich client tools , through the Apogee project we initiated and that has recently been approved by the Eclipse Foundation .
We found the Eclipse model of extensible components , based on OSGi , to be both compelling and in some ways similar to the “ Zope component architecture ” we were familiar with .
After working on an hybrid combination of Zope front - end and Jackrabbit + Lucene backend , we finally decided that the time was ripe for a full rewrite , that would take advantage of both our ECM and Java experience .
Pros :
It is easier to hire and train staff , both for us and our partners
There is a strong ecosystem of open source libraries , the most relevant for ECM applications being : Jackrabbit , Lucene , jBPM , JBoss Rules , etc .
We have a choice of applications servers
Our main customers and partners ask us for it
There are a lot of tools to help developers be productive
It will be easier to integrate with the customers information systems
Java is now “ Agile ” thanks to JUnit , refactoring support in mdern IDEs , the OSGi component model , AOP , upcoming JVM scripting support ( JSR - 223 ) …
The overall dynamism of the open source Java community ( thanks to the Apache , JBoss , Eclipse , ObjectWeb , etc. groups or projects ) is compelling Cons :
We have to rewrite the whole application from scratch ( but the other option was to manage a transition from Zope 2 to Zope 3 , which would have been less dramatic , but still a lot of work , maybe more than the Java rewrite )
We ’re losing our status as the biggest Zope - focussed company in the World ( but we intend to claim the title of biggest open source ECM company , with more focus on business ( ECM ) and less on technology )
We ’re leaving the Python community , which was full of smart and knowledgeable people ( but we know the Open Source Java community is cool too
Nuxeo SAS has announced that the next generation of its enterprise content management platform , due to November 2006 , will be based on open source Java technologies , specifically JBoss SEAM EJB 3 , and JBoss Application server .
The move is interesting as previously they were mainly a Python shop using the ZOPE application server , and they claimed to be " the biggest Zope - focused company in the world . "
Last week InfoQ spoke to Nuxeo 's engineering team to find the why and how of their move .
The company initially chose ZOPE as it's primary platform back in 2000 when there were no open source Java alternatives .
On the pros/cons analysis of the move , the team found the following :
The company is believes it will take 5 ( mythical ) man-years to reach a functional scope similar to what they had in previous versions , with a sounder and more scalable overall architecture .
They have already been working on the port for 6 months , and are on schedule to meet the milestones in the current roadmap .
On why they chose OSGI :
OSGi is the model used by Eclipse .
We are targeting Eclipse RCP with Nuxeo RCP , the rich client side of our project , in the sense that we want the same core components to be usable both on a Java EE application server and on Eclipse .
Hence we had to use OSGi .
Besides , OSGi has several useful features : it is probably the most complete mainstream Java packaging and service model
it allows dynamic activation and hot deployment
it manages dependencies between bundles
Of course these functionalities are probably available on other platforms , but by using OSGi , which is a POJO component model , we can easily adapt it to other target platforms .
We have also observed that several Java EE application servers already support , or plan to support OSGi in the future : Geronimo , JBoss AS 5 , JOnAS .
That made our choice even clearer .
What we have added to OSGi is the extension points mechanism , inspired by Eclipse , which gives a lot of freedom in configuring and extending applications .
We also plan to make this mechanism compatible with the OSGi descriptive services .
The company decided to adopt JBoss SEAM as their web application framework , due to the ' highly conversational ' nature of the apps they need to host .
In addition they chose to use JBoss application server as a full Java EE environment in order to get the benefits of EJB and a ' real ' application server :
Performances : Nuxeo 5 targets high document volume with high level of concurrent transactions , and we believe the pooling and state replication services of an EJB container will allow us to reach these goals .
Integrity and security : Nuxeo 5 leverages the transaction and security model of EJB3 .
As we have a very modular system , having a simple way to waranty transaction and security propagation to all components on all JVMs is important .
Clear separation of Presentation and Business logic :
All processing and services of Nuxeo 5 are implemented using EJB3 .
This clear separation gives us several advantages : you can choose to deploy presentation and logic on differents JVM we can easily split the business components on several machines to externalise the services that have intensive needs of ressources the development model for business and presentation are differents , as they should be
Remote access to the business layer : Because Nuxeo 5 can be used both via a thin client and via a rich client , EJB3 gives us the opportunity to expose a remote business API .
This remote API can be accessed via SOAP ( as this would be possible in Tomcat ) but also via RMI and IIOP .
The emphasis on JBoss is tactical : we want to get a working product out of the door ASAP ( in November 2006 to be precise ) and we believe the best way to achieve this is to focus on one target platform .
JBoss is production - ready , Java EE 5 / EJB 3 compliant , and professionally supported .
Last , we have chosen to use three products from JBoss ( Seam , jBPM and JBoss Rules ) as primary building blocks for our platform .
We know they can also be used on top of other servers than JBoss , but it ’s more convenient for us to work with the same partner for both the application servers and these additionnal components .
But in the long run , we will target other application servers , including Glassfish , JOnAS and Geronimo .
We have specifically designed the Nuxeo Runtime layer of Nuxeo 5 to be able to do this , by pluging in new adapters for each new platform we ( or third - party contributors to the project ) will want to target .
There is a roadmap on the website .
First server platform release is scheduled for November 2006 , while several core components will be released sooner .
Participation to the project is encouraged .
The project is licensed under the LGPL .

The XFEL will start in a chamber more than 30 m underground
The intense beam made in the 3.4 km - long ( 2.1 miles ) machine will probe how matter is pieced together atom by atom .
The properties of the X -ray Free-Electron Laser ( XFEL ) should make it possible , for example , to film the very moment a chemical reaction occurs .
Construction of the 986 m euro ( £ 668 m ) facility will begin later this year .
It will be placed underground .
The XFEL will begin on the DESY ( Deutsches Elektronen - Synchrotron ) site in Hamburg and then run north - west , fanning out to experimental stations close to the neighbouring town of Schenefeld .
Electron wiggle
Scientists from academia and industry across the world are expected to apply for time on the facility when it becomes operational in 2013 .
The linear accelerator will run for 3.4km
" This will be a fundamental research tool that is needed , for example , to make advances in the pharmaceutical industry and in the domain of new materials , in particular nano - materials , " explained Professor Massimo Altarelli , the XFEL project team leader .
" It will also lead to a lot of advances in plasma physics , in high - energy density matter because its pulses generate plasmas in conditions that you cannot generate any other way .
This is relevant for astrophysics and for understanding fusion for energy production , " he told BBC News .
The first part of the XFEL consists of a particle accelerator in which bunches of electrons are taken to almost the speed of light , before being thrown down a slalom course controlled by a long system of magnets known as undulators .
As the electrons bend and turn , they emit flashes of X - rays ; and as the particles interact with the radiation , they also bunch even tighter .
Their compact configuration not only intensifies their light emission but gives it coherence as well .
In essence , the X - rays are " in sync " and have the properties of laser light .
Getting depth
The peak brilliance of the linear XFEL should be a billion times greater than current X - ray light sources that use a ring configuration - such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) at Grenoble , France ; or the recently opened Diamond Light Source at Harwell , UK .
The detected X - ray pattern reveals the target 's internal structure
The XFEL should produce flashes of light that last less than 100 quadrillionths of a second ( 100 femtoseconds ) .
This is the timescale of molecular movement , which will make it possible to film chemical reactions without any blurring of the image .
In addition , because the flashes have the properties of laser light , it should be possible to do holography - to capture three - dimensional images of molecules .
" The brilliance of the free - electron laser gives us the hope that we will be able to get an X - ray diffraction pattern for a single macromolecule like a protein , so that you do n't need to crystallise the protein to deduce its atomic structure , " said Professor Altarelli .
" Crystallisation is actually impossible for a vast class of proteins , notably cell membrane proteins .
That 's a major roadblock in structural biology that the XFEL will hopefully overcome . "
Lighting up the future
The XFEL is one of the major projects listed on a roadmap of research infrastructures that Europe feels it needs to fulfil its scientific goals over the next 20 years .
These range from high - performance computing systems through to a plan to construct the world 's biggest telescope .
An undulator is a special arrangement of magnets
On Tuesday , bureaucrats and scientists from EU member states met in Hamburg to formally launch the linear accelerator project .
Although not all the 986 m euros have been committed , sufficient funds are now available to construct a fully working facility .
It is expected more money will come at a later date to develop the project to slightly higher energies and provide more experimental stations .
The UK is still assessing - and negotiating - the terms of its membership .
A sum of about £ 30 m ( via the Large Facilities Capital Fund ) has been reserved for the XFEL .
Britain would probably give some of this in a cash payment but the greater part of its contribution would be in - kind , providing technologies such as detectors .
Professor Robert Donovan is currently conducting a review for the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council that will help determine on what basis Britain gets involved in so called fourth - generation light sources .
The US and Japan have designs of their own , but Professor Donovan told BBC News : " The XFEL is the next big step forward .
The Germans are leading in a lot of technological areas and we would be joining the number one team in the world in terms of building X - ray free - electron lasers . "
This trust is paramount to the Android Security team .
The team focuses on ensuring that Android devices respect the privacy and sensitivity of user data .
A fundamental aspect of this work centers around the lockscreen , which acts as the proverbial front door to our devices .
After all , the lockscreen ensures that only the intended user (s ) of a device can access their private data .
This blog post outlines recent improvements around how users interact with the lockscreen on Android devices and more generally with authentication .
In particular , we focus on two categories of authentication that present both immense potential as well as potentially immense risk if not designed well : biometrics and environmental modalities .
The tiered authentication model
Before getting into the details of lockscreen and authentication improvements , we first want to establish some context to help relate these improvements to each other .
A good way to envision these changes is to fit them into the framework of the tiered authentication model , a conceptual classification of all the different authentication modalities on Android , how they relate to each other , and how they are constrained based on this classification .
The model itself is fairly simple , classifying authentication modalities into three buckets of decreasing levels of security and commensurately increasing constraints .
The primary tier is the least constrained in the sense that users only need to re-enter a primary modality under certain situations ( for example , after each boot or every 72 hours ) in order to use its capability .
The secondary and tertiary tiers are more constrained because they cannot be set up and used without having a primary modality enrolled first and they have more constraints further restricting their capabilities .
Primary Tier - Knowledge Factor :
The first tier consists of modalities that rely on knowledge factors , or something the user knows , for example , a PIN , pattern , or password .
Good high - entropy knowledge factors , such as complex passwords that are hard to guess , offer the highest potential guarantee of identity .
Knowledge factors are especially useful on Android becauses devices offer hardware backed brute - force protection with exponential - backoff , meaning Android devices prevent attackers from repeatedly guessing a PIN , pattern , or password by having hardware backed timeouts after every 5 incorrect attempts .
Knowledge factors also confer additional benefits to all users that use them , such as File Based Encryption ( FBE ) and encrypted device backup .
Secondary Tier - Biometrics :
The second tier consists primarily of biometrics , or something the user is .
Face or fingerprint based authentications are examples of secondary authentication modalities .
Biometrics offer a more convenient but potentially less secure way of confirming your identity with a device .
We will delve into Android biometrics in the next section .
The Tertiary Tier - Environmental :
The last tier includes modalities that rely on something the user has .
This could either be a physical token , such as with Smart Lock ’s Trusted Devices where a phone can be unlocked when paired with a safelisted bluetooth device .
Or it could be something inherent to the physical environment around the device , such as with Smart Lock ’s Trusted Places where a phone can be unlocked when it is taken to a safelisted location .
Improvements to tertiary authentication While both Trusted Places and Trusted Devices ( and tertiary modalities in general ) offer convenient ways to get access to the contents of your device , the fundamental issue they share is that they are ultimately a poor proxy for user identity .
For example , an attacker could unlock a misplaced phone that uses Trusted Place simply by driving it past the user 's home , or with moderate amount of effort , spoofing a GPS signal using off - the - shelf Software Defined Radios and some mild scripting .
Similarly with Trusted Device , access to a safelisted bluetooth device also gives access to all data on the user ’s phone .
Because of this , a major improvement has been made to the environmental tier in Android 10 .
The Tertiary tier was switched from an active unlock mechanism into an extending unlock mechanism instead .
In this new mode , a tertiary tier modality can no longer unlock a locked device .
Instead , if the device is first unlocked using either a primary or secondary modality , it can continue to keep it in the unlocked state for a maximum of four hours .
A closer look at Android biometrics
Biometric implementations come with a wide variety of security characteristics , so we rely on the following two key factors to determine the security of a particular implementation :
Architectural security :
The resilience of a biometric pipeline against kernel or platform compromise .
A pipeline is considered secure if kernel and platform compromises do n’t grant the ability to either read raw biometric data , or inject synthetic data into the pipeline to influence an authentication decision .
Spoofability : Is measured using the Spoof Acceptance Rate ( SAR ) .
SAR is a metric first introduced in Android P , and is intended to measure how resilient a biometric is against a dedicated attacker .
Read more about SAR and its measurement in Measuring Biometric Unlock Security .
We use these two factors to classify biometrics into one of three different classes in decreasing order of security :
Class 3 ( formerly Strong )
Class 2 ( formerly Weak )
Class 1 ( formerly Convenience )
Each class comes with an associated set of constraints that aim to balance their ease of use with the level of security they offer .
These constraints reflect the length of time before a biometric falls back to primary authentication , and the allowed application integration .
For example , a Class 3 biometric enjoys the longest timeouts and offers all integration options for apps , while a Class 1 biometric has the shortest timeouts and no options for app integration .
You can see a summary of the details in the table below , or the full details in the Android Android Compatibility Definition Document ( CDD ) .
1 App integration means exposing an API to apps ( e.g. , via integration with BiometricPrompt / BiometricManager , androidx.biometric , or FIDO2 APIs )
2 Keystore integration means integrating Keystore , e.g. , to release app auth - bound keys
Benefits and caveats
Biometrics provide convenience to users while maintaining a high level of security .
Because users need to set up a primary authentication modality in order to use biometrics , it helps boost the lockscreen adoption ( we see an average of 20 % higher lockscreen adoption on devices that offer biometrics versus those that do not ) .
This allows more users to benefit from the security features that the lockscreen provides : gates unauthorized access to sensitive user data and also confers other advantages of a primary authentication modality to these users , such as encrypted backups .
Finally , biometrics also help reduce shoulder surfing attacks in which an attacker tries to reproduce a PIN , pattern , or password after observing a user entering the credential .
However , it is important that users understand the trade - offs involved with the use of biometrics .
Primary among these is that no biometric system is foolproof .
This is true not just on Android , but across all operating systems , form - factors , and technologies .
For example , a face biometric implementation might be fooled by family members who resemble the user or a 3D mask of the user .
A fingerprint biometric implementation could potentially be bypassed by a spoof made from latent fingerprints of the user .
Although anti-spoofing or Presentation Attack Detection ( PAD ) technologies have been actively developed to mitigate such spoofing attacks , they are mitigations , not preventions .
One effort that Android has made to mitigate the potential risk of using biometrics is the lockdown mode introduced in Android P. Android users can use this feature to temporarily disable biometrics , together with Smart Lock ( for example , Trusted Places and Trusted Devices ) as well as notifications on the lock screen , when they feel the need to do so .
To use the lockdown mode , users first need to set up a primary authentication modality and then enable it in settings .
The exact setting where the lockdown mode can be enabled varies by device models , and on a Google Pixel 4 device it is under Settings > Display >
Lock screen >
Show lockdown option .
Once enabled , users can trigger the lockdown mode by holding the power button and then clicking the Lockdown icon on the power menu .
A device in lockdown mode will return to the non-lockdown state after a primary authentication modality ( such as a PIN , pattern , or password ) is used to unlock the device .
BiometricPrompt - New APIs
In order for developers to benefit from the security guarantee provided by Android biometrics and to easily integrate biometric authentication into their apps to better protect sensitive user data , we introduced the BiometricPrompt APIs in Android P .
There are several benefits of using the BiometricPrompt APIs .
Most importantly , these APIs allow app developers to target biometrics in a modality - agnostic way across different Android devices ( that is , BiometricPrompt can be used as a single integration point for various biometric modalities supported on devices ) , while controlling the security guarantees that the authentication needs to provide ( such as requiring Class 3 or Class 2 biometrics , with device credential as a fallback ) .
In this way , it helps protect app data with a second layer of defenses ( in addition to the lockscreen ) and in turn respects the sensitivity of user data .
Furthermore , BiometricPrompt provides a persistent UI with customization options for certain information ( for example , title and description ) , offering a consistent user experience across biometric modalities and across Android devices .
As shown in the following architecture diagram , apps can integrate with biometrics on Android devices through either the framework API or the support library ( that is , androidx.biometric for backward compatibility ) .
One thing to note is that FingerprintManager is deprecated because developers are encouraged to migrate to BiometricPrompt for modality - agnostic authentications .
Improvements to BiometricPrompt
Android 10 introduced the BiometricManager class that developers can use to query the availability of biometric authentication and included fingerprint and face authentication integration for BiometricPrompt .
In Android 11 , we introduce new features such as the BiometricManager .
Authenticators interface which allows developers to specify the authentication types accepted by their apps , as well as additional support for auth - per-use keys within the Biometric Prompt class .

It takes all of about four minutes for 4,300 cadets to file into the West Point mess hall for breakfast .
Meals are taken inside a graceful granite building whose arched ceilings , dark wooden walls , and low lighting give it the feel of a Gothic cathedral — one where the parishioners are dressed in gray or camouflage uniforms , and the saints , staring down from massive oil paintings lining the walls , are decorated generals .
A rumbling chatter echoes as the cadets are seated , until a clear , forceful voice , coming from a balcony above the main dining - room floor , quiets the cavernous room .
“ Please give your attention to the first captain ! ”
Then another voice , this one belonging to the top - ranked cadet .
“ I regret to inform you of the death of First Lieutenant Phillip Neel , class of 2005 .
First Lieutenant Neel died on 8 April 2007 , in Balad , Iraq , when his unit came in contact with enemy forces using grenades .
Please join me in observing a moment of silence for this fallen graduate . ”
Among the silent is cadet David del Cuadro - Zimmerman , 22 , a son of Park Slope , who is in his final year at the United States Military Academy .
Later that day , he nods solemnly ; he remembers seeing Lieutenant Neel on campus not that long ago .
“ Those announcements seem to come more frequently now , ” he says .
Four years ago , as the war in Iraq began , del Cuadro - Zimmerman ’s parents , both retired public - school teachers , had offered to pay for whatever college he chose — anywhere that would keep him from going to West Point .
At the last minute , though , he picked Army over Boston College .
Now he ’s ready to start flight school and get to Iraq .
Yet he ca n’t help wondering what his life would have been like had he taken up his parents on their offer .
Nine hundred cadets will graduate from West Point on May 26 .
Five are from New York City .
After taking in a commencement speech from Vice - President Dick Cheney , and after tossing their caps in the air in the football stadium , the Army ’s newest officers will scatter for months of branch training .
Perhaps before it ends , Congress will cut off money for the war and bring the troops home .
Perhaps Nouri al - Maliki , the Iraqi prime minister , will prestidigitate a functioning government and police force .
But the most likely scenario is that all but a handful of the 900 graduates will be in harm ’s way by this time next year .
They ’ll face grim odds .
West Point graduates are taking a larger share of casualties than at any time in recent American military history .
Of the almost 3,800 military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan , 49 have been USMA alumni .
That ’s three times the percentage of graduate deaths in Vietnam , six times higher than what befell former cadets in the Second World War , and thirteen times the proportion of those killed in the First World War .
Suicide bombers , IEDs , snipers — it ’s little wonder that more officers are doing the “ five and fly , ” the term for leaving uniform as soon as the required five years of active duty is finished .
The Army is now suffering from a shortage of about 3,000 mid-level officers , which has caused President Bush to gradually increase the size of West Point ’s entering classes , growing the student body from 4,000 to 4,300 cadets in the past four years .
New York ’s newest warriors are part of the first class to matriculate after the war in Iraq began .
Some were pulled by patriotism ; for others , joining the Army was a truly radical form of rebellion .
All knew what they were signing up for — although they could n’t have anticipated the questions that would arise about the weapons of mass destruction , or the country ’s political sea change , or even that we ’d still be there four years later .
Somehow , they ’ve held onto an inspiring , clear - eyed idealism .
Or maybe it ’s a self - preserving denial .
“ Everyone is optimistic about what lies ahead , ” del Cuadro - Zimmerman says .
“ Dwelling on why the country went to war in the first place is a waste of time .
It ’s about making things right now , or at least doing right from here forward . ”
Marya Rosenberg had been in the Army for ten days , and she was starving .
It was June 2003 , the beginning of the introductory summer session for new cadets — and for many , the roughest stretch of their entire four years at West Point .
Rosenberg is a naturally lean five foot seven , but she had melted from 134 pounds to 122 .
Running in the summer heat with a 25 - pound pack on her back contributed to the drastic drop , but the real cause was even more basic — and more cruel .
“ They would n’t let me eat , ” Rosenberg , 22 , says of the senior cadets running the indoctrination .
“ I was screwing up everything at first — I could n’t even march in step .
So at meals , they put me at the haze table .
They tell you anything you eat has to be small enough to swallow in three to five chews .
This went on for two weeks , until my squad started volunteering to switch out with me because they thought I was dying . ”

Rosenberg was 50 miles north of the city and a long way from home .
She ’d grown up on East 84th Street , between Madison and Fifth Avenues , in a cozy sixth - floor two - bedroom .
She could lean over the railing of her apartment ’s rooftop deck and see the Met.
Rosenberg ’s parents are both semi-retired corporate lawyers with refined literary tastes .
She ’d gone to Hunter , one of the city ’s elite public high schools , and a place where a liberal political viewpoint is as assumed as the school building ’s staying upright .
By tenth grade , Rosenberg was feeling aimless .
So when an unsolicited postcard from West Point arrived in her mailbox , along with dozens from conventional colleges thanks to her stellar PSAT scores , Rosenberg was curious , if unserious .
“ I thought it was hilarious , ” she says .
“ It seemed so out of character in terms of everything I was doing .
I said , ‘ Well , I ’m not making a commitment if I send in the card . ’ ”
Marya ’s father , however , was more intrigued .
To Richard Rosenberg , West Point seemed a strangely perfect fit .
When Marya and her younger sister , Alexandra , were small , their father would read them nightly bedtime stories , selecting the books with care .
“ I happen to like knight stories , ” says Richard .
“ So in the beginning , there was a version of King Arthur , by Sir James Knowles .
The last thing I read Marya was Moby - Dick , which I would say is a weird , sad , modern knight story .
The medieval romances are , of course , fantasies — but nothing just happens in those stories .
Everything is intended to teach — specifically , the values of the warrior class . ”
Making the decision to go to West Point during a polarizing war is a bold choice for a high - school student living in one of the deepest - blue precincts of a staunchly antiwar city .
“ Everybody was all busy protesting the war at the time , ” says Marya .
“ Hunter is really liberal , and I ’m a liberal too .
But I had one girl ask me what I was thinking about doing for college , and when I told her , she said , ‘ How could you do something so immoral ? ’
They made fun of me in the yearbook . ”
She is regularly reminded that , apart from her parents ’ place on East 84th , New York is not her home anymore .
“ There ’s a graduate of West Point who endowed this great program that sends cadets to the opera , ” she says .
“ A couple of years ago , we went to the Metropolitan Opera and The New Yorker wrote an article and they were dubious about the idea .
There was a line in the story , something like ‘ After all , Josef Mengele liked to listen to opera when he was torturing people . ’
That made me so angry .
Do you guys recall who stopped Josef Mengele ?
It was not reporters at The New Yorker , or people in New York City with correct moral principles .
It was people in the Army . ”
Richard Rosenberg , sitting in his Upper East Side living room , becomes visibly distraught at the thought of his daughter ’s choice going unappreciated .
“ I grew up in Liberty , New York , the Catskills , ” he says .
“ When a child from Liberty gets into West Point ” — his voice breaks — “ they get their picture in the paper , you know ?
They make a big deal of it . ”
But the reaction Marya got from her Hunter teachers and classmates only confirmed her decision to join the Army .
And her sister has followed in her footsteps .
Alexandra is now a plebe , finishing up her freshman year at West Point .
Richard glances up at his wife , who is slicing some coffee cake from Greenberg ’s .
“ Kate was upset when Marya got interested in West Point , ” he says .
“ I just knew it was going to happen , ” she says quietly , adjusting her tortoiseshell glasses .
“ Like the fates had been arranged , ” Richard says .
The attackers have Mark Zambarda surrounded .
They ’re rushing in , fists flying — first one , then another pair , then a fourth , closing fast .
Everyone is taller and heavier than Zambarda .
But he does n’t wait , or run away .
He charges the nearest man , pins his arms , and uses him as a shield .
Punches rock Zambarda ’s head , but he does n’t panic .
He keeps moving , pivoting , warding off blows with the body of one of his enemies , sweat turning his fatigues a dark swampy green .
The whistle blows after two minutes .
Zambarda and his attackers — his classmates — suck wind .
He ’s exhausted , but he ’s upright , staggering across the matted floor inside Arvin gym .
“ Most kids are crushed the first time , ” says professor Jason Winkle .
“ They forget what they ’re doing and end up cowering or becoming a punching bag .
Mark was a natural .
He was the aggressor , and he stayed under control .
As far as heart , he ’s one of the biggest kids in the world . ”

Zambarda , 21 , grew up playing with GI Joes in a blue - collar section of Staten Island , the son of an narcotics detective in the NYPD .
Family friends died responding to the attacks of September 11 , and his father spent days vainly searching for survivors .
“ I thought I needed to consider doing something to give back to the country .
Less than three - tenths of one percent of the population is serving in the military , ” the cadet says .
Zambarda knew that one of his father ’s few regrets was not serving in Vietnam .
“ You ’re 18 years old , you ’re ready to grab the bull by the horns .
Joining the military seemed like a cool thing to do .
I still think it ’s one of the coolest jobs a guy can have , ” he says .
“ But the reality of going to war was n’t really a consideration . ”
The reality of going to war has dramatically changed the experience of West Point .
There are still the standard elements of a military education — Introduction to Warfighting , Tactical Leadership , Combined Arms Operations I and II — but the academy has adapted to meet the specific demands of battle in Iraq .
The multiple - attacker exercise , which Winkle calls “ the Gauntlet , ” is part of a course called Advanced Close - Quarters Combat ; Zambarda took it in the fall of his junior year .
West Point hired Winkle as director of combatives in the days immediately following September 11 , as one of the first steps in retooling a curriculum for an unpredictable and dangerous new period .
He ’d spent his career training Navy seals and Army Special Forces units .
“ West Point has changed almost everything it teaches about on - the - ground combat in the past five years , ” says Winkle , who is now teaching at Indiana State .
“ In the Vietnam era , we were doing jungle warfare ; in the first Gulf War , it was a lot of air strikes .
Now we ’ve moved into an era where urban warfare is predominant .
I introduced military operations in urban terrain . ”
Nine instructors , most rotating through West Point after tours in Iraq , teach the tactics of asymmetric warfare .
“ When you have to hunt the bad guy in the streets in the middle of people trying to live and exist , you ’ve got some major issues , ” Winkle says .
“ People are shooting at us from mosques , but if we return fire , we ’re the bad guy .
It ’s extremely tough .
We do a lot of mind - set training on what it means to be a warrior :
When you ’re terrified and someone ’s trying to hurt you , how do you not squeeze that trigger ?
It ’s critical that we give them an ethical basis to fall back on . ”
Even as the churning of the leadership ranks has increased the pressure to produce greater numbers of field commanders , the academy has clung tenaciously to its mission — turning out well - rounded adults , not just battle - ready grunts .
The debacle in Iraq has made that mission even more important .
“ The new lieutenants are coming out of four years at the academy , and they ’re put in charge of guys who ’ve done two or three tours already , ” Winkle says .
“ They ’re expected to show up and lead these soldiers .
That ’s a heck of a thing to hang over some young kid ’s head . ”
Especially because Iraq is very much a platoon leader ’s war .
Fighting an insurgency means they ’re out in front , commanding small units instead of working in larger formations directed by senior officials off the battlefield .
The first lieutenants have unusual power to exercise independent judgment — but they ’re also far more vulnerable than in other wars .
West Point has tried to prepare the cadets more thoroughly by expanding its menu of ethics courses — partly as a response to embarrassments like Abu Ghraib , but primarily because its graduates are dropped into the middle of a world of shadowy allegiances and unending stress .
The academy has also added courses on terrorism , a subject barely addressed in the curriculum before September 11 .
It was only in 2003 that the academy opened its Combating Terrorism Center .
In classes like Terrorism : New Challenges , the school attempts to catch up with the modern threat .
Inside Thayer Hall , sixteen cadets are riveted to a TV set , watching Dirty Kuffar , an infamous , somewhat goofy jihadist video made somewhere in England .
On screen , a black - masked , gun-waving man dances and raps in front of a flag filled with Arabic slogans .
The video cuts quickly to American soldiers being shot , to photos of President Bush shaking hands with Ariel Sharon , to a glimpse of a smiling Saddam Hussein .
“ We cover the roots of terrorism , how does an individual become involved with a violent organization , the strategic uses of violence , ” says professor Lianne Kennedy - Boudali , one of five part - time instructors in the terrorism program .
“ And we want the cadets to have an understanding of how their role fits in a larger strategic picture , both for their own safety and because what they do on a daily basis has an effect on U.S. policy .
The cadets are going to end up on the ground in a year , so this is pretty practical information .
They need to understand the difference between a Sunni Baathist , what that person wants out of an act of violence , versus Al Qaeda in Iraq , and who each is trying to influence .
What changes most is the part dealing with insurgency , about the relationship between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency . ”
Zambarda was one of Kennedy - Boudali ’s best students .
“ Mark and the other cadets are smart ; they do n’t take a lot of things for granted , ” she says .
“ And they ’re kind of cynical , which is good , too . ”
When a West Point graduate is killed in Afghanistan or Iraq , word passes quickly .
Marya Rosenberg had heard about Phil Neel the day before the announcement in the mess hall .
“ He was in my company two years ago , ” she says .
“ And I was on a team with him in my second year here .
I do n’t want to jump on other people ’s tragedies , because I did n’t know him that well .
I ’m really sorry this happened for his family .
Some of my friends in the company are really devastated by his death .
They were close to him , and that was upsetting , to see them upset .
Two of my good friends from the class of ’05 are in Iraq right now , though thankfully they ’ve been okay so far . ”
Rosenberg is acutely aware that her hometown believes Neel ’s death , along with the thousands of others in Iraq , was in the service of a falsely entered , then mismanaged war .
But she sticks to the cadet ’s duty not to publicly criticize the chain of command .
Whatever mission she ’s sent on , she ’ll fulfill .
Still , she does n’t necessarily disagree that the war in Iraq has been misguided .
“ I do n’t want to get into criticizing the president or anything , ” she says diplomatically .
“ But I have a lot of respect for the retired generals who have spoken out against things that are clearly wrong . ”
Sometimes , though , after taps is played each night at 11:30 , talk in the barracks turns to who is to blame for the mess in Iraq .
“ People do n’t attribute the mistakes to any one person in particular , ” says one cadet .
“ Well , okay — Donald Rumsfeld .
And there ’s a disappointment with the civilian leadership overall . ”
Interestingly , though , the leaders who come in for the harshest critiques are the ones in uniform .
“ The generals have n’t spoken up as much as they should have , ” says a New York cadet .
“ When you become a four - star general , the expectation is that you ’re a politician as well as a military leader , and you ca n’t always hold your tongue .
Sometimes you have to speak up , and a lot of people feel that has n’t been done .
The troops just are n’t getting what ’s needed over there , or they ’re getting it too late .
That ’s what makes people upset . ”
Another thing that makes cadets mad is the public ’s indifference to their sacrifice .
Joseph McCarthy , 21 , who grew up in the Bronx , was in class at Stuyvesant when the planes hit .
“ Anyone who ’s in support of the troops , I ’d just like to say , let the troops know , you know ? ” says McCarthy , who is headed for an artillery unit .
“ Everyone has different opinions on the war , but at least let the soldiers know you ’re there for them . ”
Zambarda loves a good argument ; often playing devil ’s advocate , he constantly turns issues over in his head .
He reads the Times every day , and has been closely following the debate in Congress over setting a deadline for withdrawal .
“ As far as setting a deadline , it ’s a step in the right direction , ” he says .
“ It ’s forcing the government to evaluate ; what is the exit plan ?
As long as it does n’t come to the point where we ’re leaving the soldiers hanging out to dry . ”
Still , he says , “ if I really wanted to make policy decisions , I should have been a politician .
My job is to execute the orders , the lawful orders , of those above me . ”
At the end of the day , there ’s simply not much point in debating something that is a fact of life .
“ The larger Army attitude does n’t really change , ” says one cadet .
“ We ’ve all gone through stuff here we thought was pretty unpleasant .
So if you stay the four years , you have that attitude : Maybe things suck , but you have to put your head down and keep going .
And that characterizes people ’s attitudes toward the war . ”
Rosenberg recently went back to Hunter , her old high school , to talk to students about what it ’s like to be a cadet right now .
Mostly the students were respectful ; the faculty was another story .
“ One of the teachers , when I walked down the hall in my uniform , yelled , ‘ No blood for oil ! ’ ” she says , her face reddening .
“ Um , I had nothing to do with that .
Then I talked to my old art - history teacher , who ’s a sweet guy , and I wanted to tell him I ’m taking a bunch of art - history courses now .
He was like , ‘ Oh , so you ’ll know what [ the ] buildings are before you drop bombs on them . ’ ”
Lately she ’s racked up honors that even the liberals at Hunter can appreciate : Scribner chose one of her poems for The Best American Poetry 2007 .
And in April , she was selected for a scholarship to pursue Asian studies , so she ’ll spend the next year in Hawaii .
She ’s considering studying for a law degree after that , but the Army is making no promises .
“ To be honest , I do n’t want to go to Iraq , ” Rosenberg says .
“ I ’ll go if my unit deploys , but I do n’t want to go there , or to Afghanistan .
Sometimes I feel kind of guilty about that , when other people are putting themselves in harm ’s way . ”
She ’s tried to dissuade a few of the cadets she cares about most from rushing into action .
“ I ’m not as worried about myself as I am some of my friends , ” she says .
“ A guy that I was dating for a while , that I ’m still good friends with , wants to be a pilot , and he ’s crazy to get into combat .
He ’s just worried that the war ’s going to be over before he gets there .
He was one of the people who was really upset when Lieutenant Neel died , and I said to him , ‘ This is why I do n’t want you to be so gung ho about going to combat .
And he ’s like , ‘ Well , I ’m invincible , so do n’t worry about me . ’
He ’s kidding , but … ”
Rosenberg ’s parents are thrilled she ’ll be in the middle of the Pacific Ocean for the short term , but the anxiety is still there .
One way Richard Rosenberg has tried to cope is by wearing his allegiance on his chest at nearly all times :
His closet is full of shirts and jackets emblazoned with the United States Military Academy logo .
( “ I could n’t quit West Point , ” Marya says with a laugh .
“ My father would n’t have anything to wear . ” )
Still , he swings rapidly from pride at what his daughter has achieved to anguish about where the future will take her .
“ There ’s nothing Marya could have done that I would have regarded with greater respect .
But the dark side of that is the fear that something bad could happen . ”
He closes his eyes , and when he opens them again , tears seep from the corners .
“ I , I , um , what can one do ?
These things are worrisome .
Fortunately , the Army does n’t allow women in direct combat — artillery , infantry , armor .
My own view is that women could do a great job , but I ’m grateful for the policy .
Because I do n’t want my baby to get hurt . ”
Kate Rosenberg interrupts .
She wants to make it clear she did n’t vote for George W. Bush , either time .
Asked what she ’d tell Cheney if she somehow got five minutes alone with him at graduation , she shakes her head slowly , biting her tongue so as not to cause any trouble for Marya .
“ They have heard much more powerful voices than ours and not listened , ” Richard Rosenberg says .
“ So what could we say ? ”
Perched high on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River , West Point seems to gleam in the spring sun .
Its granite buildings loom like a beautiful fortress over the green grass and slate courtyards .
On this April day , as I meet with Zambarda on campus , down in Washington , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is announcing the extension of military tours from twelve to fifteen months .
Lately , with his deployment looming , the possibility of being wounded occupies Zambarda less than the concern that he ’ll need to shoot someone .
“ I just went to a class a week ago on the moral justification for killing , ” he says .
“ No one wants to deal with , for the rest of their lives , having killed someone .
That ’s scary .
Some people accept the idea , that it ’s my job , I ’m the Army .
But for anyone who’s in the Judeo - Christian tradition , there ’s a lot of ‘ Thou shall not kill . ’
How do you deal with that ?
It will plague you for the rest of your life .
We went over a lot of theory .
Whether it proved to me whether I should feel justified killing someone or not — that ’s not as important as that it got me thinking . ”
This is Zambarda ’s primary method for dealing with fear :
He tries to think his way past it .
He has immersed himself in tactics and practical preparation , and he ’s majoring in Arabic .
“ It might give me five seconds to react — extra , ” he says .
“ On the front lines , it could save my life , or more importantly , one of my soldiers ’ .
The most potent weapon on the battlefield for me is n’t going to be my rifle .
It ’s going to be my brain . ”
He well knows , however , that Iraq is a place that defies logic .
One of Zambarda ’s best friends is First Lieutenant Daniel Sjursen , who also grew up on Staten Island and graduated from West Point two years ago .
Sjursen is now in Baghdad ; Zambarda e-mails him regularly , and is troubled by the changes he ’s seeing in his pal , whom he considers one of the toughest , most competent officers he knows .
“ He ’s in armor — that ’s tanks — and he ’s had one of the highest platoon attrition rates .
He ’s lost a lot of soldiers , ” Zambarda says .
“ It ’s sad .
The kind of fight we ’re in today , it ’s not always about how good you are tactically .
There ’s a lot of randomness . ”
He tries to tamp down the uncertainty by thinking about the men he ’ll soon be leading .
“ The thing with being a leader — you ’re that beacon that all the soldiers underneath you are looking at , ” Zambarda says , his words rushing out .
“ As much fear as I may have to deal with , I know that I ’d be more afraid of my guys breaking down and everything going to hell . ”
He pauses and looks out the window , at the cadets striding through the sun on their way to class .
“ It ’s hard to predict how I ’ll react when the first bullet goes by my ear and I say , ‘ Okay , what now ? ’
Everyone ’s looking at me ; I ca n’t be saying , ‘ What now ? ’
I gotta be telling people what to do . ”
At times , he uses bravado to get past the worry — especially at home , when he knows he can get a rise out of his mother by saying he can’t wait to feel the adrenaline rush of combat .
Zambarda ’s father spent twenty years in the NYPD , and knows what it ’s like to have a gun pointed at him .
“ I ’ve only heard the sound of a bullet flying past my head once , ” says Mark Sr. , “ and it ’s not a good sound . ”
Mark ’s mother , Nancy , an administrator at Merrill Lynch , absently clutches a large pillow to her chest as she talks about her son ’s last chance to turn back .
Midway through West Point , all cadets must make a decision :
They can leave up to two years into their military education , but if they choose to stay , they commit to active duty .
“ I encouraged him to get out if he could , ” she says .
“ As the reality of it started setting in , as a parent , I really got scared .
I said , ‘ If you have any doubt at all , get out . ’
Many times .
Many times . ”
Mark filled out an application to Cooper Union , where his best friend goes to school , just to remind himself he had options .
He never submitted it .
Mark ’s next choice thrilled his mother even less :
He wanted to “ branch ” infantry .
Zambarda had excellent grades ; why not , his mother suggested , apply to medical school ?
The Army needs doctors , and five more years in classes would n’t be such a bad thing .
Or , his father said , how about artillery ?
At least that ’s twenty miles from the front lines .
Infantry , Mark insisted , and , as always , he backed it up with logic .
“ He sold it to us that , if you ’re gonna be over there anyway , infantry guys are the best trained , ” Nancy says .
“ And if you ’re going to be career military , infantry is almost a requirement .
He sold it to me .
A little bit .
I ’m a little better with it now . ”
The Zambardas are inviting dozens of friends and relatives to celebrate Mark ’s graduation .
He ’ll wear his class - of - 2007 ring , with an engraved image of the Twin Towers and the class motto ALWAYS REMEMBER , NEVER SURRENDER .
“ This coming summer , I have 60 days of leave , and my best friend from back home , he asked me if I wanted to go on a trip with him to the Dominican Republic , ” Zambarda says .
“ It ’s basically seven days and seven nights of drinking and partying .
The person I was before I came to West Point , that would have been the perfect trip .
But it does n’t interest me now . ”
Instead , he ’ll use his leave this summer to backpack in Europe , one last spasm of being a regular kid .
Lately , though , he spends a lot of time thinking about the day he departs for Iraq , and what he ’ll say to his mother and father .
“ I will just tell them I ’m going to do everything I can to come back alive , and bring every single soldier I have alive , ” Zambarda says .
“ I ’m gonna do my job .
And if I die on duty , that I ’m sure I died doing something I ’m proud of . ”
He takes a deep breath .
“ I know that if I die , that does n’t affect me so much .
It ’s more worrisome for me that my parents will live the rest of their lives questioning ever letting me apply here . ”
Here I collect interesting links and findings about eclipse and java ...
74 year old Joseph Longo , founder and CEO of Startech Environmental Corporation , is fast becoming known as “ The Prophet of Garbage ” because he has developed a Plasma Converter that can turn the world ’s most dangerous and toxic waste into clean usable energy .
This promising new technology straight out of Star Trek holds out the promise of making landfills and other troublesome toxic storage sites a thing of the past and with further research and development become a viable alternative energy source for homes , transportation and space travel .
Startech ’s trash converter uses superheated plasma to reduce garbage to its molecuar components .
Longo ’s multimillion dollar technological marvel dubbed the “ Plasma Converter ” has taken almost 20 years to design and build and can fit easily within a space the size of a two - car garage .
Yet , it has the capability to consume almost any kind of waste or toxic product through a process called plasma gasification .
This annilhilation process is described like something similar to the the big bang , only in reverse in that you get nothing from something , instead of something out of nothing .
Inside a sealed vessel made of stainless steel and filled with a stable gasâ € ” either pure nitrogen or , as in this case , ordinary airâ€ ” a 650 - volt current passing between two electrodes rips electrons from the air , converting the gas into plasma .
Current flows continuously through this newly formed plasma , , creating a field of extremely intense energy very much like lightning .
The radiant energy of the plasma arc is so powerful , it disintegrates trash into its constituent elements by tearing apart molecular bonds .
The by - products are an obsidian - like glass used as a raw material for numerous applications , including bathroom tiles and high - strength asphalt , and a synthesis gas , or â€œsyngasâ€â€ ” a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be converted into a variety of marketable fuels , including ethanol , natural gas and hydrogen .
The only type of waste that it cannot break down is nuclear waste since the radiation is already in its natural atomic state .
To learn more about this new technology go to Popular Science Magazine online POPSCI.com and read Michael Behar ’s fascinating article on the subject .
The potential for this is staggering in its scope .

RALEIGH , N.C. , June 16 — In a case that has brought one surprise after another , a disciplinary hearing panel found Michael B. Nifong , the Durham County district attorney , guilty today of ethical violations while pressing a false accusation of sexual assault against three former Duke University lacrosse players .
The panel then ruled that Mr. Nifong should be disbarred .
But the ruling was almost an anticlimax to the case because in the penalty phase of the five - day ethics hearing , David Freedman , one of Mr. Nifong ’s lawyers , told the panel that Mr. Nifong believed that disbarment was “ the appropriate punishment in this case . ”
The state also said it felt disbarment was appropriate .
After deliberating for less than an hour , the panel stated that any punishment short of disbarment would not be appropriate in the case .
In a lengthy statement , F. Lane Williamson , chairman of the disciplinary committee , said that Mr. Nifong had received due process , “ and that ’s what was nearly hijacked in the case of the Duke lacrosse defendants . ”
Sometimes it feels as if the Bush administration has invented astounding time - warp technology , because the news so often appears to be caught in a loop .
In shocking news , a non-scientist political appointee forced the scientists around her to alter their data on climate change .
Wait , wait .
That 's not it .
It was promoting creationism .
Hold on , endangered species .
That 's where we were .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said yesterday that it will review eight endangered species decisions that were " inappropriately influenced " by a political appointee of the Interior Department , throwing a lifeline to 18 species that scientists had deemed to be in need of protection .
In this case , some decisions made by Julie A. MacDonald , who Bush made deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , will be reviewed because ( say it with me now ) she altered the scientific data to fit administration policy .
That 's good news for the white - tailed prairie dog , arroyo toad , and other species involved in those cases , but it 's also just the tip of the iceberg .
First as a special assistant and later as deputy assistant secretary for fish , wildlife and parks , MacDonald was involved in more than 200 endangered - species rulings between 2002 and May 2007 , when she resigned after an inspector general 's report that found that she had improperly leaked information to private organizations , bullied staff scientists and broken federal rules .
So , a handful of the two hundred rulings stomped on by MacDonald will be reviewed .
The list was larger , but right up until the day before the announcement , the list was still being trimmed .
" It 's not inappropriate to take the science and then apply policy decisions to it , " Hall said in a conference call with reporters .
In other words , if MacDonald actually went in and changed the numbers , it gets a review .
If she tossed a species out of the ark for political reasons , but did n't mess with the data , it 's time for that species to visit with trilobites and dodo birds .
Julie MacDonald Fun Facts
In 2005 , MacDonald got a special bonus to thank her for exceptional work .
The Endangered Species and Wetlands Report has obtained documents through the Freedom of Information Act showing that Julie MacDonald , the disgraced and recently retired Deputy Secretary of Interior , was given a cash award of $ 9,628 in 2005 for her work in 2004 .
... 2004 was a banner year for MacDonald .
She : stripped 80 percent of protected areas from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service critical habitat proposal for the bull trout ( a threatened fish from CA , OR , and WA ) ;
stripped thousands of acres from agency critical habitat proposals for the Topeka shiner ( an endangered Midwestern fish ) , Peirson 's milk - vetch ( an endangered CA plant ) , and the California tiger salamander ;
overruled and rewrote scientists ' reports in order to deny endangered species protection to the greater sage grouse ( a western high plains bird ) ;
passed memos to industry lawyers in litigation to remove the Delta smelt from the endangered species list ;
aided Craig Manson , Assistant Secretary of Interior , in overruling agency scientists in order to push the marbled murrelet ( a Northwest old - growth dependent bird ) off the threatened list .
She 's also quite the little office cut up .
She said she had made her feelings clear in an array of documents ; overruled scientists ' conclusions in areas where she has authority , such as designating critical habitat ; and mocked rank - and - file employees ' recommendations .
... " A lot of times when I first read a document I think , ' This is a joke , this is just not right . ' " ...
In several instances , MacDonald wrote sarcastic comments in the margins of the documents , questioning why scientists were portraying a species ' condition as so bleak .
Come on , guys , it 's only extinction .

It 's well worth reading this post by Tony Karon at Rootless Cosmopolitan : " Palestinian Pinochet Making His Move ? "
Be sure to check out all the links as well .
Few Americans are even aware of the Palestinian mini-civil war going on now in Gaza .
Fewer still know this civil war is to a large degree the conscious creation of the Bush administration — and specifically of America 's old friend Elliot Abrams .
Here 's an article with some details :
Deputy National Security Advisor , Elliott Abrams — who Newsweek recently described as “ the last neocon standing ” — has had it about for some months now that the U.S. is not only not interested in dealing with Hamas , it is working to ensure its failure .
In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas elections , last January , Abrams greeted a group of Palestinian businessmen in his White House office with talk of a “ hard coup ” against the newly - elected Hamas government — the violent overthrow of their leadership with arms supplied by the United States ...
Over the last twelve months , the United States has supplied guns , ammunition and training to Palestinian Fatah activists to take on Hamas in the streets of Gaza and the West Bank .
Interesting .
You know , when prominent neoconservatives talk about " hard coups " to overturn Palestinian elections , or hint at their regret the military did n't stage a coup in Turkey , it almost makes me think their purported concern for democracy is complete bullshit .
Fortunately , we know that 's not that case , because no one ever broaches this possibility in the US media .
STAY TUNED : For endless debate in the Washington Post about whether the neoconservative worldview is flawed because they naively luv democracy too much .
There it was , Blair 's problem in a televisual nutshell : he can get no message across , can set no grand vision , drive through no important policy , because his voice is drowned out by political noise .
This week 's noise was Labour sleaze .
Last week it was Labour 's split on education reform .
The week before that it was more alleged Labour sleaze , centred on the financial arrangements of Tessa Jowell .
These are the passing squalls , but they are not the source of the storm .
That lies elsewhere .
To find it , one has to look hard at that speech yesterday .
Ambitious to lay out a coherent Blair doctrine of foreign policy , the prime minister began by restating his belief in liberal interventionism - the creed that democratic countries can no longer stand by while dictators commit hideous crimes against their own peoples .
When he first developed the idea , in the so - called Chicago speech of 1999 , at the height of the Kosovo crisis , he won many admirers .
Those who , like me , backed the principle of intervention believed Blair was articulating a new approach to international affairs , one that would no longer see the principle of state sovereignty trump all other moral considerations .
That same year , Augusto Pinochet had failed in his attempt to hide behind the legal notion of " sovereign immunity " rather than be answerable for his crimes in Chile .
The Blair doctrine suggested a new dispensation , one that would no longer let horror go unpunished , one that would not tolerate a second Rwanda .
Such talk sounds quaint now or , worse , deluded .
The explanation is simple enough .
The Iraq adventure poisoned the well for interventionism , perhaps for generations to come .
Not because it made a case on humanitarian grounds , but because it invented a threat that was not there .
At the turn of the decade many progressives were ready to believe in a new ethical , rather than realpolitik , motivation in foreign policy .
But the Iraq war made a mockery of all that .
From now on , any government urging military action for moral purpose will face hoots of derision and howls of scepticism .
You said that about Iraq , the voters will say , and we wo n't be fooled again .
All of which lent Blair 's speech a rather forlorn feel .
As if in valedictory mode , the PM conceded those places where there had been no intervention , even though he wished there had .
He had done nothing for Burma , nothing for the slave nation of North Korea , nothing for Zimbabwe .
And , above all , though he referred to it only indirectly , nothing for Darfur .
The lesson of Rwanda had gone utterly unheeded .
There was no hint of action for these places ;
Blair tacitly admitted that there is no chance of that .
Partly because he is approaching the end of his tenure , but also because , after Iraq , the idea of marshalling an international consensus for armed action anywhere seems almost preposterous .
His roll call of countries was a wish list , as remote from reality as a beauty queen 's plea for world peace .
The same was true of his remarks on what he called " a clash about civilisation " .
Blair urged a firm stance not just against terrorist methods , but against the ideology of Bin Ladenist Islamism itself .
We have to tell them , he said , that their " attitude to America is absurd , their concept of governance pre-feudal , their positions on women and other faiths reactionary and regressive " .
Yes , some may feel frightened of straying into this terrain , for fear of being branded a critic of Islam itself , but nevertheless a stand had to be taken against this particular " warped " strain of Islamism - chiefly by supporting those Muslims who are already fighting this battle themselves .
All of that made great sense and suggests that Blair has shifted his position .
Once he tiptoed around the point ; now he is willing to urge Muslims not to go into denial , but " to face up to the strain of extremism within [ their ] religion " .
Yet this message too was drowned out .
Of course , Blair is right that Bin Ladenist ideology is worldwide and lethal , and must be defeated .
The trouble is , everyone knows not only that the Iraq war was unrelated to that titanic struggle , since Saddam had no link with al - Qaida , but that it has made it so much worse .
Yesterday Blair urged us to ignore that fact , to realise that , whatever our earlier disagreements , we have to close ranks in wanting democracy to triumph over murderous sectarianism in Baghdad today .
The trouble is , he is the one person who cannot make this case .
Why should we follow his banner in the war against Islamist reaction , when it was he who led us blindly into such a calamity ?
The crude , harsh truth is that no one can take what Blair says on foreign policy seriously , because he is responsible for the greatest foreign - policy disaster in half a century of British history .
No matter that he emerged as a major world leader during the Kosovo war , or that he won international admiration after the Good Friday agreement .
Now , because of that one fateful decision , his credibility is shot .
And it is not just in international affairs that Blair is overwhelmed by Iraq .
Take the current sleaze affair .
A useful law of scandal is that charges only bite when they confirm a pre-existing suspicion .
In the 1990s Britons believed the Major government was decayed ; the Hamilton and Aitken revelations duly validated that belief .
When the Bernie Ecclestone affair broke in 1997 , voters did n't see Blair or New Labour as financially corrupt ( even though the charge then , of cash - for - policy , was much graver than anything revealed now ) .
Today 's scandal bites because it plays into something Britons do now believe about their government : that it is not honest and cannot be trusted .
And the explanation for that , once again , is Iraq .
Polls show that Blair was broadly trusted before the invasion .
But he told the nation that Saddam had weapons of destruction when he did n't , and Blair has never been trusted since .
In this sense , removing Blair over a few undisclosed loans would be like jailing Al Capone for tax evasion : he will be punished for a small offence because the system could n't get him for the much larger one .
Can he overcome this ?
Can Blair somehow persuade us , as he tried again yesterday , to draw a line under the three - year conflict that corrodes every aspect of his premiership , preventing him leading on matters domestic and foreign ?
I do n't see how .
It 's understandable that he wants to recover his reputation and quit as a winner .
He 's like a gambler at the roulette wheel , sinking further and further into debt , but still praying for one more lucky spin that will restore his fortune .
Maybe he 'll enjoy a small win one of these days .
But it ca n't last .
His luck has run out .
And he cannot blame fate or chance or anyone but himself - and his decision to fight the war that destroyed him .

With its premium price tag , shoppers expect organic chicken to be both tastier and healthier than cheaper battery - farmed birds .
But organic poultry is actually less nutritious , contains more fat and tastes worse than its mass - produced equivalent , research has shown .
Tests on supermarket chicken breasts showed that organic versions contained lower levels of health - boosting omega 3 fatty acids than other varieties , including non-organic free - range
poultry .
The compounds , present in high levels in oily fish , are thought to be responsible for a host of health benefits , from combating heart disease to boosting intelligence .
Organic chicken , which typically costs nearly three times as much as battery - farmed poultry , also contained lower levels of anti-oxidants – compounds which mop up harmful molecules called free radicals that have been linked to cancer , heart disease and strokes .
If that was n’t enough , the chicken – from birds which are raised as naturally as possible and are given antibiotics only when they are actually ill – contained up to twice as much cholesterol .
Organic chicken even fared poorly in blind taste tests , gaining the lowest marks for succulence .
Researcher Dr Alistair Paterson , of Strathclyde University , told the Sunday Times : ‘ It is safe to say that you are not getting any nutritional benefit from buying organic chicken .
‘ You could be better off buying conventional
chicken .
‘ There is no guarantee that organic chicken gives you more omega 3 , better taste or lower cholesterol level . ’
The findings come as organic food market is booming , fuelled by a rise in ethical shopping .
Last year it was worth £ 1.6 billion , dounle the amount in 2000 .
Sales are forceast to be worth £ 2.7 billion by 2010 .
An organic chicken costs about £ 12 in a supermarket , almost three times the price of a more conventionally reared bird .
The latest study , published in the
International Journal of Food Sciences
and Nutrition , is not the first to question
the health benefits of eating organic .
Earlier this year , food watchdog the Food Standards Agency said that organic milk was no healthier than the traditionally produced variety .
Dr Paterson , a food technologist , said the
difference in nutritional quality could partly be explained by the way the birds are fed .
Synthetic vitamin supplements , which are routinely added to conventionalfeed , are banned under organic farming rules , as is feed with GM
additives .
The rules also impose strict standards on the use of pesticides and animal welfare and sustainability .
While all organic chickens are free range not all free - range chickens are
organic .
The Soil Association , which accredits organic poultry producers , disputed the Strathclyde University team ’s findings yesterday .
Spokesman Hugh Raven said : ‘ This research contradicts the bulk of evidence which shows organic food is higher in omega 3 , vitamins and minerals than conventional chicken . ’
It would be nice to believe that the the reason the US can't win in Iraq is because Bush waged the wrong war , in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Or that he failed to anticipate the post- invasion insurgency .
Or that no country can any longer be occupied and subjugated by distant , foreign powers .
Sure , all those things are playing their part in the slaughterhouse that Iraq has become since the George W. Bush & Co. " liberated " the place .
But remember , two decades before that the Russians were driven out of Afghanistan .
And the French were chased out of North Africa .
Each possessed superpower status , manifested in the potentially most devastating military forces in the history of mankind .
Yet that status and all that fire power could n't give the victories , the control or hegemony , they sought .
Why ?
Blame it on evolution .
Attaining superpower status required more of those societies than simply hammering out guns , tanks , submarines , stealth fighters and nukes .
All that military / industrial R&D had to move in lockstep with a host of social developments ; education , trade ties , advances in science and medicine , information , and the humanities .
One could argue that the former Soviet Union made less progress in some of those areas than Western countries , and they would be right .
Which is largely the reason it's now called " the former Soviet Union . "
Nevertheless , Russians made plenty of progress as well .
And some might argue that they were more smarter than we were in some ways .
Rather than continuing to waste national treasure in a mindless and unwinnable arms race , they bailed , figuring that being the world 's No. 2 superpower was good enough .
And the Russians were right about that .
Because both No. 1 , the US and No. 2 , Russian , lost wars in piss ant countries against near - primitive irregular forces .
Russian was chased out of Afghanistan and the US is about to be chased out of Iraq , and maybe Afghanistan too .
There was a time when both the US and Russian kicked ass .
Russian did n't just defeat German invaders but devastated them .
The US leveled both Germany and Japan .
So why can't superpowers defeat today 's insurgencies , such as those fighting US troops in Iraq or terrorist groups like al - Qaida , Taliban , Hamas and Hezbollah ?
Because , we can't fight dirty anymore .
We used use military tactics designed to make an enemy cry " uncle . "
But these days we just can't bring ourselves to stoop to the level required to inflict the kind of pain bring an enemy and and it's allies to their knees .
How did we win World War II ?
Not with tiny troop " surges " or by turning soldiers into community cops .
And we did n't do it by building power plants on enemy territory , quite the opposite , we bombed power plants into dust .
We bombed dams so farmers could n't irrigate crops , thereby starving the enemy .
But the biggest difference between " us " then and " us " now is that back then we did n't give a fig about civilians .
We did n't use surgical bombing strikes to take out a handful of German or Japanese soldiers , we flattened everything and everyone in their general vicinity .
Today we blanch when we hear on the news that 50 people were killed in Iraq , or that the US lost 10 soldiers in a day .
During WW II such a lackluster day would have been considered a day wasted .
Just look at the carnage the last generation shrugged off as " just the cost of war . "
" The total estimated human loss of life caused by World War II , irrespective of political alignment , was roughly 72 million people .
The civilian toll was around 47 million , including about 20 million due to war related famine and disease .
The military toll was about 25 million , including about 5 million prisoners of war .
The Allies lost around 61 million people , and the Axis lost 11 million .
[ See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties and http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html.]
Even as Germany was teetering on the brink of defeat , the Allies sent an armada of bombers to Dresden to blanket the city with firebombs .
In a matter of a couple of hours the entire city was turned into a funeral prier for an estimated 30,000 civilians .
Thirty thousand , in a single day !
Imagine that .
The tactical theory behind such acts of mind boggling brutality was to send a message to the enemy - " Surrender or we 'll level your social and industrial infrastructure and slaughter your people .
Your move . "
The US sent the same message to Japan , twice , and for the first time with nuclear exclamation mark .
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were leveled , killing nearly a quarter million civilians in two days of war .
Both German and Japan surrendered , the war ended and the victors went about the business of getting back to business .
Over the next fifty years we changed , for the better .
We no longer believe that leveling entire cites filled with civilians is a justifiable tactic of war .
Instead we now fight enemies the way like cancer , by targeting the tumors while trying to do as little damage to the victim as possible .
All of which makes us better human beings than we were .
But it likely also makes us incapable of winning .
I am not suggesting we go back to the bad old days and ways , I am simply describing our new strategic reality .
After all , does anyone doubt that the US and UK could turn all or parts of Iraq into a glass parking lot with a couple nukes ?
Of course they could .
But , thank goodness , they have n't and they wo n't .
Because they can't .
They can't because of the developed world would explode in rage and indignation - as would most the American people .
And it 's not just the US struggling with this new reality .
Look at what 's going on in Tripoli Lebanon this week .
A handful of al - Qaida fighters - less than 200 - took refuge in the sprawling Palestinian refugee camp and opened fire on Lebanese Army forces .
In the bad old days the military solution would have been to bomb the bajeebers out of the area , send in tanks to knock down what buildings were left standing , followed by ground troops with orders to shoot anything that 's still moving .
Noncombatant civilians would have to figure out how to survive on their own and , if they did n't , they did n't .
But the " developed " world will no longer would stand for such wholesale slaughters .
So the Lebanese army is reduced to lobbing a few targeted shells into buildings they suspect are being used by insurgents , then calling a cease fire so ambulances can evacuate wounded civilians and the UN rushes in to provide food and water to civilians trapped in the crossfire .
How will the Lebanese standoff end ?
I can't tell , but one thing is for sure , it wo n't end with anything our fathers or grandfathers would have graced with the term " victory . "
Instead the insurgents will disrupt , then disappear to disrupt another day .
How long a civil society can survive such tactics - or whether it can - is the question that remains to be answered .
Ironically , this new reality mankind faces may be far more bleak than anything our parent 's generation faced .
Maybe they were more brutal in waging war , but that brutality resulted in victory , fortunately for the good guys .
We face a much less certain outcome and future .
We live in a time when nice guys finish last -- simply because we are nice guys .
I can hear those on the far left pounding their palms to the foreheads shouting , " What the hell is this moron talking about ?
Does n't he know that Bush 's war in Iraq has killed tens of thousands , maybe hundreds of thousands of innocent people ? "
Yes , this moron knows that .
But imagine if MacArthur or Patton were waging the war in Iraq .
Civilian casualties would be counted in the millions , and without a hint of shame or apology .
I 'm glad my father 's generation defeated the Nazis and Imperial Japan .
And I am not judging them for the way they went about doing it .
It was different time and half - century ago .
Their sacrifices gave us the decades of peace during which we were freed to learn , grow and mature as a species .
But now we face the very real possibility that the power to secure victories has passed from us .
That maybe today that power is solely in the hands of the world 's lowest common - denominators - the under - educated , under - employed , under - socialized and religiously lobotomized .
I do n't know how this chapter of mankind 's story is going to end .
All I know is that this time the bad guys are using our old tactics against us .
Civilians are fair game to them .
That would you and I this time around .
And , when the day comes - and it will - when al - Qaida et al get their hands on nuclear weapons , they will do their best to turn one or more of our cities into another Dresden .
Then what ?
Do we surrender ?
Or do we turn our social - evolutionary clock back sixty years and start killing people by the millions again until someone cries " uncle ? "

When the Commerce / Justice Dept. and Science appropriation comes to the floor , possibly as soon as tomorrow , Representatives Hinchey ( D - NY ) and Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) will be offering an amendment prohibiting appropriate funds from being used to arrest or prosecute patients using marijuana as medicine in compliance with State law .
The 2 offered a similar amendment last year , which failed on a 163-259 vote rollcall .
18 Republicans voted for the amendment , 53 Democrats against .
Since only 2 of the Republican " Ayes ' have left the chamber , there 's a decent chance the measure can pass this week , if we can get most of the new Dems and swing a handful of those who voted against last year .
You already know how to contact your Representative , please do so now .
A new light - activated therapy could make skin cancer treatment painless , inexpensive and portable .
Scottish company Lumicure has developed a portable device that combines a tiny light , a photosensitizing cream and a bandage that , if approved by the Food and Drug Administration , could treat skin cancer conveniently with molecular precision .
" It can be worn by the patient in a ( Band - Aid ) , while the battery is carried like an iPod , " said professor Ifor Samuel of the Organic Semiconductor Centre at Scotland 's University of St. Andrews , who helped develop the technology , in a statement .
Skin cancer , which typically requires painful or invasive treatments , affects 40 percent of all Americans at some point during their lives .
The Lumicure treatment would cost between $ 200 and $ 300 , compared with roughly $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 for the standard therapy .
It could also eliminate the need for chemotherapy in some cases .
Lumicure 's treatment is a new twist on an existing treatment called photodynamic therapy .
It starts with a cream containing aminolevulinic acid , which becomes photosensitive when it comes in contact with a cancer lesion .
When exposed to light , the cream interacts with only the cancerous cells , making it a very selective skin treatment .
Lumicure 's light source is a low - powered organic light - emitting diode embedded in a small adhesive device .
Its battery module – roughly the size of an MP3 player – fits easily in a pocket .
Photodynamic therapy available today requires treatment at a hospital using heavy equipment .
It 's also uncomfortable for patients because they must stay very still under extremely intense light ; the treatment also can leave painful skin lesions .
The new treatment takes longer than the standard therapy , but there 's almost no discomfort and no scarring .
" As traditional photodynamic therapy is delivered in a physician 's office , this new technology , if proven effective in clinical trials , may offer the possibility of increased access and ease of use for many patients , " said Dr. Isaac Neuhaus , assistant professor at University of California at San Francisco Dermatologic Surgery and Laser Center .
Early human trial results are promising , and Lumicure hopes the light therapy will be available in about two years .
Future iterations could target other skin problems including warts , acne and even wrinkles .

Relational databases are universally conceived of as an advance over their predecessors network and hierarchical models .
Superior in every querying respect , they turned out to be surprisingly incomplete when modeling transitive dependencies .
Almost every couple of months a question about how to model a tree in the database pops up at the comp.database .
theory newsgroup .
In this article I 'll investigate two out of four well known approaches to accomplishing this and show a connection between them .
We 'll discover a new method that could be considered as a " mix - in " between materialized path and nested sets .
Adjacency List
Tree structure is a special case of Directed Acyclic Graph ( DAG ) .
One way to represent DAG structure is :
create table emp (
ename varchar2 ( 100 ) ,
mgrname varchar2 ( 100 )
) ;
Each record of the emp table identified by ename is referring to its parent mgrname .
For example , if JONES reports to KING , then the emp table contains < ename= ' JONES ' , mgrname= ' KING '> record .
Suppose , the emp table also includes < ename= ' SCOTT ' , mgrname= ' JONES '>.
Then , if the emp table does n't contain the < ename= ' SCOTT ' , mgrname= ' KING '> record , and the same is true for every pair of adjoined records , then it is called adjacency list .
If the opposite is true , then the emp table is a transitively closed relation .
A typical hierarchical query would ask if SCOTT indirectly reports to KING .
Since we do n't know the number of levels between the two , we can't tell how many times to selfjoin emp , so that the task can't be solved in traditional SQL .
If transitive closure tcemp of the emp table is known , then the query is trivial :
select ' TRUE ' from tcemp
where ename = ' SCOTT ' and mgrname = ' KING '
The ease of querying comes at the expense of transitive closure maintenance .
Alternatively , hierarchical queries can be answered with SQL extensions : either SQL3 / DB2 recursive query
with tcemp as (
select ename , mgrname from tcemp
union
select tcemp.ename,emp.mgrname from tcemp,emp
where tcemp.mgrname = emp.ename
) select ' TRUE ' from tcemp
where ename = ' SCOTT ' and mgrname = ' KING ' ;
that calculates tcemp as an intermediate relation , or Oracle proprietary connect - by syntax
select ' TRUE ' from (
select ename from emp
connect by prior mgrname = ename
start with ename = ' SCOTT '
) where ename = ' KING ' ;
in which the inner query " chases the pointers " from the SCOTT node to the root of the tree , and then the outer query checks whether the KING node is on the path .
Adjacency list is arguably the most intuitive tree model .
Our main focus , however , would be the following two methods .
Materialized Path
In this approach each record stores the whole path to the root .
In our previous example , lets assume that KING is a root node .
Then , the record with ename = ' SCOTT ' is connected to the root via the path SCOTT -> JONES ->KING .
Modern databases allow representing a list of nodes as a single value , but since materialized path has been invented long before then , the convention stuck to plain character string of nodes concatenated with some separator ; most often '.' or '/index.html ' .
In the latter case , an analogy to pathnames in UNIX file system is especially pronounced .
In more compact variation of the method , we use sibling numerators instead of node 's primary keys within the path string .
Extending our example :
ENAME PATH KING 1 JONES 1.1 SCOTT 1.1.1 ADAMS 1.1.1.1 FORD 1.1.2 SMITH 1.1.2.1 BLAKE 1.2 ALLEN 1.2.1 WARD 1.2.2 CLARK 1.3 MILLER 1.3.1
Path 1.1.2 indicates that FORD is the second child of the parent JONES .
Let 's write some queries .
1 . An employee FORD and chain of his supervisors :
select e1.ename from emp e1 , emp e2
where e2.path like e1.path || '% '
and e2.name = ' FORD '
2 . An employee JONES and all his ( indirect ) subordinates :
select e1.ename from emp e1 , emp e2
where e1.path like e2.path || '% '
and e2.name = ' JONES '
Although both queries look symmetrical , there is a fundamental difference in their respective performances .
If a subtree of subordinates is small compared to the size of the whole hierarchy , then the execution where database fetches e2 record by the name primary key , and then performs a range scan of e1. path , which is guaranteed to be quick .
On the other hand , the " supervisors " query is roughly equivalent to
select e1.ename from emp e1 , emp e2
where e2.path > e1.path and e2.path < e 1.path || 'Z '
and e2.name = ' FORD '
Or , noticing that we essentially know e2. path , it can further be reduced to
select e1.ename from emp e1
where e2path > e1.path and e2path < e 1.path || ' Z '
Here , it is clear that indexing on path does n't work ( except for " accidental " cases in which e2 path happens to be near the domain boundary , so that predicate e2 path > e1. path is selective ) .
The obvious solution is that we do n't have to refer to the database to figure out all the supervisor paths !
For example , supervisors of 1.1.2 are 1.1 and 1 .
A simple recursive string parsing function can extract those paths , and then the supervisor names can be answered by
select e1.ename from emp where e1.path in ( ' 1.1 ' , '1 ' )
which should be executed as a fast concatenated plan .
Nested Sets
Both the materialized path and Joe Celko 's nested sets provide the capability to answer hierarchical queries with standard SQL syntax .
In both models , the global position of the node in the hierarchy is " encoded " as opposed to an adjacency list of which each link is a local connection between immediate neighbors only .
Similar to materialized path , the nested sets model suffers from supervisors query performance problem :
select p2.emp from Personnel p1 , Personnel p2
where p1.lft between p2.lft and p2.rgt
and p1.emp = ' Chuck '
( Note : This query is borrowed from the previously cited Celko article ) .
Here , the problem is even more explicit than in the case of a materialized path : we need to find all the intervals that cover a given point .
This problem is known to be difficult .
Although there are specialized indexing schemes like R - Tree , none of them is as universally accepted as B - Tree .
For example , if the supervisor 's path contains just 10 nodes and the size of the whole tree is 1000000 , none of indexing techniques could provide 1000000 / 10=100000 times performance increase .
( Such a performance improvement factor is typically associated with index range scan in a similar , very selective , data volume condition . )
Unlike a materialized path , the trick by which we computed all the nodes without querying the database does n't work for nested sets .
Another — more fundamental — disadvantage of nested sets is that nested sets coding is volatile .
If we insert a node into the middle of the hierarchy , all the intervals with the boundaries above the insertion point have to be recomputed .
In other words , when we insert a record into the database , roughly half of the other records need to be updated .
This is why the nested sets model received only limited acceptance for static hierarchies .
Nested sets are intervals of integers .
In an attempt to make the nested sets model more tolerant to insertions , Celko suggested we give up the property that each node always has ( rgt - lft+1 ) / 2 children .
In my opinion , this is a half - step towards a solution : any gap in a nested set model with large gaps and spreads in the numbering still could be covered with intervals leaving no space for adding more children , if those intervals are allowed to have boundaries at discrete points ( i.e. , integers ) only .
One needs to use a dense domain like rational , or real numbers instead .
Nested Intervals
Nested intervals generalize nested sets .
A node [ clft , crgt ] is an ( indirect ) descendant of [ plft , prgt ] if :
plft <= clft and crgt >= prgt
The domain for interval boundaries is not limited by integers anymore : we admit rational or even real numbers , if necessary .
Now , with a reasonable policy , adding a child node is never a problem .
One example of such a policy would be finding an unoccupied segment [ lft1 , rgt1 ] within a parent interval [ plft , prgt ] and inserting a child node [ ( 2*lft1+rgt1 ) / 3 , ( rgt1+2*lft ) / 3 ] :
After insertion , we still have two more unoccupied segments [ lft1,(2*lft1+rgt1 ) / 3 ] and [ ( rgt1+2* lft ) /3,rgt1 ] to add more children to the parent node .
We are going to amend this naive policy in the following sections .
Partial Order
Let 's look at two - dimensional picture of nested intervals .
Let 's assume that rgt is a horizontal axis x , and lft is a vertical one - y .
Then , the nested intervals tree looks like this :
Each node [ lft , rgt ] has its descendants bounded within the two - dimensional cone y >= lft & x <= rgt .
Since the right interval boundary is always less than the left one , none of the nodes are allowed above the diagonal y = x .
The other way to look at this picture is to notice that a child node is a descendant of the parent node whenever a set of all points defined by the child cone y >= clft & x <= crgt is a subset of the parent cone y >= plft & x <= prgt .
A subset relationship between the cones on the plane is a partial order .
Now that we know the two constraints to which tree nodes conform , I 'll describe exactly how to place them at the xy plane .
The Mapping
Tree root choice is completely arbitrary : we 'll assume the interval [ 0,1 ] to be the root node .
In our geometrical interpretation , all the tree nodes belong to the lower triangle of the unit square at the xy plane .
We 'll describe further details of the mapping by induction .
For each node of the tree , let 's first define two important points at the xy plane .
The depth - first convergence point is an intersection between the diagonal and the vertical line through the node .
For example , the depth - first convergence point for < x=1 , y=1/2 > is < x=1, y=1 > .
The breadth - first convergence point is an intersection between the diagonal and the horizontal line through the point .
For example , the breadth - first convergence point for < x=1, y=1/2 > is < x=1/2,y=1/2 >.
Now , for each parent node , we define the position of the first child as a midpoint halfway between the parent point and depth - first convergence point .
Then , each sibling is defined as a midpoint halfway between the previous sibling point and breadth - first convergence point :
For example , node 2.1 is positioned at x=1/2 , y=3/8 .
Now that the mapping is defined , it is clear which dense domain we are using : it 's not rationals , and not reals either , but binary fractions ( although , the former two would suffice , of course ) .
Interestingly , the descendant subtree for the parent node " 1.2 " is a scaled down replica of the subtree at node " 1.1 . "
Similarly , a subtree at node 1.1 is a scaled down replica of the tree at node " 1 . "
A structure with self - similarities is called a fractal .
Normalization
Next , we notice that x and y are not completely independent .
We can tell what are both x and y if we know their sum .
Given the numerator and denominator of the rational number representing the sum of the node coordinates , we can calculate x and y coordinates back as :
function x_numer ( numer integer , denom integer )
RETURN integer IS
ret_num integer ;
ret_den integer ;
BEGIN
ret_num := numer+1 ;
ret_den := denom *2 ;
while floor ( ret_num / 2b = ret_num / 2 loop
ret_num := ret_num /2 ;
ret_den := ret_den/2 ;
end loop ;
RETURN ret_num ;
END ; function x_denom ( numer integer , denom integer )
...
RETURN ret_den ;
END ;
in which function x_denom body differs from x_numer in the return variable only .
Informally , numer + 1 increment would move the ret_num / ret_den point vertically up to the diagonal , and then x coordinate is half of the value , so we just multiplied the denominator by two .
Next , we reduce both numerator and denominator by the common power of two .
Naturally , y coordinate is defined as a complement to the sum :
function y_numer ( numer integer , denom integer )
RETURN integer IS
num integer ;
den integer ;
BEGIN
num := x_numer ( numer , denom ) ;
den := x_denom ( numer , denom ) ;
while den < denom loop
num := num *2 ;
den := den*2 ;
end loop ;
num := numer - num ;
while floor ( num / 2 ) = num / 2 loop
num := num /2 ;
den := den/2 ;
end loop ;
RETURN num ;
END ; function y_denom ( numer integer , denom integer )
...
RETURN den ;
END ;
Now , the test ( where 39/32 is the node 1.3.1 ) :
select x_numer ( 39,32 ) ||'/index.html'||x_denom ( 39,32 ) , y_numer ( 39,32 ) ||'/index.html'||y_denom ( 39,32 ) from dual 5/8 19/32 select 5/8+19/32 , 39/32 from dual 1.21875 1.21875
I do n't use a floating point to represent rational numbers , and wrote all the functions with integer arithmetics instead .
To put it bluntly , the floating point number concept in general , and the IEEE standard in particular , is useful for rendering 3D - game graphics only .
In the last test , however , we used a floating point just to verify that 5/8 and 19/32 , returned by the previous query , do indeed add to 39/32 .
We 'll store two integer numbers — numerator and denominator of the sum of the coordinates x and y — as an encoded node path .
Incidentally , Celko's nested sets use two integers as well .
Unlike nested sets , our mapping is stable : each node has a predefined placement at the xy plane , so that the queries involving node position in the hierarchy could be answered without reference to the database .
In this respect , our hierarchy model is essentially a materialized path encoded as a rational number .
Finding Parent Encoding and Sibling Number
Given a child node with numer / denom encoding , we find the node 's parent like this :
function parent_numer ( numer integer , denom integer )
RETURN integer IS
ret_num integer ;
ret_den integer ;
BEGIN
if numer=3 then
return NULL ;
end if ;
ret_num := ( numer - 1 ) /2 ;
ret_den := denom/2 ;
while floor ( ( ret_num - 1 ) /4 ) = ( ret_num - 1 ) / 4 loop
ret_num := ( ret_num + 1 ) /2 ;
ret_den := ret_den/2 ;
end loop ;
RETURN ret_num ;
END ; function parent_denom ( numer integer , denom integer )
...
RETURN ret_den ;
END ;
The idea behind the algorithm is the following :
If the node is on the very top level — and all these nodes have a numerator equal to 3 — then the node has no parent .
Otherwise , we must move vertically down the xy plane at a distance equal to the distance from the depth - first convergence point .
If the node happens to be the first child , then that is the answer .
Otherwise , we must move horizontally at a distance equal to the distance from the breadth - first convergence point until we meet the parent node .
Here is the test of the method ( in which 27/32 is the node 2.1.2 , while 7/8 is 2.1 ) :
select parent_numer ( 27,32 ) ||'/index.html'||parent_denom ( 27,32 ) from dual 7/
8
In the previous method , counting the steps when navigating horizontally would give the sibling number :
function sibling_number ( numer integer , denom integer )
RETURN integer IS
ret_num integer ;
ret_den integer ;
ret integer ;
BEGIN
if numer=3 then
return NULL ;
end if ;
ret_num := ( numer - 1 ) /2 ;
ret_den := denom/2 ;
ret := 1 ;
while floor ( ( ret_num - 1 ) /4 ) = ( ret_num - 1 ) / 4 loop
if ret_num=1 and ret_den=1 then
return ret ;
end if ;
ret_num := ( ret_num + 1 ) /2 ;
ret_den := ret_den/2 ;
ret := ret+1 ;
end loop ;
RETURN ret ;
END ;
For a node at the very first level a special stop condition , ret_num=1 and ret_den=1 is needed .
The test :
select sibling_number ( 7,8 ) from dual 1
Calculating Materialized Path and Distance between nodes
Strictly speaking , we do n't have to use a materialized path , since our encoding is an alternative .
On the other hand , a materialized path provides a much more intuitive visualization of the node position in the hierarchy , so that we can use the materialized path for input and output of the data if we provide the mapping to our model .
Implementation is a simple application of the methods from the previous section .
We print the sibling number , jump to the parent , then repeat the above two steps until we reach the root :
function path ( numer integer , denom integer ) RETURN varchar2 IS BEGIN if numer is NULL then return ''; end if ; RETURN path ( parent_numer ( numer , denom ) , parent_denom ( numer , denom ) ) || '.' || sibling_number ( numer , denom ) ; END ; select path ( 15,16 ) from dual .2.1.1
Now we are ready to write the main query : given the 2 nodes , P and C , when P is the parent of C ?
A more general query would return the number of levels between P and C if C is reachable from P , and some exception indicator ; otherwise :
function distance ( num1 integer , den1 integer , num2 integer , den2 integer ) RETURN integer IS BEGIN if num1 is NULL then return - 999999 ; end if ; if num1=num2 and den1=den2 then return 0 ; end if ; RETURN 1+distance(parent_numer(num1 , den1 ) , parent_denom ( num1 , den1 ) , num2,den2 ) ; END ; select distance ( 27,32,3,4 ) from dual 2
Negative numbers are interpreted as exceptions .
If the num1 / den1 node is not reachable from num2 / den2 , then the navigation converges to the root , and level ( num1 / den1 ) - 999999 would be returned ( readers are advised to find a less clumsy solution ) .
The alternative way to answer whether two nodes are connected is by simply calculating the x and y coordinates , and checking if the parent interval encloses the child .
Although none of the methods refer to disk , checking whether the partial order exists between the points seems much less expensive !
On the other hand , it is just a computer architecture artifact that comparing two integers is an atomic operation .
More thorough implementation of the method would involve a domain of integers with a unlimited range ( those kinds of numbers are supported by computer algebra systems ) , so that a comparison operation would be iterative as well .
Our system would n't be complete without a function inverse to the path , which returns a node 's numer / denom value once the path is provided .
Let 's introduce two auxiliary functions , first :
function child_numer ( num integer , den integer , child integer ) RETURN integer IS BEGIN RETURN num * power ( 2 , child ) + 3 - power ( 2 , child ) ; END ; function child_denom ( num integer , den integer , child integer ) RETURN integer IS BEGIN RETURN den*power ( 2 , child ) ; END ; select child_numer ( 3,2,3 ) || '/index.html ' || child_denom ( 3,2,3 ) from dual 19/16
For example , the third child of the node 1 ( encoded as 3/2 ) is the node 1.3 ( encoded as 19/16 ) .
The path encoding function is :
function path_numer ( path varchar2 ) RETURN integer IS num integer ; den integer ; postfix varchar2 ( 1000 ) ; sibling varchar2 ( 100 ) ; BEGIN num := 1 ; den := 1 ; postfix := '. ' || path || '.' ; while length ( postfix ) > 1 loop sibling := substr ( postfix , 2 , instr( postfix , '. ' , 2 ) - 2 ) ; postfix := substr ( postfix , instr( postfix , '. ' , 2 ) , length ( postfix ) - instr ( postfix , '. ' , 2) +1 ) ; num := child_numer ( num , den, to_number ( sibling ) ) ; den := child_denom ( num , den, to_number ( sibling ) ) ; end loop ; RETURN num ; END ; function path_denom ( path varchar2 ) ... RETURN den ; END ; select path_numer ( ' 2.1.3 ' ) || '/index.html ' || path_denom ( ' 2.1.3 ' ) from dual 51/64
The Final Test
Now that the infrastructure is completed , we can test it .
Let 's create the hierarchy
create table emps (
name varchar2 ( 30 ) ,
numer integer ,
denom integer
) alter table emps
ADD CONSTRAINT uk_name UNIQUE ( name ) USING INDEX
( CREATE UNIQUE INDEX name_idx on emps ( name ) )
ADD CONSTRAINT UK_node
UNIQUE ( numer , denom ) USING INDEX
( CREATE UNIQUE INDEX node_idx on emps( numer , denom ) )
and fill it with some data :
insert into emps values ( ' KING ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' JONES ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' SCOTT ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.1.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.1.1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' ADAMS ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.1.1.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.1.1.1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' FORD ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.1.2 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.1.2 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' SMITH ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.1.2.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.1.2.1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' BLAKE ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.2 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.2 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' ALLEN ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.2.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.2.1 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' WARD ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.2.2 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.2.2 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' MARTIN ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.2.3 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.2.3 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' TURNER ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.2.4 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.2.4 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' CLARK ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.3 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.3 ' ) ) ;
insert into emps values ( ' MILLER ' ,
path_numer ( ' 1.3.1 ' ) , path_denom ( ' 1.3.1 ' ) ) ;
commit ;
All the functions written in the previous sections are conveniently combined in a single view :
create or replace
view hierarchy as
select name , numer , denom ,
y_numer ( numer , denom ) numer_left ,
y_denom ( numer , denom ) denom_left ,
x_numer ( numer , denom ) numer_right ,
x_denom ( numer , denom ) denom_right ,
path ( numer , denom ) path ,
distance ( numer , denom , 3,2 ) depth
from emps
And , finally , we can create the hierarchical reports .

Revisionism as applied to World War II and its origins ( as also for previous wars ) has the general function of bringing historical truth to an American and a world public that had been drugged by wartime lies and propaganda .
This , in itself , is a virtue .
But some truths of history , of course , may be largely of antiquarian interest , with little relevance to present - day concerns .
This is not true of World War II revisionism , which has much critical significance for today ’s world .
The least of the lessons that revisionism can teach has already been thoroughly learned : that Germany and Japan are not uniquely " aggressor nations , " doomed from birth to menace the peace of the world .
The larger lessons have , unfortunately , yet to be learned .
The United States is again being subjected to that " complex of fear and vaunting " ( in the brilliant phrase of Garet Garrett ’s ) which drove us , and the Western world , into two other disastrous wars in our century .
Once again , the American public is being subjected to a nearly unanimous barrage of war propaganda and war hysteria , so that only the most searching and rational can keep their heads .
Once again , we find that there has emerged upon the scene an Enemy , a Bad Guy , with the same old Bad Guy characteristics that we have heard of before ; a diabolic , monolithic Enemy , which , generations ago in some " sacred texts , " decided ( for reasons that remain obscure ) that it was " out to conquer the world . "
Since then , the Enemy , darkly , secretly , diabolically , has " plotted , " conspiratorially , to conquer the world , building up a vast and mighty and overwhelming military machine , and also constructing a mighty international and " subversive " " fifth column , " which functions as an army of mere puppets , agents of the Enemy ’s central headquarters , ready to commit espionage , sabotage , or any other act of " undermining " other states .
The Enemy , then , is " monolithic , " ruled solely and strictly from the top , by a few master rulers , and is dominated always by the single purpose of world conquest .
The model to keep in mind is Dr. Fu Manchu , here trotted forward as an international bogeyman .
The Enemy , then , says the war propaganda , is guided by but one purpose : conquest of the world .
He never suffers from such human emotions as fear  fear that we might attack him  or belief that he is acting in defense , or out of self - respect and the desire to save face before himself as well as before others .
Neither does he possess such human qualities as reason .
No , there is only one other emotion that can sway him : superior force will compel him to " back down . "
This is because , even though a Fu Manchu , he is also like the Bad Guy in the movie Western : he will cower before the Good Guy if the Good Guy is strong , armed to the teeth , resolute of purpose , etc .
Hence , the complex of fear and vaunting : fear of the supposedly implacable and permanent plotting of the Enemy ; vaunting of the enormous military might of America and its meddling throughout the world , to " contain , " " roll back , " etc. , the Enemy , or to " liberate " the " oppressed nations . "
Now revisionism teaches us that this entire myth , so prevalent then and even now about Hitler , and about the Japanese , is a tissue of fallacies from beginning to end .
Every plank in this nightmare evidence is either completely untrue or not entirely the truth .
If people should learn this intellectual fraud about Hitler ’s Germany , then they will begin to ask questions , and searching questions , about the current World War III version of the same myth .
Nothing would stop the current headlong flight to war faster , or more surely cause people to begin to reason about foreign affairs once again , after a long orgy of emotion and cliché .
For the same myth is now based on the same old fallacies .
And this is seen by the increasing use that the Cold Warriors have been making of the " Munich myth " : the continually repeated charge that it was the " appeasement " of the " aggressor " at Munich that " fed " his " aggression " ( again , the Fu Manchu , or Wild Beast , comparison ) , and that caused the " aggressor , " drunk with his conquests , to launch World War II .
This Munich myth has been used as one of the leading arguments against any sort of rational negotiations with the Communist nations , and the stigmatizing of even the most harmless search for agreement as " appeasement . "
It is for this reason that A.J.P. Taylor ’s magnificent Origins of the Second World War received probably its most distorted and frenetic review in the pages of National Review .

It is about time that Americans learn : that Bad Guys ( Nazis or Communists ) may not necessarily want or desire war , or be out to " conquer " the world ( their hope for " conquest " may be strictly ideological and not military at all ) ; that Bad Guys may also fear the possibility of our use of our enormous military might and aggressive posture to attack them ; that both the Bad Guys and Good Guys may have common interests which make negotiation possible ( e.g. , that neither wants to be annihilated by nuclear weapons ) ; that no organization is a " monolith , " and that " agents " are often simply ideological allies who can and do split with their supposed " masters " ; and that , finally , we may learn the most profound lesson of all : that the domestic policy of a government is often no index whatever to its foreign policy .
We are still , in the last analysis , suffering from the delusion of Woodrow Wilson : that " democracies " ipso facto will never embark on war , and that " dictatorships " are always prone to engage in war .
Much as we may and do abhor the domestic programs of most dictators ( and certainly of the Nazis and Communists ) , this has no necessary relation to their foreign policies : indeed , many dictatorships have been passive and static in history , and , contrariwise , many democracies have led in promoting and waging war .
Revisionism may , once and for all , be able to destroy this Wilsonian myth .
There is only one real difference between the capacity of a democracy and a dictatorship to wage war : democracies invariably engage much more widely in deceptive war propaganda , to whip up and persuade the public .
Democracies that wage war need to produce much more propaganda to whip up their citizens , and at the same time to camouflage their policies much more intensely in hypocritical moral cant to fool the voters .
The lack of need for this on the part of dictatorships often makes their policies seem superficially to be more warlike , and this is one of the reasons why they have had a " bad press " in this century .
The Origins of The Sec ... Taylor , A.J.P. Best Price : $ 2.01 Buy New $ 10.65 ( as of 03:25 EST - Details )
The task of revisionism has been to penetrate beneath these superficialities and appearances to the stark realities underneath  realities which show , certainly in this century , the United States , Great Britain , and France  the three great " democracies "  to be worse than any other three countries in fomenting and waging aggressive war .
Realization of this truth would be of incalculable importance on the current scene .
Conservatives should not need to be reminded of the flimsiness of the " democratic " myth ; we are familiar now with the concept of " totalitarian democracy , " of the frequent propensity of the masses to tyrannize over minorities .
If conservatives can see this truth in domestic affairs , why not in foreign ?

There are many other , more specific but also important , lessons that revisionism can teach us .
The Cold War , as well as World Wars I and II , has been launched by the Western democracies so as to meddle in the affairs of Eastern Europe .
The great power - fact about Eastern Europe is that the smaller nations there are fated to be under the dominance , friendly or otherwise , of Germany or Russia .
In World War I , the United States and Britain went to war partly to help Russia expand into the part of Eastern Europe then dominated by Austria - Hungary and Germany .
This act of meddling on our part , at the cost of untold lives , both West and East , and of an enormous increase in militarism , statism , and socialism at home , led to a situation in Eastern Europe which brought the United States and Britain into World War II , to keep Germany from dominating Eastern Europe .
As soon as World War II was over ( with its enormous consequent increase in statism , militarism , and socialism in the United States ) , the US and Britain felt they had to launch a Cold War to oust Russia from the dominance over Eastern Europe which it had obtained as a natural consequence of the joint defeat of Germany .
How much longer is the United States to play with the fate of the American people , or even the human race itself , for the sake of imposing a solution of our own liking on Eastern Europe ?
And if we should wage a holocaust to " destroy communism , " and there should ( doubtfully ) be any Americans remaining , how distinguishable from communism will the American system , in reality , be ?
Why American History I ... Jeff Riggenbach Best Price : $ 39.99 ( as of 08:30 EST - Details )
There have been two major facets to the Cold War : trying to establish US and British hegemony over Eastern Europe , and attempting to suppress nationalist revolutions that would take undeveloped countries outside of the Western imperialist orbit .
Here again , revisionism of World War II has important lessons to teach us today .
For in World War I , England , backed by the United States , went to war against Germany to try to hobble an important commercial competitor which had started late in the imperialist game .
Before World Wars I and II , Britain and France tried to preserve their imperialist domination as against the " have - not " nations Germany and Japan that came late in the imperialist race .
And now , after World War II , the United States has assumed the imperialist scepter from the weakened hands of Britain and France .
Revisionism thus provides us with the insight that America has now become the world colossus of imperialism , propping up puppet and client states all over the undeveloped areas of the world , and fiercely attempting to suppress nationalist revolutions that would take these countries out of the American imperial orbit .
As Garet Garrett also said : " We have crossed the boundary that lies between republic and empire . "
Communism having allied itself with the immensely popular movements of national liberation against imperialism , the United States , in the hypocritical name of " freedom , " is now engaged in the logical conclusion of its Cold War policy : attempting to exterminate a whole nation in Vietnam to make very sure that they are rather dead than Red  and to preserve American imperial rule .
All these lessons revisionism has to teach us .
For revisionism , in the final analysis , is based on truth and rationality .
Truth and rationality are always the first victims in any war frenzy ; and they are , therefore , once again an extremely rare commodity on today ’s " market . "
Revisionism brings to the artificial frenzy of daily events and day - to - day propaganda , the cool but in the last analysis glorious light of historical truth .
Such truth is almost desperately needed in today ’s world .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
DICK CHENEY , the vice - president , claims that his office is not “ an entity within the executive branch ” , and therefore not subject to the rules concerning the proper care of secret documents .
Six years ago , he rebuffed a probe into his energy task - force on the ground that it “ would unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executive branch ” .
Zen masters can doubtless see how a man can be both part of the executive and not part of it .
Everyone else is grateful to Henry Waxman , the Democratic chairman of the House oversight committee , for exposing the absurd rationale for Mr Cheney 's compulsive secrecy .
In November last year the Democrats trounced the Republicans to capture both chambers of Congress .
On January 4th Nancy Pelosi , the top Democrat in the House of Representatives , celebrated her elevation to the speakership with the same prayer Margaret Thatcher used when she first became prime minister of the United Kingdom : “ Where there is darkness , may we bring light .
Where there is hatred , may we bring love .
And where there is despair , may we bring hope . ”
Mrs Pelosi and her fellow Democrats have made some progress on the first of these , but not much on the other two .
In the six months that the Democrats have been in charge , they have energetically shone torches into White House nooks the previous , Republican - controlled Congress was content to leave dark .
Besides chivvying Mr Cheney , the new Congress has investigated slipshod planning for the occupation of Iraq and the woeful treatment of injured veterans .
It has subpoenaed the White House for documents about warrantless wiretapping , and grilled the attorney - general , Alberto Gonzales , about alleged politically - motivated sackings .
Mr Gonzales still has his job , though .
So does Mr Cheney .
Yet all this prodding keeps the administration on its toes .
And so do efforts by the new Congress to influence the campaign in Iraq .
The Democrats owe their majority in large part to war - weariness .
Many of their supporters thought they would pull American troops out of Iraq .
They have not .
They could have done so , by refusing Mr Bush the funds to carry on fighting .
But that would have shifted to the Democrats the blame for the carnage that would probably follow a sudden withdrawal .
Instead , Ms Pelosi and her Senate counterpart , Harry Reid , sent President George Bush a war budget that included a timetable for withdrawal , knowing he would veto it .
Their point made , they sent him another bill , without a timetable , that will fund the war until September .
The bill also included benchmarks that the Iraqi government must meet if it is to continue receiving non-military aid .
It was far short of what the anti-war movement wanted , but it keeps Mr Bush on a shorter leash than he would like .
What else has the 110th Congress accomplished ?
Of the Democrats ' campaign promises , the meatiest one so far enacted is an increase in the federal minimum wage from $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 an hour , which is widely popular and will benefit some Americans while perhaps throwing others out of work .
The Democrats have also tightened up rules about lawmakers accepting gifts from lobbyists , although Ms Pelosi undermined her own anti-corruption crusade by trying unsuccessfully to place an ethically - challenged ally in the number - two job in the House .
Other pledges have been blocked , delayed or watered down .
A bill to allow the government to negotiate directly with drug companies to reduce prices passed through the House but stalled in the Senate .
An attempt to fund foetal stem - cell research was vetoed by Mr Bush .
Bills to provide cheaper student loans and implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission are grinding their way through the legislative process slowly .
Some big business is under way .
Last week the Senate passed a substantial but flawed energy bill , which imposed tougher fuel - efficiency standards on cars but failed to consider a carbon tax or a cap - and - trade system .
It also banned “ price - gouging ” by oil firms , a practice that exists only in Democrats ' imaginations .
The House version of the bill has yet to be revealed , so all this could change .
This week the Senate revived a bipartisan attempt to fix America 's immigration system .
Reformers want to curb illegal immigration but also to allow illegal immigrants who are already in the country swift legalisation and a path to becoming citizens .
Opponents of the bill , mostly Republicans who decry it as an “ amnesty ” , nearly killed it earlier this month and were hoping to do so for real as The Economist went to press .
After a quarter of its term , some lament that this Congress has done very little .
That is too harsh .
America 's lawmaking process is designed to be slow and deliberative .
And a Congress should not be measured merely by the number of laws it passes .
David Boaz of the Cato Institute , a libertarian think - tank , argues that divided government is actually working quite well , since each side curbs the other 's excesses .
“ The Democrats are discovering oversight and the president is discovering his veto pen , ” he says .
That is probably helping to restrain spending , at least for the time being .
But still , neither side shows the slightest appetite for reforming Medicare ( health care for the elderly ) or Social Security ( public pensions ) , the two entitlement programmes that will bust the budget when the baby - boomers retire .
And Americans are hardly enthused about their new Congress .
At 25 % , its approval rating is now even lower than Mr Bush's .

My husband and I started trying for a family eight years ago , when I was in my mid-30s .
We left it fairly late , and four miscarriages down the line , there is only a fool 's hope that we will ever become parents .
I know it may sound callous after the emotional trials we 've faced , but I am beginning to see childlessness as a blessed relief .
In a UN survey of 23 countries , Britain was judged the worst place to be a child .
I am pretty sure it is one of the worst places in the world to be a parent .
Why ?
Because somehow our liberal society has created a tribe of monstrous kids .
Parents have become terrified of their offspring , in thrall to their every want and desire , which they scurry to fulfil .
And the thanks they receive ?
A constant litany of abuse , much of it woundingly personal , and publicly delivered , casual disobedience .
I know this from my personal experience of seeing friends abused .
Meeting them with their children in tow has become an ordeal .
I do n't like hearing the people I love and admire described as ' pathetic ' by their six - year - old offspring .
But this has occurred on more than one occasion .
So how did it come to this ?
Born in the mid-1960s , I respected and adored my parents : the idea of telling my dad to **** off , slapping my mum or calling her an " old hag " ( another phrase I 've heard uttered in anger ) was unthinkable .
But such behaviour is now par for the course .
Why have children changed so radically in two short generations ?
Partly , I suspect , because they have been encouraged to do so by well - meaning but misguided ' child professionals ' .
Since the advent of the 1989 Children 's Act , there has been an endless caravan of Bills and initiatives aimed at achieving a ' child - centred society ' .
This has left many adults - particularly professionals such as teachers or police - feeling defenceless when they deal with ' challenging ' ( that is rude and violent ) kids .
The same legal system treats children as if they had a hotline to God .
Of course , there are always abuses in need of stamping out , and we certainly should do all we can to protect vulnerable children .
It should be recognised that the Children 's
Act did valuable work , in enshrining a child 's right not to be physically abused , for example .
But we have lost sight of how things should be .
" Child - centred " has become a buzz phrase beloved by educationalists , psychologists and just about anyone working with children .
Our friends Jim and Charlie are child - centred parents .
They came to dinner , bringing ( uninvited and unwanted ) their eight - year - old boy and four - year - old daughter .
Plus the nanny .
Because it took at least three adults to control these two brats .
The eight - year - old breezily announced : " Everyone loves me . "
Pointing suddenly at my husband , he demanded : " You love me , do n't you ? "
When he got over the shock , my husband lukewarmly agreed .
What else to do ?
The entire evening was spent preventing the four - year - old climbing the stairs .
Upstairs was my office , bedrooms - the usual private spaces of a house - and more importantly the cat , who had taken one look at the visitors and wisely fled .
The little girl 's parents were laughably apologetic , proud of her ' intellectual curiosity ' and ' adventurous spirit ' .
Inevitably , at some point during dinner , she escaped .
She was upstairs tormenting the cat .
She 'd thrown the contents of the litter tray , water and food bowl round the bedroom .
" What are you doing ? " I demanded .
She burst into tears and left for home two hours later , still crying .
Was it the first time she had ever been admonished ?
For the past 30 years or so , everyone from lofty academics to Oprah Winfrey has taught us that we are not to blame for our sins and misfortunes .
We are the product of our upbringing and early influences - for good or ill .
But absolving the young of all blame for their actions - and failing to discipline them when they do wrong - has created a generation of brats .
Paralysed by guilt and fear , and spurred on by a gloopy sentimentalism which decrees that anyone under 12 years of age is , at core , an unsullied sweetheart , we give a latitude to children which they simply do n't deserve .
The results are not pretty .
I recently saw a small boy hit his mother full in the face with a cricket bat at a local fete .
He 'd been twirling the bat , ignoring her nervous pleas for him to stop .
Eventually , he deliberately flung the bat straight at her .
As she sat , stunned , crying into the picnic , others ran to help .
The small perpetrator just stood there , interested in the drama he 'd produced .
Then there was the besuited dad out with his son .
The boy was maybe six .
For some reason the child lost his temper , and the father tried to squat down and calm the boy .
He was struck in the face and quickly stood up , only to find himself repeatedly being kicked in the shins by this mini - tyro .
The astonishing thing was the man made no attempt to stop him , too scared to apply the kind of discipline that came naturally to previous generations .
Do not forget that the law now says that if you strike your own child and leave a mark , you can be arrested for assault .
The power to discipline your own children is being eroded irrevocably .
These parents have turned into the family equivalent of a doormat girlfriend who snivels about how her man is misunderstood as she tries to hide the black eye .
No doubt our overwhelming love for our offspring is essential .
And undoubtedly the struggle many now go through to have a child makes that child still more precious .
And children are precious , and I have a godchild and other children in my family whom I adore .
But all this love should be tempered by strength and guidance , and the power to say ' No ' .
In China , the single child per couple laws have created the phenomenon of the ' Little Emperors ' , the longed for baby ( boy ) who is the centre of the household - a generation of obese and horrendously spoilt young men .
Perhaps it is time we shouldered our responsibilities , learnt to say ' No ' more often and began to behave as adults .
After all , these wayward children are n't the only ones who need to grow up .
Iran has effectively created a Shi’ite “ state within a state ” in neighboring Iraq , defying both Iraqi Sunnis and neighboring Sunni nations , according to a Saudi security report .
Iranian military forces are providing Shi’ite militias with weapons and training , Iranian charities are pouring funds into schools and hospitals , and Tehran is actively supporting pro-Iranian Iraqi politicians , the report said .
“ Where the Americans have failed , the Iranians have stepped in , ” said the report by the Saudi National Security Assessment Project , a Riyadh - based consultancy commissioned by the Saudi government to provide security and intelligence assessments .
The report , submitted to the Saudi government in March , has not been publicly distributed .
Citing interviews with intelligence and military officials in Iraq and surrounding region , the report states that the Sunni insurgency numbers about 77,000 , while the Shi’ite militia forces total about 35,000 .
According to the report , Iran also is infiltrating Iraq through its al Quds forces — the special command division of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) — which specialize in intelligence operations in unconventional warfare .
RAND Corp. senior defense analyst Ed O’Connell said the Iranian intelligence was trying to counter Saddam Hussein ’s former formidable spy network , Iraqi Intelligence Service ( IIS ) , or the Mukhabarat .
Under Saddam ’s regime , he said , roughly one of every six Iraqi adults was a paid or unpaid informant — a network that did not disappear with the arrival of the U.S. - led coalition .
“ The real story in Iraq is this below - the - surface ‘ unconventional war ’ between the old IIS , which could become a more overt Saudi proxy — and the al Quds special directorate intelligence - counterintelligence , ” Mr. O’Connell said .
The Saudi security report was directed by Nawaf Obaid — who recently was fired for writing an article in The Washington Post warning that Saudi Arabia would not stand idly by and allow Iraq ’s Shi’ites to destroy its Sunni population .
Washington diplomats and analysts say Mr. Obaid ’s dismissal was more window - dressing than a real punitive action .
The report states that the Iranian levers of influence in Iraq include a broad network of informants , military and logistical support of armed groups , and social welfare campaigns .
It adds that Tehran has “ sought to influence Iraq ’s political process by giving support to new various parties , in particular , to the SCIRI , ” or Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq , the leading Shi’ite party .
Analysts say some Saudi citizens are raising funds for Sunni insurgents .
“ I have heard them say it is not hard to line up a couple hundred thousand dollars and send it to the insurgents across the border , ” said Isobel Coleman , a senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations .
Despite claims by SCIRI leader that the party ’s private militia , the Iran - backed Badr Organization , formerly known as the Badr Brigade , has surrendered its weapons , gun-toting Badr members are still visible on the streets of Baghdad .
The Saudi study says the Badr Organization is still about 25,000 - strong , and the party has roughly 3 million supporters .
Anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr ’s militia , the Mahdi Army , is thought to number just under 10,000 , while his party has the support of about 1.5 million Shi’ites .
“ Each of these groups is beholden in some way to Iran and has ties to its intelligence and security services , ” the report says .
It adds : “ Recent intelligence indicates that IRGC officers are currently operating in Iraq certain Shi’ite militias and actual army and police units . ”
U.S. officials have acknowledged that Shi’ite militias have infiltrated the police , but stopped short of saying that there is direct Iranian involvement in the security forces .
Mrs. Coleman cautions that the report , while not necessarily inaccurate , is not impartial .
“ It is alarmist about the Iranians , and Mr. Obaid comes with a bias .
Not that it is wrong , but it is not unbiased , ” she said .
The Saudi study was the result of five months of cooperation with Iraq and neighboring countries and dozens of interviews with current military and intelligence officials in the region , Mr. Obaid wrote in the preface to the 40 - page report .
“ Ordinary police and military officers now have a stronger allegiance to the Badr Organization or the Mahdi Army than to their own units , ” the report says , adding that the Badr Organization is the “ key vehicle Iran is using to achieve its military , security and intelligence aims . ”
The study also provides details on the Sunni insurgency .
It cites Iraqi tribal leaders as saying that the insurgency is run mainly by former commanders and high - level military officers of the Ba’athist regime .
Only a smaller group is religiously inspired and includes foreign fighters .
Of the 77,000 active members of the insurgency , the “ jihadis ” number about 17,000 , of which some 5,000 are from North Africa , Sudan , Yemen , Egypt and Saudi Arabia .
The remaining 60,000 are members of the former military or Saddam ’s paramilitary Fedayeen forces .
The officer corps of the insurgency has “ command and control facilities in Syria as well as bases in strategic locations , where Sunnis constitute the majority of the urban population . ”
Given the centuries - old tribal , familial and religious ties between Iraq ’s Sunnis and Saudi Arabia , the assessment concludes that “ Saudi Arabia has a special responsibility to ensure the continued welfare and security of Sunnis in Iraq . ”
Its recommendations to the Saudi government included a comprehensive strategy that would include overt and covert components to deal with the worst - case scenario of full - blown civil war .
It also calls on the government to communicate the assessment to the United States ; make it clear to Iran that if its covert activities did not stop the Saudi leadership would counter them ; and extend an invitation to the highest Iraqi Shi’ite leader , Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , to reassure the Shi’ite community .

Five years before we invaded Iraq , one senator had the remarkable foresight to speak about our responsibility to any Iraqis who might help the United States : “ If we would have people in Iraq , or elsewhere in the world , trust us and work with us , then we need to take care that the United States maintains a reputation for trustworthiness and for taking care of its friends . ”
He was even more direct about what was at stake : “ The world will be watching and judging how America treats people who are seen to be on our side .
We cannot afford to foster a perception of unfairness that will make it more difficult for the United States to recruit supporters in the future . ”
So spoke Senator Kyl in 1998 .
I thought I had witnessed the depths of our government ’s inability to rapidly help Iraqis during the year that I worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad and Falluja .
That was until I went to Washington in February with a list of all of my former Iraqi colleagues who are now refugees because they helped us .
While the State Department bureau in charge of refugee resettlement has been trying feverishly to respond belatedly to the crisis , it is not equipped or authorized to act expeditiously .
In her Jan. 16 testimony to the Senate , the assistant secretary of state for population , refugees and migration , Ellen Sauerbrey , said that the plight of Iraq ’s refugees was the bureau ’s “ very top priority . ”
More than two months later , she reported to the House that it could take six months ( and likely longer ) before our Iraqi friends might find refuge here .
What kind of superpower ca n’t convert its “ very top priority ” into a program that starts saving its allies ’ lives before their visas expire and they are forced to return to Iraq ?
Rita is on my list , which has grown to include hundreds of former colleagues and others who endured similarly shattering fates because they believed in America enough to help us in Iraq .
They wonder if they chose poorly when they signed on with us , and they are rapidly losing hope that the United States will offer them a life preserver before it ’s too late .
Those who paid ransoms for their lives or those of their loved ones are scared to explain in their asylum applications the chief reason they fled their country , because they worry it will disqualify them — a perverse indication of the extent to which our government has lost its way since we invaded .
This is not an issue President Bush can delegate anymore .
His bureaucracies are moving perilously slowly .
They need the leadership of an American president .
How will the United States help those whose belief in us cost them their country ?
We need to honor the sacrifice of these Iraqis — and start recovering the moral credibility our country forfeits each day they go without our help .
In the first fierce day of war , when coordinated air strikes on Iranian targets destroyed most of the Iranian air force and navy , the US military appeared invincible again .
Wrecking a second - rate military power does that for an imperial war machine .
By the second day of the war , however , most American and Iranian citizens wished for peace .
Unfortunately , wars are always easier to get into than out of .
While the war planners in the Pentagon and Israel had devised a workable plan to force Iran into war , using a fake attack on US warships by Iranian gunboats ( as the faked Tonkin Gulf attack initiated the Vietnam War ) , the US Navy fared far worse than the planners wished .
In 1987 - 88 , during the First US - Iran Gulf war , the combined US Navy , Navy Seals , Marines and Army copters easily destroyed the navy of Iran in a single day .
Yet Iranian gunboats continued to harass US shipping in that undeclared war , culminating in the USS Vincennes shooting down an unarmed Iranian jumbo jet while in Iran water .
Nearly 20 years later , after being armed with Russian and Chinese weapons , the Iranian defensive forces proved far more capable than the civilian wizards at the Pentagon predicted .
Before the war , the chief of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , General Yahya Rahim Safavi , said the advanced missile system served ' to show our deterrent and defensive power to trans - regional enemies , and we hope they will understand the message . '
By the second day , the message became clearer : Iran was no longer the pushover of years past .
The combined effect of Sunburn , Exocet and Yakhonts missiles striking several US Navy ships fleeing the fishbowl of the Persian Gulf was an unforgettable sight .
So unforgettable that CNN and Fox chose not to show them .
According to Mark Gaffney : ' At the time of the Falklands war the Argentine air force possessed only five Exocets , yet managed to sink two ships .
With enough of them , the Argentineans might have sunk the entire British fleet , and won the war . '
By contrast , the Iranians , cognizant of their defeat at the hands of the Iraqi and US forces in 1987 - 88 , aware of the twin threat from Israel and the US , had focused heavily on defensive weaponry , supplied to them by Russian and Chinese manufacturers .
' The Russian SS - N - 22 . Sunburn ( Moskit ) , which technical journals and experts have termed the most effective and lethal anti-ship weapon extant , is far cheaper to produce than a fighter plane or a missile destroyer , cruiser or aircraft carrier , ' wrote Gaffney before the war .
To make matters worse for US Navymen , the Russians provided the SS - NX - 26 Yakhonts anti-ship missiles to Iran , reported to possess Mach 2.9 speed and a range of 180 miles .
The width of the Persian Gulf ?
100 -180 miles .
The immediate closure of the Persian Gulf to oil tankers from six nations provided a huge boost to peace advocates .
By the second day of the war with Iran , with US Navy ships ablaze and sinking , with dire forecasts of worldwide fuel shortages , with gas prices spiking at $ 10 a gallon in some places , with increasing calls for impeachment appearing in the mainstream media , with environmentalist decrying the spread of radiation from the bomb blasted atomic sites in Iran , suddenly the neocon - sponsored war with Iran no longer seemed like such a good idea .
Despite the claimed success of the pre-emptive attack on Iran , despite the round - the - clock appearances of neocons on most US news channels , the fallout from the war , both in Iran and America , had become exceedingly toxic .
By the middle of the second day , with reports of missile strikes on the Green Zone , the media spin became harder to control .
The glorious flag - waving patriotism that followed 911 and the approach of the Iraq War never materialized .
Along the smalltown streets of America , fewer folks unfurled a flag .
Instead , lines of panicked motorists , faces stricken by the new reality of another war , a war they had chosen to ignore for so long , unfurled into every gas station in America as a frightened mob .
Most rushed to the pumps with a single thought in mind : I am going to fill my SUV to the top and woe be to anyone who tries to stop me .
Predictably the price of platinum , gold and silver rose .
Gold topped $ 1000 an ounce while silver , the poor man 's gold , approached $ 50 .
Predictably , the US dollar fell , as nations as diverse as China and Kuwait began dumping greenbacks for gold .
Predictably , most stocks not related to war industries tumbled .
Housing starts dipped and sales dried up .
And all because of an ill - conceived war designed by a few Israel - centric US leaders with lots to gain and little to lose .
The retaliatory strikes by US carrier - based fighter planes that struck the Iranian oil platforms along Bandar Abbas and left them ablaze never appeared on American television .
Likewise the attacks on civilian infrastructure in Iran by Israeli and US warplanes .
These were purely punitive attacks by US Navy fliers in revenge for ship losses in the Persian Gulf .
The war with Iran had become a retaliatory war , a war of attrition , by the second day .
Yet throughout the Middle East , the television coverage by Al Jazeera of bomb damage to bridges , waterworks , power stations and oil platforms -- not to mention schools , mosques and houses --- only served to drive a wider wedge between US and their few remaining Islamic and European allies .
Throughout the first week , while US and Israeli fighter bombers attacked Iran at will , suffering an occasional loss , Iranian missiles rained down on US troops huddled in semi-permanent bases in Iraq .
Resistance in Iraq grew as the war with Iran waxed and waned and US casualties rose .
Meanwhile another sort of war raged at home , another unexpected resistance .
The American public , too long acquiescent , took to the streets , took to campuses , courthouses and public squares , loud , outrageous and strong .
Uncivil disobedience , a public strength the powerful always feared , had returned to America three decades later .
The White House threatened to mobilize troops to handle dissidents at home , but Keith Olbermann asked President Bush : ' Sir , from where do you intend to get those troops ? '
Public support for the Iraq and Iran wars and support for the Bush administration fell to record lows .
In Congress , the docile , do - nothing Democrats proved less adversarial than the tougher Republicans .
But in the streets , where the fate of any nation thrives or dies , the spirit of Americans grew angrier and angrier .
For each spike in crude prices , each report of new losses , each report of new atrocities inflicted on Iran , the calls for a change became cruder and more violent .
The first to fall , surprisingly , was Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The Imams , wielding real power in Iran , disapproved of the increasingly bellicose stance of Ahmadinejad and the destruction of the war , forcing his resignation .
Later in the week , calls for the impeachment of George Bush forced a brokered peace deal and a hurried vote by the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment by an overwhelming majority .
The US Senate , under as much fire as the troops in Iraq , dragged their feet but the words ' High Crimes ' began to filter into their brains by the end of the first week of the war .
The second week of the war promised many more surprises .

Yes , you .
You sick fucker .
On Wednesday morning I emerged from my girlfriend 's building by U.N. Plaza to find that you had sawed the tops off both the sparkplugs on my motorcycle .
At the time , I had no idea why anyone would do that .
Other than the sparkplugs , the bike was untouched .
Some kind of bizarre vandalism ?
A fraternity prank gone awry ?
I had no idea .
All I knew is that I looked like a huge douchebag riding the Muni to work in a padded motorcycle jacket and helmet .
Because the bike was immobilized I got a $ 35 street sweeping ticket that night .
Thursday I had it towed to the shop ( $ 45 ) where they replaced the sparkplugs and the boots ( $ 50 including labor ) .
They explained to me that " people " - I use the term loosely here - like you break off the tops of spark plugs and use the porcelain tubes to smoke crack .
As an engineer and former MacGyver fan , in a way I think this is kind of cool .
But then I remember that I just paid $ 100 for YOUR crackpipes , and I get angry again .
Crackhead , it was really good to have my bike back though .
I rode home from the shop with a couple of spare sparkplugs and a smile on my face .
I figured the next time I parked at my girlfriend 's place overnight I would have to buy some crackpipes and tape them to my bike as a peace offering .
Overall , I was n't that upset .
Despite having to ride the bus for three days and dropping a hundred bones at the shop , I had gained some fascinating knowledge , a new set of sparkplugs , and a pretty funny anecdote about how fucked up you are , and how our paths once crossed briefly in the night .
But you could n't just let sleeping dogs lie , could you Crackhead .
You could n't just stay in on Friday , watch Letterman through the window of a home electronics store and then call it a night .
You could n't rest on your laurels .
Two porcelain sparkplug crackpipes just was n't enough for you , was it Crackhead ?
You just had to come back for more .
This morning , a scant fifteen hours after I rode it out of the shop , I found my motorcycle violated once again .
This time you only took the right one - maybe you were having an off night .
At least this time I had a spare sparkplug and the tools to fix it - or so I thought - having ordered a 73 - piece toolset from SEARS.com last week .
But no , the sparkplug socket in my new toolset was for American sparkplugs .
So I had to go down to the neighborhood Ace hardware .
They had an 18 mm socket that would fit over my sparkplug , but it was for a 1 / 2 " drive ratchet .
My toolkit only has 1/4 " and 3/8 " ratchets .
So I had to buy a 1/ 2 " ratchet along with the socket .
Even though the clerk took pity on me and gave me the senior citizen discount ( I'm 25 ) it still cost me $ 22 all told .
Now , you might say that I should have just gotten a 3/8 " - to - 1/2 " drive adaptor instead of springing for the whole ratchet .
And to that I say " Shut the hell up , Crackhead , I 'm not finished .
And besides , I was eventually going to buy a 1/ 2 " ratchet anyway so it 's probably not worth it to take it back now .
" OK , now I 'm rambling .
But the point is , Crackhead , that you have done me wrong .
Now , I get that you love crack .
That is totally understandable .
I 've heard it is really fun , at first , and quite addictive .
What I do n't understand is , YOU ARE A CRACKHEAD .
WHY DON'T YOU OWN A CRACKPIPE ?
I am an engineer .
Do you ever see me shaking down bums in the Loin for a calculator and sliderule ?
No , you do n't .
Because engineering is the main thing I do , I went and bought myself a calculator .
The main thing you do is crack .
How do you get by without a crackpipe ?
The other crackheads must clown on you non -stop .
I mean , the fucking saw you used to saw off my sparkplugs is probably worth five or ten bucks .
Why not sell or trade it for a crackpipe ?
You really have n't put much thought into this , have you ?
Please , Crackhead , please do n't tell me you sold your crackpipe to buy crack .
Even a stupid crackhead such as yourself could n't possibly be that stupid .
I 've decided that taping crackpipes to my motorcycle would be tantamount to appeasement .
You have crossed a line , Crackhead - specifically California Street .
You have come onto my own street and you have desecrated that which I hold dear .
You have stolen from me , and you have caused me to spend the last half hour writing this post instead of engineering shit , and it is concievable , if not likely , that my boss could find out about this and fire me .
I am hella pissed at you dude .
Here are my options as I see them : 1 . Write a note saying that I have coated both of my sparkplugs in rat poison and tape it to my bike at night .
You can thank Tim for that one , it was his idea .
2 .
Do n't write a note , but just coat both sparkplugs in rat poison .
This is probably closer to a punishment that would fit your despicable crime .
I 'm sure this is super illegal and shit , but it 's not like anyone is going to miss you , Crackhead .
Do n't fool yourself .
3 .
Wait in an alley near my bike armed with my new stainless steel mirror - finish Ace Professional brand 1/ 2 " drive socket wrench , my 18 mm sparkplug socket , and my searing rage .
It 's pretty heavy and well balanced .
I am not a large man , but I am angry .
In conclusion , Crackhead , why do n't you just do both of us a favor and buy yourself a crackpipe ?
It will both enhance your crack smoking experience and save me a lot of time and felony assault charges .
Think about it .
Sincerely , Matt ***
If you are not the Crackhead that took my sparkplugs , please disregard this posting ***
FBI personnel who used misleading emergency letters to acquire thousands of Americans ' phone records are the subject of a criminal investigation , top bureau officials told civil liberties groups Monday .
The unprecedented criminal probe , revealed at an outreach meeting led by FBI director Robert Mueller and general counsel Valerie Caproni at FBI headquarters , is looking at the actions of an antiterrorism team known as the Communications Analysis Unit , according to two people who attended the meeting independently and who informed Wired News , requesting anonymity .
The privately disclosed investigation would mark the first time government officials have faced possible prosecution for misuse of Patriot Act investigative tools , and highlights the seriousness of recent reports about the FBI 's misuse of a powerful self - issued subpoena known as a National Security Letter .
Unit employees , who are not authorized to request records in investigations , sent form letters to telephone companies to acquire detailed billing information on specific phone numbers by falsely promising that subpoenas were already in the works .
According to a third source , FBI officials also said at the meeting that some bureau employees have already been granted immunity from prosecution in the investigation .
The third source , who also spoke on condition of anonymity , did not recall , however , that FBI officials described the investigation as " criminal . "
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to comment on the content of the conversation , saying only , " The FBI does not confirm or deny investigations . "
Neither the Justice Department 's Office of the Inspector General nor the FBI 's Office of Professional Responsibility returned calls for comment .
While the scope of the alleged investigation is unknown , investigators could be examining whether the unit violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act , or committed fraud by falsely swearing that subpoenas were being prepared .
National Security Letters are self - issued subpoenas that allow investigators in terrorism and espionage cases to require phone companies , banks , credit reporting agencies and internet service providers to turn over records on Americans considered " relevant " to an investigation .
Those records are then fed into three computer systems , including a shared data - mining tool known as the Investigative Data Warehouse .
Though warned in 2001 to use this power sparingly , FBI agents issued more than 47,000 National Security Letters in 2005 , more than half of which targeted Americans .
Justice Department officials , including Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , have downplayed the gravity of the reported errors while attempting to mollify critics by promising to strengthen internal oversight .
The Communications Analysis Unit , part of the FBI 's Communications Exploitation Section based in the agency 's headquarters building , is tasked with analyzing terrorist communications and providing intelligence to the FBI 's Counterterrorism Division .
However , because it only supports investigators , unit employees cannot issue subpoenas and instead need to have counterterrorism investigators do so .
However , the Justice Department 's Inspector General reported ( .pdf ) in March that the office issued 739 " exigent letters " to AT&T , Verizon and MCI seeking information on more than 3,000 phone numbers .
The letters stated : " Due to exigent circumstances , it is requested that records for the attached list of telephone numbers be provided .
Subpoenas requesting this information have been submitted to the U.S. Attorney 's Office who will process and serve them formally to ( Phone Company Name ) as expeditiously as possible . "
However , no such subpoenas had been filed with U.S. Attorneys and only later were some of the requests followed up with proper legal process , according to the Inspector General 's report .
Several of the letters included requests for records for more than 100 phone numbers .
Bassem Youssef , the current head of the Communications Analysis Unit , told Congress in March that key FBI lawyers knew about the problem in 2005 , when he notified them and put an end to the false letters .
Youssef first noticed the problem with the letters in 2005 when he took over the unit and quickly brought the matter to the attention of his supervisor and the FBI 's Office of the General Counsel , according to a March letter ( . pdf ) sent by his lawyer , Stephen Kohn , to Sen. Chuck Grassley .
" At all times , the ( National Security Law Branch ) and the FBI ( Office of the General Counsel ) knew that the field offices and operational units were non-compliant in obtaining the legal documentation , " Kohn wrote .
Youssef is currently suing the FBI for retaliating against him for complaining that the bureau was wasting his Arabic - language skills and antiterrorism experience .
He attempted to get proper National Security Letters filed to provide post - facto legal backing for the exigent letters but was hampered by uncooperative field offices , according to the Senate letter .
Kohn did not respond to requests for comment .
BY the time Laszlo Polgar 's first baby was born in 1969 he already had firm views on child - rearing .
An eccentric citizen of communist Hungary , he had written a book called “ Bring up Genius ! ” and one of his favourite sayings was “ Geniuses are made , not born ” .
An expert on the theory of chess , he proceeded to teach little Zsuzsa at home , spending up to ten hours a day on the game .
Two more daughters were similarly hot - housed .
All three obliged their father by becoming world - class players .
The youngest , Judit , is currently ranked 13th in the world , and is by far the best female chess player of all time .
Would the experiment have succeeded with a different trio of children ?
If any child can be turned into a star , then a lot of time and money are being wasted worldwide on trying to pick winners .
America has long held “ talent searches ” , using test results and teacher recommendations to select children for advanced school courses , summer schools and other extra tuition .
This provision is set to grow .
In his state - of - the - union address in 2006 , President George Bush announced the “ American Competitiveness Initiative ” , which , among much else , would train 70,000 high - school teachers to lead advanced courses for selected pupils in mathematics and science .
Just as the superpowers ' space race made Congress put money into science education , the thought of China and India turning out hundreds of thousands of engineers and scientists is scaring America into prodding its brightest to do their best .
The philosophy behind this talent search is that ability is innate ; that it can be diagnosed with considerable accuracy ; and that it is worth cultivating .
In America , bright children are ranked as “ moderately ” , “ highly ” , “ exceptionally ” and “ profoundly ” gifted .
The only chance to influence innate ability is thought to be in the womb or the first couple of years of life .
Hence the fad for “ teaching aids ” such as videos and flashcards for newborns , and “ whale sounds ” on tape which a pregnant mother can strap to her belly .
In Britain , there is a broadly similar belief in the existence of innate talent , but also an egalitarian sentiment which makes people queasy about the idea of investing resources in grooming intelligence .
Teachers are often opposed to separate provision for the best - performing children , saying any extra help should go to stragglers .
In 2002 , in a bid to help the able while leaving intact the ban on most selection by ability in state schools , the government set up the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth .
This outfit runs summer schools and master classes for children nominated by their schools .
To date , though , only seven in ten secondary schools have nominated even a single child .
Last year all schools were told they must supply the names of their top 10 % .
Picking winners is also the order of the day in ex-communist states , a hangover from the times when talented individuals were plucked from their homes and ruthlessly trained for the glory of the nation .
But in many other countries , opposition to the idea of singling out talent and grooming it runs deep .
In Scandinavia , a belief in virtues like modesty and social solidarity makes people flinch from the idea of treating brainy children differently .
And in Japan there is a widespread belief that all children are born with the same innate abilities — and should therefore be treated alike .
All are taught together , covering the same syllabus at the same rate until they finish compulsory schooling .
Those who learn quickest are expected then to teach their classmates .
In China , extra teaching is provided , but to a self - selected bunch .
“ Children 's palaces ” in big cities offer a huge range of after - school classes .
Anyone can sign up ; all that is asked is excellent attendance .
Statistics give little clue as to which system is best .
The performance of the most able is heavily affected by factors other than state provision .
Most state education in Britain is nominally non-selective , but middle - class parents try to live near the best schools .
Ambitious Japanese parents have made private , out - of - school tuition a thriving business .
And Scandinavia 's egalitarianism might work less well in places with more diverse populations and less competent teachers .
For what it 's worth , the data suggest that some countries — like Japan and Finland , see table — can eschew selection and still thrive .
But that does not mean that any country can ditch selection and do as well .
Mr Polgar thought any child could be a prodigy given the right teaching , an early start and enough practice .
At one point he planned to prove it by adopting three baby boys from a poor country and trying his methods on them .
( His wife vetoed the scheme . )
Some say the key to success is simply hard graft .
Judit , the youngest of the Polgar sisters , was the most driven , and the most successful ; Zsofia , the middle one , was regarded as the most talented , but she was the only one who did not achieve the status of grand master .
“ Everything came easiest to her , ” said her older sister .
“ But she was lazy . ”
THE RECENT installment of the Harvard University Institute of Politics ' survey of Politics and Public Service , shows much has changed since our first national poll of young people was taken during spring 2000 .
Seven years ago , we were in the middle of the first dot.com economic cycle but also a cycle of record low turnout among college - aged youth who were disconnected from government and the political process .
At that time , young people chose stock options and community service over politics , failing to recognize the long - term benefits gained by political action and civic engagement .
Much has changed over the course of seven years : the tragic events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the war in Iraq , Hurricane Katrina , and greater concern over global warming .
But another thing that is different -- perhaps due in part to some or all of these things -- is the level of engagement of young Americans in politics .
Since our first survey in 2000 :
Voter turnout among 18 - to 24 - year - olds in the United States has grown from 36 percent in 2000 to 47 percent in 2004 ; young voters helped propel Democrats Jim Webb in Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana past Republican incumbents to secure Democratic control of the US Senate ; and hundreds , if not thousands , of organic social groups of young Americans flourish online and offline in support of candidates or pressing policy issues .
Whether or not the boomers or the " Xers " are ready , members of the " Millennial Generation " -- the group of American voters between 18 and 30 today -- are preparing to make their voices heard again in 2008 , perhaps louder than ever before .
But it is the 29 million people age 18 to 24 who are the focus of our most recent poll that have a new way of thinking about some of our nation 's greatest challenges .
Political candidates are starting to take notice .
Young people today have a strong multilateral world view on foreign policy .
In stark contrast to their elders , nearly three out of four 18 - to 24 - year - olds believe the United States should let other countries and the United Nations take the lead in solving international crises and conflicts .
After Iraq , young voters consider genocide in Darfur the next big foreign policy priority for the US government -- ahead of looming situations in Iran , North Korea , China , and Israel and its neighbors .
Religion and morality play strong roles in their political thinking .
One of the most influential voting blocs in the next election cycle will be " religious centrists , " who account for about one - in - five young voters and are defined by their concern for the moral direction of the country and the role that religion and faith play in their lives .
Balancing conservative beliefs on our culture , same - sex marriage , and abortion with a more liberal outlook on the environment and healthcare coverage , the influence of religious centrists is likely to grow over time as they are also the group with the highest percentage of African - Americans and Hispanics .
Political campaigns are beginning to make youth outreach a priority .
Many political candidates running for president in 2008 on both sides of the aisle have placed youth outreach coordinators on their staffs to tap the youth vote and are beginning to integrate media and social computing into strategies .
Young people may be ready to demand change again at the ballot box in 2008 .
Nearly six in 10 18 - to 24 - year - olds we surveyed believe the country is " off on the wrong track , " a sentiment reflected throughout all pockets of the cohort , even among Republicans .
This latest survey of America 's youth is our 12th in a project spanning thousands of interviews online and offline since 2000 .
We know that Millennials think , act , and vote very differently than the preceding " Xers " and the baby boom generation .
This information is important to political candidates looking for success in 2008 -- it 's time for political leaders to take Millennials seriously or risk being left behind .

Wired Magazine this month offers a few pointers on how to disguise on your resume the fact that you have been fired .
The main point is to come up with a negotiated settlement that has you resigning from your job .
Many employers will go along with these because they fear litigation .
There will be no " wrongful termination " lawsuits if you are on record as having left voluntarily .
I do n't dispute this advice .
It seems fine enough .
But it does n't deal with the much more important matter of how to handle being fired from a psychological and sociological point of view .
The truth is that getting fired is one of the best things that can ever happen to you , if you look at it the right way .
There is no reason to consider it the end of the world .
It can be the beginning of great things .
The key to understanding this is to zoom in on the nature of a labor contract .
It is an agreement based on the expectation of mutual cooperation that betters the lot of both the employer and the employee .
In a world without scarcity , the employer would rather do all work alone and not have to hire anyone .
This would save in resources , and , in any case , most employers figure that they can do a better job than anyone than they can hire , and , often , they are right .
The very existence of institutions that are larger than sole proprietorships grows out of the need to divide the labor .
Even if the employer is the best sweeper , web developer , accountant , and marketing expert in the world , it is to his advantage to specialize in one area while farming out the other tasks , even if these tasks will not be done as well by others .
Every employer , then , regards the hiring decision with a combination of dread ( no one wants to waste money ! ) and relief ( finally I can get something done around here ! ) .
It is critically important for the employee to understand that he is doing no favors to the employer by working there , nor is the employer to be regarded as a generous distributor of funds , much less someone who is under some positive moral obligation to dish out .
The employee is there because the nature of the world and the ubiquity of the scarcity of time and resources make it necessary .
In order for there to be peace amidst this arrangement , there must be mutual benefit , always .
When that mutual benefit ceases to exist , it is in the interest of both parties to dissolve the relationship .
The employee can leave for greener pastures .
In the same way , the boss can stop paying the employee in exchange for services that he no longer believes are a benefit to the company .
To be fired only means that the employer takes the initiative in ceasing to fund further engagement .
Both or either side of this exchange could be wrong , of course , but all human decision making is speculative , and we can only act on the information we have .
Why would anyone want to hang around at a dinner party at which he is not wanted ?
It 's the same way with a labor contract .
If you are n't wanted , you should walk away and consider yourself better off as a result .
No lawsuits , no complaints , no bitterness , no acts of vengeance .
Just a clean and happy break .
Does n't the reason you are fired matter ?
Not really .
The employer does n't always know the reason .
He just knows it is not working out from his point of view , and he is perfectly within his rights to terminate the prior agreement .
Let me tell a quick story from my own work history .
When I was in clothing sales , I was one of the top - ranked salesmen on the floor , but I did n't always see eye to eye with the owner - boss .
One Christmas season , he told all the salespeople that all alterations had to be promised out three weeks from the date they were sold .
That struck me as outrageous .
Sure enough , within the next hour , I had a customer come in a buy seven pricey suits , on the condition that all alterations were to be done within the week .
Now , I should have gone to the boss and asked him .
He would have said no , I 'm quite sure .
So I did n't : I went ahead and promised the suits out .
At closing time , the boss found the tickets and threw all seven suits at me and demanded to know " who is going to alter these ? "
I said , " I will , " and I promptly hit the sewing machines and began to sew .
I had them all finished by 9 pm that evening .
I brought them into him and said that I would deliver them to the customer personally in the morning .
My boss said , that 's great , and added : " after that , I wo n't need your services anymore . "
Was he wrong or right ?
He was wrong that firing me was good for his business .
But he was right that he could not countenance an insubordinate employee , and just as a tip to the worker : there is no surer way to make yourself unwelcome than to be insubordinate .
Even from a business point of view , he needed a staff that would follow his orders , right or wrong .
Hey , it 's not my style but it was his clothing store , for goodness sake .
( I ended up as a manager in another store and we outcompeted his store in every season that followed . )
Being fired does not mean that your time with the company was a waste .
In the time you were there , both you and your boss benefited in some way .
Because conditions change does n't negate that reality .
The boss gained a worker .
And you gained valuable experience — and one of the most valuable experiences is the shock of being fired .
Sometimes it the best way to get a person 's attention .
We all need improvement , and experiencing outright rejection provides a poignant reminder of this fact , and an impetus to change .
You might feel anger and even hatred .
You might want to curse out your boss .
You might plan a lawsuit ( which seems to be everyone 's first reaction ) .
Instead , you need to do something completely counterintuitive .
You need to thank your boss for having had confidence in you and for giving you the opportunity to work there .
You need to say this as sincerely as you can .
And when you see your boss at the grocery store or sports event in the future , you should bound up to him as if he were an old friend and thank him again .
If you do this , there might come a time in the future — in fact , there certainly will — when this person will be in a position to recommend you for a job .
He is far more likely to do so .
In fact , he might be so impressed at your magnanimity that he will offer you your job back .
You can politely turn him down , if you so wish .
The point is that there is nothing productive about resentment or hate , any more than you should hate the convenience store from which you no longer buy milk .
You once benefited from exchange and you no longer perceive the advantage in doing so .
Big deal .
If it makes it any easier , let us remember that you were most likely paid more than you contributed to the firm .
Wages work this way .
I can recall that I worked with some jerk who refused to straighten inventory in the back room .
" For minimum wage , I wo n't do this . "
But the truth is that he was paid far more than he gave back .
Employers often pay wages in advance of productivity , hoping that they are making some kind of investment in the future .
It is only later that you become productive enough to make it worth it for him , at which point he has to raise your wage in the anticipation of future productivity .
So there is a sense in which everyone is indebted to the employer .
The worst fate to befall the American labor market came after World War II when employees began to think of all jobs as lifetime jobs — the way they are in economically backward and decaying Europe today .
In a free market , we would hop from job to job without any problem .
Employers would freely hire and fire , trying people out the way we try on shoes , and employees would be the same way .
In this way , we are most likely to find the right fit , and our places of work would become less contentious — places of happiness and peace .
Nothing is more absurd than the attempt to restrict the right to fire .
Voluntarism goes both ways .
The employee can leave , and the employer can fire .
Any other system , such as one that would restrict either action , is an act of coercion that diminishes the well - being of both sides .
Thinking of our kids here and their job experiences , we should hope that they get fired from at least one job or several in their early work years .
Being fired reminds us of our obligations , the contractual nature of work , and the need for agreement and voluntarism in all social relations .
The act of getting fired underscores the existence of the freedom of association , which is the key to social peace and a foundation of a growing economy .
Do your part and take it well .
About 1.7 million people die from TB globally each year
Extreme drug resistant TB ( XDR TB ) has been seen worldwide , including in the US , Eastern Europe and Africa , although Western Europe has had no cases .
Dr Paul Nunn , from the WHO , said a failure to correctly implement treatment strategies was to blame .
TB experts have convened in Johannesburg , South Africa , to discuss how to address the problem .
TB presently causes about 1.7 million deaths a year worldwide , but researchers are worried about the emergence of strains that are resistant to drugs .
This is very worrying , especially when mixed with HIV
Dr Paul Nunn , WHO
Drug resistance is caused by poor TB control , through taking the wrong types of drugs for the incorrect duration .
Multi -drug resistant TB ( MDR TB ) , which describes strains of TB that are resistant to at least two of the main first - line TB drugs , is already a growing concern .
Globally , the WHO estimates there are about 425,000 cases of MDR TB a year , mostly occurring in the former Soviet Union , China and India .
Treatment requires the use of second - line drugs , which are more toxic , take longer to work and costly .
But now , according to researchers , an even more deadly form of the bacteria has emerged .
High prevalence
XDR TB is defined as strains that are not only resistant to the front - line drugs , but also three or more of the six classes of second - line drugs .
This , according to Dr Paul Nunn , coordinator of the WHO team at the Stop TB department , makes it virtually untreatable .
A recent survey of 18,000 TB samples by the US - based Centers for Disease Control and the WHO between November 2004 and November 2005 found 20 % of them were multi-drug resistant and a further 2 % were extreme drug resistant .
Further detailed analysis of several countries found the prevalence was even higher .
In the US , 4 % of all MDR TB cases met the criteria for XDR TB ; in South Korea , the figure was 15 % .
In Latvia , and according to Dr Nunn other areas of the Baltics and the former Soviet Union , 19 % of all multi - drug resistant cases were extreme drug resistant too .
Dr Nunn said XDR TB was present across several strains , but added it was not yet clear how transmissible it was or whether it was limited to isolated pockets .
HIV peril
But he warned HIV positive people were at particular risk .
He highlighted a study recently presented at the International Meeting for Aids , held in Toronto .
XDR TB is very serious - we are potentially getting close to a bacteria that we have no tools , no weapons against
Paul Sommerfeld , Stop TB
In Kwazulu - Natal , in South Africa , 53 patients were found with XDR TB .
Of these , 52 died within 25 days , and 44 of the 53 had been tested for HIV and were all found to be HIV positive .
He said XDR TB could have a bigger impact on developing nations , including Africa , because of the prevalence of HIV .
Dr Dunn said : " This is very worrying , especially when mixed with HIV .
" We need to make sure we do the basics properly , in other words , ensuring , and where necessary , supervising that the patient takes every pill for the course of the treatment .
" If you do that , then the rate of development of resistance drops dramatically , even in the context of HIV . "
He added that it was key that new drugs were developed in future .
He said work was underway looking at new drugs , including research into TB vaccines .
The meeting in South Africa will discuss the recent findings and how to curb the growing problem .
Paul Sommerfeld of TB Alert , said : " XDR TB is very serious - we are potentially getting close to a bacteria that we have no tools , no weapons against .
" What this means for the people in southern Africa , who are now becoming susceptible to this where it is appearing , is a likely death sentence .
" For the world as a whole it is potentially extremely worrying that this kind of resistance is appearing .
This is something that I am sure the WHO will be taking very seriously . "
Dem calls for Special Prosecutor to investigate Gonzales ' lies to Congress Nick Juliano and Will Manaker
Published : Tuesday July 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Democratic Congressman called for Alberto Gonzalez 's resignation and said he wants an independent prosecutor to investigate reports that the attorney general misled Congress in denying knowledge of civil rights abuses by the FBI .
" Attorney General Gonzales has shown an apparent reckless disregard for the rule of law and a fundamental lack of respect for the oversight responsibilities of Congress , " said Rep. Jerry Nadler , D - N.Y .
" The man entrusted with enforcing our nation 's laws must also abide by them - and Mr. Gonzales has apparently failed in that duty . "
Tuesday 's Washington
Post reports that Gonzales was given at least a half - dozen reports detailing FBI abuses of power in the three months before testifying to Congress where he sought to renew the Patriot Act .
In front of the Senate Intelligence Committee , on April 27 , 2005 , he claimed he knew of no wrongdoing or abuse of power , and that the Patriot Act was free of problems , despite the reports of numerous violations of the law and FBI protocol .
The report detailed acts of unauthorized surveillance , improper searches , and other procedural and legal breaches of civil rights and privacy laws .
Gonzales was also briefed on the abuse of an anti-terror tool known as the national security letter as early as 2005 , well before the Justice Department 's inspector general made these violations public .
Gonzales also was apparently dishonest when answering questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year about the national security letters , that panel 's chairman said Tuesday .
In written responses to questions from Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , Gonzales said he did not know of the FBI 's misuse of the letters until he saw a draft copy of the inspector general 's report , which was released publicly in March of this year .
 Unfortunately , this Administrations penchant for secrecy makes it difficult to work in a cooperative way .
...
This inconsistency is a disturbing addition to a growing list of misleading answers by the Attorney General to questions from the Judiciary Committee , and it is unacceptable . "
Leahy said in a prepared statement .
When the stinging IG report was issued , Gonzales reacted with surprise , saying , " I was upset when I learned this , as was Director Mueller .
To say that I am concerned about what has been revealed in this report would be an enormous understatement . "
Justice Department officials were quick to say Gonzales ' comments were ' in the context ' of the IG report : " The statements from the attorney general are consistent with statements from other officials at the FBI and the department , " spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said .
He added that many of the violations the FBI disclosed were not legal violations and instead involved procedural safeguards or even typographical errors .
The Post writes that , " Each of the violations cited in the reports copied to Gonzales was serious enough to require notification of the President 's Intelligence Oversight Board , which helps police the government 's surveillance activities .
The format of each memo was similar , and none minced words .
' This enclosure sets forth details of investigative activity which the FBI has determined was conducted contrary to the attorney general 's guidelines for FBI National Security Investigations and Foreign Intelligence Collection and / or laws , executive orders and presidential directives , ' said the April 21 , 2005 , letter to the Intelligence Oversight Board . "
The Post also reports , " Some of the reports describe rules violations that the FBI decided not to report to the intelligence board .
In February 2006 , for example , FBI officials wrote that agents sent a person 's phone records , which they had obtained from a provider under a national security letter , to an outside party .
The mistake was blamed on 'an error in the mail handling . '
When the third party sent the material back , the bureau decided not to report the mistake as a violation . "
" The Attorney General 's resignation is the only step that can help restore our confidence in the Department of Justice , " Nadler added .
" Our democracy is harmed when the Executive so blatantly violates our fundamental freedoms .
However , if the Attorney General resigns , the Bush Administration is not absolved of its sins .
...
It 's clear now that this Justice Department is unable to even abide by the wide latitudes of the Patriot Act and serious change - both in the law and the leadership - is needed . "

I had the privilege of meeting Presidential candidate and former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel at the National Impeachment Summit in New York earlier this year .
At that time , he was considering his position on impeachment , and his campaign said they would inform me of his position as it was formulated .
Today , I spoke with Gravel ’s Press Secretary and received a statement .
He said , “ Senator Gravel does support impeachment in the event that any wrongdoing has occurred at the executive level of President or Vice President .
At this time the senator ’s focus is firmly on the Iraq war , stopping the torture , and bringing the troops home now . ”
Gravel ’s position is further clarified by this statement from his campaign ’s website , “ Senator Gravel supports a congressional inquiry into whether or not George Bush has indeed overstepped his authority as president and broken the law .
The inquiry would focus on the accumulation of any and all evidence that indicates wrongdoing and could then be used in criminal proceedings against the president . ”
These statements were made despite his failure , during the recent presidential debate , to raise his hand when asked if he or any of the other presidential candidates were “ willing to enter into Congressman Kucinich ’s effort to impeach Vice President Cheney . ”
George Bush and Condoleezza Rice have stated that they will ignore the Congress regarding the war , and that they plan on remaining in Iraq through their term in office .
Also , historically it ’s been shown that a President can find funds for war despite a lack of designated war funding from Congress .
It ’s Impeach for Peace ’s position that in light of these facts , the only path towards brining our troops home is through the accountability that is impeachment .
So , I applaud Gravel ’s statements in support of impeachment , and hope that his focus on bringing the troops home leads him to become an even louder proponent of peace through justice .

One of the more famous myths of the space age , the so - called " Face on Mars " , has finally been debunked after new photos clearly showed that it is just a heavily eroded hill .
The European Space Agency 's Mars Express probe , which has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2003 , managed to get a clear look at the hill after being frustrated by dust and haze on earlier passes .
Sadly , the photos show that the kilometre - wide Face and other supposedly artificial structures in Mars ' Cydonia region are just quirks of geology .

Israeli police at Dome of the Rock
The very stones of Jerusalem are political weapons in the age - old struggle for possession of the Holy Land .
And nowhere is more sensitive than the great platform built by King Herod , known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to the Muslims as the Haram al - Sharif , the Noble Sanctuary .
To understand the current row over excavation and repair work just outside one of the gates onto the compound , it is important to know that here history , religion and politics meet .
Nothing in Jerusalem can be understood without all three .
The history
It was where Herod the Great ( ' Great ' because of his buildings ) constructed , or re-constructed , the Second Temple - and where King Solomon had probably built the First Temple , destroyed by the Babylonians .
The Old Testament story of Abraham offering his son Isaac for sacrifice is placed here by tradition .
For the Jews , it was once the centre of their world - and the place to which they always promised themselves in exile that they would return .
Even today , Jews pray at the nearest point they can reach to the Temple Mount , its Western Wall , once known as the Wailing Wall .
Most are content to leave the eventual reconstruction of the temple to the future - and to God .
Religious Jews will not even go onto the Temple Mount for fear of stepping on some holy place .
Christians know it as the temple where Jesus overturned the tables of the moneychangers .
The Romans knew it as a place of Jewish rebellion and , under Titus , demolished it in 70 AD ( the Common Era ) after the Zealots ' revolt , which also saw the siege and fall of Masada .
JERUSALEM HOLY SITE SACRED TO JEWS : Site of first and second Temples and the rock on which Abraham offered his son as a sacrifice .
As the visible remnant of the Temple , the Western Wall is the holiest site in Judaism
SACRED TO MUSLIMS : First direction of prayer for Muslims , site of Prophet Muhammad 's ascent into , home to al - Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock
Guide to holy sites
Where archaeology is politics
Then in 638 , the Muslim army of Omar , Commander of the Faithful , conquered Jerusalem .
There was then built one of the most beautiful edifices in the world , the Dome of the Rock , followed by the al - Aqsa mosque nearby .
The Dome became , in Muslim eyes , holy because they believe that it was from this rocky outcrop that the Prophet Muhammad in a night journey ascended into heaven on his horse Buraq to receive commandments from God .
The al - Aqsa ( " The Furthest " ) was built to commemorate the furthest mosque to which Muhammad states that he travelled from Mecca in his dream .
It has become the third most holy place in Islam , after Mecca and Medina .
Politics
One now has to roll forward until 1967 .
When the Israelis captured the Old City from the Jordanians , the question as to the future of the compound obviously arose .
Political realism prevailed .
A compromise was reached .
Israel allowed the Muslim religious authority known as the Waqf to administer the whole compound .
But the Israelis claimed the right to enter it at will to keep security control .
They enforce this claim regularly .
They do so by entering the compound through a small gate known as the Mougrabi or Moors ' Gate .
The gate
It is this gate that is at the centre of the current controversy .
Because the gate is high up in the wall ( it overlooks the Western Wall , ) it has to be reached by either an earth mound or a walkway .
The Dome , the Western Wall and the bridge to the gate
Last year , the earth mound collapsed after a rainfall .
So a temporary wooden structure was put up .
The current work is designed to replace this with something stronger and more permanent .
This entails removing the remains of the earth mound down to bedrock in order that there can be secure foundations for the new walkway or bridge .
The observer
An independent observer , Father Jerome Murphy - O'Connor , from the French institute the Ecole Biblique in East Jerusalem , said that the work was " completely routine " .
" This work is not inside the Haram .
It is outside , leading to the Moors ' Gate .
The earth ramp fell down and has to be replaced , " Father Murphy - O'Connor , author of an Oxford University guide " The Holy Land " , told me .
" I do not know why the Palestinians have chosen to make an issue out of this .
It is a recognised Jewish area under the arrangements that prevail in the Old City .
" One can contrast this to the extensive excavations just round the corner in a Muslim area where huge pilgrim hostels from the 8th Century were revealed , with no protest .
There has also been no protest over digs at the City of David nearby .
" There is absolutely no danger to the foundations of the al - Aqsa mosque since that is built on the huge Herodian blocks that are still there . "
The reason for the protest does not really have much to do with archaeology in fact .
It is a protest about presence .
The Palestinians and the wider Muslim world have an objection to anything the Israelis do that touches on the Haram .
Such work is seen as symbolising a threat to Palestinian and Muslim identity and a rallying point for Palestinians to express their desire for their own space , their own state .
In this atmosphere , the arguments of the archaeological academics do not carry much force .
The Moors '
Gate is perhaps even more sensitive than other sites , as it is the only gate to the compound for which the Israelis hold the key .
They do so , Father Murphy - O'Connor said , under an agreement reached in 1967 between General Moshe Dayan and the Waqf .
In 1996 , the Israelis tunnelled further along the Western Wall , prompting riots and unrest .
Again , the issue was not so much the actual dig as the concept .
Israeli digs
But it has not only been the Palestinians who have linked archaeology and politics .
Over recent years , Israelis have accused the Waqf of deliberately removing evidence of Jewish remains on the Haram / Temple Mount and dumping them in rubbish fills .
Especially after 1967 , the Israelis , among them the amateur archaeologist ( and illegal hoarder ) Moshe Dayan himself , made a concerted effort to dig into history to provide evidence that the Jews had been there and had a right to be there still .
" They were digging for God and country , " says Father Murphy - O'Connor .
" Though it has to be said that those days are over .
The younger Israeli archaeologists just dig .
They have for example been leading the way in researching the monasteries of the Judean wilderness . "
But in Jerusalem , you cannot " just dig " .
There , every stone counts .

Marine Cpl. Saul Mellado could be back in California , finishing the final months of his enlistment in a safe billet at Camp Pendleton .
Instead , the 23 - year - old naturalized U.S. citizen from Mexico is patrolling these war - torn streets only recently wrested from insurgent control -- and bracing for an expected counteroffensive .
Mellado , a machine - gunner , knows these streets : the adults who eye the Marines with suspicion and the children who beg for candy and water .
He was first dispatched to Ramadi in late 2004 , a deployment during which 15 Marines in his unit -- the 2nd Battalion , 5th Regiment -- died and more than 200 were wounded .
Under Marine Corps rules about “ short - timers , ” Mellado could have skipped this return to Ramadi six weeks ago .
But like 200 other members of the battalion -- a quarter of its number -- he asked to have his enlistment extended .
Unlike a reenlistment , the move earns the Marines no bonus money , no promotion and no promise of a job shift or posting to a favored duty station .

“ For a lot of the guys , this is their first tour , ” Mellado said as his Humvee moved slowly through the rubble - strewn streets .
“ If anything happened to them , and I could have helped them , I could n’t stand that . ”
Mellado ’s wife , Kirsten , is pregnant with their first child , a boy .
Mellado has no plans to take leave to see the birth , and it is unclear whether a webcam will be available so he can see the infant .
“ I ’m here so our sons do n’t have to come here and fight someday , ” he said .
In a teasing , sing - song voice , Lance Cpl. Abraham Saenz , 21 , said : “ He came out here to be with us .
He just could n’t stand to leave his boys behind . ”

Officials say extensions are not uncommon among the Marine Corps ’ 24 battalions , even as some return to Iraq for their third combat tour .
In fact , they say , few records are kept because they are so common .
But Marine generals who review the manpower of all infantry battalions say the 200 from the Two - Five , the most decorated battalion in the Corps , make up the biggest group .
It can be traced to a meeting in Okinawa , Japan , several months ago when the battalion was finishing a phase of its pre-deployment training .
Lt. Col. Craig Kozeniesky , the battalion commander , and Sgt. Maj .
William Jordan , the senior enlisted man , assembled Marines whose enlistments were running short .
Marines who were there do n’t remember that Kozeniesky or Jordan spent much time speaking of the complexities of U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century .
Instead , the two asked the Marines to help the battalion ’s younger members .

“ I just told them : ‘ We ’ve been together this long .
We need you -- the young Marines need you , ’ ” Jordan said .
In an infantry battalion , a sergeant major serves as the embodiment of institutional values to younger “ grunts . ”
At 44 , Jordan has been in the Marine Corps for 27 years .
“ Finally I just told them , ‘ Everybody who is with us , move to the right side of the room , ’ ” Jordan said .
Only a handful stayed put .
About 175 moved immediately to the right side .
“ I was blown away , ” Jordan said .
“ In all my years in the Marine Corps , I never saw anything like it . ”

A decision to extend an enlistment meant putting plans on hold and finding an explanation for spouses and parents who would prefer that their Marines not return to Iraq .
Sgt. Brian Kasher , 22 , of Illinois plans to attend college , but he figures that can wait .
“ I ’m here to teach the younger guys , ” he said .
“ My wife does n’t like it , but she understands it . ”
Once the battalion returned to Camp Pendleton , 25 more Marines , many of whom had not attended the Okinawa meeting , also agreed to extend their enlistments by several months to be part of the deployment .
For Mellado , the decision is connected to his status as an immigrant .
“ I came to America with 10 bucks in my pocket , ” he said as he walked through a marketplace .
“ This is my way of paying back my country for all the good things it has done for me . ”

The Two - Five , whose motto , “ Retreat , Hell , ” stems from the World War I battle at Belleau Wood , has drawn one of the tougher assignments in what remains the toughest city in sprawling Al Anbar province .
Phone service is spotty , sewage runs in many streets , and any sign of local government is minimal .
But Marines say that residents , encouraged by tribal sheiks and imams , have turned against the extremists and , among other things , are pointing out the location of hidden roadside bombs .
“ The last time , it was like the people did n’t want to do anything to help their neighborhoods , ” Mellado said .
“ Now it ’s a big change .
I want to be here to help with that , to help my Marines . ”

How Real Is “ Restless Legs Syndrome ” ?
The first time I saw a TV commercial about Restless Legs Syndrome , I was pretty sure it was a spoof .
I figured I had stumbled across a prime - time Saturday Night Live special and was seeing a well - done fake ad .
It was pretty funny , I thought — Restless Legs Syndrome , ha !
Who thinks of this stuff ?
Of course , it turned out to not be a joke at all , but rather a pharmaceutical ad — for Requip , I think .
And then I thought , Now this is what Direct - to - Consumer advertising is made for .
You make up a disorder , give it an easygoing name , and voila : drug sales .
Oh , cynical me .
Writing in the New York Times , Nicholas Wade reports that researchers in Germany and Iceland have identified a genetic link to the condition , which “ should help scientists understand the biological basis of the disorder . ”
Not everyone is yet persuaded .
Wade cites a recent report in the journal PLoS Medicine by two Dartmouth researchers , Steven Woloshin and Lisa Schwartz , called “ Giving Legs to Restless Legs : A Case Study of How the Media Helps Make People Sick . ”
These skeptics ,
Wade writes , “ argued that its prevalence had been exaggerated by pharmaceutical companies and uncritical newspaper articles , and that giving people diagnoses and powerful drugs were serious downsides of defining the elusive syndrome too broadly . ”
Here is the lead of their report :
Life can be hard .
Sometimes you feel sad or distracted or anxious .
Or maybe you feel a compelling urge to move your legs .
But does that mean you are sick ?
Does it mean you need medication ?
Maybe , maybe not .
For some people , symptoms are severe enough to be disabling .
But for many others with milder problems , these “ symptoms ” are just the transient experiences of everyday life .
Helping sick people get treatment is a good thing .
Convincing healthy people that they are sick is not .
Sick people stand to benefit from treatment , but healthy people may only get hurt : they get labeled “ sick , ” may become anxious about their condition , and , if they are treated , may experience side effects that overwhelm any potential benefit .
When asked to comment on this newest genetic finding , Woloshin stuck to his guns , telling Wade he “ would n’t change a thing ” in his PLoS Medicine article .
Which makes it sound as if Woloshin still pretty much thinks of Restless Legs Syndrome as , well , a joke .
The victims included women , children and a cleric as well as 20 suspected Taliban militants , according to Mohammad Hussein Andiwal , the Helmand province police chief .
The air strike - which happened late yesterday - was launched in response to an attack on police posts near the town of Gereshk by militants .
It killed 25 civilians including nine women , three babies and the mullah of a local mosque , Mr Andiwal said .
In a statement , Nato said a compound " assessed to have been occupied by up to 30 insurgent fighters , most of whom were killed in the engagement " , had been attacked .
" We are concerned about reports that some civilians may have lost their lives during this attack , " Lieutenant Colonel Mike Smith , a Nato spokesman , said .
However , he blamed the deaths on Taliban fighters for sheltering among civilians .
" It was the insurgents who initiated this attack , and in choosing to conduct such attacks in this location and at this time , the risk to civilians was probably deliberate , " he added .
" It is this irresponsible action that may have led to casualties . "
There has been increasing anger among Afghans about the number of civilian deaths that have resulted from international military operations .
According to the Associated Press news agency , the latest deaths - if confirmed - will bring the number of civilians killed in NATO or US - led military operations this year to 177 .
Among these were seven children who died in a US air strike on Sunday .
A total of 169 civilians have been killed in militant attacks this year , including a recent series of suicide bombings .
Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , has faced public protests over the issue .
In an interview with the BBC yesterday , Mr Karzai criticised the rising toll from foreign troop operations .
" This is a suffering that increasingly is becoming difficult for us to accept or understand , " he said .
However , the new British ambassador to Kabul this week insisted foreign troops were popular among a civilian population wary of a return to Taliban rule .
" Mistakes have been made .
I know that , we all know that , we regret them deeply , " Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles told the BBC on Wednesday .
" But the Taliban are responsible for five times as many civilian casualties as the coalition forces here . "
People 's main concern was " not about us staying .
It 's about us going " , he added .
Nato has also acknowledged that some civilians died in a three - day battle with Taliban fighters in the central Uruzgan province .
" Some may have been killed at the hands of the Taliban , some may have been caught in crossfire and some may have died in airstrikes against enemy positions , " Lt Col Smith said .
Imagine a future in which wireless power transfer is feasible : cell phones , household robots , mp3 players , laptop computers and other portable electronics capable of charging themselves without ever being plugged in , freeing us from that final , ubiquitous power wire .
Some of these devices might not even need their bulky batteries to operate .
A team from MIT 's Department of Physics , Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , and Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies ( ISN ) has experimentally demonstrated an important step toward accomplishing this vision of the future .
The team members are Andre Kurs , Aristeidis Karalis , Robert Moffatt , Prof. Peter Fisher , and Prof. John Joannopoulos ( Francis Wright Davis Chair and director of ISN ) , led by Prof. Marin Soljacic .
Realizing their recent theoretical prediction , they were able to light a 60 W light bulb from a power source seven feet ( more than two meters ) away ; there was no physical connection between the source and the appliance .
The MIT team refers to its concept as " WiTricity " ( as in wireless electricity ) .
The work will be reported in the June 7 issue of Science Express , the advance online publication of the journal Science .
Late - night beeps
The story starts one late night a few years ago , with Soljacic ( pronounced Soul - ya - cheech ) standing in his pajamas , staring at his cell phone on the kitchen counter .
" It was probably the sixth time that month that I was awakened by my cell phone beeping to let me know that I had forgotten to charge it .
It occurred to me that it would be so great if the thing took care of its own charging . "
To make this possible , one would have to have a way to transmit power wirelessly , so Soljacic started thinking about which physical phenomena could help make this wish a reality .
Radiation methods
Various methods of transmitting power wirelessly have been known for centuries .
Perhaps the best known example is electromagnetic radiation , such as radio waves .
While such radiation is excellent for wireless transmission of information , it is not feasible to use it for power transmission .
Since radiation spreads in all directions , a vast majority of power would end up being wasted into free space .
One can envision using directed electromagnetic radiation , such as lasers , but this is not very practical and can even be dangerous .
It requires an uninterrupted line of sight between the source and the device , as well as a sophisticated tracking mechanism when the device is mobile .
The key : Magnetically coupled resonance
In contrast , WiTricity is based on using coupled resonant objects .
Two resonant objects of the same resonant frequency tend to exchange energy efficiently , while interacting weakly with extraneous off - resonant objects .
A child on a swing is a good example of this .
A swing is a type of mechanical resonance , so only when the child pumps her legs at the natural frequency of the swing is she able to impart substantial energy .
Another example involves acoustic resonances : Imagine a room with 100 identical wine glasses , each filled with wine up to a different level , so they all have different resonant frequencies .
If an opera singer sings a sufficiently loud single note inside the room , a glass of the corresponding frequency might accumulate sufficient energy to even explode , while not influencing the other glasses .
In any system of coupled resonators there often exists a so - called " strongly coupled " regime of operation .
If one ensures to operate in that regime in a given system , the energy transfer can be very efficient .
While these considerations are universal , applying to all kinds of resonances ( e.g. , acoustic , mechanical , electromagnetic , etc. ) , the MIT team focused on one particular type : magnetically coupled resonators .
The team explored a system of two electromagnetic resonators coupled mostly through their magnetic fields ; they were able to identify the strongly coupled regime in this system , even when the distance between them was several times larger than the sizes of the resonant objects .
This way , efficient power transfer was enabled .
Magnetic coupling is particularly suitable for everyday applications because most common materials interact only very weakly with magnetic fields , so interactions with extraneous environmental objects are suppressed even further .
" The fact that magnetic fields interact so weakly with biological organisms is also important for safety considerations , " Kurs , a graduate student in physics , points out .
The investigated design consists of two copper coils , each a self - resonant system .
One of the coils , attached to the power source , is the sending unit .
Instead of irradiating the environment with electromagnetic waves , it fills the space around it with a non-radiative magnetic field oscillating at MHz frequencies .
The non-radiative field mediates the power exchange with the other coil ( the receiving unit ) , which is specially designed to resonate with the field .
The resonant nature of the process ensures the strong interaction between the sending unit and the receiving unit , while the interaction with the rest of the environment is weak .
Moffatt , an MIT undergraduate in physics , explains : " The crucial advantage of using the non-radiative field lies in the fact that most of the power not picked up by the receiving coil remains bound to the vicinity of the sending unit , instead of being radiated into the environment and lost . "
With such a design , power transfer has a limited range , and the range would be shorter for smaller - size receivers .
Still , for laptop - sized coils , power levels more than sufficient to run a laptop can be transferred over room - sized distances nearly omni-directionally and efficiently , irrespective of the geometry of the surrounding space , even when environmental objects completely obstruct the line - of - sight between the two coils .
Fisher points out : " As long as the laptop is in a room equipped with a source of such wireless power , it would charge automatically , without having to be plugged in .
In fact , it would not even need a battery to operate inside of such a room . "
In the long run , this could reduce our society 's dependence on batteries , which are currently heavy and expensive .
At first glance , such a power transfer is reminiscent of relatively commonplace magnetic induction , such as is used in power transformers , which contain coils that transmit power to each other over very short distances .
An electric current running in a sending coil induces another current in a receiving coil .
The two coils are very close , but they do not touch .
However , this behavior changes dramatically when the distance between the coils is increased .
As Karalis , a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science , points out , " Here is where the magic of the resonant coupling comes about .
The usual non-resonant magnetic induction would be almost 1 million times less efficient in this particular system . "
Old physics , new demand
WiTricity is rooted in such well - known laws of physics that it makes one wonder why no one thought of it before .
" In the past , there was no great demand for such a system , so people did not have a strong motivation to look into it , " points out Joannopoulos , adding , " Over the past several years , portable electronic devices , such as laptops , cell phones , iPods and even household robots have become widespread , all of which require batteries that need to be recharged often . "
As for what the future holds , Soljacic adds , " Once , when my son was about three years old , we visited his grandparents ' house .
They had a 20 - year - old phone and my son picked up the handset , asking , ' Dad , why is this phone attached with a cord to the wall ? '
That is the mindset of a child growing up in a wireless world .
My best response was , ' It is strange and awkward , is n't it ?
Hopefully , we will be getting rid of some more wires , and also batteries , soon . ' "

MEXICO CITY
NOWHERE in the United States Constitution is there any mention of Miss U.S.A .
She has no authority to declare war .
She does not build border walls or round up undocumented immigrants .
Those things are left to others , none of whom wear a sash .
But that fact seemed to get lost during the recent Miss Universe pageant , when Mexicans greeted Rachel Smith , Miss U.S.A. , with one chorus after another of boos .
Pageant officials said Ms. Smith , 22 , was rattled by the denunciations , which echoed other booing she had received during her monthlong stay in Mexico , notably when she showed off a sleek , white Elvis outfit as her national costume on a runway on one of Mexico City ’s grand avenues .
On pageant night , the wrath continued .
As Ms. Smith was chosen for the final five , despite an awful fall in her evening dress , the crowd grew more boisterous , especially because Miss Mexico , Rosa María Ojeda Cuen , had been eliminated .
Donald Trump , who owns the pageant , said he was nervous the audience might storm the stage .
“ The level of hostility was amazing , ” he said , comparing it to the fury on display at the end of a disputed prizefight .
Mario López , the TV actor who was the show ’s host , did his best to calm the crowd during a commercial break .
“ I said in Spanish : ‘ Hey , listen , Mexico , the world is watching .
Let ’s show the world we ’re really good hosts , ’ ” he recalled .

Something has gone very wrong with the United States patent system .
Americans think of the granting of patents as a benevolent process that lets inventors enjoy the fruits of their hard work and innovations .
But times have changed .
The definition of what is patentable has slowly evolved to include business practices and broad ideas .
The fact that the Smucker 's company went to court over patents on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches might have provoked chuckles .
But it became a symbol of a system gone awry .
Technological advances raise new questions with each passing year .
Should genes be patentable ?
What about life forms ?
The high - tech and pharmaceutical industries find themselves at odds on reform because patents affect their businesses so differently .
The understaffed Patent and Trademark Office needs to draw the line between a real innovation and an obvious concept that should be freely available as a building block for future generations of creative thinkers .
Meanwhile , profiteers , including lawyers and hedge funds , have turned the very purpose of patent rights -- to encourage people to invent and produce -- on its head , using them to tax , blackmail and even shut down productive companies unless they pay high enough ransoms .
These so - called patent trolls have emerged as the villains in this intellectual property debate .
The possibility of this sort of abuse is inherent in the concept of patents , which in this country allow no one to produce or sell a patented product for up to 20 years without a license from the patent holder .
Our nation 's founders considered intellectual property important enough to include in the Constitution , but did not establish the system for the sake of the inventor .
It exists for the sake of society , or , as it says in the Constitution , " to promote the progress of science and the useful arts . "
There appears to be no respite in the pace or impact of the growing burden of mental ill health on individuals and the nation as a whole .
One in four people is likely to experience a mental illness at some point in their life , and the costs of mental ill health to the UK economy are now approaching £ 100 bn a year .
Mental health problems are believed to be the result of a combination of factors , including age , genetics and environmental factors .
One of the most obvious , yet under - recognised factors in the development of major trends in mental health is the role of nutrition .
But the body of evidence linking diet and mental health is growing at a rapid pace .
As well as its impact on short and long - term mental health , the evidence indicates that food could play an important contributing role in the development , management and prevention of specific mental health problems such as depression , schizophrenia , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and Alzheimer 's disease .
The increasing incidence of mental ill health echoes changes in food production in the UK .
The last 50 years have witnessed significant changes to the way food is produced and manufactured .
The proliferation of industrialised farming has introduced higher levels and different types of fat into our diet .
Chickens now reach their slaughter weight twice as fast as they did 30 years ago , which has changed the nutritional profile of the meat .
Whereas a chicken carcass used to be 2 % fat , it has now risen to 22 % .
Also , the diet fed to chickens has changed , which has reduced omega - 3 fatty acids and increased omega - 6 fatty acids in chicken meat .
Similarly , the diet fed to farmed fish is changing the ratio of fatty acids in the fish we eat .
As a result , the population 's intake of omega - 3 fatty acids has decreased whilst the consumption of omega - 6 fatty acids has increased .
This unequal intake combined with a lack of vitamins and minerals has been linked depression , concentration and memory problems .
At the same time , the UK population is consuming less nutritious , fresh produce and more saturated fats and sugars .
Over the last 60 years there has been a 34 % decline in UK vegetable consumption with currently only 13 % of men and 15 % of women now eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables per day .
New substances , such as pesticides , additives and trans - fats have been introduced to our diets .
Alone and together , these substances can prevent the brain from functioning effectively .
A poll carried out by the Mental Health Foundation found that :
· Women eat healthy foods , including fresh vegetables , fruit or fruit juice and meals made from scratch , more often than men , who tend to eat more takeaways and ready meals .
· Two - thirds of those who do not have daily mental health problems eat fresh fruit , vegetables or juice every day , compared with less than half of those who do report daily mental health problems .
· Younger people are more likely than older people to experience daily mental health problems .
Foods can have an immediate and lasting effect upon a person 's mental health and behaviour because of the way they affect the structure and function of the brain .
While most people are aware of how diet affects their physical health , fewer understand that the brain , as an organ , is affected by the foods they eat , and how this has a knock on effect on their mental health .
While some foods damage the brain by releasing toxins or oxidants that harm healthy brain cells , there are many more nutrients that serve the brain without deception or damage , which can improve mood and mental wellbeing .
Dietary interventions may hold the key to a number of the mental health challenges our society is facing .
Yet little investment is being laid out to develop this knowledge , and only a tiny - but growing - number of professionals are putting it to effective use .
In May 2005 , a team at the Doncaster and South Humber NHS trust was set up to help young people experiencing their first episode of psychosis .
The team helps the young people by improving their nutrition , with the aim of preventing the physical complications of schizophrenia and improving their mental state .
All young people are given a full nutritional assessment and analysis .
Where a person has nutritional deficiencies in their diet , they are given omega - 3 fatty acids , multivitamins and mineral supplements .
Those with poor diets are advised to reduce their intake of saturated fat and sugar .
Young people are then encouraged to eat a balanced diet , to reduce the need for supplements and follow an exercise programme .
Growing evidence indicates the benefits of dietary interventions to support a person 's recovery from mental health problems .
But financial investment is now needed to further this understanding and develop appropriate interventions to help people manage mental health problems including depression , dementia , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia .
The Mental Health Foundation has joined forces with the Sustain , the alliance for food and farming to raise awareness of the links between nutrition and mental health .
We are calling on the government to recognise these links and to increase financial and political support to ensure that a variety of nutrient - rich foods are available for people to buy in the UK .
We are also hoping that the government will improve the quality of food provided to people with mental health problems , with appropriate support and guidance for mental health service providers .

Some of Microsoft ’s most important customers are n’t happy with the battery life offered by notebooks running Windows Vista .
“ It ’s a little scary , ” said John Wozniak , a distinguished technologist in Hewlett - Packard ’s notebook engineering department , referring to the work HP needed to do on making Windows Vista more suitable for notebooks .
Vista , while touted as having improved power management capabilities that would make it easier for users to extend battery life , is n’t to some living up to that promise .
The main culprit appears to be the Aero Glass interface , a spiffy new user interface that makes Vista more pleasing to the eye with transparent windows and animated transitions when moving from one application to another .
When Aero is turned off , battery life is equal to or better than Windows XP systems .
But with it turned on , battery life suffers compared with Windows XP .
Microsoft made some important changes in Vista that do improve some aspects of battery life , such as smarter hibernation modes that override applications that want to keep running , and simpler options for choosing a power management setting .
But laptop users who spent extra money on powerful laptops to handle the graphics requirements of Vista and the Aero interface are forced to run the aesthetic equivalent of Vista Basic , the low - cost version of Vista , if they care about battery life .
– John Wozniak ,
technologist , Hewlett - Packard
“ The potential is there to do some good things , the bad thing is that it comes with the canned settings . ”
HP decided it was n’t going to use the power management settings that shipped with Vista , Wozniak said .
The company came up with its own set of power management settings for Vista laptops , allowing users to select different power settings , such as “ power saver ” or “ high performance , ” that strike a balance between processing power and battery life .
Lenovo is likewise using its own power management technologies honed over several years , said Howard Locker , director of new technology at Lenovo .
“ They ’ve really made it complex from a power management standpoint , ” Wozniak said .
“ The potential is there to do some good things , the bad thing is that it comes with the canned settings … and we did n’t like any of them . ”
Reports that Vista was an energy hog started to surface during beta testing last year .
At the time , Microsoft said many of the problems would be cleared up by the time the operating system launched .
Of course , this is n’t a new issue when it comes to operating system changeovers , said Richard Shim , an analyst with IDC .
“ When you look at a new operating system , battery life tends to be worse .
When Windows XP came out , that was true , and when Windows 98 came out , that was true . ”
The difference this time around is that notebooks are “ the growth engine for industry , ” Shim said .
Notebook PCs now account for more than half of all retail PC sales and are projected to become the majority for the whole market by the end of the decade .
But battery life problems continue to rankle notebook users .
As blogger Rob Bushway of Tablet PC site Gottabemobile.com put it , “ when a consumer has to buy an extended battery to get what they use ( d ) to get out of a standard battery , something is really wrong . ”
More than one company other than HP has acknowledged the demand that Vista and the Aero interface put on a notebook PC running off its battery .
“ Vista is consuming more power than Windows XP , but we have been very focused on introducing more power - efficient technologies , ” said Bahr Mahony , director of product marketing for Advanced Micro Devices ’ mobile product division .
Most attribute that power use to Aero .
“ In ( Aero ) mode , you will drain the battery faster , but you get something in return because it ’s cool and nice looking , ” Lenovo ’s Locker said .
The Aero interface is automatically disabled when users put their Vista notebooks into the “ power - saving ” profile , one of three new simplified power - management states .
While that makes for an arguably duller experience , Microsoft said it commissioned a study ( click here for PDF ) that found no difference in “ responsiveness , ” or application load time , between a notebook with Aero disabled versus one running the fancy graphics : implying that Aero does n’t put too much of a load on the system .
Now on News.com
But the notebook and Tablet PC used in Principled Technologies ’ test had the power management setting on “ high - performance ” when testing Aero ’s performance .
At that setting , the notebook wo n’t ever compromise performance to preserve battery life , so responsiveness is n’t an issue .
Microsoft is n’t deterred by HP ’s decisions and other criticism .
“ We actively encourage ( PC companies ) to customize the default power profiles so that users get the most out of their hardware , ” Microsoft said in a statement .
A more definitive statement on Windows Vista and battery life should surface soon , with Intel scheduled to release new chips for notebooks next week at the launch event for the next generation of its Centrino technology .
Also , Bapco , an industry benchmarking organization , is expected to soon release the MobileMark 2007 benchmark .
Microsoft , for its part , will likely have to improve Vista ’s battery life performance over time through the release of service packs and other tweaks , Shim said .
“ The ( PC companies ) are getting pressure from consumers –who are the notebook adopters –who are saying their number one priority on a notebook is battery life . ”

Mr ElBaradei has faced criticism from Europe and the US
Mr ElBaradei said he wanted to prevent Iran from enriching uranium on an industrial scale and to use talks to ease tensions over its nuclear work .
The US says it will press for new sanctions on Iran over its continued failure to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran denies US claims that its nuclear programme has a military aspect .
The UN's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , said in a report on Wednesday that Tehran was stepping up enrichment and obstructing inspections .
The US described the report as " a laundry list of Iran 's continued defiance of the international community " .
Even if Iran wanted to go for a nuclear weapon , it would not be before the end of this decade or sometime in the middle of the next decade
Mohamed ElBaradei
UN lists Iran defiance ' Third way ' on Iran issue ?
But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran would not be deterred from pursuing its nuclear goals .
" The enemies want us to surrender so that Iran wo n't have anything to say in the world , " Mr Ahmadinejad said on Thursday .
" With the backing of the Iranian nation we are not afraid of the enemies ' ... psychological warfare and with God 's help we have come close to our ultimate goals , " he said .
UN pressure
Mr ElBaradei addressed a joint US - Russian conference on nuclear proliferation in Luxembourg on Thursday .
" Even if Iran wanted to go for a nuclear weapon , it would not be before the end of this decade or sometime in the middle of the next decade , " he said , adding that this estimate echoed the view of US intelligence agency , the CIA .
The US and its European allies have rejected Mr ElBaradei 's suggestion that Iran be allowed to keep part of its enrichment programme .
In March , the UN Security Council imposed a second round of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment , prompting Tehran to limit its co-operation with the IAEA .
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says Washington may have some difficulty in persuading all members of the UN Security Council to impose further sanctions .
IAEA inspectors still regularly visit Iran 's atomic facilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Iran has denied hindering the IAEA and says it will " continue to co-operate " .
Revision tracking of functions is more important than file names .
With git , and bazaar two differences are that one tracks code moves fairly well and one tracks file moves well .
One was originally written mostly by someone managing a code base , and the other is originally written by a company doing an operating system .
So you can see their priorities - one has lots of code it cares more about , and the other has a lot of files it cares more about .
( There are quite a few other priorities and features that each have ) .
I guess tracking the code itself is much more important than tracking file renames - for me .
Much more useful anyway .
However * both * are important parts of revision control .
Many times during development I might cut a function / class from one file and move it into another .
I can't get reports of this information in a meaningful way with bazaar ( or can I ? ) .
Also I might accidentally move a file with the command line tools , change it , then add it in again to the revision control system .
This is because I forget that I need to use the revision controls system of moves .
A system that can automatically track * code * moving around , then can see that a file has been moved / renamed .
It shows you that the code has moved , which is often more important , than showing you the file names have moved .
However the system that can track file renames * when you tell it * can not automatically see that I moved a function from one file to another .
Or see that I split a big file of code into separate pieces - that is I moved one file into five .
Well it could , and I think that 's important .
I often care about what has changed at a module level , but more often care about what has changed at a class level , or a at the function level .
I even care about change sets at the module , package , and application levels .
Full text search could help dramatically here , however having the tools built into the revision control system is much handier - and probably quicker .
So I think you should be able to see that the ' bazaar is lossless ' argument is not true ... or is it ?
I think bazaar is still lossless , it just does n't let you get at all that information yet - just the data .
In the future it would be possible given a bazaar tree to find where a function has lived , no matter which file it has lived in .
Caring about what is in the files , is more important than caring about the files themselves .
So these tools that work with revision control systems should be able to say things like
' svn log my_superfunction '
and see a log of changes to my_superfunction no matter where it lives .
Perhaps giving it a hint of which file to look in , or even provide the full text of the current function .
However would this mean that the revision control system would need to know more about the content it is storing ?
I think a lot of it could be generalised , like ' this is a block of code ' could be defined as a C++ class , a C function , or a python function .
These tools could probably even be built outside of revision control systems .
There 's probably some tool that can be used for this already ?
What about the case where code moves from one repository to another ?
This is a common case in a lot of projects .
It 'd be nice to be able to tell your RCS that you copied this function from project X with the repository XX .
Then have your same commands for looking at history automatically work .
I think bazaar - with launch pad - is interested in doing this type of stuff , and probably GIT too .
I think with bazaar you can already do this - tell it you 're merging from a separate svn repository , and it'll copy all of the history .
Well , for files anyway , not sure about separate functions .
Mostly when you move code from one project to the other , the file names will not be the same .
It 's all very interesting reading about these different systems , and the thought that goes into them .
Mostly though , I 'll probably still just use add del update and commit - with hopefully a bit more of push , and merge .
I 'm using bazaar more and more now , along with svn too .
YOUNG men who speed do so because they have a small penis - or so the new RTA road safety campaign implies .
Ads from the $ 1.9 million campaign - which targets speeding among 17 - to 25 - year - olds - aired for the first time on TV last night .
They show onlookers who see speeding male drivers wiggling their pinkie fingers .
The gesture represents a small penis in youth culture , but even an elderly woman employs it .

Agents Hit the Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Shortly After the L.A. City Council Bars New Facilities for a Year to Write Better Regulations .
The gap between state and federal drug laws became apparent again Wednesday when federal agents raided 10 local medical marijuana facilities only minutes after the Los Angeles City Council placed a moratorium on new facilities so rules could be drafted to better regulate them .
The ban is for one year , but the council can extend it for another year .
The city move was widely applauded by medical marijuana activists who believe that having a solid set of rules will help prevent future city crackdowns and ensure that dispensaries remain open .
But state or local laws have no effect on federal activities .
Although voters in California approved the use of medical marijuana in 1996 and said users should not be subject to criminal prosecution , it remains illegal under federal law to possess , sell or cultivate marijuana and neither the federal nor state courts have resolved the matter .
Drug Enforcement Administration officers served a search warrant on facilities across Los Angeles County , including the California Patients Group in Hollywood , said DEA spokeswoman Sarah Pullen .
The timing of the raid was not intended to coincide with the council vote , she said .
" These are ongoing enforcement operations .
As far as we know , we 've been planning this for some time , " Pullen said .
The Los Angeles Police Department was on hand to patrol the perimeter , as it often does as a courtesy to federal agencies .
LAPD officers arrested five people demonstrating outside the California Patients Group dispensary , Lt. Ruben De La Torre said .
Four of the arrests were for blocking a DEA vehicle and failing to comply with orders from a police officer to move .
The other arrest was for vandalizing a police car .
Don Duncan , operator of the Hollywood dispensary , was the first activist to testify at Wednesday 's council meeting .
He also is a board member of Americans for Safe Access , a pro-medical marijuana group .
" It 's disgusting that sick people would be subjected to this right here in Los Angeles , " Duncan said .
Pullen said that although medical marijuana was legalized by state voters , the DEA has been enforcing federal laws .
The agency has ramped up efforts recently because the number of dispensaries has grown to more than 400 in Los Angeles County and the surrounding area , she said .
The DEA and other agencies earlier this month issued indictments against six men , alleging that they participated in selling marijuana at dispensaries throughout the state , including two such stores in West Hollywood .
In response to a request from the council , the office of City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo reported earlier this year that at least 98 dispensaries are in Los Angeles , although some activists believe there are more .
The report also found that 12 dispensaries were near schools or day - care centers .
City Councilman Dennis Zine said the temporary ban was designed to protect patients ' rights while drawing up rules to protect communities where dispensaries are located .
Several dozen medical marijuana activists attended the council meeting to support the temporary ban .
No one spoke against it .
Activist Sarah Armstrong said that she often has to travel from her home in Ventura County to Los Angeles to obtain medical marijuana to help relieve pain from arthritis she said was the result of a 1989 car crash .
Cities and police agencies in Ventura County and others in Southern California have been far less tolerant of the dispensaries , which is why most in the region are in L.A. County .

Top 10 Emerging Environmental Technologies
The big Blue Marble , Earth , as seen from space .

Wasteful energy policies , overuse of resources , water supply shortages , global climate change , and deforestation are just some of the issues experts say need to be addressed for humans to achieve sustainable living on this planet .
By the year 2025 , an additional 2.9 billion people will strain tightening water supplies , and the world \'s energy needs will go up 60 percent by 2030 , according to the United Nations .
LiveScience looks at 10 technologies - some old , some new , some a bit offbeat - that might help make the future a little brighter .
Make Oil from Just about Anything

Any carbon - based waste , from turkey guts to used tires , can , by adding sufficient heat and pressure , be turned into oil through a process called thermo- depolymerization ,
This is very similar to how nature produces oil , but with this technology , the process is expedited by millions of years to achieve the same byproduct .
Proponents of this technology claim that a ton of turkey waste can cough up about 600 pounds of petroleum .
Remove the Salt

According to the United Nations , water supply shortages will affect billions of people by the middle of this century .
Desalination , basically removing the salt and minerals out of seawater , is one way to provide potable water in parts of the world where supplies are limited .
The problem with this technology is that it is expensive and uses a lot of energy .
Scientists are working toward better processes where inexpensive fuels can heat and evaporate the water before running it through membranes with microscopic pores to increase efficiency .
The ' H ' Power

Hydrogen fuel cell usage has been touted as a pollution - free alternative to using fossil fuels .
They make water by combining hydrogen and oxygen .
In the process , they generate electricity .
The problem with fuel cells is obtaining the hydrogen .
Molecules such as water and alcohol have to be processed to extract hydrogen to feed into a fuel cell .
Some of these processes require the using other energy sources , which then defeat the advantages of this " clean " fuel .
Most recently , scientists have come up with ways to power laptops and small devices with fuel cells , and some car companies are promising that soon we 'll be seeing cars that emit nothing but clean water .
The promise of a " hydrogen economy , " however , is not one that all experts agree will ever be realized .
The image shows the Chevy Equinox Fuel cell , which runs on hydrogen and emits only water .
Sunny New Ideas

The sun 's energy , which hits Earth in the form of photons , can be converted into electricity or heat .
Solar collectors come in many different forms and are already used successfully by energy companies and individual homeowners .
The two widely known types of solar collectors are solar cells and solar thermal collectors .
But researchers are pushing the limits to more efficiently convert this energy by concentrating solar power by using mirrors and parabolic dishes .
Part of the challenge for employing solar power involves motivation and incentives from governments .
In January , the state of California approved a comprehensive program that provides incentives toward solar development .
Arizona , on the other hand , has ample sunshine but has not made solar energy a priority .
In fact in some planned communities it is downright discouraged by strict rules of aesthetics .
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
Three Energy Islands are shown connected in this artist rendering .

The biggest solar collector on Earth is our ocean mass .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , the oceans absorb enough heat from the sun to equal the thermal energy contained in 250 billion barrels of oil each day .
The U.S. consumes about 7.5 billion barrels a year .
OTEC technologies convert the thermal energy contained in the oceans and turn it into electricity by using the temperature difference between the water 's surface , which is heated , and the cold of the ocean 's bottom .
This difference in temperature can operate turbines that can drive generators .
The major shortcoming of this technology is that it 's still not efficient enough to be used as a major mechanism for generating power .
Harness Waves and Tides

The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the Earth 's surface .
Waves contain an abundance of energy that could be directed to turbines , which can then turn this mechanical power into electrical .
The obstacle to using this energy source has been the difficulty in harnessing it .
Sometimes the waves are too small to generate sufficient power .
The trick is to be able to store the energy when enough mechanical power is generated .
New York City 's East River is now in the process of becoming the test bed for six tide - powered turbines , and Portugal 's reliance on waves in a new project is expected to produce enough power for more than 1,500 homes .
Here the Wavebob , a buoy system capable of capturing the ocean 's power in the form of offshore swells is pictured .
Plant Your Roof
Chicago 's City Hall got a green roof in 2001 .
The project was designed to test various concepts and methods and to test the benefits .

It 's a wonder that this concept attributed to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , one of Seven Wonders of the World , did n't catch on sooner in the modern world .
Legend has it that the roofs , balconies , and terraces of the royal palace of Babylon were turned into gardens by the king 's order to cheer up one of his wives .
Roof gardens help absorb heat , reduce the carbon dioxide impact by taking up CO2 and giving off oxygen , absorb storm water , and reduce summer air conditioning usage .
Ultimately , the technique could lessen the " heat island " effect that occurs in urban centers .
Butterflies and songbirds could also start frequenting urban garden roofs , and like the king 's wife , could even cheer up the inhabitants of the building .
Here , a green roof is tested at Chicago 's City Hall .
Let Plants and Microbes Clean Up After Us

Bioremediation uses microbes and plants to clean up contamination .
Examples include the cleanup of nitrates in contaminated water with the help of microbes , and using plants to uptake arsenic from contaminated soil ( like the Arabidopsis in the image above ) , in a process known as phytoremediation .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has used it to clean up several sites .
Often , native plant species can be used for site cleanup , which are advantageous because in most cases they do n't require pesticides or watering .
In other cases scientists are trying to genetically modify the plants to take up contaminants in their roots and transport it all the way to the leaves for easy harvesting .
Bury The Bad Stuff
Surprise Increase in Global Carbon Dioxide Out
Carbon dioxide is the most prominent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming .
According to the Energy Information Administration , by the year 2030 we will be emitting close to 8,000 million metric tons of CO2 .
Some experts say it 's impossible to curb the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere and that we just have to find ways to dispose of the gas .
One suggested method is to inject it into the ground before it gets a chance to reach the atmosphere .
After the CO2 is separated from other emission gases , it can be buried in abandoned oil wells , saline reservoirs , and rocks .
While this sounds great , scientists are not sure whether the injected gas will stay underground and what the long - term effects are , and the costs of separation and burying are still far too high to consider this technology as a practical short - term solution .
Make Paper Obsolete

Imagine curling up on the couch with the morning paper and then using the same sheet of paper to read the latest novel by your favorite author .
That 's one possibility of electronic paper , a flexible display that looks very much like real paper but can be reused over and over .
The display contains many tiny microcapsules filled with particles that carry electric charges bonded to a steel foil .
Each microcapsule has white and black particles that are associated with either a positive or negative charge .
Depending on which charge is applied ; the black or white particles surface displaying different patterns .
In the United States alone , more than 55 million newspapers are sold each weekday .
WASHINGTON  Colin Powell , who only a decade ago was being discussed as a possible Republican presidential nominee and who more recently served as President Bush 's first secretary of state , is advising a Democratic presidential candidate , Senator Obama of Illinois .
Click Image to Enlarge Brendan Smialowski / AP / Meet The Press Colin Powell On NBC's ' Meet the Press ' yesterday .
Powell is advising a Democratic presidential candidate , Senator Obama of Illinois .
Appearing on NBC's " Meet the Press " yesterday , Mr. Powell said it was " too soon " to say whether he would endorse the Republican nominee for president , and he added that he is reserving judgment for now .
" I 've been around this town a long time , and I know everybody who is running for office , " Mr. Powell said .
" And I make myself available to talk about foreign policy matters and military matters with whoever wishes to chat with me . "
Those words appear to represent an extraordinary shift for a man who made the highest - profile case for the war in Iraq , a war the Democratic Party leadership contends was waged on the basis of politicized intelligence .
Mr. Powell , for his part , has said this interpretation of the pre-war intelligence debate is incorrect .
Yesterday , he defended his 2003 presentation of the American case for war , saying he spent five days checking every fact at CIA headquarters before he gave it .
The presentation was based on the same intelligence estimate that was made available to Congress , he said , and he noted that many Democrats who served in Congress at the time later said they did not read the classified estimate .
One lawmaker who has not had to make such a statement is Mr. Obama , who in 2002 and 2003 was a state senator in Springfield , Ill. , and opposed the war .
" Before the war in Iraq started , Obama had the courage to stand up to the politics and propaganda and spoke out against the war , even before the invasion of Iraq , " a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama 's campaign , Jen Psaki , said .
" Any time you have the opportunity to seek advice on foreign policy from the former secretary of state , it is a welcome meeting . "
Mr. Obama said in October 2002 that he was " not opposed to all wars , " just " dumb " and " rash " ones .
" What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair weekend warriors in this administration who shove their own ideological agendas down our throats , irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne , " he said at a rally hosted by Act Now to Stop War and End Racism .
Since his election to the Senate in 2004 , Mr. Obama has adopted a more moderate stance .
While many in his party , including Senator Clinton , have criticized the faulty intelligence leading up to the war , Mr. Obama has co-authored legislation to help secure loose chemical and biological weapons and keep them out of the hands of terrorists .
In October 2005 , Mr. Obama accompanied Senator Lugar , a Republican of Indiana who was then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , on a fact - finding mission to the former Soviet bloc .
In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations after the trip , Mr. Obama said : " The demand for these weapons has never been greater .
...
Right now rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs . "
Nonetheless , Mr. Obama has since expressed opposition to the surge of American troops in Iraq and has endorsed plans to withdraw from the country by 2008 , a position shared by more than 60 % of Americans , according to a New York Times poll in May .
Mr. Powell may not share that position , but he did express pessimism on " Meet the Press " yesterday about the prospects for the surge .
He believes that American forces in Iraq are facing a " civil war , " he said , and he noted that the White House has not called the conflict in Iraq a civil war .
" The current strategy to deal with it , the military surge , our part of the surge under General Petraeus  the only thing it can do is put a heavier lid on this boiling pot of civil war stew , " he said .
For close Powell watchers , this sort of statement may not be surprising .
As secretary of state during the 2004 election season , he hinted to the editorial board of the New York Times that had he known no weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq , he would not have supported the war .
More recently , Mr. Powell kept mum after his former chief of staff , Lawrence Wilkerson , said the Bush administration was being run like a " cabal . "
In 2005 , Mr. Wilkerson helped sink the White House 's nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations ; Mr. Powell did not sign a letter of former Republican secretaries of state endorsing the Bolton nomination .
Mr. Powell 's positions on a number of national security issues appear to be more in sync with those of Democrats .
On " Meet the Press , " for example , Mr. Powell said he would close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , which holds suspected terrorists .
" I would simply move them to the United States and put them into our federal legal system , " he said .
A former spokesman for the Republican National Committee , Clifford May , said he thinks it is fine for Mr. Powell to offer his advice to all presidential candidates .
" If Colin Powell is advising candidates from both parties on foreign policy , that is commendable , " Mr. May , the president of the bipartisan Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , said .
" Foreign policy and national security ought to be beyond partisanship .
They have not been in recent years , and that is deeply regrettable . "
