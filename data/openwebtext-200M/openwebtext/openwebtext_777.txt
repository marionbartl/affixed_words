The makers of Tide , Ajax and other common household cleansers are being asked to come clean about their ingredients .
Environmental and health activists announced plans Tuesday for a lawsuit to make Procter & Gamble Co. , Colgate - Palmolive Co. and two other major firms reveal the chemical ingredients of their cleaning products and their research on the products ’ effects .
The suit , to be filed today in New York , seeks to use a little - known 1976 New York law passed to combat phosphates in detergent .
The activists “ say people deserve to know whether the products they use to wash their dishes and clean their homes could be harmful , ” said New York lawyer Keri Powell , an attorney for Earthjustice , a nonprofit public interest law firm .

The lawsuit is being filed on behalf of six state and national environmental and health groups , including the Sierra Club and American Lung Assn. in New York .
Responding to the lawsuit , the Soap and Detergent Assn. expressed disappointment that activist groups were “ using an arcane New York state regulation as a way to disparage cleaning product formulators whose products are used safely and effectively by millions of people every day . ”
The industry plans a major push next year to make more information available about ingredients , said Michelle Radecki , general counsel of the Washington - based group .
It represents 110 cleaning product manufacturers that together make more than 90 % of U.S. cleaning products .
“ The cleaning product industry is committed to providing more information than ever before on cleaning product ingredients , ” she said .

Last September , the coalition of groups sent letters to several manufacturers informing them of the New York law and its requirement that they file semiannual ingredient and research reports with the state ’s Department of Environmental Conservation .
The letters asked the manufacturers to comply within 30 days .
“ Eco-friendly ” cleaning product manufacturers Method Products Inc. , based in San Francisco , and Seventh Generation Inc. , in Burlington , Vt. , were among the companies that complied with the request .
Cincinnati - based Procter & Gamble , New York - based Colgate - Palmolive and Princeton , N.J. - based Church & Dwight Co. ( maker of the popular Arm & Hammer products ) all refused to comply ; Britain - based Reckitt Benckiser Group ( which makes Woolite ) did not respond .

The lawsuit seeks to invoke Article 35 of New York ’s Environmental Conservation Law -- a statute that ’s seen little action since it was passed in 1976 to combat phosphates , a family of chemicals once widely used in detergents until they were associated with negative health effects .
Health issues are central to the new lawsuit as well .
Many of the activist groups in the lawsuit link the chemicals in household cleaning products to asthma , skin sensitization and other human health issues , as well as reproductive problems in aquatic life .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission is the federal agency charged with overseeing home cleaning products , but it does n’t require cleaning product manufacturers to provide comprehensive ingredient lists , so few companies do .
And although the federal Toxic Substances Control Act was enacted in 1976 to regulate the introduction of chemicals , it grandfathered in most of the existing chemicals on the market .

In California , two laws were approved in 2008 .
Together they require the state to identify “ chemicals of concern , ” to evaluate safer alternatives and to create a scientific clearinghouse for information on chemicals ’ effects , but environmental and health groups say it will be years before consumers see results .

In all the hype surrounding the Large Hadron Collider during the last few years , it was easy to miss the fact that low energy physics was still accomplishing a lot - and that no one was sure what the LHC could really do because we did n't know what needed discovering .
What we think it will do is based on the success of the indirect approach in science .
Darwin 's evolution by natural selection , for example , gained early acceptance because without it nothing much in biology made sense .
Later discoveries including genetics and a detailed fossil record reaffirmed that what makes the most sense can often be true .
But one of the most famous examples of why indirect science is a valid approach in modern physics was also an example of a rush to debunk something that did n't need debunking - Newton 's gravity .
We 're talking now about the discovery of Uranus .
Sirannounced the discovery of Uranus in 1781 , the first discovery of a planetmade using a , namely that it did n't follow a path that gravity said it should follow .
No less thanintimated that Newton might be wrong - without a new theory of gravity , the orbit of Uranus did not make sense , he believed .
It fell to French mathematician Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier to disregard the need for a new theory of gravity .
Instead , " with the point of his pen " meaning mathematics , he predicted there should be a new planet - now called Neptune .
Newton was n't debunked at all and Airy took some short term flak for causing England to miss out on the discovery , though he has been defended aggressively on this matter by his biographers and he also graciously accepted getting beat and did a lot of other terrific things , so none of this is a slap to him .
Urbain Jean Joseph Le VerrierAnd so it goes with complex explanations sometimes taking the place of simple ones .
In very large motion physics today , nothing makes sense in the universe unless some mystery force / energy / gravity / matter exists - the indirect approach says it must be so .
The LHC will , the mass media claims , find the Higgs boson and also solve everything we can want to know .
The one benefit to having breakdowns and delays are that people will get tired of hearing about it and physics can get back to business that goes beyond the hype - because the LHC may find nothing at all and I can contend that might actually be better than finding something and calling it a God particle .
Is finding nothing worth spending billions of dollars ?
Well , yeah .
Of course , it 's also European money , American congressmen not being willing to underwrite projects in physics that have no definable result , which makes it a little more palatable to many in America like me .
Finding nothing in the LHC that can be called a ' Higgs mass ' will mean a lot more for discovery than the canned , easy - to - label approach taken in getting the CERN project funded - even Sean Carroll at Cosmic Variance , who should know better , once predicted a 95 % chance of finding the Higgs boson with the LHC , though that may just mean someone having to rationalize the budget so they will find something - anything - and call it just that .
So even scientists can get caught up in the promise of high energy physics .
But most scientists wo n't unless it is legitimate and that will be good , both for the LHC and for low energy physics too .
I just knocked the indirect approach and now I am going to defend it because I have no loyalty at all to supersymmetry or Higgs but I have loyalty to finding answers .
Sometimes the best answers arrive when you can't find that must be there - and the planet Vulcanis an example .
Vulcan was theorized , because it had to exist .
Mercury , like Uranus , was not moving as it should and followed up when an amateur astronomer claimed to have found something he originally thought was a sunspot ; but sunspots do n't orbit the sun every 20 days so a planet had to be somewhere in the vicinity of Mercury .
Even experienced astronomers such as professorof theand , who had multiple successes between them , confirmed seeing something they thought was a planet , though in a different place .
So most astronomers still doubted the mystery planet despite the fact that nothing made sense about Mercury without one .
The indirect approach which had worked so successfully with Neptune was not as convincing with Mercury .
Stating that Mercury 's orbit could not exist if what we know about planetary motion is correct was not holding water any more - science had matured since Neptune so astronomers knew the science had to change .
Change it did .
In 1915 Einstein explained the odd perturbations of Mercury using special relativity .
The effect of the Sun 's gravitational field was working on all planets but to a lesser degree farther away .
Had Vulcan been found , we would still have special relativity but with one less example of its awesome power .
So I am more interested in what will happen if we do n't find this magic bullet of physics in the ground underneath Switzerland .
It wo n't mean the money has been wasted , it will mean that we have a chance to break even more new ground with what we do know .
Likewise , there is a lot left to learn in low energy physics .
Fermi lab 's Project X , for example , is just the kind of thing that can be done using lower energy physics , just by upgrading the booster - in those physics frontiers of energy and intensity and cosmology , intensity can still add a lot to our understanding of the universe .
Either way , physics wins because we learn a lot about the universe even by discovering that something that should exist does n't exist .
And if something key is found using the LHC , it will require the future ILC to do precision studies of whatever that new thing is , so physics wins there too .
NOTES : (1 ) It had been detected before but was assumed to be a star - first name 34 ( 2 )
It 's also the only one to be named after a Greek God .
The rest are Roman .
(3) It is unlikely Spock 's homeworld was named after this mystery planet but that would be pretty cool .
(4) Mistakes can also make science better by optimizing it or even inspiring it .
In 1846 , Frederic Petit , director of the observatory of Toulouse , stated that a second moon of thehad been discovered - something Le Verrier did not like hearing much because of the lack of a way to account for air resistance .
But Jules Verne inspired generations of scientists just the same and the hunt was on .
Since it is a cross- platform program , VirtualBox can be run on multiple operating systems .
This means that it will work perfectly fine on Linux , just as it does on Windows .
Furthermore , the graphical user interface should be almost identical on all platforms .
Let ’s see how we can install and run virtual machines on Ubuntu with VirtualBox .
Install VirtualBox
Install VirtualBox through Ubuntu ’s Software Center application .
However , use the terminal here .
It ’s more universal , works the same way anywhere and you can see what is going on .
After opening a terminal emulator , you can easily install virtualbox with this command :
Normally , “ virtualbox - qt ” should install automatically alongside other dependencies .
This is the package that shows us a graphical user interface for VirtualBox .
If , for some reason , you find it missing , you can install it manually with sudo apt install virtualbox - qt .
VirtualBox should now appear in the applications menu .
In Ubuntu ’s default desktop environment , just press the Super key ( usually the one with the Windows logo ) .
Type “ virtualbox ” and click on the icon to launch the program .
In other desktop environments , such as LXDE ( Lubuntu ) , VirtualBox appears under the “ System Tools ” category .
Create a New Virtual Machine
After launching the utility , you ’ll see a button labeled “ New ” in the top - left corner .
After clicking on this button , you are guided through a few easy steps to create your first virtual machine .
First , though , you need to download a bootable ISO file .
For example , from this link you can download a Debian live image with your favorite desktop environment .
“ Live ” means you can try it even without , or before , installing .
If time and Internet bandwidth do n’t allow a download of a few gigabytes , you can download a very small Ubuntu ISO image for a quick test .
After naming your new virtual machine and selecting the operating system type and version , click on “ Next . ”
Operating systems that include a graphical user interface will need at least 2GB of RAM .
Text - based server distributions can run with 1GB of RAM .
Keep in mind , though , that if you move the slider past the green line , things can dramatically slow down .
In the next step you can create the new virtual disk where the operating system will be installed .
When you just want to test a live operating system , without installing , you can skip this step and choose “ Do not add a virtual hard disk . ”
If you do create a virtual disk , you ’ll have to choose the disk file format .
You can leave the default answer checked if you do n’t plan to use this virtual disk with other virtualization software .
When asked about virtual hard disk allocation type , you should choose “ Fixed size . ”
This offers the best read / write performance .
Though if you prefer your VM disk size to start small and grow as you use it , then select the “ Dynamically allocated ” option .
Afterwards choose the name for the file that will host your virtual disk .
After deciding its size , click on “ Create ” and finish setting up the virtual machine .
Finally , click on the green arrow labeled “ Start ” to boot your machine .
When first launching a virtual machine , you will be prompted to select a startup disk .
This is the step where you click on the small folder icon with a green arrow ( lower - right side of window ) .
After browsing and selecting the ISO file you have downloaded , you can boot the machine .
Alternate Way to Add Bootable ISO to Virtual Machine
If you accidentally close this prompt , it wo n’t be shown again .
In this case the procedure to add a bootable ISO is different .
Right - click on the virtual machine and click on “ Settings -> Storage ” in the first column .
In the middle column , under “ Controller : IDE , ” we can see a small CD icon labelled “ Empty . ”
In the third right column you ’ll see “ Optical Drive , ” and at the far right of that , a small CD icon .
Click on it and browse to the ISO file .
When done , click OK to save the settings .
The machine will now boot from the ISO image .
Conclusion
At this point you can run almost any operating system on our Ubuntu host .
You can even install Android in VirtualBox .

LOS ANGELES , Dec. 30 ( UPI ) -- Woody Harrelson 's publicist has confirmed that the actor married his longtime girlfriend Laura Louie in Maui , which is where the couple live .
Usmagazine.com said Owen Wilson , Willie Nelson and Sean Penn were among the guests at the ceremony while Alanis Morissette was the wedding singer .

" Woody Harrelson and Laura Louie were officially married yesterday on the island of Maui , " the actor 's representative told the magazine Monday .
" The ceremony was attended by family and friends .
The couple have been together 20 years and are the proud parents of three daughters . "
Harrelson is best known for his portrayal of naive bartender Woody Boyd on the classic TV sit-com " Cheers . "
His other acting credits include " Doc Hollywood , " " Natural Born Killers , " " A Prairie Home Companion , " " After the Sunset , " " No Country for Old Men " and " Seven Pounds . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Mexico suspended purchases from 30 U.S. meat plants due to sanitary issues , which sent U.S. cattle and hog prices sharply lower on Friday and prompted speculation the ban was retaliation against a U.S. labeling law .

Early on Friday , U.S. analysts said the bans were likely because of Mexico ’s opposition to a recently enacted meat labeling law .
The law , commonly called Country - of - Origin Labeling or COOL , requires that meat packages in U.S. supermarkets carry labels stating the countries where the meat animals were raised .
Mexico and the U.S. Agriculture Department both denied the retaliation charge .
“ Countries would go through dispute settlement under either ( the North American Free Trade Agreement ) or ( World Trade Organization ) -- not use the action of plant - by - plant delistment , ” said Amanda Eamich of USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service .
USDA listed the affected plants on its website on Friday , but the suspensions became effective on Tuesday .
The listed plants produce beef , lamb , pork , and poultry and can be foundhere .
Many of the banned plants are owned by the largest U.S. meat companies , including Cargill Inc , Tyson Foods Inc , JBS , Seaboard and Smithfield Foods .
Mexico is a leading buyer of U.S. meat and said that purchases from the affected plants could resume as early as Monday .
“ If everything goes well , the plants could be re-listed next Monday , ” Mexico ’s agriculture ministry said on Friday .
The ministry said the affected plants fell short on standards like packaging , labeling , and some transport conditions .
USDA said it is working with Mexico and the meat companies to resolve the issues .
CANADA , MEXICO OPPOSED LAW
U.S. consumer and farm groups say the labeling rules will distinguish U.S. - grown food from imports on the grocery shelf and fulfill the shopper ’s right to know about products .
Canadian and Mexican officials have opposed the law arguing that it will have U.S. meat plants and consumers discriminating against non-U.S. animals and meat .
Both countries ship livestock into the United States .
“ It appears they ( Mexican officials ) are using this to send a signal to our government that they do n’t like COOL , ” Don Roose , analyst at U.S. Commodities , said earlier on Friday .
Earlier this year , Mexico had warned many U.S. meat plants of alleged “ point of entry violations ” and Friday ’s suspensions may have been related to that , Jim Herlihy , spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation , said early on Friday .
Point of entry violations could be a number of things including incorrect paperwork or labeling issues , he said .
BANS MAY BE LIFTED SOON
Prior to Mexico saying shipments could resume on Monday , Roose had predicted the bans would be short , because Mexico needs the meat for its population .
“ You have to feed the masses , ” he said .
News of the bans prompted selling in U.S. cattle and hog markets at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday , with cattle prices dropping 2 to 2.5 percent and hog prices dropping about 3 percent .
“ That is bad news , ” Jim Clarkson , Chicago - based analyst at A &A Trading said of Mexico ’s action .
“ They ( Mexico ) are fighting COOL . ”
After Mexico denied it was retaliating for COOL , Clarkson still predicted the labeling law may have helped prompt the bans .
Due to the holiday period , attempts on Friday were unsuccessful to reach many of the U.S. meat companies .
The sound is a fluke .
Newer trains run on alternating current , but the third rail delivers direct current ; inverters chop it into frequencies that can be used by the alternating current motors , said Jeff Hakner , a professor of electrical engineering at Cooper Union .
The frequencies excite the steel , he said , which  in the case of the R142 subway cars  responds by singing “ Somewhere . ”
Inverters on other trains run at different frequencies and thus are not gifted with such a recognizable song .

The playwright Tony Kushner told New York magazine last year that it was his favorite New York noise .
Riders often ask transit officials about it , and readers still write to the City section of The Times to report their discovery .
The filmmaker Julie Talen told me about it months before I finally caught it .
When it ’s heard by people who have n’t been tipped off , they distrust their own ears .
“ Everyone sort of noticed it , and then this corroboration process started where people said to each other , ‘ Did you hear it ? ’ ” said Jamie Bernstein , a writer and broadcaster whose father , Leonard Bernstein , composed “ West Side Story . ”
“ People still are asking me about it . ”
How can a subway car evoke a song that has been fixed in memory by great singers like Marni Nixon , Aretha Franklin and Jessye Norman ?
“ What makes a melody sound like a melody is not the note it starts on  it ’s the relationship from the first note you hear to the next one , ” said John Mauceri , the chancellor of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and a conductor who worked with Mr. Bernstein for 18 years .
What the mind knows as melody , Mr. Mauceri said , are these intervals between notes .
“ Our brains are built on pattern matching , ” he said .
“ How does a finch recognize another finch singing from a tree a half - mile away ?
Once you have two or three intervals , they become locked in your brain as that song . ”
In the first sung line of “ Somewhere , ” there are two intervals , Mr. Mauceri said .
Between the first note  “ there ’s ”  and the second note  “ a ”  the interval is known as an ascending minor seventh .
From that second note to the third  “ place ”  there ’s a descending half - step interval .
The songs from “ West Side Story , ” which opened on Broadway in 1957 and was made into a movie in 1961 , are often used to teach intervals to music students .
It ’s been less than two weeks since Bespin was introduced , and there ’s already been an impressive amount of activity around the open source project .
There are at least 3 entirely new Bespin servers that I ’m aware of .
The current Bespin server that we at Mozilla are maintaining is written in Python and appears in the backend / python directory in the Bespin source .
To help people get up to speed with the code , I have created a screencast to help people get started with the Python backend and give them an idea of how the code is set up .
I look forward to hearing your feedback !

The Republican National Committee criticized that requirement and said the new administration was already violating it .
Mr. Obama 's nominee for deputy secretary of defense , William Lynn , has been a lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon , and his nominee for deputy secretary of health and human services , William V. Corr , lobbied for stricter tobacco regulations as an official with the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids .
A senior White House official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , conceded the two nominees did not adhere to the new rules .
But he said that Mr. Lynn had the support of Republicans and Democrats , and would receive a waiver under the policy , and that Mr. Corr did not need a waiver because he had agreed to recuse himself from tobacco issues .
As the philosopher Scooby Doo might say : Awhroo ?
( That 's cartoon dog for " Huh ? " )
" When you set very tough rules , you need to have a mechanism for the occasional exception , " this official said , adding , " We wanted to be really tough , but at the same time we did n't want to hamstring the new administration or turn the town upside down . "
I 'm deeply ambivalent about this whole thicket of issues , as I have at times contradictory feelings about it .
I thought Obama 's sweeping condemnation of lobbyists was better campaign rhetoric than policy .
The reality is that some lobbyists are as nefarious as advertised and some are not .
Some want to turn their public service into big bucks and some turn around and help what we liberals would call good causes .
And oh yeah :
Many have experience that could be helpful for a new administration trying to enact its agenda .
I think that some substantial number of people who go through the so - called " revolving door " are a problem , and so I have some sympathy for tougher restrictions on that kind of back and forth .
But if you 're going to campaign on sweeping condemnations about the evil of lobbyists and then , with great fanfare , ban them from your administration , you need to live by your own rules ; or at least you should n't start making exceptions for them on Day 1 .
Else the message is :
It is important to prevent other administrations from doing business with lobbyists ; but we are of such mor al character that the rules need not apply to us .
That 's a slippery slope and leads to problems ( and specifically could lead to the ex-lobbyists not getting confirmed , as Spencer Ackerman notes ) .
Rails Application Visualization
Before we went live with the new Rails site at CarePages , we decided to use Munin for monitoring .
We needed to write a few custom plugins to visualize application health .
Fortunately , Munin plugins are really easy to write - I 'll provide the source for a couple of them .
We wrote plugins for Passenger process status , Passenger memory stats , Rails response time , Rails hits , the ARMailer queue , and the BJ queue .
Munin also comes with default plugins for things like CPU and memory usage that are good to use for correlation .
Passenger Status
Passenger has a passenger - status command that will output the status of all the Rails ( or Rack ) processes .
It will provide the maximum number of processes that can be spawned , how many processing are currently running , and how many are in use .
The output looks like this :
$ sudo passenger - status -----------
General information ----------- max = 16 count = 4 active = 2 inactive = 3 -----------
Applications
----------- /redacted /releases/20081024053350 : PID : 18984 Sessions : 0 PID : 18980 Sessions : 0 PID : 20126 Sessions : 1 PID : 15735 Sessions : 1
And here 's the Munin graph .
Parsing the output of the passenger - status command was simple , and provided good visibility into the application health .
Here 's the source for the passenger - status munin plugin .
Passenger Memory Stats
Passenger also provides memory stats via passenger - memory - stats .
It will show the amount of memory being used per process .
Here 's what it looks like in the form of a Munin graph .
You can see that as processes go idle when there 's low traffic over night , Passenger kills them , freeing up memory .
You can also see the application slowly leaking memory during the day .
Rails Hits
We wanted to be able to correlate utilization with actual traffic , so we also made a plugin to graph requests that hit Rails .
We set up a custom log to make this easier , but in the end we had a plugin that would chart how many requests were hitting Rails every 5 minutes per app server .
Rails Response Time
And of course , we wanted to be able to see the app performance using mean and median response times .
We logged Rails ' X - Runtime header in our custom log , and we used that to produce yet another Munin graph .
I 'll blog about the details of that custom log later - we found several good uses for it .
CPU
Munin comes with some default plugins that are good to correlate with the application - specific plugins that we wrote .
For example , here 's the CPU usage graph .
MySQL Queries
Munin also has bundled plugins for MySQL , making it easy to keep an eye on queries / second and slow queries .
Background Queues
Finally , it was also easy to write plugins to keep an eye on background queues .
Here 's one that watches the AR Mailer queue .
And another that watches the BJ queue ( source ) .
So some former member of Destiny ’s Child that no one remembers has started up some new act that I am not going to bother naming because I am lazy and because no one cares .
One of the girls in the group is a singer who goes by the name Bethany and bitch got fired from the group with this news hit .
Here ’s some of her footage from her porn past where she went by the name PINK and shit will make any producer at the Nature Channel proud .
I ’m not saying that cuz I am a racist , I ’m saying it because I truly believe this bitch is a beast .
In other black sex news , some model named Milani Rose who I have never heard of , but assume she ’s a classy black model who either poses half naked with cars , or half naked in low budget hip hop videos / magazines , or maybe even on flyers for hip hop parties or CD Inserts for those dudes who try to sell you their homemade CDs in every major city , you know because she has a fat ass and is the kind of model who probably needs to strip on the side to pay for her baby ’s formula .
She used to be a hooker and this is some video of her whoring out that has hit the internet and I do n’t think she ’s using a condom , I guess you get paid more for that .
Some Singer Named Bethany ’s Censored Porn Past of the Day

Writing for three green business blogs , I come across and write about my fair share of ideas .
My greenwash filter is quick , swift , and merciless .
And then you come across something like Wild Wool , and everything gets confused .
The front page has pleasing images of piles of soft , fuzzy fabric and clothing , made from what it describes as , “ …a 100 % natural fiber product made from 60 % merino wool and 40 % paihamu spun together to make a premium cashmere - like fabric that is softer , warmer , and lighter than plain wool . ”
Sounds good so far , right ?
My eyebrow started to cock when I read a seemingly throwaway sentence , without a connecting justification for it : “ Eco-friendly and practical – talk about a great way to reduce , reuse and recycle . ”
Going to the Ecological Profile page to learn more , I was surprised to read what I can say is the most unique claim to being sustainable I ’ve seen in a while – Basically , by killing them for their fur , they are helping restore ecological balance on New Zealand .
[ social_buttons ]
For context , it explains that the Paihamu is a non native animal without natural predators , has overrun New Zealand and now numbers an estimated 70 million .
They consume 20,000 tons of vegetation nightly , and go after , among others , the kiwi bird , and endangered icon of New Zealand .
They are potential carriers / spreaders of Tuberculosis .
New Zealand ’s official way to deal with them is by using a poison ( 1080 ) that ’s been banned from US Federal lands since the 70s , and results in other unintended deaths of other animals .
While this may make sense on a pragmatic level , it ’s troublesome that that be used as a way to claim being a sustainable product .
And in a recent article on Ideal Bite , it sparked a fierce debate .
In the FAQ , they seem aware of this tightrope they walk on , making sure to mention , “ The vast majority of Paihamu are killed using cyanide laced bait and they are unconscious within seconds .
A smaller number are trapped in humane traps or hunted . ”
So , readers , what do you make of this ?
I ’m undecided .
Taking the emotional component out and being purely rational , it makes sense , from an overall perspective .
And yet , it was we humans that introduced it in the first place , should we live with the consequences ?
I look forward to hearing your thoughts , below .

There ’s nothing worse than that moment when you realize your data is gone .
All the music , saved games , instrument presets , documents , and information that you took for granted are now lost forever .
When my last hard drive crashed , there was the sickening moment when I realized the data was gone , and it was almost as hard to deal with as a break up .
Seagate has revamped its FreeAgent series of external drives .
The drives now come with a five year warranty , and a fold out instruction page with less than 1,000 words .
I had the opportunity to test out all three of the drives in the line , The FreeAgent Go , FreeAgent Desk , and FreeAgent XTreme , and I am impressed .
With a huge bang for the buck and more data storage than most people will ever need , the FreeAgent drives are definitely a choice to consider if you ’re shopping for a portable storage solution .
The drives are sleek and have the coolest drive light I have ever seen .
The display LEDs glow brightly when plugged , pulse in brightness when the drive is reading or writing data , and dim when it goes into standby .
As an energy saver , all the drives automatically jump to standby after 15 minutes .
The drives are simple to use .
Simply plug them and start rocking .
As if looks and ease are n’t enough , the drives are almost silent .
The FreeAgent
Go is a tiny bit larger than an iPhone , and can easily fit in your pocket .
The unit has a docking bay and leather case ( sold separately ) that eliminate the need to plug and unplug cables on your computer .
While the included USB cable is only 3.5 feet , it ’s a perfect carry along .
I put the Go in my pocket and went to see some friends with my data , and found that the FreeAgent Go is the perfect portable drive .
It took much less than I expected to pour my data onto their computers .
The FreeAgent Go comes in several colors , and you can choose between three file capacities , 250GB , 320GB , and 500GB .
You can get the 500GB for as low as $ 122 , making this drive a cheap addition to your rig , and perfect for bringing the entire contents of your computer somewhere else .
The FreeAgent Desk and XTreme seem almost the same , with the exception of the casing and a coupe of features .
They both have 7200 rpm drives , making them near the top of the line in speed .
While the color is different ( The Desk is silver and the XTreme is black ) , the only other feature that sets them apart is the interface .
While the desk is USB 2.0 only , the XTreme also has ports for firewire and eSATA , giving it a leg up on speed .
Both drives come in four storage sizes between 500GB and 1.5TB , and span in price from $ 140 to $ 280 .
You can also get them for much cheaper on Amazon.com .
The software that comes with the FreeAgent is easy to use .
It includes some simple diagnostics , and automated backup controls , including setting specific folders and backup times .
The software also includes an encryption option .
While there are several steps to the encryption and decryption process , it ’s nice to know that if someone takes my drive , they wo n’t get my data .
I tested the drives by backing up my 168GB of media , documents , pictures , and studio sessions on all the drives … at the same time .
In less than nine hours all three drives were complete When I Copied my music collection ( 50 GB of MP3s ) to the FreeAgent go , the transfer was complete in less than 90 minutes .
We ’ve yet to see what the new drives ’ reliability over time will be , but Seagate ’s offerings look good , are easy to use , and are inexpensive – and that works for me !
I ’m impressed .
( Editor ’s Note : [ GAS ] Contributor Brian Boyko had an earlier version of the Seagate FreeAgent drive – his hard drive crashed on him .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Suggesting that the planet will soon reach an irreversible " tipping point " of damage to the climate , former Vice President Al Gore told members of Congress on Wednesday that the United States needs to join international talks on a treaty .
Al Gore says the United States must join international talks on an environmental treaty .
" This treaty must be negotiated this year , " Gore told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
During questioning , he acknowledged that any treaty must include mechanisms to ensure compliance with prospective limits on carbon dioxide emissions , which come primarily from burning fossil fuels for energy .
Committee Chairman John Kerry of Massachusetts said public policy must change and respond to warnings from scientists who fear that a buildup of greenhouse gas emissions may prove permanent .
" Frankly , the science is screaming at us , " he said .
" Right now , the most critical trends and facts all point in the wrong direction . "
The prospective harm from climate change includes permanent coastal flooding from rising sea levels , agricultural deterioration and the spread of tropical diseases to temperate climates , scientists say .
To avoid reaching any point of no return , said Sen.
Richard Lugar , R - Indiana , the United States should rise to a leadership role in promoting other forms of energy such as solar and geothermal power .
" Such technology represents an enormous opportunity for United States exports , " Lugar said , " but we have to have the will to develop , test and implement these technologies on a truly urgent basis . "
Gore came equipped with charts and graphs , photographs and video to help illustrate his call to action .
In one video recorded in the Arctic , a researcher screamed when a colleague ignited a large cloud of methane gas that Gore said is bubbling up as a result of the melting ice cap .

He said the scientist was not hurt .
The former presidential candidate , who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for raising awareness of climate change , urged lawmakers to support an economic stimulus package now moving through Congress .
The Obama administration bill , he said , promotes " energy efficiency , renewables , a unified national energy smart grid and the move to clean cars " that he described as long overdue .
He also tied job creation to improved energy policy , saying alternative energies would create " sustainable , high - paying jobs . "
As for workers in today 's coal industry who could be left behind , Gore said it cannot be justified " to keep on doing this incredible damage and harm in the name of their jobs " when the nation could " much more effectively create even better jobs . "
Gore did not rule out a continued presence for atomic energy , despite high construction costs and the problem of nuclear waste disposal , but he noted that the greatest growth in the energy sector involves wind and solar power .
During the hearing , Republican staffers handed out a statement contending that there are " significant objections " to claims about climate change .
The document , which did not name Gore , said there is " a continued international outpouring of skeptical scientists " along with research " to refute warming fears . "
The idea that the world 's climate is being changed by human activities is supported by studies accepted by the vast majority of scientists with expertise in the field .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences , the American Meteorological Society , the American Geophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science are among groups that have issued reports backing that position .
Gore 's testimony may help Kerry 's committee shape the U.S. position at a conference on global climate change set for December in Copenhagen , Denmark .

Since I was very little , one of the things I 've always loved was drawing .
When you start drawing you imagine things you woud n't normally .
Space dragons , tea parties with rabbits , underground adventures and all those things you used to think as a kid .
Mike Maihack is an artist from Florida and he draws some really cool cartoons .
He 's style is pretty sweet and he 's running some projects such as the weekly webcomics called " Cow & Buffalo " and the Christian comics anthology called " Parable " .
He also draws another webcomic called " Cleopatra in Spaaaace ! " which is pretty awesome .
Anyways , for further information on his work , visit his portfolio and his blog .
Hope you like it .
Cheers ! ;)
Cadbury is to encourage its cows to burp less to reduce the carbon footprint of its milk chocolate .
The company is working with its 65 dairy farmers in Wiltshire to reduce the emissions of their animals .
Production of the famous glass - and - a - half of milk in every bar is responsible for 60 % of the chocolate 's carbon emissions , according to experts at the Carbon Trust who audited the carbon emissions from the company 's products .
Cadbury has sent the farmers a guide for low carbon dairy farming , which includes advice on changing the diet of the cows to cut their eructations .
Farmed ruminant animals are thought to be responsible for up to a quarter of " man-made " methane emissions worldwide though , contrary to common belief , most gas emerges from their front , not rear ends .
Studies show that the production of one litre of milk produces the equivalent of 900g of CO2 .
More than half of this is down to methane .
The average cow emits between 80kg and 120kg of methane a year , equivalent to the annual carbon emissions from an average family car .
Ian Walsh , Cadbury 's global head of environment , said the company was looking to reduce the environmental impact of its supply chain .
" We are committed to tackling climate change and we rely on scientific research to inform the actions we take . "
The company worked with the Carbon Trust to work out the life cycle emissions of the chocolate .
Cadbury is not the first to address emissions from cattle and dairy farming .
Experts at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research in Aberystwyth have also looked at how the diet of farmed animals can be changed to make them produce less methane , a much more potent global warming gas than CO2 .
The altered diet changes the way that bacteria in the stomachs of the animals break down plant material into waste gas .
The institute is working on a government programme with the universities of Wales and Reading , to investigate how this process could be improved .
A similar project in New Zealand suggested that dietary changes could reduce methane emissions from sheep by up to 50 % .
Tony Benn once spoke about wanting a fundamental shift of power and wealth to working people .
I too want that fundamental shift - to local people and local institutions .
Over the last century Britain has become one of the most centralised countries in the developed world as power has been sucked to Westminster .
Some might wonder why this matters .
After all , is n't politics just about what works ?
But there is a deep connection between where decisions are made and what works .
When one - size - fits - all solutions are dispensed from the centre , it 's not surprising they so often fail local communities .
When people experience a yawning gap between the changes they want to see and those they can directly affect , it is inevitable that demoralisation and democratic disengagement follow .
The Conservative party wants nothing less than radical decentralisation , to reach every corner of the country .
The policies we launch today are a decisive step towards that goal .
They fall into three broad groups .
There are plans to give people a much greater say over the issues that affect their daily lives ; plans to give local councils much more responsibility and power ; and plans to actually reshape the way political power is structured in this country .
Let me give you some examples of how we 're going to push power out to the people .
First , giving local people more power .
Right now most people feel totally insignificant in the political process .
Frankly , that 's because - in the current over - centralised system - they are insignificant .
If you 're unhappy about decisions made by your council there 's very little you can do about it outside election day .
We 're going to change that by giving people the power to instigate referendums on local issues - including council tax rises .
If there 's a local consensus that a tax increase is unnecessary , people will be able to club together and vote it down .
This is n't the sham " power to the people " of a one - day consultation or a citizens ' jury ; it 's real power in the hands of local people .
Second , we 're going to give local councils much more power and responsibility .
We 've got to recognise that the central state can't have the imagination and flexibility to tailor all of its services to local needs .
I am convinced that if we have more local discretion - more decisions made and money spent at the local level - we 'll get better outcomes .
It is both patronising and absurd that councils can only act on a local issue if they have a specific mandate to do so .
We 're going to change that by trusting local authorities with a " general power of competence " that will free them to carry out any lawful activity on behalf of their community .
That way , instead of endlessly looking up to Whitehall for permission , our councils will be looking to local people for direction .
Our third front is a restructuring of political power in cities .
The case of London shows how having a single accountable mayor is a huge boost to democratic engagement , and we want other cities to benefit too .
We 're not going to enforce a mayoral system anywhere ; instead we will legislate to hold a referendum on the change in 12 of our largest cities .
Unless they reject the new structure , cities from Bristol and Birmingham to Nottingham and Newcastle will have a mayor .
Strong local leadership is just one of the ways we can start re-balancing power and responsibility in Britain .
Many worry that decentralisation is a step backwards .
But localism is n't some romantic attachment to the past .
It is absolutely essential to our economic , social and political future .
If our local economies are vibrant and strong we are far less vulnerable to global shocks or the failures of a few dominant industries .
If people know that their actions can make a real difference to their local communities , they 're far more motivated to get involved - and civic pride is revived .
If local government is both more powerful and more accountable , we can start to restore the trust that 's been lost in our political system .
It 's for these practical reasons that I am a confirmed localist , committed to turning Britain 's pyramid of power on its head .

I 've been taking adderall for about 2 months for depression and it of course like most people say ' instantly cured my depression ' and gave me loads of energy .
I was suppose to take 20mg twice daily but I have an extreme tolerance for stimulants and 20mg did nothing so I went as high as 120 mg once daily .
This had the usual pleasent ' feel the power ' effects speed is suppose to have .
I also do n't like to overdo it with drugs so I had to stop taking it before I got to that psychotic state of mind and feeling worse than before .
So I stopped for a little while and when I talked to my Shrink in my next appointment I told him that the 20mg twice daily was n't doing anything anymore because of my high tolerance , so he immediatley went to his cabinet and gave me two sample packs of provigil ( modafinil ) .
Today I decided to see what Provigil and Adderall together could do and what it does is very nice for me , but I know this too will have to stop because its unhealthy and I care about my health .
I decided to take 5 20mg adderrall and 1 200mg Provigil , about 1 hour later I begin to feel unusually mellow and sleepy and time seems to be going by slowly like I had just taken some Xanax bars or Smoked some nice Dank , which really comes as a shock to me because I thought 2 Stimulants would equal something very speedy , but instead I 'm feeling drowsy and Xanaxish , it 's probably just how the two affect me though .
Anyways its a very nice high , but thats just me , I strive to not to overdo it and become helplessly addicted and depressed .
Anyway 's I feel like napping right now .
Ronald Reagan said the most destructive thing to the American people that a president could say on his inaugural address ---1/20/81 .
Reagan :
In this present crisis Government is not the solution to our problem .
Government is the problem .
That statement caused fear and anger in Americans and painted a big fat target on the backs of the government so that he could attack it and so would the American people .
Good government is crucial in restoring this country to prosperity and as we have all witnessed , conservatism has indeed unleashed its destructive influence over every part of our society .
Obama 's response is right on ...
Obama insisted that only government could “ break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy , ” prevent “ the catastrophic failure of financial institutions , ” restart the flow of credit and restore the regulations needed to prevent such a crisis in the future .
This is government 's role .
When Reagan said that government was the problem , he made them the bogeyman instead of the life raft .
When we have a disaster like Hurricane Katrina , government should be there to rescue us , but with conservatives in control , people were left stranded to fend for themselves .
As much as I get ticked off with all this bipartisan talk , Obama understands that government can be the agent of hope in this time of crisis and thus will be reversing Reagan 's anti-government mantra .
This week 's Nintendo Wii update not only includes Evasive Space for WiiWare and NES shooter Life Force on the virtual console , but also a secret surprise clue that we need your help to decipher .

Nintendo's weekly announcement of new content for WiiWare and the Virtual console today came complete with news of a " fun surprise " that they were n't ready to reveal yet .
Great !
To make matters worse , they then go on to tease us for an entire paragraph .
We can't tell you the secret just yet but maybe we 'll offer you some hidden clues .
From AZ to NC , if you 're a fan , your applause could rattle your walls , windows , door .
You might enjoy this news whether you live in a brick house or Vanderbilt dorm .
Even people living along Route 286 in rural Pennsylvania ought to be excited .
It 'll feel like a bunch of birthday greetings and , really , who could ask for more ?
But that 's about all we can say for now , so be sure to check future Wii-kly Updates .

So what the hell does that mean ?
Could the clue lie in the abbreviations ?
Something about fans ?
Why is door a singular while windows and walls are n't ?
And what 's this about Route 286 ?
Looking it up on the internet I discovered that Route 296 encompasses Golden Mile Highway , Saltsburg Road , Washington Street , Salt Street , Main Street , Oakland Avenue , Philadelphia Street , and Franklin Street .
Does this mean anything , or am I barking up the wrong tree ?
If you find the whole thing too frustrating , at least there 's two shooters available this week to help let off some steam .
Check out the official descriptions for Life Force and Evasive Space below , while I slowly go insane .
Evasive Space™ ( Yukes Company of America , 1 - 4 players , Rated E for Everyone – Mild Fantasy Violence , 1,000 Wii Points ) : Launch a one - of - a - kind mission to rescue the stars .
The universe is going dark , and it's up to you , Konki the Stellar Guardian , to set things right .
Dr. Dark Matter and his roving band of space thieves have stolen many of the Constellation Stones that make up the heavens .
It 's time to suit up , power up , recover the Stones and once again bring light to the night sky .
Using the Wii Remote™ controller 's unique pointer capabilities , simply point and thrust Konki through 20 dangerous time - and collection - based missions in the harshest of environments .
Navigate through narrow , mazelike astral caves riddled with space worms , steam pipes and mining drills .
Explore vast space stations while avoiding turret fire , mines and huge crushing gears .
Weave through cluttered asteroid fields and gaseous planetary rings .
Evade the hazards , pick up precious items and ship upgrades , and save the Constellation Stones before the night sky is lost forever .
Life Force ( NES , 1 - 2 players , Rated E for Everyone – Mild Fantasy Violence , 500 Wii Points ) :
This classic shooter , originally ported to the NES in August 1988 , is a spin - off of the seminal Gradius series .
Pilot the Vic Viper through six stages of intense action , alternating between horizontally and vertically scrolling environments , and take on wave after wave of enemies .
Destroy particular enemies throughout the game ( which takes place within the body of an enormous alien ) to release power - up capsules and equip your ship with your choice of more powerful weapons , extra speed and shields .
Utilize the power - ups carefully , though , as a fearsome guardian lurks at the end of each stage and wo n't be easily defeated .
You can go it alone or bring along a friend to take on the challenge simultaneously .
Do you have what it takes to save your planet ?
Videogame controllers are typically rated on ergonomics , durability , and responsiveness -- though they sometimes get a few bonus points by looking especially cool .
The original NES game pad really did n't have any of those attributes going for it , but that did n't stop it from becoming a cultural icon , one that has inspired reproductions of all shapes and sizes .
The latest one varies not in dimensions but in composition : it 's made of soap .
Yes , this controller , which sells for just $ 8.25 , is designed for bath time fun , and what it lacks in functionality it makes up for with natural ingredients and lovely ( we presume ) fragrances that surely smell a good bit better than those musty hunks of discolored plastic you probably have stuffed in a box somewhere .

Olympia , Wash .
HALF a century ago , the conventional wisdom was that having a child was the surest way to build a happy marriage .
Women ’s magazines of that era promised that almost any marital problem could be resolved by embarking on parenthood .
Once a child arrives , “ we do n’t worry about this couple any more , ” an editor at Better Homes and Gardens enthused in 1944 .
“ There are three in that family now .
...
Perhaps there is not much more needed in a recipe for happiness . ”
Over the past two decades , however , many researchers have concluded that three ’s a crowd when it comes to marital satisfaction .
More than 25 separate studies have established that marital quality drops , often quite steeply , after the transition to parenthood .
And forget the “ empty nest ” syndrome : when the children leave home , couples report an increase in marital happiness .
But does the arrival of children doom couples to a less satisfying marriage ?
Not necessarily .
Two researchers at the University of California at Berkeley , Philip and Carolyn Cowan , report in a forthcoming briefing paper for the Council on Contemporary Families that most studies finding a large drop in marital quality after childbirth do not consider the very different routes that couples travel toward parenthood .
Some couples plan the conception and discuss how they want to conduct their relationship after the baby is born .
Others disagree about whether or when to conceive , with one partner giving in for the sake of the relationship .
And sometimes , both partners are ambivalent .
German scientist Otto H. Warburg 's theory on the origin of cancer earned him the Nobel Prize in 1931 , but the biochemical basis for his theory remained elusive .
His theory that cancer starts from irreversible injury to cellular respiration eventually fell out of favor amid research pointing to genomic mutations as the cause of uncontrolled cell growth .
Seventy - eight years after Warburg received science 's highest honor , researchers from Boston College and Washington University School of Medicine report new evidence in support of the original Warburg Theory of Cancer .
A descendant of German aristocrats , World War I cavalry officer and pioneering biochemist , Warburg first proposed in 1924 that the prime cause of cancer was injury to a cell caused by impairment to a cell 's power plant – or energy metabolism – found in its mitochondria .
In contrast to healthy cells , which generate energy by the oxidative breakdown of a simple acid within the mitochondria , tumors and cancer cells generate energy through the non-oxidative breakdown of glucose , a process called glycolysis .
Indeed , glycolysis is the biochemical hallmark of most , if not all , types of cancers .
Because of this difference between healthy cells and cancer cells , Warburg argued , cancer should be interpreted as a type of mitochondrial disease .
In the years that followed , Warburg 's theory inspired controversy and debate as researchers instead found that genetic mutations within cells caused malignant transformation and uncontrolled cell growth .
Many researchers argued Warburg 's findings really identified the effects , and not the causes , of cancer since no mitochondrial defects could be found that were consistently associated with malignant transformation in cancers .
Boston College biologists and colleagues at Washington University School of Medicine found new evidence to support Warburg 's theory by examining mitochondrial lipids in a diverse group of mouse brain tumors , specifically a complex lipid known as cardiolipin ( CL ) .
They reported their findings in the December edition of the Journal of Lipid Research .
Abnormalities in cardiolipin can impair mitochondrial function and energy production .
Boston College doctoral student Michael Kiebish and Professors Thomas N. Seyfried and Jeffrey Chuang compared the cardiolipin content in normal mouse brain mitochondria with CL content in several types of brain tumors taken from mice .
Bioinformatic models were used to compare the lipid characteristics of the normal and the tumor mitochondria samples .
Major abnormalities in cardiolipin content or composition were present in all types of tumors and closely associated with significant reductions in energy - generating activities .
The findings were consistent with the pivotal role of cardiolipin in maintaining the structural integrity of a cell 's inner mitochondrial membrane , responsible for energy production .
The results suggest that cardiolipin abnormalities " can underlie the irreversible respiratory injury in tumors and link mitochondrial lipid defects to the Warburg theory of cancer , " according to the co-authors .
These findings can provide insight into new cancer therapies that could exploit the bioenergetic defects of tumor cells without harming normal body cells .
Seyfried , Chuang and Kiebish were joined by co-authors Xianlin Han and Hua Cheng from the Washington University School of Medicine , Department of Internal Medicine , in St. Louis .

Dutch virtual world startup Virtual Fairground has raised $ 4 million and signed a license to publish a game based on the hit animated soccer TV show Galactik Football .
Amsterdam - based Virtual Fairground raised the money from an undisclosed angel investor .
It will create a Flash - based virtual world and massively multiplayer online game based on Alphanim ’s Galactik Football animated TV series .
Virtual Fairground will develop and publish the game and virtual world .
The first phase of the virtual world will be available to consumers in North America and Europe in April .
A full launch will happen in 2010 , the year of the next FIFA World Cup .
Glactik Football is produced by French animation studio Alphanim , a subsidiary of Gaumont Group .
The cartoon - animated story follows the progress of Snow Kids , a futuristic soccer team from the planet Akillian as they try to win the Galactik Football Cup .
The show is being aired in 100 countries .
The Virtual Fairground world will be set in the galaxy of Galactik Football and the company will bill the game and virtual world as a safe place for kids to congregate and play mini games or socialize .
It is targeted at kids around 13 or under .
The game will run within a web browser .
Virtual Fairgrounds has 25 employees .
It was founded in January , 2008 , and has offices in Amsterdam and Kiev , Ukraine .
The other day I was looking at pyjamas ( which bills itself as a GWT - like tool for Python ) .
I was also reminded of the semi-recent release of Objective - J .
Pyjamas , GWT , and Objective - J all hinge around a central concept : Abstracting away the authoring of JavaScript - heavy web applications by allowing the developer to program entirely in their natively language ( be it Python , Java , or an Objective - C- like - language accordingly ) .
This is a large abstraction – much more so than what is provided by most JavaScript libraries – you are programming in another language which is outputting JavaScript code .
You are likely to never see a DOM object or any pieces of the native JavaScript language .
I worry about large abstractions like this for a number of reasons .
When you use a pure - JavaScript library ( such as jQuery , Prototype , Dojo , Yahoo UI , etc. ) you are still programming using the JavaScript language .
In the case of jQuery a large number of users , who have either never programmed JavaScript before or never programmed before , acquire a good grasp of how to use JavaScript – accented by the use of the library .
A pure JavaScript library makes annoying tasks simple , the largest of which being cross - browser support .
It does nothing to dilute the quality of the JavaScript - authoring experience .
In fact I would argue that JavaScript libraries do much to give JavaScript a particular style and feel .
Code written with Prototype feels very different from code written with jQuery – and this is fine since it ’s giving the user the option to develop in the JavaScript language how they best see fit .
In the case of these language abstractions you are gaining none of the benefit of learning the JavaScript language .
When a leak in the abstraction occurs ( and it will occur – just as it ’s bound to occur in any abstraction ) what resources do you have , as a developer , to correct the problem ?
If you ’ve learned nothing about JavaScript then you stand no chance in trying to repair , or work around , the issue .
It could be stated that these tools could work well if a developer already has some knowledge of JavaScript but neither pyjamas nor GWT sell themselves as such ( Objective - J recommends , but does not require , some basic JavaScript knowledge ) .
I think such a developer ( one that has strong knowledge of both JavaScript and Java / Python / Objective - C and still feels compelled to use one of the abstractions ) does n’t really exist – at least not in any significant numbers .
A developer who is capable of authoring JavaScript code should naturally gravitate towards authoring as close to the final product as possible .
It will give them greater flexibility when developing and allow for the greatest amount of control .
A huge benefit of JavaScript is that it ’s a proverbial melting pot of experience .
Developers from all backgrounds code in it ( those who program Java , PHP , Perl , Ruby , . NET , or any other server - side language ) and it lends a lot to the style of JavaScript code that you see in the wild .
By writing in a single - language stack you miss out on this collaboration with other developers .
Java developers now only communicate other Java developers ( for example ) .
While this may be fine for some projects it certainly limits your range of experience that you can draw from .
All of this being said these stacks have some excellent features that you can draw on .
In the case of GWT you can use all of the normal Java - debugging techniques and continue to develop in your IDE of choice ( even including Eclipse integration ) .
Additionally since the framework has full control ( both client and server - side ) it can selectively send parts of the codebase depending on the browser .
This is very interesting and having this full stack for development makes it quite lucrative .
I should mention here that I ’m a creator of a JavaScript language abstraction : Processing.js .
You can write Canvas visualization using the Processing language ( no apparent JavaScript involved ) .
I included support for the straight Processing language for a single reason : Because it would allow for all the Processing demos to be able to run unchanged .
Beyond that I do n’t really see a good use for using the Processing language abstraction to author scripts .
Some people have done it but I do n’t really encourage it .
Instead you can use the full Processing API from JavaScript :
var p = Processing ( CanvasElement ) ; p.size ( 100 , 100 ) ; p.background(0 ) ; p.fill ( 255 ) ; p.ellipse ( 50 , 50 , 50 , 50 ) ;
I consider this to be a good compromise :
Take the good parts from one language and bring them to JavaScript to allow for the greatest amount of flexibility and control – without a massive abstraction .

Dear Cecil :
Why is it that if you film an act of prostitution and call it porn , suddenly it 's legal ?
The only difference I can see is that the male performer is also being paid , but that can't be the case for all pornography .
Adler , Toronto , Canada
Cecil replies :
Just imagine the arraignment :
The prosecutor says , “ Your honor , the video recording in question shows defendants Mr. Long and Ms. Luvzit engaging in coitus in what appears to be a baseball dugout .
Defendant Luvzit is wearing a cap , stirrup socks , and cleats , while defendant Long is dressed in the top half of an umpire ’s uniform .
After several minutes of explicit sexual activity , during which time defendant Luvzit is heard to moan , yell , and exhort defendant Long to continue ( repeatedly complimenting him on his “ command of the strike zone ” ) , defendant Long withdraws and ejaculates in full view of the camera . ”
The judge looks over to the defendants , whose lawyer leans back with his hands behind his head and exclaims with satisfaction , “ Now , that ’s acting ! ”
Cecil jokes , Adler , but it ’s for your own good .
You ’re not the first to propose this ingenious legal theory .
Back in the 1980s some law - enforcement types in LA got the bright idea that they could use California ’s pandering statute to run pornographers out of town .
Instead , they established a legal precedent that enshrined their state as the porn capital of the U.S .
The case in question involves porn producer - director Hal Freeman , auteur of more than 100 full - length classics including the immortal Caught From Behind .
In 1983 he made Caught From Behind II : The Sequel , and was charged and convicted under California ’s pandering law , which makes it a felony to “ [ procure ] another person for the purpose of prostitution . ”
But in 1988 his conviction was overturned by the California Supreme Court , which cited precedent establishing that “ for [ an act ] to constitute ‘ prostitution , ’ the genitals , buttocks , or female breast , of either the prostitute or the customer must come in contact with some part of the body of the other for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification of the customer or of the prostitute ” [ emphasis added ] .
The court found that the “ payment of acting fees was the only payment involved in the instant case .
. . .
There is no evidence that [ Freeman ] paid the acting fees for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification , his own or the actors ’ . ”
Thus , no prostitution .
Besides , the court went on , “ even if [ Freeman ’s ] conduct could somehow be found to come within the definition of ‘ prostitution ’ literally , the application of the pandering statute to the hiring of actors to perform in the production of a . . . motion picture would impinge unconstitutionally upon First Amendment values . ”
So Freeman ’s conviction was overturned , and making porn was effectively legalized in California .
Producers who once filmed surreptitiously in motel rooms were free to shoot with good lights and no fear of arrest .
Another triumph for the storied LAPD .
Not all jurisdictions define prostitution as narrowly as California does .
Next door in Arizona , for example , prostitution law was for years written to prohibit “ engaging in or agreeing or offering to engage in sexual conduct with another person under a fee arrangement with that person or any other person ” [ emphasis added ] .
In 1990 an Arizona appeals court thus upheld the prostitution conviction of one Laure Taylor , who managed and performed in a peep - show theater visited six times by Phoenix undercover police .
These were some diligent coppers .
The performers asked them to unzip and masturbate , to show their good faith , as it were , but somehow they managed to keep their weapons holstered while the girls got it on .
Then there ’s the case of Tom and Suzi Wahl , a married couple from Lake Saint Louis , Missouri .
Not to say they enjoyed the spotlight or anything , but in 1992 , the year after they were busted for selling pornographic videos ( the raid was later ruled illegal ) , Suzi applied for the job of police chief , and in 1997 Tom ran for mayor .
In 2001 they were arrested and convicted of prostitution by undercover cops attending one of their “ educational ” sex performances .
According to the Missouri statute , “ a person commits prostitution if he engages or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for something of value to be received by the person or by a third person ” [ emphasis once again added ] .
However prostitution is defined , courts are generally reluctant to restrain pornographers because of the First Amendment complications .
A publicity - crazy lawman can always make arrests and even get convictions , but it ’s foolish to do so without ironclad statutory language .
If a conviction is reversed like Hal Freeman ’s was , the result would be counterproductive at best .
As it stands , there ’s a big sign over California saying “ PORN PRODUCTION LEGAL HERE . ”
Only an idiot , a porn lover , or perhaps an Illinois governor would risk erecting another sign saying “ HERE TOO . ”

Now one of DreamWorks ' original benefactors , Paul Allen , has sold his stake in DreamWorks Animation , the separate publicly traded company that was spun off from DreamWorks proper in 2004 .
He owned 18 % of the company a year ago , but in according to the SEC filing submitted Friday ( and pasted below ) , Allen had sold off his entire stake by December 31 , the value of which The Hollywood Reporter estimates at $ 120 million .
It 's likely Allen needed the cash , considering that his cable company Charter Communications is on the verge of filing for bankruptcy , but The Hollywood Reporter notes that the profit Allen made from selling his DreamWorks stock wo n't be enough to make up for the $ 7 billion he 's lost through Charter .
So , what will be the next to go ?
Allen 's sports teams ?
His yacht ?
Leave your speculation and tips below .

Exhibit 2
NOTICE OF DISSOLUTION OF GROUP
Barrister and author Sir John Mortimer has died , his publisher said today .
Tony Lacey , his editor at Viking , said : " It 's hard to think he 's gone .
" At least we 're lucky enough to have Rumpole to remind us just how remarkable he was . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mortimer , the self - styled good - living " champagne socialist " , was a successful barrister , but an even more successful writer , and creator of the criminal defence lawyer Horace Rumpole , one of the great comic fictional characters of his generation .
Even in old age , Mortimer , although confined to a wheelchair , continued to write profusely , provocatively and amusingly , shamelessly destroying shibboleths , and even appearing on stage .
He enjoyed a cavalier but not malicious contempt for political correctness , feminism and the constant campaign for equality in everything .
On feminism , he once said : " It has become discriminatory .
All these things start out by wanting to be equal and end up by wanting to be on top . "
And when he was once asked whether men and women could communicate without gender getting in the way , he replied : " No , thank God for it .
Vive La Difference .
I think women do n't want to be sex objects , but I 'd love to be a sex object .
My own ambition is to be loved only for my body . "
Despite his commitment to socialism , Mortimer was often highly critical of Tony Blair 's Labour Government , often targeting the prime minister himself with damaging barbs .
Once he said : " Blair is a not very impressive politician , playing at being a statesmen .
Tell him to stop pretending to be a mini-Churchill and to calm down . "
John Clifford Mortimer was born on April 21 , 1923 .
His father was a prominent divorce lawyer .
" He told me to go and divorce people , which was really quite easy . "
He was educated at Harrow and Brasenose College , Oxford and called to the Bar in 1948 .
The following year he married Penelope Ruth Fletcher .
The marriage was dissolved in 1972 and she died in 1999 .
He subsequently married Penelope Gollop .
Mortimer actually regretted having read law at Oxford .
" Knowing the law is not much help for an advocate , " he said .
" In fact it is a bit of a disadvantage .
Cramps your style . "

After graduating he got a job at Pinewood Studios as a script writer , when it was home to Noel Coward , David Niven and Dickie Attenborough during the Second World War .
" I made £ 11 a week and had a flat in Chelsea and I had a really good time .
Some of the happiest years of my life .
We used to go to parties and wait for the bombs to fall on someone else . "
His famous court appearances included the Oz censorship trial , the Linda Lovelace so - called Deep Throat case and numerous others involving alleged pornography .
His style of cross-examination was always to charm and not to badger .
As a lawyer he was a traditionalist .
" If you are about to be sent down for life , you do n't want someone in a T - shirt , jeans and trainers doing it .
You want the whole works . "
He was also pro-fox - hunting , in favour of the Royal family , but " against " religion .
He always said he " loved " foreigners and was " all for " homosexuality .
But despite his success as a barrister , Mortimer always considered the law to be a way to support his true love - writing .
He thought of the law really as nothing other than a day job , " like girls who want to be actresses " .
Even so , did enjoy acclaim as a barrister , especially for his successful defences in censorship cases .
He also represented many divorce clients and murderers during his barrister years .
He always said he much preferred the murderers .
" I found criminal clients easy and matrimonial clients hard .
Matrimonial clients hate each other so much and use their children to hurt each other in beastly ways .
Murderers have usually killed the one person in the world that was bugging them and they 're usually quite peaceful and agreeable . "
But he said the law gave him great insights .
" People will go to endless trouble to divorce one person and then marry someone who is exactly the same , except probably a bit poorer and a bit nastier .
I do n't think anybody learns anything . "
He always regarded writing as being much harder than being a lawyer .
But he did admit that writing had rather less disastrous results .
" If you write a bad book , no one goes to prison which is rather a relief . "
Rumpole , his most famous character , was created in the mid-1970s and was , most people think , based on his stern father .
His motto was : " Never plead guilty . "
These famous stories were a massive success on television .
Mortimer also wrote several memoir novels , such as Summer 's Lease , Paradise Postponed , Titmuss Regained , and Dunster , with numerous plays , film scripts and television dramas , including an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh 's Brideshead Revisited .
But Rumpole was by far and away his most famous character .
A bewigged barrister , but not a Queen 's Counsel , with a passion for cheap wine ( " Chateau Thames Embankment " ) and a dedication to criminal defence .
He became hugely popular on television , solving droll mysteries with barely a twitch of his stiff upper lip .
Rumpole 's wife , Hilda , was always known as " she who must be obeyed " .
The Rumpole stories dealt with all sorts of issues , like euthanasia , fox - hunting , devil worship and children in care , but not at all in a pompous or preaching kind of way .
His stories were as funny as his earlier performances in court as a barrister , where once a judge gently rebuked him by telling him the courts were not supposed to be places of entertainment .
Mortimer was an early - morning writer - and drinker as well , regularly having a glass of champagne first thing in the day .
He started writing at about 5 am and by midday , he reverted to imbibing .
He always said writers had to be ruthless .
" Your material is your life .
So anybody who lives with you has the danger of being in books all the time .
When I have quarrels with my wife , which does n't happen very often , " he once said , " I write down her dialogue and give it to Hilda ( Rumpole 's wife ) . "
He received a CBE in 1986 and was knighted in 1998 .
( CNN ) --
Two crew members were taken to a hospital after a FedEx cargo plane crashed on landing Tuesday morning at the Lubbock , Texas , airport , officials said .
A damaged FedEx ATR - 42 lies beside a runway early Tuesday at the Lubbock , Texas , airport .
The injuries appeared to be minor , said James Loomis , director of Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport .
There was a small fire on the plane , the Federal Aviation Administration and FedEx spokeswoman Sandra Munoz said .
Munoz said she was not sure about the extent of the damage .
The plane is an ATR - 42 twin - turboprop aircraft and landed short of the touchdown zone at 4:37 a.m. CT ( 5:47 ET ) , Loomis said .
Munoz said the plane had been traveling from Fort Worth Alliance Airport and skidded off the runway amid light freezing rain .
iReport.com : Are you there ?
Send photos , video
Neither official could immediately say what caused the accident , and Munoz did n't know why parts of the plane caught fire .
The plane was operated by Empire Airways , which is under contract with FedEx Corp. , based in Memphis , Tennessee .

Fired over 1.30 Euros Supermarket Cashier Becomes German Anti-Capitalist Hero
Barbara E. was fired for allegedly stealing 1.30 euros .
Now , the German media has transformed a 50 - year - old supermarket cashier into a national hero .
Even senior German politicians have voiced their solidarity .
A simple question ; what is that red dot on the map ?
I was looking at the CONUS map browser depicting the 2008 temperature departure from normal provided by NOAA ’s High Plains Regional Climate Center and noticed something odd :
Click for a larger image
Note the red dot in Arizona , which is the only one in the USA .
Truly an anomaly .
At first I thought it might be University of Arizona Tucson and its famous parking lot station , but that is further southeast .
The other map depiction HPRCC offers also shows it , and narrows it to a single data point :
Click for a larger image
HPRCC allows us to zoom in to the regional level to get a better handle on the location :
Unfortunately , I have not found any tools on the HPRCC website that will identify this station ID .
I can narrow down the location to Pinal County Arizona , and using some crude graphical tools I can approximate the lat / lon of the red dot to be : 32.9 , - 111.4 .
This puts it near the town of Florence , AZ .
Doing a search in NCDC ’s MMS database for all stations in Pinal county , I find that there is indeed a COOP station # 23027 in Florence , and more importantly , it is part of the “ A ” sub -network , which makes it a climate reporting station .
According the NCDC MMS database the lat lon for Florence COOP station is 33.0363 ,-111.388 so it is not very far away from my crude lat / lon estimate as seen in this Google Earth view :
Further searching the NCDC MMS database tells me that the station is “ current ” and that the station has an MMTS temperature unit equipped with a newer NIMBUS LCD display , and a standard rain gauge .
Using the Location tab of the NCDC MMS database I find the station is located at :
Location Description : 1206 MAIN STREET WITHIN AND 0.1 MI NW OF PO AT FLORENCE , AZ Prior to that it was located at : 1707 S WILLOW ST , WITHIN AND 0.4 MI SW OF PO AT FLORENCE , AZ
So , I put that address into Google Web Search and found this in the FCC database for a tower registration :
1206 Main St ( Lat : 33.020056 Lon : - 111.384000 ) , Call Sign : WRA544 Assigned Frequencies : 155.475 MHz Grant Date : 04/19/1999 , Expiration Date : 07/05/2004 , Cancelation Date : 09/26/2004 Registrant : Florence , Town Of , 130 Main St , Florence , AZ 85232 , Phone : ( 602 ) 868-5873
So it appears the location is some city owned property , which makes sense , since COOP stations are often located at places that are staffed 24/7 ( so somebody can take a reading once a day ) and many city offices are .
The lat / lon is fairly close to what the COOP coordinates are , but not quite close enough .
The street address is about a half mile south of the lat / lon listed in the NCDC database :
The new location is at about 500 Main Street , rather than the 1206 Main Street listed in the NCDC MMS database .
Perhaps it has been moved to a new location and NCDC has not caught up with the street address change .
Perhaps the lat / lon is off .
Anything is possible as I and the surfacestation volunteers constantly find discrepancies and errors in the database .
So I decided to use the new Google Street Level View feature to snoop around a bit at the two locations .
I found nothing at 1206 S. Main Street except a lot of grass and buildings .
It looks like perhaps a community college :
Click for an interactive view from Google Maps
But when I went looking around 500 Main Street – BINGO !
I can spot both the MMTS sensor unit and the standard rain gauge to the west of the street :
Click for an interactive view from Google Maps
Looking at an aerial view using NCDC ’s most current coordinates of 33.0363 ,-111.388 and Microsoft Live Search Maps , we can see what surrounds the sensor :
Click for a larger image
Click for an MS Live Maps interactive view
You can just barely make out the MMTS in the aerial view .
In the street level view , it looks as if some crushed rock has been laid down near the sensor and it is fairly fresh .
But more importantly , look at what surrounds the sensor :
Main Street with it ’s traffic .
Buildings North , South , and West within about 10 - 30 yards
Parking lots West and East .
The one East has quite an albedo .
In the Arizona sun I ’m sure it gets quite toasty in full sun .
It is possible this station was recently moved from the south Main Street location to the North Main Street location , which may be a warmer location , I do n’t know for certain because I ca n’t locate any imagery of the sensor at 1206 South Main Street .
Further research is needed to pin that down .
This is neither a USHCN station nor a GISS station .
It is also not the only possibility for the station that produced the red dot in the HPRCC map
There is another nearby COOP “ A ” sub -network station at the Casa Grande National Monument run by the US Park Service , COOP station # 21314 :
Location Description : CASA GRANDE RUINS NATL MON OUTSIDE AND 1.7 MILES NW OF PO AT COOLIDGE AZ
Its lat / lon of 32.9947,-111.5367 is also close to my original crude estimate of 32.9 , - 111.4
You can see the red dot is question and it ’s nearest neighbor here in this closeup of the HPRCC southwest US dot map :
When I plot both stations in Google Earth and compare to the HPRCC map above , it appears that the yellow dot lines up with Casa Grande , AZ and the red dot lines up with Florence , AZ .
My original lat / lon estimate is the white marker :
Click for a larger image
The Casa Grande COOP station also has some interesting issues that could be responsible for a temperature rise there .
Comparing aerial images on the Google Earth and Microsoft Live Search maps , which are taken at different times by different vendors , show us that it appears the parking lot for the visitor center has recently been resurfaced :
Above : Casa Grande National Monument via Microsoft Live Search Maps – Click for a larger image
Above : Casa Grande National Monument via Google Earth – Click for a larger image
Since I have no time reference for the photos , it is also entirely possible that I have the sequence reversed and the parking lot has faded with time .
But since I do n’t see any significant vegetation changes nor other changes in the landscape between the two photos , and since fading usually takes a couple of years , I ’m betting that we are seeing a resurface job , which can appear in a couple of days .
I would expect more differences in vegetation or other changes if the pictures were taken years apart .
I think I can make out the Cotton region Shelter on the Google Earth image , just south of the visitor center .
There is a street level view of the visitor center parking lot , which you can examine for yourself , but there are no weather instruments visible .
But there is another twist , according to the NCDC database , the station has recently been converted from a Cotton Region Shelter with max - min thermometers to the MMTS system , with the CRS maintained as backup instrument , So the MMTS may be closer to the building and / or the parking lot :
Click for a larger image
But on 10 - 18-2007 it appears the CRS was removed as a backup instrument .
The picture above may be the only photographic record of it ’s placement .
As we have seen time and time again , the MMTS often gets closer to buildings due to trenching issues and cabling , so it may have introduced a bias in this station due to the placement change .
It may not , I do n’t know for certain since I ca n’t spot the MMTS at Casa Grande .
I also thought perhaps there may be a large amount of missing data in the observer B91 forms that could account for the anomaly .
I checked both Florence and Casa Grande B91 observer forms at NCDC and they both appear current and well populated with data in the last year , you can search for B91 forms yourself here :
http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/coop/coop.html
I did note though that the Florence form changed in appearance from May of this year to November .
It went from hand written to typed , which suggests an observer / location change :
Casa Grande B91 11-2008 Florence B91 Form 05-2008 Florence B91 Form 11-2008 ( PDF files )
So we have two possible candidates for the station that made the red dot .
Both have potential placement issues .
It makes you wonder how many more of the dots in the HPRCC map have issue like this .
I only spotted this one because it was such a large singular anomaly .
I ’ll check with HPRCC on Monday to see if they can identify the dot ’s data origin for me .
In the meantime I need help from our readers and volunteers .
Can anyone living in Arizona get photographs of these stations for me ?

The practical value of the study of rural sociology is widely recognised today .
As long as the villages and the rural society assume importance , the rural sociology shall continue to acquire importance .
The value of rural sociology can be understood by the following points :
1. Rural Population is in Majority :
The world 's is more rural than urban .
More than two - third of people of the world live in villages .
It is the village that forms the basis of society .
Rural sociology is inevitable for the study of the majority of the population .
2.Intimate Relationship between the Land and Man : Man is born out of land and his entire culture depends on it .
Land has been the part of and parcel of human life .
Progress starts from the village .
The type of land partially conditions the type of society and the opportunities for human development .
This close relationship between man and land has also been recognised by economists and political scientists .
3. Villages and Rural Life from the Source of Population : Cities normally grow out of towns and villages .
No city can come into existence all of a sudden without having a rural background .
A village , when improved and thickly populated , becomes a town or city .
Thus it is the village population that forms the source of urban life .
4. Psychological Approach to the Rural Life : Rural progress , rural reconstruction or improvement of rural societies is possible only when the people have correct idea about the rural way of life and problems .
Rural sociology touches upon the rural psychology and provides a good understanding of the rural people and their society .

We got through Christmas without having NORAD accidently blow Santa out of the sky , but do n’t let your guard down yet .
While visions of sugarplums danced in our heads , the Pentagon flew another escalation strategy under the radar .
On the eve of Christmas Eve , Dexter Filkins of the New York Times reported “ Taking a page from the successful experiment in Iraq , American commanders and Afghan leaders are preparing to arm local militias to help in the fight against a resurgent Taliban . ”
Merry Christmas , fellow citizens .
Odds are now almost certain that your country will be in a state of war throughout your lifetimes , and possibly throughout your children ’s lifetimes as well .
They Lied With Their Boots On
It ’s hard to be surprised any more when the NYT echoes the Pentagon ’s G.I. jingo , but the experience of watching the newspaper of record cut and paste phrases like “ a page from the successful experiment in Iraq ” is aging poorly .
From the outset , a key component of the surge strategy was the propaganda piece that would make it sound “ successful ” regardless of how it went .
As in the principles of war , “ objective ” is a prime tenet of information operations ; but there ’s a difference between the way objectives work in warfare and how they ’re used in propaganda .
In warfare — theoretically , anyway — the objective is supposed to be straightforward and tangible , and all operations and tactics should support the primary goal .
In information operations , the objective , at least the stated one , is so vague and flexible that it does n’t need to have anything at all to do with the actual military operation .
In fact , it ’s best if it does n’t ; the less any statement meant for public consumption has to do with reality , the greater freedom of movement the information operator ( aka “ bull feather merchant ” or “ BFM ” ) has .
When Bill Kristol pal Fred Kagan and the rest of the neocons at the American Enterprise Institute rammed their surge strategy past the Joint Chiefs ’ tonsils , the BFMs had to justify escalating the war to the public .
Too many brass hats had admitted there was no military solution to the Iraq fiasco , so the “ political unification ” canard was adopted .
Political unification has proven to be as elusive as Saddam Hussein ’s weapons of mass destruction ; with the provincial elections just a stone ’s throw away , there ’s talk of a coup to oust Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki .
That ’s been no problem for the BFMs , though ; looking ahead , they nested the “ security ” piece of the puzzle in the original mission statement : establish security in order to allow political unity to come about .
Since some measure of decreased violence has been achieved in Iraq , the BFMs can point to it as proof of the surge ’s success , and be reasonably confident no one will remember that improving security was the task , not the goal .
They can also be fairly sure that not too many folks will ask hard questions about how that “ security ” was achieved .
In his three tours of duty in Iraq , David Petraeus has followed the same operational formula : he hands out a lot of weapons , bribes everybody he gave the weapons to not to use them , and transfers the heck out of Dodge before the time bombs he set blow off his successors ’ thumbs and noses ( Hey , what ’s this ? ) .
Four months after Petraeus turned over command of a “ tamed ” Mosul , the city ’s police chief defected and insurgents overran the city .
When Petraeus was in charge of training Iraqi security forces , his recruits disappeared into the desert night along with about 190,000 AK - 47 rifles and pistols .
As commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq , he created “ Awakening Councils , ” groups of former Sunni militants that Filkins says “ are credited by American officials as one of the main catalysts behind the steep reduction in violence there . ”
More that 100,000 of these former anti-U.S. guerillas have been armed to armpits and put on the dole so they wo n’t attack Nuri al Maliki ’s government forces .
Creating the Awakening Councils was the single dumbest thing — among a field of highly qualified contenders for the title — that we ’ve done in Iraq , and now , it ’s one of the most compelling reasons for us to stay there forever : if we leave , the gravy spigot runs dry , and all our beautiful ugliness will melt out the drain pipe when the Sunni gunmen go back to their old line of business .
And thus it is that our catalyst of victory is the machinery of our failure ; we ’ve succeeded so well in Iraq that we must stay there always .
Permanent occupation of Iraq was the operational and strategic objective all along , of course , even before 9/11 , even before young Mr. Bush was selected to head the neoconservative ticket .
But the BFMs are still doing a good job of keeping the system from acquiring that target .
Hell No , They Wo n’t Go
They ’re also doing a good job of camouflaging what the junta is up to these days .
As of December 28 , Barack Obama ’s web site still promises to phase “ combat troops ” out of Iraq in 16 months .
His Secretary of Defense and top generals must not have looked at his web site lately .

Retired Marine General James L. Jones , the incoming National Security Adviser , and ongoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates , and legacy Joint Chiefs chairman Admiral Mike Mullen are all on record as being opposed to withdrawal timelines .
Jones has said a timeline would be “ against our national interest . ”
Mullen warned that a deadline would be “ dangerous , ” and Gates objected to the 16 - month plan during the presidential campaign .
General Ray Odierno , commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq and boy sidekick to David Petraeus , recently announced that U.S. troops would stay on in Iraqi cities beyond the summer deadline called for in the Status of Forces agreement .
Gates , who was on a tour of the region blaming Iran for everything wrong in the world , did n’t say boo about Odierno ’s public defiance of the agreement .
That ’s not surprising .
In a recent article Foreign Affairs article , Gates Wrote , “ there will continue to be some kind of U.S. advisory and counterterrorism effort in Iraq for years to come . ”
From the tenor of the rest of the piece , it sounded like he meant “ years to come after 2011 . ”
The BFM work - around to ignoring international agreements and mandates from the commander in chief is pure magic :
Q : When are armed troops in a combat zone not combat troops ?
A : When we call them something else .
Presto , change -o , give them a different name and grind the new president ’s campaign promises into his eye like a broken whiskey bottle .
Maybe the BFM expression for that sort of thing is “ following orders from the bottom up . ”
The folks who brought us war without end in Iraq are rolling out advance publicity of their planned sequel set in the Bananastans , and nobody , including Barack Obama , seems to notice or care .
In propaganda art that ’s called “ desensitizing . ”
Maybe we used up what was left of our national outrage on the Iran strike that never happened .
Or maybe we have this waifish notion that Barack Obama could n’t possibly let a bad thing like Iraq happen again .
Could he ?
He sure is n’t stepping up to the plate on this Gaza atrocity , is he ?
Maybe he ’s waiting for the Pentagon to give him permission .

An expert on girls ' education became Saudi Arabia 's first woman minister on Saturday as part of a wide - ranging cabinet reshuffle by King Abdullah that swept aside several bastions of ultra-conservatism .
Nora bint Abdullah al - Fayez , a US - educated former teacher , was made deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students , a significant breakthrough in a country where women are not allowed to drive .
" This is an honour not only for me but for all Saudi women .
In the presence of a comprehensive operational team , I believe I 'll be able to face challenges and create positive change , " she told Arab News .
Fayez said she would study the state of girls ' education in Saudi Arabia before commenting on the task before her .
In his first reshuffle since assuming the throne in 2005 , King Abdullah also replaced two powerful enemies of reform , the chief of the Saudi religious police , Sheikh Ibrahim al - Ghaith , and the country 's most senior judge , Sheikh Salih Ibn al - Luhaydan .
Ghaith , who runs the commission for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice , known as the mutawa , which enforces bans on alcohol and drugs , has gained a reputation for brutality .
Luhaydan ruled last year that it was permissible to kill owners of satellite television channels broadcasting " immoral " programmes .
Several other hardline judges were sacked as part of a challenge against the kingdom 's hardline religious establishment .
The grand Ulema commission , an influential grouping of religious scholars , will be reconfigured and opened to moderate clerics , breaking the grip of the ultra - conservatives .
King Abdullah also appointed a new head of a 150 - seat consultative body , the Shura council , and replaced his ministers of education , health , justice and information .
Abdul Aziz al - Khoja , the new information minister , said : " The most important thing is that the kingdom 's voice should reach the entire world , convey the message of peace and stability and portray the kingdom 's stance of moderation , tolerance and flexibility . "
He told the Saudi Gazette he was open to debate with the country 's journalists and intellectuals , adding : " I welcome their opinions and suggestions because they constitute the pillar of the Saudi media and represent the shining face of the country within and outside the kingdom . "
The reshuffle was broadly welcomed in the Saudi press , with the Saudi Gazette calling it a " boost for reform " and al - Hayat describing the changes as " bold reform " .
Saudi schools have long been criticised as breeding grounds for extremism , and the monarchy 's western allies are likely to claim the reshuffle as a sign that the kingdom has the capacity to reform itself .
" This is the true start of the promises of reform , " said Jamal Khashoggi , editor of al - Watan newspaper .
" They bring not only new blood , but also new ideas . "
IN WHAT may be his boldest move so far , Sweden 's Fredrik Reinfeldt has shredded a central part of the election manifesto on which his centre - right government fought the election in 2006 .
The four parties in his coalition have long been split over nuclear power .
So they agreed in the manifesto to keep all matters atomic off the agenda until their term expired in 2010 .
But a combination of tight climate - change targets , energy - security worries and a wobbly economy has now caused a rethink .
On February 5th Mr Reinfeldt unveiled a plan to reverse Sweden 's 30 - year ban on building new nuclear capacity .
The new pro-nuclear policy is echoed in some of Sweden 's neighbours .
On the very day that Mr Reinfeldt announced his proposals Fortum , a Finnish energy group , lodged an application to build a new nuclear plant .
This would be the country 's sixth .
Four are in operation and a fifth ( the world 's largest ) is under construction at Olkiluoto .
On the southern shore of the Baltic Sea , Poland plans two nuclear - power stations to reduce its dependence on coal .
The Poles are also talking to Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia about a joint consortium to build a replacement for Lithuania 's outdated Ignalina nuclear - power complex .
Only the Danes and , to a lesser extent , the Germans are still anti-nuclear .
Mr Reinfeldt and his coalition partners should have little difficulty getting the necessary legislation through the Swedish parliament next month .
But broad cross -party support would still be desirable to provide stability and ward off any risk of a policy reversal by a future government .
So the leftist opposition has been invited to talks to mull over an energy package that also includes measures to cut carbon emissions and boost renewable energy .
But like the centre - right , the left is divided over nuclear power : the Social Democrats are split , while the Greens and the Left Party are firmly against .
Jan Björklund , the pro-nuclear education minister , has appealed to the opposition to “ throw the battle - axe in the lake ” and get on board for the sake of Swedish industry and the climate .
But the opposition doubts the sincerity of such appeals .
It claims to have been asking the government to discuss energy for almost three years but to have been ignored .
“ Now they just want us to rubber - stamp a done deal , ” comments one opposition figure .
There are suspicions that the government may be using its nuclear plan as a way of sowing discord within the opposition just as it is trying to formulate a joint platform for the 2010 election .
Whatever the truth , the Social Democrats are unlikely to sign up to a deal involving the construction of as many as ten new nuclear plants .
So some shrinking of the government 's ambitions may be necessary .
But Mr Reinfeldt will not give up without a fight .
He has already scored a strategic victory by persuading the Centre Party ( a junior coalition member ) to revoke its 1980 decision to phase out nuclear power .
Maud Olofsson , the Centre Party leader , admits she may not like it , “ but we can live with the fact that nuclear power will be part of Swedish electricity production for the foreseeable future . ”
To Mr Reinfeldt 's advantage , many Swedes seem to reason similarly .
A Novus Group opinion poll taken after the energy plan was announced found 57 % of respondents agreeing that it should be possible to replace old nuclear plants with new .
Fully 70 % said they thought the government 's energy package as a whole was good .
But opposition leaders are sceptical .
“ That poll was commissioned by the pro-nuclear lobby .
We have polls of our own and they say something else , ” says one .
Subject : Mormon financial clerks , any one ever a clerk ?
Date : Dec 30 , 2008 Author : Phil
I do n't know why no one has ever talked about the ward finances if they were ever a financial clerk for the ward or not .
I wanted to know what ward budgets are like .
How much funds are raised in a year for a ward and how much is spent in the ward .
I 'm assuming wards only spend like 10 % of their income and they send the rest back to headquarters .
But i was never a clerk so does anyone know ?
Examples : [ Ward is a Mormon congregation of around 600 members on the rolls and about 200 - 250 ( or less ) active members .
The size of a ward varies dramatically based on activity .
Some wards can be quite small or large due to geography or location in the US ]
Salt Lake City Ward : Tithing donations averaged just a touch over $ 500,000.00 for a year .
Again , on average , the various missionary , education and temple project funds garnered about $ 17,000.00 to 20,000.00 and Fast offering ran $ 25,000.00 to 30,000.00 .
California : Our ward was relatively affluent in So Cal .
We took in about $ 950,000 in total contributions .
Our Ward allotment from the stake was around $ 8000 .
All the utilities are paid by the stake .
The 8000 was basically to run ward programs and activities .
The 950,000 included all tithing , fast offering , missionary , .. etc...
[ The majority of the $ 950,000 stayed in the Salt Lake City corporate headquarters .
The Mormon church does not publish or release how these vast sums of money are spent . ]
A less affluent Ward : I was in a ward that was mostly retired and blue collar members ...
I was involved in tithing settlement total donations were nearly 200,000 .
The following years tapered off a little due to economy and move outs .
We would send as much as 5,000 in tithes to Salt Lake in a good week ... then watch the bishop agonize over giving someone a $ 100 in groceries .
California affluent : I was in one of the most affluent wards in California .
We took in $ 25 - 50,000 a week in tithes alone .
Our annual ward budget from Salt Lake was a measly $ 7-8,000 a year !
Student Ward in Utah : I was the clerk of a STUDENT ward in Logan Utah during the mid 1990's .
I do n't remember specific numbers but we took in something like $ 250 k in tithing in a year .
I remember thinking something along the lines of : " Wow , there are six student wards in just this one building .
That 's significantly more than $ 1 M per year just from this one building . "
A lower income ward :
We are in a lower income area and send in around 400K / year and our ward budget is around 4 K / year .
Nearly every week the bishop comes in to the clerk 's office , anxious to find out what the fast offering total is ...
But it churns my gut every time , as we deposit around $ 10,000 every Sunday , to see how it kills the bishop to consent to pay someone 's electric bill .
Another example : Seven years ago , we brought in about $ 15,000 per week [ $ 750,000 / yr ] and our allotment back from SLC was about $ 7,000 for the year .
This is just an estimate as the Mormon church does not publish its finances .
It appears in the US , the Mormon church takes in $ 5 - 8 billion a year in tithing alone .
It gives out less than $ 65 million ( less than 1.3 % of tithing income ) in humanitarian aid .
It gives back to local congregations ( wards ) less than 1.5 % for their activities .
This does not include income from the many business ventures the Mormon church owns which may well more than double what it receives in tithing .

The wards do not receive budget from the members .
All money that comes in goes upstream to the church .
The wards then get a budget allotment from headquarters based on average sacrament meeting attendance the last month of each quarter .
I do not know the multiplier for figuring the allotment .
Subject : Re : financial clerks , any one ever a clerk ?
I was Date : Dec 30 00:35 Author : confused
The budget is based on the number of actively participating membership .
The Stake then issues a budget which is divided between YM , YW , Scouts , RS , EQ , HP , Lbrary , Office ( general usage materials ) and others as needed .
At the end of the year , the budget is reassessed and depending on usage , the numbers may go up or not increase .
Part of my duties was to send out quarterly budget reports to each auxiliary so that they could keep track .
As there are no longer fund - raisers , the money is made through tithes and then are allotted to each Stake / Ward from SLC .
Subject : Yes , and one thing that really bugged me Date : Dec 30 01:01 Author : confused
was when I was working on the Budget one year , I also printed out my tithing settlement report .
I donated to the ward the same amount that was in our ward budget .
I figured there were at least an average of 80 people who donated about the same so SLC got all the extra and kept it .
To answer your question , at tithing settlement all of the donors are compiled and a report is sent to the Stake with a summary of all donations .
They submit that to SLC who in turn determine how much we get for budgets based on attendance , income ( tithe payers ) and the previous years usage .
Fast offerings are not in this equation - they remain in the stake , or are credited to the stake for welfare purposes .

Until seven years ago , I belonged to one of the stakes in Olympus Cove .
( Salt Lake City : East Bench / Millcreek Area )
I was the ward clerk for 3 years , then I quit the church .
A very wealthy area , but light on young Mormon families .
Ward Census was about 260 with an average age of about 60 and Sacrament meeting attendance at about 35 % .
There may be a few of you that remember my old posts about the " Eyring Prophecy . "
To the topic : Tithing donations averaged just a touch over $ 500,000.00 , Again , on average , the various missionary , education and temple project funds garnered about $ 17,000.00 to 20,000.00 and Fast offering ran $ 25,000.00 to 30,000.00 .
Budget at that time came from the Stake on a Quarterly basis at $ 9 times the average Sacrament meeting attendance for the previous quarter .
Which meant our ward budget was just a bit over $ 4,200.00 per year average .
We had extra ( prohibited ) fundraisers for youth conference and all that stuff .
All of the money that came into the clerk 's office went right to Church HQ .
We had a check book ( drawn on a " Corporation " account ) to pay the telephone bills , buy copier paper , buy stuff for ward parties etc. and we also wrote checks each year for $ 12,000.00 - 15,000.00 worth of " welfare " :
Helping ward members with utility bills , Cobra payments , etc. for people who were out of work or had some other crisis .

Each week our new church prints the financial issues of the church in the program .
It lists the money , to the penny , that they take in the week before .
All of the money is used in our local church or given to one of the many ministries .
All of these things are disclosed to the congregation .
Next week we will be going over our yearly budget , and everything will be disclosed .
All members are allowed to vote on the budget .
Wow , what a difference ?

I was in a ward that was mostly retired and blue collar members .
There was one professional in our ward .
the first year I was involved in tithing settlement total donations were nearly 200,000 .
The following years tapered off a little due to economy and move outs .
We would send as much as 5,000 in tithes to Salt Lake in a good week .
Then watch the bishop agonize over giving someone a $ 100 in groceries .
The stake paid the utilities on the ward building .
The church building person took care of building maintenance .
The ward had use of fast offering funds and a ward budget
of about $ 5,000 a year .
I think the bishopric and I were the only members of the ward that knew the numbers .
I now attend a church that has a yearly business meeting where a financial statement of all donations and expenditures are given to all members .
97 % of all donations remain in the congregation .
3 % goes to support district higherups .
The congregation partially supports 14 missionaries scattered all over the world .
Some of these have been missionaries 25 years .
A lifetime dedication not a one or two year pat myself on on the back mission .
We had a halloween party and invited the community it turned out really nice .
There was probably $ 1,000 put into the party .

I have been a clerk three times .
Twice prior to the consolidation of funding , and once since .
Regarding voting on budget expenditures , I recall approx .
30 years ago when the Bishop got up in a combined meeting ( all adults ) and reviewed the costs and budgets for the coming year , including estimated budget donations ( not tithing ) and costs ( utilities , books , etc. , etc. ) .
We discussed programs and various organizations , projected activities and their costs , etc .
At that point , when we had spent quite some time with the budget , we voted .
Note this was only on budget , not tithing , fast offerings , etc .
You will never see those days again .
Fast offerings stay local , for all intents and purposes , with specific guidelines provided by Salt Lake .
Tithing , on the other hand , is a black hole .
No visibility , and it SUCKS !

Most wards transmit straight to AMEX financial services via modem .
The money is counted and tallied - the connection is made , the transmission is sent to AMEX and then the deposit is made that same day ( Sunday ) .
In my ward , we did n't have a working modem - so we called a toll free number and read the figures to an AMEX employee on the other end ( yes - working on Sunday ) - then made the deposit .
Seven years ago , we brought in about $ 15,000 per week and our allotment back from SLC was about $ 7,000 for the year .

That is quite the racket that the mafia bosses in the Church Office Building are running .
It would be interesting to see what these crooks are really doing with the money .
I often look at people like General Robert C. Oaks who supposedly has impeccable morals and wonder why he is working with the unethical thugs in SLC via the Quorum of the Seventy .
It really shakes a person 's faith in humanity when a man who takes the following oath will participate in the fraud of Mormonism : " We will not lie , steal or cheat , nor tolerate among us anyone who does .
Furthermore , I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably , so help me God . "
Subject : No relation between tithing paid and ward budget Date : Dec 30 16:31 Author : lump
As has been stated , the amount that is collected in tithing really has no bearing on the amount of $ $ received by the Stake for running ward programs .
Typically , the Sacrament Meeting attendance for the months of March , June , September , and December are used by the stake to determine what each ward will receive for an operating budget .
This process is unrelated to tithing $ $ collected .

About the 1988 or 1989 time frame .
No oath of secrecy that I recall .
Ya just do n't talk , it would be unseemly .
After all church matters are sacred and must never be questioned or the facts prostituted before the masses .
I was very impressed with how much money a very average ward sucks in and sends to Salt Lake City .
All the bux do add up .
Given all that I find it incomprehensible that LDS Inc. can't afford a janitor or offer real aid for locals .
Where in the heck does all that money go ?
And I served before the billion dollars mall .
At the end of my tenure I stopped paying tithing ( in December ! not so great timing ) so that I could buy a bed that my wife needed after our daughter was born .
As I look back , it was a great investment , and a small payment against many mistakes of what I now understand as abandonment to conduct church duties .
For some reason they no longer wanted my services after I bailed on a month of tithing .
I did n't exactly feel like it was a curse to get booted and left with a smile , though silly me would have continued if they had wanted .
Some time later , before we moved , I first visited a local Unitarian - Universalist congregation .
It was so foreign to a BIC Mormon it was hard to understand .
Kind of like Plato 's allegory of leaving the cave and finding the light blinding .
But I did get that U - U was a really different place in good ways .

The bishop is in denial that I 'm inactive since I have such a picture perfect Mo-family .
I go to Sac Meeting to keep the wife happy , disappear for two hours , and show up to do the money stuff afterwards .
We are in a lower income area and send in around 400K / year and our ward budget is around 4 K / year .
Nearly every week the bishop comes in to the clerk 's office , anxious to find out what the fast offering total is .
I 've been doing finance for three years and this is the first year where we are in the red on fast offering and the bishop is catching it from the stake level .
More and more people are coming in for help with utility bills , rent , sometimes food .
With the economy , that 's only going to get worse .
But it churns my gut every time , as we deposit around $ 10,000 every Sunday , to see how it kills the bishop to consent to pay someone 's electric bill .

It occurred to me while reading Politico ’s interview with Dick Cheney , that the GOP ’s plan to regain political viability in the short term rests on two disaster scenarios : the failure of the financial rescue efforts ( stimulus , TARP , and other bailouts ) to stave off complete economic collapse and a new mass casualty terrorist attack — both of which they are positioning themselves to blame Obama for .
Without one of those two , they have to figure it ’s going to be a long time wandering in the political wilderness .

LOS ANGELES 
Take - home pay for Californians is about to shrink .
Jeans , hammers , burgers and fries will cost more .
Public school children will make do with old textbooks and find more classmates sitting next to them .
Parents will receive fewer tax benefits , and state university students will pay 9 percent more in tuition .
As the sun rose in Sacramento on Thursday , state lawmakers ended months of political gridlock and agreed on a series of budget measures that included something for most everyone in California to despise .
The $ 143 billion budget closes a $ 41 billion deficit through 2010 with tax increases , deep cuts in services and extensive borrowing .
Although California ’s budget process is unusual and its fiscal problems outsized  the state ’s deficit is larger than the expenditures of all but 10 other states  economists say this budget foreshadows the difficult choices that other state legislatures will soon face as the national economy worsens .

When databases became available for the personal computer in the mid-1980s , they quickly gained a mystique as the ultimate productivity applications .
Despite their widespread use , in some ways they have never lost that mystique -- so much so that many desktop users will stretch the use of spreadsheets to cumbersome lengths rather than consider setting up a database .
Fortunately , OpenOffice.org
Base makes setting up a database easy , giving you a more efficient way of handling data than a spreadsheet .
Setting up a basic database in Base consists of two parts : configuring the database , and adding at least one table to it .
Choosing and registering the database
To begin customizing a database , select Database from the initial screen or File -> New ->
Database from the menu .
Either way , the Database Wizard opens .
Your first step is to choose a database with which to work .
You have three choices , but what they are is obscured slightly by the wording and order of choices in the wizard :
Create a new database :
Make a new database in Base 's native HSQL format
Open an existing database file : Edit a Base database that is already created .
Connect to an existing database : Make a new database in one of the other formats supported by Base .
Besides formats such as MySQL and Oracle , Base also supports several other formats on the free desktop , including Mozilla , Evolution , and KDE address books .
Another option is to choose an OpenOffice.org or MS Excel spreadsheet , which is useful for when you want to explore Base quickly or when you want to convert a growing spreadsheet into a database .
What happens on the next page of the wizard depends on your choice .
If you are creating a new database , you are asked if you want to register it so that you can use data from it in other OpenOffice applications ( a subject for another article ) .
Since this option has no drawbacks and is convenient , usually there is no reason not to register the new database .
By contrast , if you open an existing database , you move directly to Base , while if you choose another database format , you need to enter the path to it and other information that will allow you to use the database -- anything from a simple password to the porter , server URL , and database driver .
These variations are too numerous and too different from each other to discuss here in any more detail , but if you click the Help button on the second page of the wizard , you will find detailed instructions on how to deal with each type of supported format .
Once the connection to the database is entered , in some cases , such as Evolution address books , you will be unable to continue in the wizard , and will have to edit directly from Base , regardless of your preference -- although why this limitation exists is unclear .
When you have registered a new database or connected to an existing one , you have the option of editing the database .
In some cases , you only have the choice of editing in Base , but with new databases and some others , such as spreadsheets , you also have the option of editing tables in another wizard .
Whenever possible , you should consider using the wizard , especially if you are unfamiliar with databases .
Setting up tables
Tables are the basic structure of a database .
Although they resemble spreadsheets , they are organized somewhat differently .
Instead of being organized into cells that can either be part of a larger record or individual containers of data , tables are always organized by rows .
Each row is a single record , and each column is a separate field within each record .
Since each record is unique , setting up a table consists of adding columns to it .
When you create a new database in the wizard , you may have the option of creating tables in a wizard , depending on the type of database you are using .
If you choose the wizard , then you start with selecting the fields ( that is , columns ) for the database .
The wizard provides dozens of default fields , dividing them first into Business and Personal categories , and then into secondary categories , such as Customers , Deliveries , or Addresses .
Each secondary has a list of commonly used fields .
To add one of these defaults to your database , all you need to do is select it in the Available Fields pane , and use the arrow keys to move it to the Selected Fields pane .
The first entry in the Selected Fields pane is the first column on the left of the table .
You can use the up and down arrows on the right of the Selected Fields pane to change the position of fields ; for instance , you might want to ensure that the LastName field in a table listing customer addresses was the first field , because most people will be using it to find a specific record .
You can also use the arrow keys on the left of Selected Fields pane to move a field back to the Available Fields pane .
A single arrow button moves the selected record , while a double arrow moves all records .
Pressing the Next button takes you to a page on which you define what sort of information goes into each field .
After selecting a field on the left side of the page , you can edit :
The name of the field : Usually , you wo n't want to change the name , but you might want to edit the default name .
For instance , if you are doing an address book for only the United , you might want to alter the default PostalCode to the more colloquial Zip .
Type :
The format of the data in the field .
This is analogous to the number format of a spreadsheet cell , and includes many of the same choices , such as Text , Number , and Date / Time .
Another useful type is Yes / No .
Entry required :
Whether the field is compulsory , or can be left blank .
Length :
The number of characters allowed in the field .
This characteristic can be restricted to control the size of the database , or as a guide to correctness .
For example , in a field for North American phone numbers , you might want to restrict entries to ten characters .
On the next page you set the primary key , or unique identifier for each record .
The easiest choice is Auto- value , in which case each record is identified by a number .
However , you may prefer to generate a primary key from a single field , or a combination of fields .
Whether using fields is a practical choice depends , of course , on choosing a combination that will be both unique for each field , and meaningful to the database 's users .
For example , the address field might be unique , but is probably not the handiest way to refer to a record .
By contrast , a combination of LastName and FirstName would be handy and reasonably unique , but not as much as using LastName , FirstName , and Address .
Finally , on the wizard 's last page , you can give the entire table a unique name , and choose your next step : Adding records into the database , editing the table , or creating a form ( another topic for another day ) .
If the table wizard is not available because of your database format , you can create tables from within Base by selecting Create Table in Design View .
Here , you can work within an actual table - like format , which may be easier for you to conceptualize what you are doing .
The orientation , though , is different in the wizard , in that the top field will become the first field on the left of the table .
Once you enter the field name , you can choose its format type from a drop - down list in the second column .
Below the table , the current field 's properties are listed for editing .
Unlike in the wizard , editing from design view gives you the option of adding a default value and a format example .
In the table itself , you can add a description , a sort of mouse - over help similar to that you can add using the Validity tool in a spreadsheet .
Another difference between the design view and the wizard is that , in the design view , you only create the primary key when you go to save the table -- when it appears as the first field in the table .
Next Steps
At this point , you have a basic database with one or more tables .
Should you want to add another table or to edit you can choose whether to work in design view or the tables wizard from the Tasks pane in the top middle of Base .
Alternatively , you can select a table from the Tables pane in the lower middle of the window , and select Open from the context menu to edit it in design view .
However , creating a database and tables are only the beginning of working with Base .
You can easily copy and paste information from an open Base table to other OpenOffice.org applications , but to gain the full efficiency of working with databases , you should also know how to set up forms , queries , and reports .
In upcoming articles , I 'll cover all three , explaining what they are and how to use them .

Like someone arriving at a food bank in a limousine , the chief executives of the three major U.S. automakers spark outrage when they fly their corporate jets to Washington D.C. to beg Congress for a multi-billion dollar bailout .
Yes , we know that corporate jets are often a cost - effective way for the heads of far - flung corporations to get around .
But someone should have known this was n't going to look good ( and , sure enough , Congress sent the auto chiefs away empty - handed ) .

( Reuters ) - India vowed to strengthen laws to prevent corporate fraud after Satyam Computer , the country ’s fourth - largest software company , shocked investors by revealing profits had been falsely inflated for years .
Chairman Ramalinga Raju resigned on Wednesday after revealing India ’s biggest corporate scandal in memory , sending the company ’s shares plunging nearly 80 percent .
The following is an overview of how the fraud escaped detection for so long and what compelled a soft - spoken man born into a family of farmers to risk all .
Q : How did Satyam escape detection ?
A : On the face of it , New York - listed Satyam did everything by the rulebook , with an international firm auditing its books , declaration of accounts in accordance with Indian and U.S. standards , and the requisite number of independent directors with excellent credentials , including a Harvard business school professor and a former federal cabinet secretary .
Raju , in his now famous 5 - page letter outlining the deception , said no other board member -- past or present -- was aware of the financial irregularities .
Regulators were blindsided , and analysts and experts say there are “ systemic flaws ” in accounting and audit practices .
About $ 1 billion , or 94 percent of the cash , on the company ’s books was fictitious , Raju said , and manipulation of the cash flow may be a reason why the fraud was undetected .
“ Companies have manipulated P&L ( profit and loss ) accounts before , but cash flow is the Holy Grail -- you do n’t tamper with it , ” said Saurabh Mukherjea , an analyst at UK - based research firm Noble Group .
“ Auditors generally assume if there is cash , things are OK .
But there are plenty of accounting and governance loopholes . ”
India also lacks a culture of dissent , with shareholders and independent directors reluctant to question company founders .
Q : What was the motive ?
A : India ’s $ 50 - billion information technology industry -- the poster child for India ’s economic liberalization and rapid growth -- expanded at a scorching pace on the back of outsourcing demand from Western firms .
At the height of the boom , top software firms Tata Consultancy Services , Infosys Technologies , Wipro and Satyam consistently reported annual 50 - percent increases in profits every quarter .
Pressure to maintain this pace of growth , please investors and shareholders and justify inflated P/E multiples during a six - year bull run on the stock market have all been cited as reasons why Satyam cooked the books .
Some news reports say Raju was an aggressive investor in failed dotcoms , and the family also put money in real estate .
Raju , in his letter , said he had “ not benefited in financial terms ” as a result of the inflated accounts .
Q : Are there other Satyams out there ?
A : Most certainly , say analysts and industry experts .
While there has been a plea from chief executives across the board against painting all of corporate India with the same brush , Noble Group estimates at least a fifth of the top 500 listed companies practice “ creative accounting . ”
“ At its most innocent it is not illegal , but account manipulation is very pervasive , ” said Mukherjea .
Q : What needs to be done to prevent another Satyam ?
A : Tighter rules for accounting and corporate governance , including appointment of independent directors by selection committees , and greater oversight from regulatory and government authorities .
Noble Group also suggests separation of audit and consultancy functions at companies , and quicker publication of annual reports .
For years , many of us puzzled about how something so stupid and destructive as the New Deal could have happened .
The stock market crashed because it was over - inflated .
That ’s nothing new .
History is filled with credit - filled bubbles that pop .
Resources are reallocated to reflect economic reality and we move on .
The New Deal was different .
It actually began under Hoover , who initiated new spending programs and jobs programs , and tried to inflate the money supply and bail out the banks .
He was blasted by FDR for his big government policies , and FDR won the election .
Once in power , FDR went nuts , instituting a program of central planning that combined features of the Soviet and Fascist models .
It was one idiotic program after another .
They tried to raise wages when they should have fallen .
They tried to save banks that should have collapsed .
They destroyed resources when they were most needed .
They encouraged spending when people should have been saving .
They smashed the dollar at a time when it needed to be shored up .
They cartelized business when competition was most necessary .
What were the results ?
Economic growth went nowhere between 1933 and 1939 , with real gross domestic product per adult still 27 percent below trend at the end .
Per capita GDP was lower in 1939 than in 1929 .
Unemployment was at 17.2 percent in 1939 .
This was actually higher than it was in 1931 .
This is despite 100 percent increases in monetary expansion .
Taxes had tripled .
Employing people became ever more expensive due to unions and national income guarantees .
Every time the economy would bottom out and genuine recovery would begin , policy would knock it back down again .
Other seeming upturns were entirely artificial : make work instead of real work , for example .
Regimentation was everywhere , so that business could n’t compete , farmers were destroying livestock and crops on command , and dissidents were being ferreted out through police - state tactics .
In other words , the whole project was a massive dud .
It turned what might have been a short downturn into a decade - long national calamity , the biggest cost of which was freedom itself .
And then as a cover - up for the calamity , there was war .
At last FDR found some use for those unemployed workers : send them to kill and be killed at taxpayer expense .
As for wartime price controls and nationalization , it was the New Deal by other means .
( For a full account , with all the detail , in scintillating prose , see Flynn ’s Roosevelt Myth . )
Was it some sort of national insanity ?
No , it was a power grab , and the current political moment shows precisely how this happens .
A small group of elites , cut off from the broader reality , decide to finagle the system to serve themselves and their friends in the short term while forgetting the big picture and the long term .
Sensible people try to point out obvious facts but their voices are drowned out .
But none of this happens without some philosophical rationale .
Even before J.M. Keynes came along to give bad economic ideas a scientific gloss , the notion that government could gin up the economy with spending and inflation was pervasive .
Laissez - faire economic theories had fallen out of favor with the elites who controlled the universities , print houses , and government agencies .
Many nutty ideas were in the air .
It ’s remarkable to see how many pro-fascist books , for example , were in print in the 1920s and 30s .
It was widely assumed that the future of the good society was bound up with the idea of “ economic planning . ”
This was an interesting phrase .
It covered all forms of socialism plus the interventionist state .
Planning was the intellectual fashion , and there were very few dissidents .
Once the crisis hit , the intellectual reality became the political reality .
( Higgs describes the process in Crisis and Leviathan . )
Now that we are living amidst this , it is easier to come to terms with how the New Deal came about .
It makes those in the know feel completely helpless .
We look at what is happening to bank reserves and we know what is coming .
When the economy recovers — even if only cosmetically — and lending starts again , the internal dynamic of the fractional - reserve system will come into operation .
We could be facing inflation at 10 percent or 20 percent or even much higher , depending on how spending psychology plays itself out .
Then we listen to speeches by the president - elect , who is going on about the great stimulus package he is going to push through Congress .
It ’s like listening to one quack doctor propose bleeding the patient even as the last quack doctor who bled the patient is packing his bags to leave .
You want to shout : is there a real doctor in the house ?
But it seems like no one is listening .
What ’s striking here is how the historians are the ones with power right now .
Bush has gone nuts with inflation and intervention as a way of avoiding Hoover ’s fate , even though the actual historical record ( as versus the historian ’s fantasies ) shows that Herbert was the first New Dealer .
Meanwhile , the Obama clique hopes to recreate the FDR disaster by following his plan detail by detail , even though the plan was stupid and did n’t work .
To watch all this happening is like watching a slow - moving train headed over a cliff .
The problem is that the engineers have earplugs in and blinders on .
Will this go on for ten years like the last time ?
Will it end in World War III , as if following some historical script ?
Is it possible that we will go the way of Germany in the 1920s , straight into the abyss of hyperinflation and into the hands of a ghastly dictator ?
It is unwise to rule it out .
And yet , I ’m not that pessimistic .
It is extremely crucial to realize that there is a difference this time .
In the 1930s , technological limits put severe restrictions on information delivery .
Government propaganda easily dominated the culture .
All of that has changed .
Despite everything , people simply do not trust the government as they once did .
Obama will enjoy a short honeymoon but it will be over by summer .
What is missing today so far is the critical thing : a culture - wide love of liberty that is capable of intimidating and beating back the rogue regime .
The conditions are right for this to actually happen , and to reverse the direction of politics today .
But it will require all our efforts .
Fortunately everyone has the opportunity today to make a difference .
I hope my own book will help make a difference .
The last words in Ludwig von Mises ’s book Socialism bear repeating .
“ Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders , ” wrote Mises , “ no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others .
And no one can find a safe way for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction .
Therefore everyone , in his own interest , must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle . ”

The European parliament today voted by a sweeping majority to tighten the use of pesticides in agriculture and to ban 22 treatments , a decision that critics say could wipe out British carrots .
The British government and the Conservatives are against the legislation , but the ban and restrictions were carried by a vote of 577 to 61 , putting pressure on the 27 EU member states to support the decision .
Greens celebrated the vote as a victory for environmentalism .
But the farming lobby warned that the restrictions were pointless , would wipe out harvests of winter vegetables , and push up food prices during a European recession and worsening unemployment .
The proposed legislation places tight curbs on crop-spraying , bans the use of pesticides near schools and hospitals , and proscribes 22 chemicals , some said to be carcinogenic .
The Green MEP for the south - east , Caroline Lucas , hailed it as " a new milestone for environment and health protection " .
" This regulation , the first of its kind in the world , will bring clear health benefits and improve both food and water quality in the EU , " she said .
Critics argued that the benefits are unproven and that the harm ascribed to the banned or restricted substances was also not based on evidence .
Rather , the draft legislation was based on the " what - if " or precautionary principle .
Labour , Conservative and SNP MEPs were all against the decision which still has to be agreed by the 27 governments of the EU member states to become law .
The British government is expected to oppose the ban .
Ministers still have the last say .
Britian 's environment secretary , Hilary Benn , said : " These regulations could hit agricultural production in the UK for no recognisable benefit to human health , and we are being asked to agree to something here when nobody knows what the impact will be .
While we have managed to secure some improvements surrounding the use of certain pesticides , the UK does not support these proposals . "
Robert Sturdy , a Conservative MEP on the EU parliament 's environment committee , said yields of carrots , cereals , potatoes , onions and parsnips would decline .
" The parliament 's overzealous approach will take a vast number of products off the market , " said
" This law will drive up the cost of the weekly food shop at the worst time for British families . "
The National Farmers ' Union , which fought the proposals , denounced the bans and curbs as damaging for British agriculture and a threat to food production at a time of potential food shortages and rising prices .
The Soil Association ridiculed arguments that the pesticides were needed to maintain crop yields .
If turned into law , the tighter rules would be phased in from next year with the aim of halving toxic substances on plants by 2013 .
Labour and the Conservatives are both calling for an impact assessment of the measures before the bans become law , amid claims that the legislation could see British food production fall by a quarter .

It was rooted at the rear end of the food chain , but now the humble dung beetle is biting back .
A ferocious scarab species has been filmed in Peru attacking and eating millipedes 10 times its length .
D. valgum no longer dines on faeces .
Instead , the nocturnal predator prefers to decapitate live prey with its armour " teeth " and then devour their insides .
It is a rare example of a scavenger species turning carnivore , say US scientists in a Royal Society journal .
Dung beetles ( Scarabaeidae ) are not renowned for their predatory instincts .
It seems like such a huge jump - from a scavenger to a hunter - predator - so how did it get from A to Z ?
Dr Adrian Forsyth , Blue Moon Fund
They feast on fresh animal faeces which they gather into balls and roll with their hind legs .
But after the species Deltochilum valgum was seen grappling with millipedes several times its size , Dr Trond Larsen of Princeton University decided to find out whether it could actually be preying on the creatures .
Biting back Working in the Peruvian rainforest , his team set up more than 1,000 traps containing different treats to tempt the beetles .
These included a traditional menu of dung , fungus and fruit , as well as millipedes , which were live , injured or dead .
They found D. valgum fed exclusively on the millipedes , preferring prey which were alive but injured .
The millipedes coiled up in defence against the beetles Using infrared cameras , they filmed one adult beetle attacking and killing an injured millipede , which dwarfed it in size , by decapitating it with its body armour .
" This is a remarkable transition , " wrote Dr Larsen , a tropical ecologist , in the journal Biology Letters .
" Despite its close relationships with dung feeding species , D. valgum has entirely abandoned its ball - rolling behaviour .
" This is the first known case of an obligate predatory dung beetle species . "
The carnivorous beetles use the same mouthparts their cousins use to extract bacteria from dung and carrion as weapons to assault and kill their much larger prey .
I find it amazing that what we thought was just another dung beetle turned out to be something rather exceptional
Dr Adrian Forsyth , Blue Moon Fund
When placed together in observation chambers , the beetles began their attacks by grasping a millipede 's body with its mid- and hind - legs .
The millipedes - up to 110 mm long - responded by coiling or flailing their bodies to resist the grip of beetles just 7 - 8 mm wide .
After waiting until the flailing slowed down , the beetles inserted their armour teeth between body segments , prying upwards with their head while simultaneously sawing with their fore - teeth .
" During one kill we observed , the force of the beetle 's prying severed the millipede's head from the rest of its body , " said Dr Larsen .
One giant leap
The team say their discovery demonstrates how small changes in the physiology of a species can lead to giant leaps in its behaviour .
The beetles were never seen rolling dung balls .
Instead , they used their powerful hind legs to drag a killed millipede to a safe site and then begin devouring it .
Most dung beetle species feed on balls of faeces Dung beetles ' heads are usually flat and wide like a shovel in order to roll balls of dung but D. valgum has a narrow , pointy head which it uses to get right inside the millipede 's body and feed on its insides .
It also has sharper " teeth " , which are used to prise open the body and sever it into smaller pieces .
And unlike most dung beetle species , which bury their food , the remains of dead millipedes were left lying under leaves , entirely cleaned of their soft inner tissue .
" It seems like such a huge jump - from a scavenger to a hunter - predator - so the real story is , how did it get from A to Z ? " said Dr Adrian Forsyth of the Blue Moon Fund , a co-author on the paper .
" We knew plenty of dung beetles which are attracted to dead insects - drawn by their potent cyanide - rich odours .
And now we find a species which just could n't wait .
" This is a beetle which says : ' It does n't matter if it 's dead or alive , I 'm going to eat it ' .
" It 's a nice example of how you can take an apparently big step - to become a carnivore . "
The scientists believe this unusual evolutionary transition was driven by high levels of competition for food .
Instead of rolling dung balls , the beetle used its hind legs to drag millipedes Dung beetles undergo fierce competition for resources , both between species and within species .
Adults are seen to aggressively defend their dung balls from competitors by pushing and chasing each other .
The same behaviour was seen in beetles which had captured millipedes .
The dramatic evolutionary leap could help to explain the coexistence of so many different types of insects , researchers say .
" I find it amazing that what we thought was just another dung beetle turned out to be something rather exceptional , " said Dr Forsyth .
Taste test However , this is not the first time the dung beetle has been shown to be more sophisticated than its name suggests .
In 2006 , researchers in Kuwait won an Ig Nobel Prize for a study showing that " dung beetles are fussy eaters " .
When offered dung from three herbivorous animals - horse , camel and sheep - the beetles preferred the more fluid horse dung to the others .
Furthermore , the African dung beetle was the first animal found to navigate using moonlight , enabling it to orientate itself and make a hasty retreat from competitors when rolling a ball of dung .
So while they may be the butt of many jokes , it would be foolish to pooh - pooh their talents .

Last week
We received the phone call everybody dreads .
It was my brother .
The Great - Aunt Laura had only passed away .
She died in her sleep , peacefully .
This news hit me like a load of bricks .
I am just sitting and stared at my monitor for what seemed like hrs .
Do n’t make a mistake associated with joining a business just because your family and friends have joined .
If you are not into health and nutrition , then avoid joining that industry .

The lady sees her father who may be an insurance agent to get their opinion .
She consults along with four other people who are sensible in such matters .
After 14 days of praying about this plus consulting with knowledgeable folk , the girl sits down with Ted and explains that she gets identified several “ crutches ” that needs to be eliminated .
( Explaining all of this to Ted is probably the hardest a part of it all . )
He will not get it too nicely but agrees to go together .
The particular repair is necessary for many items , and it matters on your credit rating and future financial preparing .
Having a good credit score indicates you have safe financial upcoming .
It is better to look into these types of matters before time .
REFERENCE :
Over the past few weeks , I ’ve been exploring the various techniques for speeding up your JavaScript .
Part 1 covered how to deal with loops that are doing too much .
Part 2 focused on functions that do too much and taught techniques such as queuing and memoization to lighten the workload .
Part 3 expanded the conversation to handling recursion both with memoization and switching to an iterative algorithm .
Part 4 , the last part in this series , focuses on too much DOM interaction .
We all know that the DOM is slow …really slow …and that it ’s one of the most common sources of performance issues .
What makes it slow is that DOM changes can change the user interface of a page , and redrawing the page is an expensive operation .
Too many DOM changes mean a lot of redrawing since each change must be applied sequentially and synchronously to ensure the correct end result .
This process is called reflow , and is one of the most expensive functions of a browser .
Reflow happens at various points in time :
When you add or remove a DOM node .
When you apply a style dynamically ( such as element.style.width=" 10 px " ) .
) .
When you retrieve a measurement that must be calculated , such as accessing offsetWidth , clientHeight , or any computed CSS value ( via getComputedStyle ( ) in DOM - compliant browsers or currentStyle in IE ) , while DOM changes are queued up to be made .
They key , then , is to limit the number of reflows that occur on a page via DOM interactions .
Most browsers will not update the DOM while JavaScript is executing .
Instead , they queue up the DOM interactions and apply them sequentially once the script has finished executing .
As with JavaScript execution , the user cannot interact with the browser while a reflow is occurring .
( Reflows will happen when the long - running script dialog is displayed because it represents a break in JavaScript execution , allowing the UI to update . )
There are two basic ways to mitigate reflow based on DOM changes .
The first is to perform as many changes as possible outside of the live DOM structure ( the part representing visible elements ) .
The classic example is adding a number of DOM nodes into a document :
for ( var i=0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { var item = document.createElement ( " li " ) ; item.appendChild(document.createTextNode(" Option " + i ) ; list.appendChild( item ) ; }
This code is inefficient because it touches the live DOM each time through the loop .
To increase performance , you should minimize this number .
The best option , in this case , is to create a document fragment as an intermediate placeholder for the created li elements and then use that to add all of the elements to their parent :
var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment ( ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { var item = document.createElement ( " li " ) ; item.appendChild(document.createTextNode(" Option " + i ) ; fragment.appendChild(item ) ; } list.appendChild( fragment ) ;
This version of the code touches the live DOM only once , on the last line .
Prior to that , the document fragment is used to hold the intermediate results .
Since a document fragment has no visual representation , it does n’t cause reflow when modified .
Document fragments also ca n’t be added into the live DOM , so passing it into appendChild ( ) actually adds all of the fragment ’s children to list rather than the fragment itself .
The second way to avoid unnecessary reflow is to remove a node from the live DOM before operating on it .
You can remove a node from the live DOM in two ways : 1 ) literally remove the node from the DOM via removeChild ( ) or replaceChild ( ) , or 2 ) setting the display style to " none " .
Once the DOM modifications have been complete then the process must be reversed and the node must be added back into the live DOM .
Another approach to the previous example could be :
list.style.display = " none " ; for ( var i=0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { var item = document.createElement ( " li " ) ; item.appendChild(document.createTextNode(" Option " + i ) ; list.appendChild(item ) ; } list.style.display = " " ;
Setting the list ’s display to “ none ” removes it from the live DOM since it no longer has a visual representation .
All of the items can safely be added before setting the display back to its default value .
Another common source of multiple reflows is making changes to an element ’s appearance via the style property .
For example :
element.style.backgroundColor = " blue " ; element.style.color = " red " ; element.style.fontSize = " 12em " ;
This code has three style changes … and also three reflows .
A reflow happens with every change in style to this element .
If you ’re going to be making a number of changes to an element ’s style , it ’s best to group those in a CSS class and then change the class using JavaScript rather than applying individual style changes manually .
For example :
.newStyle { background - color : blue ; color : red ; font - size : 12em ; }
Then the JavaScript becomes a single line :
element.className = " newStyle " ;
Changing the class of an element counts allows all of the styles to be applied at once , within a single reflow .
This is much more efficient and also more maintainable in the long run .
Since the DOM is so slow at pretty much everything , it ’s very important to cache results that you retrieve from the DOM .
This is important for property access that causes reflow , such as offset Width , but also important in general .
The following , for example , is incredibly inefficient :
document.getElementById(" myDiv" ).style.left = document.getElementById(" myDiv" ).offsetLeft + document.getElementById(" myDiv" ).offsetWidth + " px " ;
The three calls to getElementById ( ) here are the problem .
Accessing the DOM is expensive , and this is three DOM calls to access the exact same element .
The code would better be written as such :
var myDiv = document.getElementById(" myDiv " ) ; myDiv.style.left = myDiv.offsetLeft + myDiv.offsetWidth + " px " ;
Now the number of total DOM operations has been minimized by removing the redundant calls .
Always cache DOM values that are used more than once to avoid a performance penalty .
Perhaps the most egregious offender of slow property access is the HTMLCollection type .
This is the type of object that is returned from the DOM anytime a collection of nodes must be represented , and so is the type of the childNodes property and is the type returned from getElementsByTagName ( ) .
An HTMLCollection may act like an array in many ways , but it actually is a living , breathing entity that changes as the DOM structure changes .
Every time you access a property on an HTMLCollection object , it actually queries the DOM for all nodes matching the original criteria once again .
That means the following is an infinite loop :
var divs = document.getElementsByTagName ( " div " ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < divs.length ; i++) { //infinite loop document.body.appendChild(document.createElement (" div " ) ) ; }
This code is an infinite loop because every time a new div element is added to the document , the divs collection is updated with that new information .
That means that i will never reach divs.length because divs.length increases by one every time through the loop .
Every time divs.length is accessed , it collection is updated , making it far more expensive than accessing a regular array ’s length property .
When dealing with HTMLCollection objects , it ’s best to minimize the number of times you access their properties .
You can speed up a loop tremendously by simply caching the length in a local variable :
var divs = document.getElementsByTagName ( " div " ) ; for ( var i=0 , len=divs.
length ; i < len ; i++) { //not an infinite loop document.body.appendChild(document.createElement ( " div " ) ) ; }
This code no longer represents an infinite loop because the value of len remains the same through each iteration .
Caching the value is also more efficient so that the document is n’t queried more than once .
This wraps up the “ Speed up your JavaScript ” series .
I hope you ’ve learned enough to avoid the long - running script dialog and make your code much faster .

When it comes to science , Barack Obama is no better than many of us .
Today he joins the list of shame of those in public life who made scientifically unsupportable statements in 2008 .
Closer to home , Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith faltered on the science of food , while Kate Moss , Oprah Winfrey and Demi Moore all get roastings for scientific illiteracy .
The Celebrities and Science Review 2008 , prepared by the group Sense About Science , identifies some of the worst examples of scientific illiteracy among those who profess to know better – including top politicians .

Mr Obama and John McCain blundered into the MMR vaccine row during their presidential campaigns .
" We 've seen just a skyrocketing autism rate , " said President - elect Obama .
" Some people are suspicious that it 's connected to the vaccines .
This person included .
The science right now is inconclusive , but we have to research it , " he said .
His words were echoed by Mr McCain .
" It 's indisputable that [ autism ] is on the rise among children , the question is what 's causing it , " he said .
" There 's strong evidence that indicates it 's got to do with a preservative in the vaccines . "
Exhaustive research has failed to substantiate any link to vaccines or any preservatives .
The rise in autism is thought to be due to an increased awareness of the condition .
Sarah Palin , Mr McCain 's running mate , waded into the mire with her dismissal of some government research projects .
" Sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good .
Things like fruit fly research in Paris , France .
I kid you not , " Ms Palin said .
But the geneticist Ellen Solomon takes Ms Palin to task for not understanding the importance of studies into fruit flies , which share roughly half their genes with humans .
" They have been used for more than a century to understand how genes work , which has implications in , for example , understanding the ageing process , " she said .
Hollywood did not escape the critical analysis of the scientific reviewers , who lambasted Tom Cruise , for his comments on psychiatry being a crime against humanity , and Julianne Moore , who warned against using products full of unnatural chemicals .
" The real crime against humanity continues to be the enduring misery caused by the major mental illnesses across the globe , and the continuing lack of resources devoted to supporting those afflicted , " said the psychiatrist Professor Simon Wessely .
In answer to Moore , the science author and chemist John Emsley said that natural chemicals are not automatically safer than man-made chemicals , which undergo rigorous testing .

" Something which is naturally sourced may well include a mixture of things that are capable of causing an adverse reaction , " Dr Emsley said .
Other mentions went to the chefs Nigella Lawson , who said " mind meals " can make you feel different about life , and Delia Smith , who claimed it is possible to eliminate sugar from the diet .
The dietician Catherine Collins said that Lawson 's support for expensive allergy foods is a wasted opportunity and too costly for those on limited incomes , while Lisa Miles of the British Nutrition Foundation said that sugars are part of a balanced diet .
Kate Moss , Oprah Winfrey and Demi Moore all espoused the idea that you can detoxify your body with either diet ( scientifically unsupportable ) or , in the case of Moore , products such as " highly trained medical leeches " which make you bleed .
Scientists point out that diet alone cannot remove toxins and that blood itself is not a toxin , and even if it did contain toxins , removing a little bit of it is not going to help .
But top prize went to the lifestyle guru Carole Caplin for denouncing a study showing that vitamin supplements offer little or no health benefits as " rubbish " – it is the third year on the run that she has been mentioned in the review .
Science author and GP Ben Goldacre pointed out that the study Ms Caplin referred to was the most authoritative yet published .
" Carole should understand that research can often produce results which challenge our preconceptions : that is why science is more interesting than just following your nose , " Dr Goldacre said .
Talking sense :
Two who got it right
* The writer Jilly Cooper gets nine out of ten for making a stab at why alternative treatments might work : " If you believe them , then they work . "
That describes the placebo effect , where a harmless but useless remedy seems to work because the patient feels as if it is working .
* The vocal coach and singer Carrie Grant is applauded for raising the profile of Crohn 's disease without abusing the science .
" There are so many therapies available , but none of them are going to cure you , " she said .
A few weeks ago there was that story where a guy was found frozen in a Detroit warehouse .
Remember that ?
With the photo of his leg sticking up out of the ice ?
Story got a lot of attention for obvious reasons , not the least of which was because the Detroit News story that brought attention to that frozen leg interviewed a number of folks who were apparently aware of the frozen dead guy but did n’t seem to care enough to want to do anything about it .
The most glaring example , you may recall , were those ‘ urban adventurers ’ ( most likely not actually from Detroit ) who were playing ice hockey on the frozen pool of water inside the building where the body was found .
Sure , they knew about the body but why let a frozen dead guy get in the way of a good hockey game ?
That would spoil their ‘ urban adventure ’ .
Yeah .
So anyway , my point at the time when I decided to comment on this particular story was to point out that as horrific as this particular incident was , folks need to keep in mind that this one incident does not represent the entire city , as the article in some ways seemed to imply .
Things are bad here , no doubt , but I ’m pretty sure the majority of Detroiters would at the very least feel compelled to make a call when confronted with a dead body frozen in plain view in a block of ice .
Of course there are those folks who do n’t really know Detroit who have no problem believing such a heartless portrayal of who we are because that ’s the only portrayal they ’ve ever seen .
And so , for whoever may have been listening , I felt I owed it to our city to say something in her defense .
Because I know we are so much better than that .
Even now .
Even today .
But having said that ( that ’s right , here it comes ) , Detroit does make it hard sometimes .
Because sometimes you feel like no matter how hard you may try to defend this city ’s honor when everyone else is setting fire to it , Detroit keeps on bringing bigger , more flammable logs to the fire than everyone else .
And you have to ask yourself ; what kind of twisted shit is this ?
What manner of warped brain brings his own stake to the bonfire where he is to be burned at the stake ?
Which brings me , at long last , to another one of those news stories – this time in the Free Press – that a lover of Detroit instinctively wants to stomp into the ground and then curse out the editor for publishing yet another negative story the likes of which they seem to specialize in so well .
But then there is that other voice inside your head – the one you try to keep muzzled in the closet behind the brooms – that quietly whispers what you already know ; namely that if this shit was n’t happening then nobody could be writing stories about it .
Like the story ( see below ) about the store owner who shot and killed a guy for pissing on his building .
The guy , insofar as has been reported thus far , had no priors and his neighbors all seemed to think he was a decent enough guy .
Just a small business owner trying to maintain his business in what may very well be one of the toughest times of his life , or at least one of the toughest times he has ever experienced as a business owner .
So then here comes some guy and there he is , and he ’s , like , well shit he ’s pissing on my fucking wall .
So naturally this store owner does n’t know that the guy just picked up his wife from her job and then took her to dinner .
But then after dinner the car gets a flat , and then the police pull him over to the side of the street .
And of course that ’s when they find out that this guy is driving on a suspended license and some other shit , so the police impound the car on the spot and have it towed .
The officer offers the guy and his wife a ride home but he declines the offer .
They decide to walk it .
And you know this guy has got to be seething , I mean for this to be happening on this day , and in front of his wife ?
And then he feels nature call and he figures fuck it .
If I had my car I could hold it until we got home , but I do n’t and here I am so I ’m gonna piss up against this damned wall .
At which point the owner of that wall comes out and tells him to stop and they get into it and the owner tells somebody to go get his gun which they do and then he shoots the pisser dead .
Right there in front of the guy ’s wife .
And it was after reading this that I began to wonder …damn .
Is it really this bad after all ?
1st - degree murder charge filed in urination shooting
BY TAMMY STABLES BATTAGLIA AND BEN SCHMITT
FREE PRESS STAFF WRITERS
A 69 - year - old Detroit business owner facing accusations of gunning down a man for urinating on his building was charged today with first - degree murder .
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced the charge against Leroy Moon , who owns Asian Fisheries on Gratiot .
If convicted , Moon faces a mandatory life prison sentence .
Moon was arraigned at 5:30 p.m. in 36th District Court via video from a police holding cell .
Chief Magistrate Steve Lockhart ordered Moon held without bond , despite arguments from defense attorney Marlon Blake Evans that Moon was not a flight risk .
Evans asked Lockhart to consider the source of the version of events , referring to the victim ’s wife as the only witness .
“ He ’s never done anything like this , ” Evans said of Moon .
“ He ’s owned that business for years .
I ’m quite sure it ’s not the first time someone urinated on his building . ”
Still , Lockhart ordered Moon held without bond until his March 3 preliminary examination .
Moon is accused of shooting and killing Shawn Johnson , a 36 - year - old janitor at a Detroit Public Schools elementary school , on Tuesday .
Johnson ’s wife , Mildred Johnson , told freep.com that she can’t comprehend how someone could kill her husband for urinating .
“ I want to know what state of mind he was in , ” said Mildred Johnson , 35 , who lives a couple of blocks from where her husband died Tuesday night on Gratiot Avenue in Detroit .
“ Why did he have to shoot ?
He could ’ve called the police .
I was screaming , telling him , ‘ Please do n’t kill him !
Please do n’t kill him !’
And he continued to shoot .
I feel he should pay for what he did .
It was a wrongful death . ”
Moon appears to have no felony convictions , according to state Corrections records .
“ I still ca n’t imagine , ” Mildred Johnson said , on her way today to plan the funeral for her husband , instead of celebrating their 4 - year wedding anniversary , which was Wednesday .
“ Using the bathroom on somebody ’s property is something men do all the time .
I ’m not saying it ’s right .
It ’s something the rain would ’ve washed away . ”
She had just gone out for dinner with her husband , a janitor at White Elementary School , after he picked her up from work as a para - professional educator at Heilmann Park Middle School .
But as the pair was driving home , they got a flat tire .
Detroit Police pulled them over as they drove to a place to fix the flat and then towed the car because of driving infractions .
Shawn Johnson was on probation at the time of his death for an assault with a dangerous weapon conviction , according to Michigan Department of Corrections records .
His driver ’s license expired in 1998 and was never renewed , according to the Secretary of State .
They were walking home , a couple of blocks away , when nature called , she said .
“ Usually , they with their wife , pretty much people do n’t disrespect their wife like that , ” by urinating in public , said Shawn Johnson ’s aunt , a lifelong Detroiter who now lives in Syracuse , N.Y .
She still ca n’t believe her nephew was shot , despite crime in the area .
“ There ’s a lot of stuff going on there . ”
Mildred Johnson said Moon approached her husband , told him to stop urinating and told another man to get his gun .
When Shawn Johnson started walking away , still urinating but off Moon ’s property , Moon pushed him from behind , Mildred Johnson said .
“ And Shawn turned around and started cussing him out , ” she said .
“ And the younger guy walked up to him and the older guy started shooting .
He was n’t even on his property when he got shot . ”
Other business owners in the neighborhood describe Moon as a giving person who would feed those in need and help others .
“ Peeing on the side of the building is n’t going to make someone that mad , ” said David Short , owner of Gratiot Pelkey Auto Repair next door .
“ There are a lot worse things going on where we ’re at . ”
Tanya Armstrong , who works across the street at Lewis Tool Rental , said the alleged gunman is a “ gentleman . ”
“ That does n’t seem like something he would do , ” Armstrong said .
“ I just figured this had something to do with a robbery attempt , ” Armstrong said .
Mildred Johnson said she wants to attend Moon ’s court hearings to find out his motives .
“ If he was such a nice person , why would he take it upon himself to shoot someone for peeing ? ” Mildred Johnson said .
“ If he was such a nice person , why is my husband lying in the ground ?
Maybe he was nice to some people .
Maybe he was having a bad day .
Only he can answer that . ”

The New York Times ran on a piece on CSAs doing well despite the economy .
Forgive me , I am so boggled by the ironies that my computer is stuttering .
The New York Times is in New York state which is responsible for the fact that CSAs are actually in terrible trouble and that trouble stems directly from a New York source , Hillary Clinton .
She pushed a centralized Food Safety Department when she ran for president , one that would bring together the USDA and FDA , giving them vastly more power over food .
Both agencies are grossly corrupted by Monsanto so the multiplication of power accrues powerfully to Monsanto .
Senator Clinton is deeply , historically connected to Monsanto .
And her and Bill Clinton 's association with Monsanto has not been good for the safety of American food and our democracy , and the two are inextricably linked .
Her long time advisor and campaign strategist was Mark Penn , CEO of Burson - Marsteller , one of the world 's largest PR firms representing Monsanto ( Blackwater , ExxonMobil of the Alaska spill , Union Carbide of the Bhopal disaster , the Argentinian junta ... ) .
The astounding name of one of the bills is so absurd and totalitarian in both its use of fear and its infinite reach , it should have been rejected outright based solely on that :
H. R. 814 " Tracing and Recalling Agricultural Contamination Everywhere Act of 2009 . "
In addition , there is HB875 and a Senate bill introduced by Sherrod Brown .
The supporters of H. R. 814 were all strong supporters for president ( as was Sherrod Brown ) .
DeLauro is married to prominent Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg , who was President Bill Clinton 's chief pollster from 1991 to 1994
Bordallo supported Clinton in Guam
Degette On November 26 , 2007 , DeGette announced her endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for president , and was named national co-chair of Clinton 's Health Care Policy Task Force and adviser on stem - cell research .
Nadler endorsed Clinton for president .
In essence , the bills entail a hidden takeover and then forced industrialization of small farming - and that would include organic CSAs - by the industrial side .
Here is a farmer 's alert to his local anti-NAIS group :
Hello friends ,
Have you all read federal HB814 and HB875 ?
If not
better take a look .
Seems we are looking at NAIS on steroids .
814 is bad , 875 is awful , it creates a new food safety department
that seems to take some power from USDA&FDA and who knows what else ?
It has language in it that appears to turn our farms into food
production facilitys and allows them to decide our feed ratios and types as well as our animal health regime and whether or not and with what we can fertilize our ground , sounds worse than NAIS to me , the wording is vague and probably intentionally so .
[ My emphasis . ]
This is the end of organic farming .
There is no frontal assault , it is done insidiously , through " entering " it and using government regulations and criminal penalties ( $ 500,000 and 10 years in prison ) to simply make it industrial .
And for the well - being of Monsanto and industrial agricultural corporations , it will require purchase of agrochemical and pharmaceuticals .

The Competition Commission said today that it has decided to block plans for a video on demand ( VOD ) joint venture between ITV , BBC Worldwide and Channel 4 .
The service , called Project Kangaroo , had been expected to launch last autumn with thousands of hours of TV .
But the Office of Fair Trading referred the venture to the Commission amid concerns that it could give the partners involved too much muscle over prices for their own content .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Plans for the service had included it containing some free and some paid - for programmes , launching online and eventually on TV sets .
The Commission looked at possible remedies and concluded that none proposed could remove the threat to competition in the VOD market .
Peter Freeman , Commission chairman and chairman of the inquiry group , said : " After detailed and careful consideration , we have decided that this joint venture would be too much of a threat to competition in this developing market and has to be stopped .
" The case is essentially about the control of UK - originated TV content .
" VOD is an exciting and fast - moving development in TV , which makes programmes previously broadcast available to viewers at a time of their choice .
" The evidence we saw showed that UK viewers particularly value programmes produced and originally shown in the UK and do not regard other content as a good substitute .
" BBC Worldwide , ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material , which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of VOD services to UK viewers . "
He said the inquiry thought the joint venture parties would have an interest in doing this , in order to make Project Kangaroo a success .

He continued : " Without this venture , BBC Worldwide , ITV and Channel 4 would be close competitors of each other .
" We thought that viewers would benefit from better VOD services if the parties - possibly in conjunction with other new and / or already established providers of VOD - competed with each other . "
A statement from the BBC said : " We are disappointed by today 's decision that prevents the partners taking Kangaroo forward .
" However , we remain absolutely committed to delivering distinctive quality BBC programmes online and will continue to drive innovation through our successful iPlayer platform . "
A joint statement was released by BBC Worldwide , ITV plc and Channel 4 , saying the decision was a " missed opportunity " and the real losers were British consumers .
It said : " We are disappointed by the decision to prohibit this joint venture .
" While this is an unwelcome finding for the shareholders , the real losers from this decision are British consumers .
" This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting . "
Michael Grade , chairman and chief executive of ITV , spoke of the broadcaster 's surprise at the move .
He said : " We are surprised by this decision because we believed that the Kangaroo joint venture , competing in a crowded online world against dominant global brands , was an attractive UK consumer proposition , free at the point of use .
" However , in the two years since the idea for Kangaroo was born , the success of ITV.com has proved that our UK content is attractive enough to stand on its own and we remain focused on our online growth .
" We will provide a further update on our online plans with our full - year results on 4 March . "
Ulster
Ulster are rocked by latest Addison setback
It was never meant to work out like this but Will Addison 's injury issues just are n't going away which represents an inescapably significant and worrying blow for Ulster as the new season begins .
DETROIT -
There are thousands of buildings that should be demolished in Detroit .
Eric Roslonski says the city took the wrong one .
Roslonski filed a lawsuit against the city Monday , more than two years after a house he was rehabbing suddenly was destroyed .
He said he put more than $ 30,000 into the property on the east side of Detroit after buying it for $ 7,000 .
One day in summer 2006 , he could n't find 13405 Flanders .
" I drove up and down the street three times -- where is my house ? "
Roslonski , 26 , said .
The Rochester Hills man said he has n't received any good explanations from the city , just finger - pointing between departments .
His lawyer , Jeffrey Dworin , said the house was taken off a demolition list , then apparently reinstated without Roslonski's knowledge .
" It happens , " Dworin said .
" I had a similar situation with someone in Pontiac . "
A message seeking comment was left with the city 's law department , which was closed for the King holiday .
Roslonski acquired the house in 2005 and took inventory of what needed to be done to get it into shape for a renter or new owner .
" We did the roof , windows , kitchen , flooring , carpet , furnace , water heater -- every single thing you could imagine , " he said .
Before the house was razed in June 2006 , someone broke in and stole the carpet and kitchen cabinets .
Roslonski is suing Detroit for his losses under a federal civil rights law .
He fixed another house on the same street and sold it for $ 85,000 .
" I see all these boarded - up and burned - out houses .
I 'm trying to make the city a better place , " he said .

Rabid far - right commentator Ann Coulter is known across America for sliming everyone and everything she disagrees with .
Al Gore is a “ total f-- ” and another one - time presidential candidate , John Edwards , is the same .
Democrats are “ gutless traitors ” and their convention a “ Spawn of Satan ” gathering .
Muslims are “ r-------” and America should “ kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . ”
Jews are people who need to be “ perfected . ”
The New York Times building and its editorial staff should be bombed .
Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens should have “ rat poisoning ” mixed into his food .
Princess Diana “ ostentatiously [ had ] sex in front of [ her ] children . ”
The Rev. Al Sharpton is “ a fat , race - baiting black man . ” President Bill Clinton was “ a very good rapist , ” and North Korea should be “ nuked . ”
But despite denouncing school desegregation as a “ spectacular ” failure , Coulter has generally avoided bolstering white supremacist hate groups .
Until now , that is .
In her latest foaming - mouth tome — Guilty : Liberal “ Victims ” and Their Assault on America , released on Jan. 6 — Coulter spends the better part of three pages defending a group called the Council of Conservative Citizens ( CCC ) , which The New York Times had described as a “ thinly veiled white supremacist organization . ”
Coulter begs to differ .
The CCC , Coulter opines , is “ a conservative group ” that has unfairly been branded as racist “ because some of the directors of the CCC had , decades earlier , been leaders of a segregationist group . ”
“ There is no evidence on its Web page that the modern incarnation of the CCC supports segregation , ” she says .
“ Apart from some aggressive reporting on black - on - white crimes — the very crimes that are aggressively hidden by the establishment media — there is little on the CCC website suggesting ” that the group is racist .
Indeed , its main failing is “ containing members who had belonged to a segregationist group thirty years earlier . ”
Coulter could hardly be more wrong .
And even if she can’t find time to read beyond a page of the CCC ’s website , she really ought to know — after all , the organization where she frequently speaks , the Conservative Political Action Committee , has publicly banned the CCC from its annual gathering because it is racist .
Also in the late 1990s , Jim Nicholson , then - chairman of the Republican National Committee , asked GOP members to stay away from the CCC because of its “ racist and nationalist views . ”
How could conservative Republicans be inspired to say such ugly things ?
Let us count the ways .
The CCC ’s columnists have written that black people are “ a retrograde species of humanity , ” and that non-white immigration is turning the U.S. population into a “ slimy brown mass of glop . ”
Its website has run photographic comparisons of pop singer Michael Jackson and a chimpanzee .
It opposes “ forced integration ” and decries racial intermarriage .
It has lambasted black people as “ genetically inferior , ” complained about “ Jewish power brokers , ” called gay people “ perverted sodomites , ” and even named the late Lester Maddox , the baseball bat - wielding , arch - segregationist former governor of Georgia , “ Patriot of the Century . ”
One day , the CCC ran photos on its home page of accused Beltway snipers John Muhammad and John Malvo , 9/11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui and accused shoe - bomber Richard Reed .
“ Notice a Pattern Here ? ” asked a caption underneath the four photos .
“ Is the face of death black after all ? ”
On another occasion , its website featured a photo of Daniel Pearl , the “ Jewish Wall Street Journal reporter ” who had just been decapitated by Islamic terrorists .
In the photo , Pearl was shown with his “ mixed - race wife , Marianne . ”
The headline above the couple ’s picture was stunning even for the CCC : “ Death by Multiculturalism ? ”
The CCC Arkansas chapter ran an essay waxing nostalgic for the days “ when racial separation was the norm . ”
But to Ann Coulter , there is “ no evidence ” on its website that the CCC “ supports segregation . ”
Mostly , she says , the group — which was formed from the debris of the White Citizens Councils that Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once called “ the uptown Klan ” — is about “ a strong national defense , the right to keep and bear arms , the traditional family , and an ‘ America First ’ trade policy . ”
Indeed , she says , The New York Times and other critics of the CCC are simply liberals “ who have no principles . ”
In hospitals and clinics , magnetic resonance imaging is quite common today .
Clinicians like it because it shows much better images of soft tissues than computed tomography ( CT ) and uses no ionizing radiation .
What it does use is a powerful magnetic field .
Magnetic resonance tomography has been around for just over 30 years so it is much younger than something like X - ray technology ( > 110 years ) but ordinary MRI technology uses magnetic flux densities of 1.5 and 3 tesla .
A new MRI device delivered to Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt ( PTB ) and the Experimental and Clinical Research Center ( ECRC ) of the Max Delbrück Center ( MDC ) for Molecular Medicine in Berlin - Buch uses a whopping 7 tesla and , they say , it will provide the clearest images ever taken of our insides .
The core of the magnetic resonance tomograph , a magnet weighing 32 tons , is lifted from the transporter .

These new devices have been used in research but this will be the first time it has been used for hospitals and clinics and they believe it will jumpstart cardiovascular research .
Heart research by magnetic resonance tomography is still considered very difficult .
The magnetic resonance tomograph cost approximately seven million Euros and weighs 35 tons and was delivered to its new location at the Max Delbrück Center yesterday .
Its higher magnetic field will provide sharper images and better insights into the smallest structures of the human body .
The aim is to detect the risk or commencement of an illness at a very early stage in heart , brain and cancer research .
The magnet has reached his final position : it is surrounded by a cage of steel weighin 250 tons which will , in future , be used to protect the surrounding area from the magnetic field .
The hole in the center of the magnet will be the " pipe " in which the patient will be pushed in order to be examined ..
Credit : PTB
PTB scientists , the group dealing with the physics and technical issues of the joint project , are responsible for making the potential of this tomograph useful for applications in clinics .
The other partners in the project , besides the Max Delbrück Center and the PTB , are Siemens , the constructors of the 7 tesla device , and the Charité hospital .
The new ultra - high - field MRT equipment of the ECRC has been completed with a 9.4 tesla small animal MRT of the Bruker company which was supplied three weeks ago .

Will India and Pakistan ever finish the cat - fight and get on with a real war ?
“ We live in hope , ” like my grandma used to say — but do n’t hold your breath .
Listening to the Indian and Paki generals shaking their little fists at each other , with their little mustaches going up and down , hearing the Indians talk about how their patience is “ almost ” exhausted — it just gets me down .
This fag - slapping shit gives war a bad name .
I used to live next to a housefull of Pakistanis in Santa Ana .
They were all brothers or cousins or something and ran this pirate cab company , and they fought non-stop — but I never saw a single punch thrown .
It was this weird Pakistani style of fighting : they ’d yell for hours before they escalated to slapping — weird downward slaps , like elephants hitting each other with their trunks .
After a couple minutes of that , they ’d each retreat about five yards and look around for automotive parts to throw .
They ’d keep throwing till they were tired , or till they accidentally hit one of the half - fixed taxis parked in the yard .
That was the only thing that sobered them up : hurting a car .
When they drew blood on each other they ’d cheer , but if they broke a windshield they ’d instantly stop fighting and run up to the car moaning and sobbing .
The way those cabdrivers fought is the way India and Pakistan fight — maybe it ’s something in the water there .
It ’s always low - intensity , low - risk skirmishing , like these “ mortar duels ” the networks keep reporting from Kashmir .
Mortar duels are the perfect combat for cowards , because the mortar is a very high - trajectory weapon , so you can fire it over hills and never even see the enemy face - to - face .
I ’m not knocking mortars ; they can be powerful weapons in the hands of a real army .
The East Asians are particularly good with them .
A mortar barrage from Chinese or Vietnamese troops is a serious deal .
But that ’s because East Asian troops take the risk of lugging their tubes right up to the front line , where they can do quick rangefinding and walk their fire right up to the enemy positions .
The mortar barrages you hear about on the India - Pakistan line are nothing like that .
These are from mortars dug in way behind the front line .
The aim is n’t really to hit any enemy troops but to make a lot of noise , a lot of chimpanzee - style hooting .
At most , they aim at a fixed target already plotted .
Like a village .
Border villages make great targets , because they ’re not going anywhere and ca n’t fight back .
So both armies blow up huts on the other side of the border and kill a lot of livestock .
Somebody should do a history of livestock - killing as an element of military history .
In the fifteenth century , the Germans called soldiers “ the horse - butchers ’ league ” because it was basic tactics to kill knights ’ horses — by taking them out of the saddle , you cut their speed and mass by two - thirds .
In “ primitive warfare ” like you see in Africa , killing the enemy ’s cattle is the worst blow you can inflict , worse than killing the wives .
And in Kashmir right now , the main target for the brave mortarmen of both armies is livestock .
You mortar a village and you ’ll only kill a few villagers ; the rest will duck inside , get down on the floor after the first shells hit .
But cattle can’t duck , so they inevitably get shrapnelled into hamburger .
And the really sad thing is the villagers — on the Indian side of the border , anyway — ca n’t even eat the sacred - cow meat .
That ’s one good argument for Islam , I guess : at least you can eat the cattle - casualties .
Or maybe not , because the Muslims have that whole “ halal ” deal where you can only eat animals killed in the proper Mohammedan manner .
I doubt if an 82 - mm mortar is an Imam - approved slaughtering device .
Religion — ai n’t it wonderful ?
Anyway , the point is : the longer these two chickenshit armies mortar each other , the less likely it is they ’ll ever get down to business with a real war .
The mortar duels are military masturbation , a way of letting off steam .
When you mortar each other for months and months , you ’re signaling the fact that you scared of a real fight .
The Indian Army has the weapons and the numbers to win .
They ’ve got plenty of hardware and 1.1 million men , roughly the number of riders on the average Indian train .
But it ’s hard to believe the Indian Army has the right spirit when you see them drilling in those wacky uniforms , doing the Monty Python moves they got from the British .
Goosestepping , swaggersticks , little mustaches — it ’s pathetic .
You keep looking around for John Cleese as officer - in - charge .
True , the Indians have beaten the Pakistanis three times out of three ( in 1947 , 1965 and 1971 ) .
But look at what happened the one time they tried fighting a real army : the India - China war of 1962 .
India decided that its new status as world power required it to grab a few square miles of Himalayan wasteland from China .
They worked themselves up into a war frenzy and attacked the Chinese .
The Chinese , who do n’t do woofing , made no boasts , tried smoothing things over , and when that failed , quietly flattened the Indian army .
It was a rout : mustaches and swaggersticks sprinting downhill so fast the snow had n’t yet melted on their helmets when they hit 120 - degree Delhi .
After that , the Indians decided they ’d stick to picking on someone less than half their own size : the Pakistanis .
The Pakistani Army only has 550,000 men — just about the number of spectators crushed to death in the average cricket match in Karachi .
They talk big — what do you expect , when the name Pakistan means “ land of the pure ” ?
But they ’ve lost 3 out of 3 to the Hindus .
The Pakistani Army is one of those third - world armies that specialize in protection money , not war .
The Army runs the country , and the intelligence service , the ISI , runs the Army .
And the ISI does n’t want a real fight .
They ’d rather shake down the local drug dealers and let the Kashmiri “ jihadi ” groups they control raid India .
It ’s safer and cheaper .
Besides , they know they ’d lose a real war .
As long as the Pakistanis act through the “ jihadi , ” they can keep denying any involvement at all .
In other words : it ’s the usual cowardly standoff .
But we ’re supposed to believe it might get serious this time , because the ruling party in India are “ Hindu militants . ”
Uh…yeah .
“ Hindu militants ” !
I ca n’t help it , that phrase just cracks me up every time I hear it .
What does a Hindu militant do , anyway ?
Scream , “ You bastard , you ate my great - grandfather ! ” at the drive - thru window of the New Delhi Burger King ?
The only thing these “ Hindu militants ” ever did was burn down shops selling Valentine ’s Day cards .
Do n’t ask me why .
Apparently they ’re anti-love .
I have to agree with them on that .
Death to Love !
Make War on Love !
I ’m all for that .
But I just do n’t see how putting a match to some Hallmark cards qualifies you to be the kind of “ militant ” who actually fights and wins wars .
All I know is , militants whose big atrocity is burning Hallmark cards do n’t sound too scary .
Just reasonable .
Throughout the fortnight - long Battle of the Stimulus Package — the Capitol Hill confrontation that culminates this week in a signing ceremony for a historically unprecedented piece of legislation that will inject more than three - quarters of a trillion dollars ’ worth of adrenaline into America ’s fluttering economic heart — one question preoccupied commentators and observers , especially those desperate for relief from the daunting substance of the matter : was President Obama being “ bipartisan ” enough ?
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Some discussed the question calmly , others less so ; but there was something like a consensus that if non-trivial numbers of Republican legislators failed to support the stimulus bill the fault , and the obloquy , would be Obama’s .
“ The bill will be judged a political success not simply if it becomes law , but if it ’s deemed ‘ bi- partisan , ’ ” ABC ’s “ The Note ” Web site warned .
The Los Angeles Times , while calling the bill ’s quick passage in the House of Representatives a “ big legislative victory ” for Obama , cautioned that “ it was clear that his efforts so far had not delivered the post - partisan era that he called for in his inauguration address . ”
( The man had been in office for eight days — a tight schedule for era-delivering . )
On the Senate floor , the remarks of Lindsey Graham , of South Carolina , provided evidence that an age of perpetual political peace had not yet dawned .
“ This bill stinks ! ” Senator Graham exclaimed .
And :
The process that ’s led to this bill stinks !
. . .
There is no negotiation going on here !
Nobody is negotiating !
We ’re making this up as we go !
The polling numbers are scaring the hell out of everybody , and they ’re in a panic !
They ’re running from one corner of the Capitol to the other to try to cobble votes together to lower the cost of the bill to say we solved the problem !
This is not the way you spend a trillion dollars !
The “ process , ” admittedly , was a hurried one ; it had to be , what with the banking system frighteningly close to collapse , the economy in its deepest crisis since the nineteen - thirties , and job losses , which approached three million last year , accelerating to more than a half million a month .
Still , the President found time for cordiality , inviting Republicans from both Houses of Congress to join him for cocktails , a Super Bowl party , and more cocktails .
Nor was his “ outreach ” purely social .
“ This was not a drive - by P.R. stunt , and I actually thought it might be , ” Zach Wamp , of Tennessee , told the Times after he and his Republican House colleagues finished a long session with the President .
“ It was a substantive , in - depth discussion with our conference . ”
More to the point , the bill they were discussing had already been tailored to soothe Republican sensibilities .
It included tax cuts as well as direct spending , and its size , however huge by normal standards , was not even half the output — two trillion dollars — that the recession is expected to drain from the economy in the next two years .
“ I finally feel I can accept the things I ’m too lazy to change . ”

After the Senate passed the stimulus , which Sean Hannity , on Fox News , denounced as “ the European Socialist Act of 2009 , ” Mitch McConnell , the Senate Republican leader , pronounced it “ a dramatic move in the direction of indeed turning America into Western Europe . ”
Whether or not greater income equality , better health , and fewer prisons would really be a dystopian nightmare , McConnell ’s vision of “ the Europeanization of America ” has already come true in a way that bears directly on the question of “ bipartisanship ” : what might be called America ’s parliamentary parties have come to resemble their disciplined European counterparts .
As recently as the nineteen - sixties , for reasons of history and origins , the Democrats were a stapled - together collection of Southern reactionaries , big - city hacks , and urban and agrarian liberals ; the Republicans were a jumble of troglodyte conservatives , Yankee moderates , and the odd progressive .
Ideological incoherence made bipartisanship feasible .
The post - civil - rights , post - Vietnam realignment , along with the gerrymandered creation of safe districts , has given us — on Capitol Hill , at least — an almost uniformly rightist G.O.P. and a somewhat less uniformly progressive array of Democrats .
In 1981 , President Reagan ’s tax cuts passed with the help of forty - eight cross-party votes in the House and thirty - seven in the Senate .
Obama ’s stimulus got zero and three , respectively .
( Getting those three — a practical necessity , thanks to the scandalous routinization of the filibuster — precipitated the vote - cobbling scramble that Senator Graham was hyperventilating about . )
Last week ’s sudden withdrawal , under Party pressure , of Judd Gregg , a conservative Republican senator from New Hampshire , as Obama ’s nominee for Secretary of Commerce was another signal that Hill Republicans have opted for total war .
But this does not mean that Obama ’s hopes for bipartisanship have been entirely in vain .
A Gallup poll taken last week found twenty - eight per cent of Republican voters ( and fifty - six per cent of independents ) backing the stimulus .
It had the support not only of the labor federations but also of the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce .
And four Republican governors — California ’s Arnold Schwarzenegger , Connecticut ’s Jodi Rell , Florida ’s Charlie Crist , and Vermont ’s Jim Douglas — joined fifteen of their Democratic colleagues in signing a letter calling for its enactment .
A Republican governor , you might say , is sort of like a Republican congressman — except with actual responsibilities .
At the President ’s first full - scale news conference last week , two of the thirteen questions were about bipartisanship .
As usual , Obama took the long view .
The American people , he said , “ understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up here in Washington , and it ’s going to take time to break down some of those bad habits . ”
His overtures to Republicans “ were not designed simply to get some short - term votes .
They were designed to try to build up some trust over time . ”
At the same time , he was firm about his “ bottom line , ” which ,
when it comes to the recovery package , is : send me a bill that creates or saves four million jobs , because everybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting people back to work , making sure that folks are staying in their homes , that they can send their kids to college .
That does n’t negate the continuing efforts that I ’m going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues .
And , hopefully , the tone that I ’ve taken , which has been consistently civil and respectful , will pay some dividends over the long term .
Asked what he had learned from the stimulus tussle , Obama said again that “ old habits are hard to break , ” and added :
Now , just in terms of the historic record here , the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted .
And you ’ll remember that , when we initially introduced our framework , they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework .
Those tax cuts are still in there .
I mean , I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts , knowing that I was going to want some , and then let them take credit for all of them .
And maybe that ’s the lesson I learned .
But there was consultation .
There will continue to be consultation .
Fifty years ago , the civil - rights movement understood that nonviolence can be an effective weapon even if — or especially if — the other side refuses to follow suit .
Obama has a similarly tough - minded understanding of the political uses of bipartisanship , which , even if it fails as a tactic for compromise , can succeed as a tonal strategy : once the other side makes itself appear intransigently , destructively partisan , the game is half won .
Obama is learning to throw the ball harder .
But it ’s not Rovian hardball he ’s playing .
More like Gandhian hardball . ♦
In the 19th and 20th centuries , archaeologists discovered traces of India 's earliest civilization , one that developed in the fertile Indus River Valley between 3000 and 1900 BCE .
Larger than either the Egyptian or Mesopotamian civilizations of the same period , the population of the Indus Valley ( or Harappan ) Civilization is estimated at anywhere between two and five million people .
Among the civilization 's 2000 major settlements were the planned cities of Harappa and Mohenjo - daro , trading and craft production centers where craftspeople and villages wrought pottery and intricate beads made of gold , copper , and ivory .
Archaeological evidence shows that after 700 years of stability , the civilization declined .
Most of the Indus settlements had been abandoned or had shrunk in size by about 1800 BCE .
Many factors contributed to the end of the Indus civilization , but climate change is emerging as a primary reason for its gradual demise .
Geological evidence shows that the region 's climate grew colder and drier , in part perhaps because of a weakened monsoon .
By 1800 BCE , the Ghaggar - Hakra River , a river in the region that paralleled the Indus system and that some scholars suggest is the Saraswati , the lost sacred river of , was severely diminished .
As a result , cities were abandoned and though some of the population remained , many migrated to more fertile lands in the east around the Ganges and Jumna River .
At least 111 people were killed and more than 200 injured after an overturned petrol tanker exploded in Kenya yesterday , police said today .
The tanker exploded in the town of Molo , about 105 miles from Nairobi , after crowds had gathered around it in an attempt to collect free fuel .
Nearby hospitals were filled with victims , including small children , who had suffered severe burns in the blast .
The Kenya Red Cross said most of the dead were women and children who had rushed to the scene as news spread that the tanker had overturned , and warned that the death toll was likely to rise .
" Most of the families will have a hard time [ identifying relatives ] because these bodies are charred beyond recognition , " Patrick Nyongesa , the regional manager for the Red Cross , said .
Three police officers trying to control the crowd before the vehicle exploded were also reported to have been killed .
" Everybody was screaming … most of them were running with fire on their bodies , they were just running into the bush , " Charles Kamau , a witness who had been driving through Molo at the time of the explosion , said .
" I just ran to where there was no fire . "
Raila Odinga , the Kenyan prime minister , told a news conference it appeared that a cigarette had sparked the explosion .
He offered condolences to bereaved families and called for an education programme to prevent further tragedies .
" This is a terrible blow to the nation of Kenya , " he said , adding that Kenyans should stay away from tankers after similar accidents .
Fuel blasts are common in Nigeria , where residents tap petrol pipelines to take fuel for cooking or resale on the black market .
In 2006 , a pipeline blast killed 200 people in Nigeria .

Synthesis
Making A Toxin
Researchers build a poisonous lipid found in mussels
A quirky lipid that is associated with seafood toxicity has been constructed in a lab for the first time .
The work opens the possibility of developing tools to detect and study the molecule .
Shutterstock TOXICALLY TASTY
Some mussels accumulate algae that produce chlorosulfolipids ( shown ) which are harmful to animals that consume them .
First isolated from mussels in the Adriatic Sea , the compound is " a chemical oddity " because it 's a lipid that features both a sulfate group and six chlorine atoms , which is unusual , says Erick M. Carreira , a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Zurich , who led the research .
He and coworkers report the synthesis in Nature ( 2009 , 457 , 573 ) .
The toxin probably originates from algae that is consumed by the mussel , explains Ernesto Fattorusso , a pharmacologist at the University of Naples Federico II who isolated the chlorosulfolipid in 1999 .
" But we were only able to extract a few milligrams , " Fattorusso says .
" This synthesis appears relatively simple , considering the stereochemical complexity of the molecule , " so there are hopes of obtaining enough of it for extensive biological studies .
Researchers are uncertain whether this compound is a direct toxic agent in cases of seafood poisoning .
The synthesis could help them make this determination .
Moreover , the synthesis will allow investigators to examine other biological roles of chlorosulfolipids , such as being a component of algae cell membranes , writes Christopher D. Vanderwal of the University of California , Irvine , in an associated Nature commentary .
" I 'm interested in finding out why nature would put chlorines in a lipid at all , " Carreira says .
Vanderwal also notes that the 10 - step synthetic strategy that produced the unusual lipids is " simple and direct , but seems to be the result of painstaking experimentation . "
" There were a lot of dead ends , " Carreira says .
But students Christian Nilewski and Roger W. Geisser reached their synthetic goal by employing alkene dichlorination reactions and an epoxide ring - opening sequence .
The ring - opening step led to a " chemical surprise , " Carreira notes .
Normally , epoxides undergo ring opening with an inversion of configuration at the carbon that is being attacked , but here the team observed a retention of configuration .
It turns out that the chloride - induced epoxide opening proceeds by double inversion , Carreira explains .
He and his coworkers also propose that an unusual four - or five - membered chloronium ring intermediate is formed during the process .
" There are many interesting mechanistic curiosities to be explored in this system , " he adds .
Because the synthesis is not enantioselective , Carreira says that he and his colleagues will next work to develop an enantioselective version of the procedure , as well as syntheses of other chlorosulfolipids .
More to the point : for those who insist that others put themselves in the position of a resident of Sderot -- as though that will , by itself , prove the justifiability of the Israeli attack -- the idea literally never occurs to them that they ought to imagine what it 's like to live under foreign occupation for 4 decades ( and , despite the 2005 " withdrawal from Gaza , " Israel continues to occupy and expand its settlements on Palestinian land and to control and severely restrict many key aspects of Gazan life ) .
No thought is given to what it is like , what emotions it generates , what horrible acts start to appear justifiable , when you have a hostile foreign army control your borders and airspace and internal affairs for 40 years , one which builds walls around you , imposes the most intensely humiliating conditions on your daily life , blockades your land so that you 're barred from exiting and prevented from accessing basic nutrition and medical needs for your children to the point where a substantial portion of the underage population suffers from stunted growth .
So extreme is their emotional identification with one side ( Israel ) that it literally never occurs to them to give any thought to any of that , to imagine what it 's like to live in those circumstances .
But I was surprised to find that although the people of Sderot who I met wanted the missiles to end they understood that militarism would not protect them .
The people I met with were not calling for war , they were calling for negotiation .
And so this is an unnecessary , cruel and cynical war -- a war that could have been avoided if our leaders had shown courage during the months of the cease - fire to truly work toward creating better lives for people whose only crime is that they live in the south .
But I know the answer to our conflict will not come with this war .
We will know peace only when we accept the fact that the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have every right to lives of dignity .
We will know peace only when we recognize that we must negotiate with Hamas , our enemy , even if we are devastated that the Palestinians did not elect a more moderate party to lead them .
We will know peace only when our leaders stop considering our lives cheap and expendable , and help us create a beautiful , green Negev , free of fear and despair .

the best thing ever to happen to Germany
It 's happening slowly , but it is happening .
Blinkered American opinion is shifting .
With each atrocity committed by the bloodthirsty Israelis , more Americans lose their ability to rationalize the inexcusable .
I admire what Glenn Greenwald has written :
The excuse for the current massacre of Palestinian civilians comes down to so - called " rocket attacks " on the border town of Sderot .
Those attacks took 13 victims in eight years , and not one of the victims is recent .
Adam Horowitz has been to Sderot : Julia Chaitin , a senior lecturer at the Sapir Academic College near Sderot , has written these words :
The current destruction of Gaza reminds me of the Ardeatine massacre of World War II .
On March 23 , 1944 , Italian partisans in Rome launched an attack on a facist convoy , killing 28 .
Hitler ordered the reprisal killing of 50 Italian partisans for every dead fascist .
The German security commander in Rome , Herbert Kappler , " downsized " this directive to a 10 - to - 1 ratio .
As a result , 280 Italians ( mostly civilians ) were murdered in the Ardeatine caves , an atrocity which has lived in the annals of infamy .
Ten - to - one reprisal killings .
During World War II .
And people areangry about it .
And now , in retaliation for 15 rocket attacks over the course of eight years , Israel has decided to massacre an entire civilian population .
The proportions are much worse than 10 - to - 1 , worse than Hitler 's suggestion of 50 - to - 1 . And yet here in America , there are still people -- if we can use the term " people " to describe such pitiless brutes -- who would consider this " retaliation " against the Palestinians justified .
Most of these brutes are not Jews but so - called Christian Zionists .
Consider the historical irony , as you compare Gaza to the Ardeatine massacre .
Hitler was far kinder to the Italian partisans than Israel is to the Palestinians .
Too many Jews learned the wrong lesson from World War II .
The victims of persecution came to equate strength with a willingness to persecute others .
Like many other peoples in many other times and places , a large number of Jews were seduced into the false belief that the hardest heart beats longest .
But history teaches a very different lesson .
Hitler 's Germany didlast .
The Third Reich was destroyed for its evil .
Germany was divided like an earthworm .
Yet it recovered .
Who can deny that -- in the long run -- was the eradication of its government and its ( temporary ) loss of national sovereignty at the end of World War II ?
I 'm afraid that it is far too late to realize Julia Chaitin 's dream .
I fear that the time for negotiation has passed .
Israel must be destroyed , just as Hitler 's Germany was destroyed .
All Jews throughout the world must forevermore rid themselves of the lunatic , racist dream of " Jewish state . "
Jews living in Israel will either agree to live in a single multi-ethnic democracy in which everyone ruled ( directly or indirectly ) by the government has an equal vote -- or they will die in their madness .
记得去年年底的时候，在网站上有看到过消费者投诉电影院，禁止他们带麦当劳的食品进电影院，却对电影院自己贩卖的爆米花等东西视而不见，前2天刚好又看到台湾新闻局公告，电影院不可以张贴禁携外食的标示。
其实，影院禁携外食是有正当理由的，而且说服力也很强。因为影厅内部大都是地毯和吸音的墙壁，很容易吸附食物气味，如果有人带热食进去，往往会有很重的味道，而影院本身为了音效和隔音效果，通风性一般都较差，所以这些味道不容易排出。
但为何只禁止外带的食物，而对自家影院卖的食物不一视同仁？自家影院卖的爆米花就不是热食，而且就不会被地毯和吸音的墙壁吸食气味？影院到底是卖电影，还是卖外食？
电影院禁携外食，但又可以选择影院内贩卖的事物，这跟大陆这边餐馆禁止外带酒水，似乎有同出一辙的韵味。大陆餐馆很多都禁止外带酒水，因为餐馆为了实现薄利多销，会用相当便宜的各种食物优惠来吸引顾客，而更多真正的利润其实都会来自于酒水这样可以赚取暴利的附带消费。同样，电影院的观影价格越来越便宜，各式各样的优惠也是越来越多，而在这越来越" 薄利 " 的情形下，要怎样才能实现 " 多销 " 的目的呢？禁携外食，刚好可以在 " 薄利 " 之下大大增加影院的附加收入，而在此之下，影院的" 外食" 又跟餐馆的酒水一样往往卖得比一般的市场价格贵上很多倍，消费者为了看电影，对电影院的禁携外食规则，不能让胃口忍耐的话，就得对影院的高价 " 外食" 忍气吞声 。
其实想要以各种可以利用的手段实现利润最大化是合理的，但是以强制消费者接受交易规则的方式就值得商榷。"经营者不得以格式合同、通知、声明、店堂告示等方式作出对消费者不公平、不合理的规定，或者减轻、免除其损害消费者合法权益应当承担的民事责任。"这样类似原则的条款可以散见于各个国家，这至少就说明用店堂告示的方式并不就意味着对所有消费者就自然有效，而更关键的是，不论是经营者" 禁携外食 " 还是" 禁止外带酒水 "
其实都是强迫消费者接受高价但非更优质的食品，实质是损害了消费者的公平交易的权利。
话虽如此，即使新闻局公告电影院不可以张贴禁携外食的标示，但违反的业者仍不能处以罚则，虽然消费者可以主张规定无效，但这一公告的效应已经大打折扣。既然不能对违反的业者处以罚则，那么即使消费者可以主张规定无效，业者一旦强势要求消费者一定要按照他们的规定才能进入观影的话，无非也只是徒增消费者和业者的口角和一肚子的怨气而已。
在激烈的竞争和利润最大化的商业动机促使下，即使商家受限于"
不可以张贴禁携外食的标示"
，而又会出现何种" 道高一尺，魔高一丈" 的方法，值得期待。
The following two tabs change content below .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Even Republican governors who have said they will reject some of Washington ’s stimulus money will end up taking much of the funding , the leader of the National Governors ’ Association said on Saturday .
“ In the end ... most of the governors will accept most of the money and use it for the benefit of their citizens , ” said Pennsylvania ’s Democratic governor , Edward Rendell , at the association ’s annual meeting .
In the four days since President Barack Obama signed the $ 787 billion economic recovery bill into law , providing increases in federal backing for states ’ social services , infrastructure and education funding , at least two Republican governors have said they may not take all of the money .
Democrat Obama made the stimulus package the major focus of his first month in office , but it won only three Republican votes in Congress .
Republicans charge that was filled with wasteful spending and its $ 282 billion in tax cuts were not enough .
Mississippi ’s Republican Governor , Haley Barbour , told reporters at the meeting he would decline some $ 50 million in extra unemployment insurance funding , because it includes a condition for expanding the benefits to more people .
“ Once the federal money is gone we would have to replace it with state money , which means we would have to raise the unemployment insurance tax on employers , ” he said .
Even if governors turn down money , the economic recovery law includes a provision allowing state legislatures to override governors .
Barbour added that “ 100 percent of the governors are going to take some percentage of the funding . ”
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , who has often been mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate for the 2012 elections , said late Friday he too would not take Louisiana ’s portion of the unemployment money .
The Louisiana Workforce Commission estimates that would total $ 32.8 million over three years , but once the stimulus plan ended the state would have to cover the benefits at roughly $ 12 million a year .
Many U.S. mayors have worried much of the stimulus money will be delayed at the state level and not reach cities in time to help them .
Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans , Louisiana , said on Friday that because of Jindal ’s possible presidential aspirations , the governor has “ a certain way he has to talk right now . ”
Nagin added , “ any dollars he does not want , we will take them gladly . ”
But in Maryland where unemployment has spiked in recent months , Democratic Governor Martin O’Malley said his state had no problem with the unemployment provisions in the law .
“ I do n’t believe they ’ll cause tax increases or spending increases , ” he said .
“ We welcome the unemployment dollars . ”
WAITING FOR THE DOLLARS TO FLOW
The governors will meet with Obama on Monday to discuss the economy .
Many states have already coordinated with their transportation agencies to apply the roads funds the federal government will distribute within the next three weeks .
The package includes $ 120 billion for public works projects including highway and rail projects .
Almost all agree , though , the stimulus plan will not make up for budget shortfalls hitting a majority of states .
“ There is not a state in this union that is going to be able to use this stimulus money and wipe away all of the problems and all of the challenges that we face , ” Rendell said , adding that $ 1 billion in spending still had to be cut recently from Pennsylvania ’s budget .
The assistance for states will only “ partly close budget gaps in fiscal 2009 and 2010 that are estimated to total between $ 100 billion and $ 350 billion , ” credit rating agency Moody ’s Investors Services said on Wednesday .
Utah Governor Jon Huntsman , a Republican , said his state recently cut its transportation budget in order to preserve funding for education and other social services .
“ Now the stimulus money comes in and it basically allows us to backfill in many of these critical areas like public and higher eduction and healthcare , ” he said .
“ So we can now take the transportation money that was taken off the table a couple of months ago back to where it was originally intended .
Our transportation budget is going to be whole . ”
Jack 's parents were parted from their son for a " horrendous " 30 minutes
A mother whose baby was abducted when a thief posing as a police officer stole her car in Greater Manchester thought she would " never see him again " .
Four - month - old Jack was later dumped on a pavement after the silver Lexus , owned by his mother Emma Williams , was snatched on Hypatia Street , Bolton .
She said : " I was frantic because the speed he drove off at with Jack in the back , I did n't know what would happen . "
The baby was dumped 30 minutes later .
A 39 - year - old man has been arrested .
Jack 's parents endured a " horrendous " wait before the baby was brought back in a different car , a Nissan Micra , which was later found crashed .
Greater Manchester Police said the parents ' ordeal began at 1715 GMT on Thursday when the mother was approached by a man while sitting in her Lexus .

She managed to get her other son , two - year - old Lewis , out of the car but could not reach baby Jack .
" He sped off with Jack in the back .
I was screaming ' He 's got my kids ' . "
Police know the Lexus was involved in a hit - and - run collision on Bury Road , outside the Black Horse Pub , about 15 minutes later .
No -one was injured and the offender drove off , but the car is yet to be recovered .
At 1745 GMT , the distraught parents were still standing at the scene of the theft when a man in a Micra pulled up and put their baby on the pavement .
The car had been parked outside offices when it was stolen A short time later a patrol officer spotted the Micra turning into Thicketford Road , towards Winchester Way .
By the time the officer turned his car around to follow , he found it had crashed into a Citroen Xsara and a Volkswagen Passat .
The driver and two other people were injured in the collision .
Det Con Graham Clare said : " This was a horrendous ordeal for the family who were left absolutely distraught that their baby was taken from them .
" Fortunately he was returned safe and well but the time he was missing must have felt like an eternity for his parents . "
The man was arrested on suspicion of theft and kidnapping and is currently at hospital being treated for injuries to his leg and neck .

Bank of America , reacting to the recent controversy over executive perks , plans to sell three of its eight corporate jets , sources inside the bank tell CNBC .
BofAhas had one of the biggest fleets of corporate aircraft on Wall Street and had been reluctant to talk about it in the past .
The fleet includes 8 corporate jets , comprised of 2 falcon corporate jets and 5 gulfstreams , plus something they call the Merrill Lynch global express .
Each is valued between $ 45 and $ 50 million .
In addition to the jet sales , BofA will sell a helicopter from Merrill Lynch that it aquired in the merger between the two companies .
BofA says it never used the aircraft .
The same sources say BofA will also divest itself from one of two corporate apartments in New York City .
One of those is located at the Time Warner Center .

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar says he 's scrapping the lease of dozens of parcels of federal land for oil and gas drilling in Utah 's redrock country .
Salazar says the Bush administration rushed an auction in December of some of the country 's most precious landscapes around national parks and the wild Green River .
Salazar on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Land Management , which is part of the Interior Department , not to cash checks from winning bidders for the parcels at issue in a lawsuit filed by environmental groups .
A federal judge last month put the sale of the 77 parcels on hold .
Now Salazar is saying he wo n't sell any of them -- at least not until the Obama administration has a chance to take a second look .
In a news release , Salazar said , " We will take a fresh look at these 77 parcels and at the adequacy of the environmental review and analysis that led to their being offered for oil and gas development .
I am also concerned that there was inadequate consultation with other agencies , including the National Park Service . "
The parcels total about 130,225 acres and are in the vicinity of two national parks and Dinosaur National Monument .
Environmental groups and actor Robert Redford have been fighting the lease auction that was announced on Election Day .
They believe some of the land in question is too close to national parks and monuments .
Environmental groups called today 's announcement a step in the right direction .
Stephen Bloch , an attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance , said , " We 're thrilled .
We think that Secretary Salazar made exactly the right move to tell the BLM to back off from leasing these 77 parcels . "
But petroleum advocates fear the decision will impact the state 's economy .
President of the Utah Petroleum Association Lee Peacock said , " It will put a damper on future oil and gas development if this sentiment continues because we do depend on the use of those public lands . "
Sen .
Bob Bennett said he was disappointed with today 's decision .
He sent a statement that reads in part : " I am concerned that today 's announcement was motivated more by political reasons than environmental reasons , and I hope this is not a preview of what is to come for Utah in the Obama administration . "
Of the 130 parcels offered , bids were received on 116 parcels , totaling 148,598 acres .
Separately , an investigation is ongoing into an environmental activist who infiltrated the lease auction .
Tim DeChristopher , a college economics student , bid up prices at the auction and ended up winning 13 parcels in an effort , he says , to protect wild lands in Utah .
The U.S. Attorney for the Utah District , Brett L. Tolman , issued a statement saying today 's action by the Interior Department does not impact the investigation into DeChristopher .
He said , " Today 's decision by the Interior Department to withdraw the BLM oil and gas leases in Utah does not impact our obligation to analyze the facts and law at the time of the alleged conduct in the DeChristopher case .
" The decision to withdraw the leases does not wipe the slate clean .
We are obligated to enforce the law , a responsibility we take very seriously .
As we do with every case referred to our office , we will continue to carefully review the facts in this case and , if appropriate , present it to a grand jury .
Because it is an ongoing criminal investigation , we will not be making further comment . "

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
Three shark attacks in Australia in two days this week sparked a global media frenzy of “ Jaws ” proportions , but sharks are more at risk in the ocean than humans with man killing millions of sharks each year .
Sharks are displayed after being unloaded from wooden boats in a fish port in Banyuwangi in Indonesia 's East Java province in this June 27 , 2008 file photo .
Three shark attacks in Australia in two days this week sparked a global media frenzy of " Jaws " proportions , but sharks are more at risk in the ocean than humans with man killing million of sharks each year .

Sharks are the top of the marine food chain , a powerful predator which has no match in its watery realm , until man enters the ocean .
Commercial fishing and a desire for Asian shark fin soup sees up to 100 million sharks , even protected endangered species of sharks , slaughtered around the world each year , says the Shark Research Institute ( Australia ) .
Yet in contrast , sharks , apparently , do not like the taste of humans .
Very few shark attacks involve the shark actually eating the human , unlike a land - based predator like a lion or tiger .
“ Most of the incidents in the ( Florida - based ) global shark attack file have nothing to do with predation , ” says the Institute on its website ( www.auscyber.net).
Unlike fat seals -- the preferred meal of sharks like the Great White -- humans are bony with not much fat .
Sharks use various sensors to hunt their prey and a quick bite will tell it whether its found a good meal .
Usually when a shark bites a human it then swims off .
Unfortunately for humans , sharks are big and we are small , so a large shark bite can mean death from rapid loss of blood .
“ Sharks are opportunistic feeders .
They hear us in the water , we sound like a thrashing fish or animal in the water , and they just react to that instinctively and go to take a bite , ” marine analyst Greg Pickering told local radio on Wednesday .
According to the latest figures by the International Shark Attack File , there was only one fatal shark attack in 2007 .
It took place in New Caledonia in the South Pacific .
The mean number of deaths between 2000 and 2007 was 5 a year .
“ You have more chance of being killed driving to the beach , ” said John West , curator of the Australian Shark Attack File at Sydney ’s Taronga Zoo .
In fact , the number of fatal attacks around the world has been falling during the 20th century , due to advances in beach safety , medical treatment and public awareness of shark habitats .
The bulk of shark attacks do not happen in Australian waters , despite its shark reputation , but in North American waters .
Half of the world ’s shark attacks occur in the United States , and one third of the world ’s attacks are in Florida waters .
In 2007 , there were 50 shark attacks in U.S. waters , compared with 13 in Australia in the same year -- none were fatal .
The big difference between Florida and Australia is that the later has much bigger sharks and therefore more fatal attacks .
From 1990 to 2007 , Australia had 19 fatal attacks , Florida 4 .
But there have only been a total of 56 fatal shark attacks in Australia in the past 50 years , or an average of about 1 a year , says the Australian Shark Attack File .
The last fatal attack occurred in December 2008 , when a Great White attacked a 51 - year - old man while he was snorkeling off a beach south of Perth in Western Australia .
So , is it safe to go back in the water ?
Shark attacks are on the rise worldwide , but according to the International Shark Attack File , that does n’t mean there is an increased rate of shark attacks .
“ As the world population continues its upsurge and interest in aquatic recreation concurrently rises , we realistically should expect increases in the number of shark attacks , ” says the file on its website ( www.flmnh.ufl.edu).
SHARKS IN DECLINE
But while more humans enter the ocean each year and for longer periods of time , the shark population is declining , theoretically reducing the chances of a shark - human encounter .
“ As a result , short - term trends in the number of shark attacks , up or down , must be viewed with caution , ” says the file .
So , if shark numbers are falling why are there more sightings of sharks off Australia ’s beaches .
Surfwatch Australia , which conducts aerial patrols of Sydney beaches , estimates shark sightings have risen 50 to 80 percent in recent years .
Wildlife officials say cleaner beach water means sharks are chasing food closer to shore .
Sydney beaches were closed this month when hammerheads started feeding on squid near swimmers .
But only about two dozen shark species are considered potentially dangerous to humans because of their size and teeth .
The Great White , Bull , Tiger and Hammerhead are among the most aggressive and responsible for most attacks in Australia .
The Great White can grow to 5.5 meters ( 15 feet ) in length , weigh up to 1,000kg and has the biting power to lift a car .
Australian scientists have recorded the bite power of a 3.2 meter ( 10 foot ) shark as equivalent to 1.5 tonnes of pressure .
The aggressive looking Grey Nurse , with its piercing eyes , pointy nose and protruding teeth , is as timid as a cat and will only attack if provoked .
But its fierce appearance has seen it hunted to the point where it is now endangered and colonies of Grey Nurse sharks off Sydney are protected .
There are 30 sharks , including the Great White , on the International Union for Conservation of Nature ’s threatened species list .
“ Sharks need our help now and we cannot let our fear push them to the brink of extinction , ” says Ben Birt , from Australia ’s Nature Conservation Council , which has launched a “ Save Our Last Sharks ” campaign .

( Treatment ) ECONOMIC PLAN EARMARKS $ 4 BILLION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
The economic stimulus bill under consideration this week in the Senate would be a windfall for law enforcement , sending nearly $ 4 billion to state justice systems , police and prevention programs .
Much of the money would preserve jobs and create new ones , says Dave Steingraber , president of the National Criminal Justice Association and executive director of Wisconsin 's Office of Justice Assistance .
" The justice system is very people - intensive , " he says .
" Whenever you push funding into the justice system , you 're talking about jobs and hiring . "
The Senate version -- like the House bill that passed last week -- includes $ 1.5 billion for Byrne Justice Assistance Grants , a favorite among state and local governments because the money has few legislative restrictions and can be used for a variety of justice - related programs .

The nonpartisan group Consumer Watchdog today called on Google to stop their rumored lobbying effort to include the sale of electronic medical records in the economic stimulus bill .
Google wants the provision that they can sell patient information to its advertising clients on its new Google Health database .
In a letter to Congress , the group expressed concerns about patient privacy , “ The medical technology portion of the economic stimulus bill does not sufficiently protect patient privacy , and recent amendments have made this situation worse .
Medical privacy must be strengthened before the measure ’s final passage , rather than allowing corporate interests to take advantage of the larger bill ’s urgency . … ”
On Friday , Republican Rep. Roy Blount added an amendment to the bill that would allow pharmacists to sell private medical information without a patient ’s knowledge .
The bill would also exempt the selling of private medical records for the purposes of research , and private medical information could also be sold to associates of companies who are holding the medical information for the purpose of activities on behalf the company holding the information .
Worst of all , in the current draft of the legislation patients have no way of tracking who has been accessing their medical records .

There have been amendments introduced by Democratic members that would require that privacy must be maintained , and databases ca n’t be accessed by unauthorized persons .
The danger with the selling of medical records is a loss of privacy .
Potential employers could base their hiring practices on an applicant ’s medical records .
Banks and lender could deny someone a loan on the basis of their medical history .
It is also certain that the selling of medical records would lead to identity theft .
The above mentioned are all reasons why privacy must be maintained .
I do n’t understand how this would not be a violation of HIPPA .
This is a terrible idea that we can only hope is not included in the final legislation .

Oshkosh Defense , a division of Oshkosh Corp. ( OSK ) , has received a $ 176 million order from the U.S. Marines Corps for more than 425 military trucks and add - on armor kits .
The vehicles will include cargo , wrecker and fifth - wheel trucks .
Under the order , the company also will provide add - on armor kits , which are separate from the factory - installed armor , and can be applied in the field .
The trucks will be used for moving payloads such as munitions , fuel , water and heavy equipment .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper won a rare suspension of Parliament on Thursday , managing to avoid being ousted by opposition parties angry over the minority Conservative government ’s economic plans and an attempt to cut off party financing .
Governor General Michaelle Jean -- the representative of Queen Elizabeth , Canada ’s head of state -- agreed to Harper ’s request to shut down Parliament until Jan 26 .
Parliament was reconvened just weeks ago after the October 14 election .
Harper ’s request for suspension was unprecedented .
No prime minister had asked for Parliament to be suspended to avoid a confidence vote in the House of Commons .
Such a vote had been set for Monday and the Conservatives almost certainly would have lost it , and faced the possibility of being replaced by a coalition of opposition parties .
After a two - hour meeting with the governor general , Harper reaffirmed his promise to present a budget on Jan 27 and called on the opposition to work with the government over the next few weeks to tackle the effects of the global financial crisis .
“ Today ’s decision will give us an opportunity -- and I ’m talking about all the parties -- to focus on the economy and to work together , ” he told reporters .
The opposition Liberals , New Democrats and the separatist Bloc Quebecois -- all to the left of the Conservatives -- had signed a deal to defeat the Conservatives and put forward a Liberal - New Democrat coalition to form a new government .
The Bloc , which wants to take French - speaking Quebec out of Canada , pledged to back the coalition ’s budgets and general policy direction .
The governor general ’s role in government , as representative of the Crown , is largely ceremonial , though she has the final word on constitutional matters .
Should the government be defeated in a confidence vote , she would decide whether to call a new election or allow the opposition to form a coalition government .

CONSTITUTIONAL BATTLE
Harper ’s gambit was the latest development in a constitutional battle that erupted last week after he tried to eliminate direct subsidies of political parties , a move that would have hit the opposition particularly hard .
He backed down on that , but the opposition parties also say they are upset that the government has not dealt adequately with the economic crisis and said it had lost the confidence of the House of Commons .
Liberal leader Stephane Dion , who would have become prime minister under the opposition ’s coalition plan , said nothing he heard from Harper on Thursday had changed his mind about trying to bring down the government .
However , he did appear to open the door a crack to not proceeding with such a plan .
“ This is about replacing Stephen Harper unless he made a monumental change , ” he told a news conference .
“ It means a recovery plan , a real recovery plan . ”
The New Democrats and Bloc maintained their insistence that Harper could not be trusted and must be removed , as did some members of Dion ’s Liberal caucus .
“ You can run but you ca n’t hide , ” said Bob Rae , who is looking to become Liberal leader when Dion steps down early in May .
He predicted the opposition would topple Harper early next year .
Slideshow ( 24 images )
However the front - runner in the Liberal leadership race , Michael Ignatieff , said he imagined Jean may have told Harper “ to have a think ” and that would be good advice for all politicians on both sides of the dispute .
Liberal legislator Keith Martin told reporters after a caucus meeting that bringing the Conservatives down was “ not at all ” a done deal .
In the back of their minds may be the fact that in much of the country the idea of a formal agreement with the separatists did not go down well .
An Ekos opinion poll taken as the crisis reached its peak showed the Conservatives had shot up in popularity to 44 percent , enough to get a parliamentary majority if an election were held today , up from the 37.6 percent they received in the October 14 vote .
Liberal support dropped to 24.1 percent from 26.2 percent , the New Democrats fell to 14.5 percent from 18.2 percent and the Bloc edged down to 9.2 percent from 10.0 percent .
The poll , released late on Thursday by CBC television , covered 2,536 respondents from December 2 - 3 and carried a 1.9 point margin of error , 19 times out of 20 .
２月７日（土）に、まつもとゆきひろが語る「ビューティフルコード」×「プログラマ35歳定年説」を開催しました。
パソナテックさんのイベントやRBCの勉強会などと重なっていたにもかかわらず、５０名を超える方に参加いただきました。お越しになった皆様、ありがとうございました。それも今回は、プログラマを対象としていましたが、見事に来場された方全員がソースコードを書いたことがあるプログラマの方々でした。なかなか全員というのはないので、これには結構びっくり。もしかして、ちょっとセグメントしすぎて、遠慮した人がいたかもと少し不安にもなるところはありました。
第 １部は 、 「 ビューティフルコード」。matzも初めて話す内容と言っていましたので、楽しみにしていましたが、やっぱり面白かったですね。「コードは製品でなく設計であって一品モノ、でも実用的であってナンボ」という話で始まり、ソースコードを読むことによる恩恵、ソースコードの持つアルゴリズムというパワーの美、ソースコードの持つ内面の美と外面の美の違いなど、美しいソースコードの考え方などをたっぷり１時間語っていただきました。最後に、そうはいっても、顧客もチームも会社もあるのでとビジネスの中で生きる職業プログラマという立場を前提としたしめくくりをいただいたのは、流石にmatzというところでしょうか。
参加いただだい たSlow Danceさん やTrinityT's LABOさんのブログにまとめていただいているので、詳細をお知りになりたい方はご参照ください。詳細なレポート、ありがとうございます。
ちなみに質問で出ていた、matzが今まで一番美しいと思ってソースコードは？ の答えは、GNUEmacsということでした。いろんな意味でGNUEmacsを引き合いに出す人はいまだに多いですよね。
第２部は、ジェイブレインの修行憲一社長と私も参加したパネルディスカッション「エンジニア35歳定年説を斬る」です。こちらは打ち合わせらしい打ち合わせをしていませんでしたので、どうなることかとは思いましたが、途中、やや混沌として時間を過ごしたものの時間内に着地することができました。ここでも「月曜９時にエンジニアが主人公のドラマをやりたい、それもキャストはキムタクと深津絵里」という話をしましたが、これだけは結構うけました（かなり本気で会社設立時から社員採用時の最終面接では必ず話す内容です）
終了後のキャリアカウンセリングの時間を都合で削ってしまったのですが、３人くらいの方が、是非話をしたいとのことだったので、そのままオフィスで少々キャリアについてご相談もさせていただきました。終了後に自発的にお声をかけてくださる方が３人もいらしたのは、主催者としてはとてもうれしい気持ちでいっぱいでした。
そして、実は午前中は、Ｗｅｂエンジニア武勇伝、Engineer25に続く新企画である「スーパーハッカー列伝」のインタビューということで、matzの人生を追いかけてみました。こちらは桜の咲くころには公開できるかと思います。matzのインタビューはあまたありますが、全体を網羅した内容のものはあまり見ないので、結構独自性が出せるかなとも思っております。お楽しみに！
The Hamas movement has accepted the Egyptian initiative for a lull and is ready to launch it this week , Palestinian sources told the al - Arabiya network on Sunday .
If all agreements are approved , the Rafah crossing will reopen this Thursday , and Hamas and Israel will declare a one - year truce brokered by Egypt
Fighting Smuggling Egypt installing cameras on Gaza border Reuters Egyptian security officials hope sensors , cameras will help detect tunnel construction in border area Egypt installing cameras on Gaza border
The Palestinian sources said Hamas has agreed to have Palestinian Authority forces manage the crossing , as long as the Hamas government would be able to send inspectors there and the two sides would cooperate and coordinate their activities .
According to the report , Israel has agreed not to intervene in the Rafah crossing 's operation .
Hamas was expected to demand that the opening of the crossing would not be linked to the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit .
This issue is expected to be included in the understandings , but not as part of the official agreement .
Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki refused to confirm or deny the report , saying that the results of Egypt 's efforts to obtain a truce would be announced on Monday .
Nabil Abu Rudeineh , the spokesman of the Palestinian presidency , said Saturday that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would arrive in Cairo on Monday " in light of surprising developments in the talks with Hamas " .
British entrepreneur Azhar Hussain does n't believe going fast and going green are mutually exclusive .
The businessman has developed an all - electric race - ready motorcycle capable of swift acceleration and remarkable velocity , and he 'll showcase it at the zero-emissions alt - fuel grand prix he 's hosting in June .
Hussain hopes his TTX machine will do for sport bikes what Tesla Motors has done for sports cars .
" We want to prove electric can be fast , " Hussain told Wired.com .
" Up to now , the electric experience for road - legal vehicles has not been great .
As far as we know , this is the fastest road - legal electric bike in the world . "
The alt - fuel revolution has been slow in coming to motorcycles , but big manufacturers like Honda and KTM now follow a growing number of start - ups in developing electric two - wheelers .
So far they 've been limited to scooters like the Vectrix VX - 1E , motocrossers like the Zero X from Zero Motorcycles or commuter bikes like the Brammo Enertia .
Hussain , who co-founded Mavizen , a maker of iPod and gaming accessories , wanted something a wee bit faster .
Something capable of , oh , zero to 60 in 3.8 seconds , and 135 mph .
The TTX01 is a prototype of the bike Hussain hopes to begin selling next year .
Although designed for the track , he says it will be suitable for the street .
With a price tag in the $ 30,000 ballpark , it wo n't be cheap , but Hussain believes there 's a market for eco - friendlier race - ready machines .
" Our customers are after performance , " Hussain says .
" Whilst these bikes will be street legal , our intention is that they will be entry - level vehicles for teams and individuals to enter the next generation of motor sport . "
He 's not alone in betting motorcyclists will pay such a premium .
Austrian motorcycle manufacturer KTM is developing a race - ready electric motocrosser , and both Honda and Yamaha are said to be working on battery - powered bikes .
Although none of those companies has said how much their green ( er ) machines might cost , they wo n't be cheap : The Zero - X goes for $ 7,450 , and the Brammo is 15 grand .
Hussain is an entrepreneur , not an engineer , so he turned over construction of the TTX01 to some of Britain 's leading green - tech firms .
They started with a 2000 Suzuki GSX - R 750 , a formidable canyon - carver , and stripped it to the frame .
They pulled the engine , transmission and radiator , and replaced them with a pair of air - cooled Agni Lynch electric motors .
Each has a continuous output of 20 kilowatts ( about 27 horsepower ) and a maximum of twice that .
The motors weigh 11 kilograms ( 24 pounds ) apiece and are 200 millimeters ( 7.8 inches ) in diameter .
" The motors have the best power - to - weight ratio available , and they are one of the most efficient around ( at ) 93 percent , " Hussain says .
Power comes from a 4.3 kilowatt - hour battery pack that sports lithium– iron phosphate cells made by LifeBatt .
The battery is good for 3,000 cycles and recharges in three hours .
Range is 20 to 40 miles , depending upon how hard you 're riding .
Hussain claims the TTX01 will do about 30 miles at 100 mph .
Of course , that kind of range wo n't go far on the track , where top - tier racers like Moto GP world champion Valentino Rossi push bikes to limits that would suck a battery dry in no time .
To meet the needs of racers , Hussain is working on a " hot - swappable " battery system that will require less than 15 seconds to replace a dead pack with a fresh one .
It 's one of the top goals , as Hussain continues developing the production version of the bike , dubbed TTX02 .
" With the introduction of pit - lane stops and battery swaps , the performance parameters change , " Hussain says .
" On a typical 2.5 - mile circuit , we would aim to give you about five to eight laps , depending on how it 's ridden and the configuration of the circuit , and aim to give you a zero to 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) in under three seconds with a top speed of 140 - 150 . "
Another goal for the production bike is a front hub - mounted motor that would allow for energy regeneration under braking and traction control .
Hussain believes the benefits of two - wheel drive would offset any impact the added weight might have on handling .
" We would expect no more than 10 percent of the traction to come from the front wheel under any conditions , " he says .
" This will keep the motor small and light and minimize adverse vehicle dynamics .
The front and rear motors will not be identical .
The front motor is very much a real - time assist and not a primary driver . "
Other ideas Hussain wants to explore include belt drive , a two - speed transmission , and an open - source vehicle - management system that would encourage customization .
" We 're looking at Linux as a development model for the next generation of motor sports , " he says .
He also is considering a composite frame to help cut weight and improve acceleration .
Hussain claims the current bike will hit 110 mph with low gearing , which maximizes acceleration and allows a zero to 60 sprint of 3.8 seconds .
Change the rear sprocket , and you 'll max out at 135 mph .
That 's far short of the 3.0 seconds and 172 mph the 2000 GSX - R 750 could do , but then , the Gixxer produced 140 horsepower .
The Suzuki tipped the scales at 426 pounds ready to ride with oil gas and coolant , while the TTX01 weighs just a tad less than 364 , because it does n't need all the fluids .
Hussain will show off the TTX01 at the TTXGP , the zero-emissions grand prix he 's hosting on the Isle of Man on June 12 , but he is n't racing the new bike .
The event , which will run at the conclusion of the renowned Isle of Man TT motorcycle race , is meant to foster the development of zero-emissions technology .
Entrants will compete on the famed 38 - mile loop around the island , and cannot use any technology that emits carbon at the tailpipe .
Hussain says it looks like the grid will include 40 teams by the time registration closes March 31 , and most of them are using electric drivetrains — " although we may have some hydrogen entrants . "

Peter Gellert is a US - born , long - term activist , now Mexican citizen .
He is a leader of Mexico 's Movement for Cuban Solidarity .
Links International Joural of Socialist Renewal ’s Rachel Evans spoke to Gellert in Mexico City .
February 18 , 2009 -- Inside Peter Gellert´s small apartment books of history , politics and art , line groaning walls .
Meticulously framed Cuban posters monopolise the remaining space .
Three turtles climb over each other in a fish tank that gurgles sporadically .
' NAFTA destroyed Mexican agriculture '
" Mexico signed onto the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) in 1994 which meant greater subordination of Mexico to United States ’ ( US ) interests " , began Gellert .
" NAFTA destroyed Mexican agriculture .
Mexico was sustainable , but now we have 40 % of food imported .
We also had a mass exodus of young men from the Mexican countryside to work in the US .
Twelve - million people , one eighth of the entire Mexican population , are now in the United States .
NAFTA did n't only affect agriculture in a negative way , but local retail was also badly affected ” , noted Gellert .
" Mexico was flooded with franchises , ' Domino Pizzas ' for example , whose every ingredient comes from the US .
The flour , tomatoes -- they are all from the US .
They use no local produce at all .
I am sure Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald ’s have the same policy .
Wal - Mart is here as well , which has meant local markets with fresh agricultural produce , are getting wiped out .
An added effect is that obesity is mushrooming .
There was not as much obesity in the 70s , before the onset of American franchises . "
" The countryside is in a massive crisis ” , stated Gellert .
" The average wage earner in the countryside is earning 40 pesos or less a day .
The minimum wage has increased by 4 % per year , but inflation has seen prices mushroom .
As a result , there has been massive immigration from the Mexican countryside to Mexican cities and from the countryside to the US .
In the 1950s , 75 % of the Mexican people lived in rural areas .
Now only 20 % are based in the countryside .
" The economic crisis has seen everything rise in price .
Unions can strike , but it is a long and complicated process .
And while Mexico is a gasoline producer , gasoline prices have increased 26 times in the last year .
Compounding the problem , 90 % of gasoline stations rob customers .
Many workers at gasoline stations have to initially pay for their job !
Some get no wage , and only survive on tips or stealing .
Twenty - five - gallon cars get charged for 30 gallons .
It 's a huge issue ” , explained Gellert .
" The current Mexican president , Felipe Calderón , is from the National Action Party ( PAN ) .
This government has wanted to open the oil industry up to private national and foreign investment , and the unions and social movement have forced a partial retreat .
Manuel López Obrador , who was the presidential candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) in 2006 , has been crucial in this campaign against privatisation .
Obrador was robbed of the presidency in the fraudulent elections of 2006 ” , Gellert reported .
2006 elections
" In these elections , more than 30 % of polling stations recorded discrepancies between the number of ballots received and the number of ballots cast .
In response to these stolen elections , there were the biggest mobilisations in Mexico 's history .
" Obrador was popularly known as the legitimate president .
He led the National Democratic Convention , which declared a shadow , legitimate government .
At one stage 2.5 million people marched against electoral fraud .
For 40 days there was a seven - kilometre occupation of the major road in Mexico City .
This road was occupied 24 hours a day .
Traffic had to go elsewhere as the city was broken in two . ’’
" In working - class neighbourhoods Obrador had overwhelming support , as well as some support in middle - class areas " , said Gellert .
" The support for the PRD and Obrador was immense .
For example , in the working - class neighbourhoods adjacent to where I live , the PRD beat Calderon 8 to 1 .
" In reality , the shadow , legitimate government that Obrador initiated could not do much .
In fact , to a certain extent , it has been overshadowed by the campaign to defend the government - owned oil industry , headed up by Obrador .
There are thousands of ' grassroots brigades ' or campaign units in local areas of Mexico fighting off privatisation plans of the PAN government -- with the campaign mobilising thousands ” , noted Gellert .
Workers and unions
" Every worker has to join a union – this is obligatory in Mexico ” , continued Gellert .
But 90 % of those unions are " white " unions that are controlled by the bosses .
Workers do n't have real democratic control of their unions .
Ninety per cent of the unions in Mexico are white unions , and have no democratic participation within them at all ” , said Gilbert .
Social security workers
" Another site of struggle has been the social security workers union contract ” , said Gellert .
" The government pays low wages to this sector , but they provide good benefits .
There is a Christmas bonus that is obligatory for all companies to pay .
Private sector workers get a bonus of at least 15 days , while in government it is at least 30 days .
Social security workers get a three month Christmas bonus .
Mind you , the Mexican government does not provide unemployment benefits or student benefits .
But the government has been trying to whittle away collective bargaining agreement provisions , and this has resulted in big battles ” , remarked Gellert .
Privatisation of education
" For all intents and purposes , public universities are free , with the government charging minor tuition fees .
But the quality is not the best .
The private university system is better quality and very expensive .
Companies are starting to hire only private university students .
However , education privatisation has been fiercely contested .
" A massive student - led fight arose in 1999 , as the government tried to introduce upfront fees .
To put this fight in context -- free education was one of the victories of the 1910 Mexican revolution -- a historic moment in Mexican history .
Tuition had not been raised since 1941 .
This big campaign in 1999 was run through large democratic assemblies -- with everyone , students and professors alike -- participating .
Fortunately , the campaign had enough momentum despite many ultraleft excesses to , in essence , win its demands .
Public university education is still basically and for all intents and purposes free ” , emphasised Gellert .
History of struggle
" There has been a consistency of major campaigns from the heady 1960s in Mexico , unlike in other countries , which saw a downturn in the struggle .
In 1968 there was a huge student struggle .
In 1986 , there was another upsurge of the students .
In 1988 there was a left - wing split from a major political party – the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) ” , noted Gellert .
" We then had another upsurge in 1994 with the Zapatistas in Chiapas .
In 1999 there was the upsurge in the student movement and , currently , social movement leaders are being born in a number of struggles . "
" Currently " , continued Gellert , " the electricity workers ’ union is fighting against privatisation and government attacks on labour laws .
At the moment , that sector has a rather advanced union contract .
In Mexican labour legislation , there is no hourly pay – only monthly pay .
Additionally , it 's hard for the bosses to lay people off as they have to pay redundancy .
Hence , they want more flexibility .
The miners ’ union has also been struggling hard against government intervention in their union .
But it is the campaign to defend the oil industry that is the biggest and broadest campaign to date . "
Social disintegration
" In international news there is coverage of kidnappings taking place in Mexico ” , reflected Gellert .
" Rich people are being held to ransom and it 's quite bad .
In one case they stole a child .
The kidnappers got the ransom but killed the kid anyway .
It 's the drug cartels .
But it is linked to high government officials .
The head of the anti-drug unit was on the payroll of drug dealers .
Police are also involved because their salaries are so minimal .
Horribly low .
Sixty per cent of police agents are said to be on the pay of drug traffickers . ”
The Mexican left
" There are huge social movements in Mexico , and the left press has significant influence .
La Jornada , a left - wing newspaper , has a circulation of between 70,000 to 100,000 copies per day .
It reflects the existence of a social left , a community of sorts .
It is the second - or third - largest selling newspaper in Mexico .
Online , it has 120,000 readers per day " , reported Gellert .
" The electoral left is also very strong .
They control Mexico City -- which is the political centre of Mexico .
Mexico City holds one quarter of Mexico 's entire population .
Out of 16 districts in Mexico City – the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) has control of 14 .
The PRD also has Mexico City´s mayor , Marcel Ebrad .
There are also a lot of regional leftist governments .
" Additionally , within Mexico City , as in other parts of the country , an urban popular movement exists .
There are 1000 independent neighbourhood organisations in the city alone .
The national workers ’ confederation ( UNT ) is a strong , independent movement .
The students are organised faculty by faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
Conversely , the Marxist parties have pretty much collapsed here ” , explained Gellert .
Political parties
" The government rules by repression and cooption .
Repression is a constant factor in Mexican politics .
At the cooption end , there are numerous former leftists in government .
Former activists are even to be found in the ruling National Action Party ( PAN ) government , arguing that if they were not there , PAN would be worse .
They are lured by high salaries , and the excitement of power .
" The PRI got ousted by PAN in the 2000 elections , and is weakened – but it is planning a come - back .
The Green Party here is in a permanent alliance with the PRI , and is utterly and completely discredited .
Its main platform is the reintroduction of the death penalty !
Something not even the PRI bothers with .
In fact , even PAN and PRI are opposed to the death penalty ” , explained Gellert .
" PAN , formed in the 1920s , is linked to the Catholic Church and is anti-abortion and thoroughly neoliberal -- very conservative .
PAN wants more links with the US , but it has to contend with a deep - seated anti-imperialist sentiment within Mexico .
The PRI will make a comeback , but it is a wounded tiger -- terribly discredited .
" The PRD , founded in 1989 , is going through a major crisis and Obrador , currently , is looking at the minor parties to see if a broad electoral front can be registered using their ballot status instead of running on the PRD ticket .
This possibility he has left open . ”
The Party of Democratic Revolution
" There is a strong likelihood there will be a split in the PRD after the coming elections in 2009 .
The possible split is not over being in government ; insofar as there are political issues at stake -- the internal conflicts usually take the form of disputes over posts , candidacies and the huge amounts of money coming from the state subsidies , rather than party program or orientation .
Rather , a possible split would involve the degree of subordination to the parliamentary rules of the game versus more of an orientation toward the mass movement and more of a frontal opposition toward the Calderón administration " , explained Gellert .
" The PRD was born after the 1988 elections , following a left - wing split from the PRI , with election fraud leading to mass mobilisations .
The PRD allows tendencies to exist within its organisational structure , but these tendencies tend to be centred on personalities , not a political program .
This exacerbated some of the worst aspects of Mexican culture – such as the use of acarredos , whereby the leader of a social organisation basically corrals the ranks into participating in marches and rallies .
" Obrador has been dealing with internal tensions within the PRD over positions by leading mass mobilisations .
Obrador does not describe himself as a socialist , but he is building up grassroots committees around defending the oil industry , while not neglecting work with parliamentary deputies .
Obrador is not depending on parliamentary politics and is broadly considered to have won the 2006 elections . "
Zapatistas
" In Chiapas , the Zapatistas 's project is important and positive , constructing people 's power within the communities ” , explained Gellert .
" Outside indigenous , peasant communities of Chiapas , however , the model clearly does not work .
In all major struggles outside Chiapas , the Zapatistas have basically abstained , with the partial exception of the campesino movement and on agricultural issues .
As a result , the Zapatistas have earned a reputation for being sectarian .
" They wo n't turn up to rallies if any political party speaks , or involves themselves in anything with political party involvement .
They consider parties part of the ' power structure ' .
They see unions in the same light .
They tend to be Chiapas - centred .
The Zapatista Army of National Liberation ( EZLN ) developed a political wing -- the Zapatista National Liberation Front -- as it understood the need to relate to civil society .
But it dissolved this group a few years after its formation when it was clear that it was n't going anywhere .
" For example , in 2006 there was a massive movement against electoral fraud ; there have been struggles in defence of the electric power industry , of the miners ’ union and for an increase in education funding and teachers ’ salaries in Oaxaca , which led to generalised mass upsurge .
In all of these movements , the Zapatistas have basically abstained .
" The movement led by the Zapatistas had everything going for it -- they put indigenous rights on the front burner in Mexico ” , continued Gellert .
" They were a force that was not corrupt .
Indigenous people have a raw deal here .
And the Zapatistas had heaps of support .
One quarter of a million people came to a rally when Subcommandante Marcos came to town .
Their sectarian approach has led , unfortunately , to their almost complete isolation .
At May Day in 2008 , there were 600,000 people marching .
But no Zapatistas to be seen . "
Left unity
" At the moment , there is little movement for a left socialist party project .
There is agreement in abstract for ' unity ' , yes , there is some movement for that -- but there is no issue that is forcing that move ” , reflected Gellert .
" The PRD is in a crisis .
It is the social left – hundreds of thousands if not millions of people are involved at different levels but in terms of a unity party project , so far , nothing .
In 2009 there will be elections ...
After the elections there is a strong possibility of a split as a result of infighting over control , finances and candidacies .
It is very bad , and gives the left a bad reputation .
" We will see who , among the left groups , can take advantage of the economic crisis and use it to grow .
Cuba
`` The rejection of the US economic blockade against Cuba , however , is expressed across the board .
Even PAN and the PRI support the campaign to end the blockade against Cuba ” , commented Gellert .
" Cuba is a political reference point in defining Mexican government policy .
All of the Mexican government ’s foreign policy moves through the prism of US - Mexican relations , i.e. will Mexico bend to US foreign policy ?
When President Fox was in power , there was an Iberoamerican Summit dinner which both Fox and Fidel Castro were to attend .
Fox called Fidel to ask if Fidel could make himself scarce , so as not to make George Bush uncomfortable .
" Fidel told the world Fox had asked him to do this , which Fox denied .
Fidel -- who had taped the conversation -- proved this to be an utter lie .
Fox was very embarrassed .
In Mexico , Cuba is much more a reference point for the population , more than is the case for other Latin American countries . "
Conclusion
" This economic crisis will cost PAN .
The divided left has a bad reputation here among the Mexican people , with the PRD crisis playing out in public -- it is not a private discussion .
Obrador has consolidated , however , through his involvement with , and support of , the oil defence campaign , in particular " , concluded Gilbert .
Global recession triggers sharp downturn in Australia
By Mike Head
27 January 2009
The onset of recession in nearly all Australia 's major trading partners has produced warnings that the country has entered a " vicious cycle " of contraction that could last at least five years .
With Britain declared in recession last week , seven of Australian capitalism 's biggest markets are now officially in that situation — the others being Japan , the US , South Korea , Singapore , New Zealand and Germany .
Another three — China , Thailand and Malaysia — are regarded as possibly already in recession .
Between them , China , Korea and Japan alone take 42 percent of Australian exports , mainly minerals and energy .
Last week it was reported that Japan 's exports fell a staggering 35 percent in December , compared to a year earlier , and that South Korea 's output fell a seasonally adjusted 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Even more ominous was the news that China 's growth had officially slowed to a seven - year low of 6.8 percent in the December quarter , after soaring nearly 13 percent in 2007 .
This sharp turnaround means that China 's economy must have actually shrunk , or nearly contracted , in the last three months of 2008 .
These results helped send Australian share prices to new five - year lows , taking the total losses to $ 900 billion since the local market 's November 2007 peak .
The benchmark S&P / ASX 200 index dropped 10 percent in the first three weeks of 2009 , taking its plunge to more than half in just 14 months .
This fall is one of the worst in the world .
Months of self - serving corporate and government claims that Australia was " decoupled " from the deepening world economic meltdown — supposedly because of China 's boom — have been shattered .
TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson commented : " We thought we were decoupled from the rest of the world .
What we 're actually seeing is how coupled we are . "
Growing numbers of mining workers are paying the price for the economic breakdown .
BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining company , last week announced 6,000 job cuts internationally , with 3,400 to go in Australia .
This was on top of the 14,000 worldwide cuts inflicted by Rio Tinto , about half within Australia , and more than 5,000 job losses from smaller companies .
In the space of a few months , the mining boom has turned into a bust that is producing virtual ghost towns in remote parts of Australia , with commentators warning that the experience is a microcosm of what the entire country can expect within a year .
Two small towns in southern Western Australia — Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun — are expected to halve their populations following BHP 's decision to immediately shut its local nickel project , axing 1,800 jobs overnight .
For several years , BHP touted the new mine as a model , based on the construction of a local community , rather than a " fly - in , fly - out " workforce .
Now , the schools and other facilities face closure , together with the small businesses that were enticed by BHP to set up in the towns on the promise that the mine would last for three decades or more .
In the western New South Wales town of Cobar , there have been 600 redundancies in the past six months , about 10 percent of the population .
Just last March , the management of Cobar 's largest mine , the Endeavour , set a 2009 target to excavate a record 1.4 million tonnes of ore .
Since then , the zinc price has dropped by 75 percent and staff numbers have been cut by 540 .
Large - scale job destruction has also begun in the retail industry , with the collapse of Australia 's biggest discount retail chain — the 400 - store Crazy Clark 's and Go-Lo operation — threatening to throw 4,500 people out of work .
David Jones , a department store chain , cut 150 head office jobs and Harvey Norman , a large electrical and homewares retailer , closed a Sydney suburban store .
As many as two million people could be jobless or " under - employed " ( working fewer hours than they want ) by mid-2010 , according to calculations by labour economist Professor Bill Mitchell of the University of Newcastle .
Previously unreported figures from the Bureau of Statistics reveal that the labour " under- utilisation " rate is already climbing much faster than the official jobless rate .
While the jobless rate rose from 4.1 percent to 4.4 percent between August and November , the underemployment rate jumped from 5.8 to 6.4 percent , producing a total " labour wastage " rate of 10.8 percent .
The official unemployment figures seriously understate the impact of the crash because they do not count the workers who have had their hours reduced or been forced into part - time work .
Banking and financial stocks have led the latest share market rout , reflecting another vulnerability of Australian capitalism — its reliance on unprecedented levels of corporate and consumer debt over the past 15 years .
Since the start of 2009 , a new wave of US and European financial and banking crises has thrown fresh doubts over the local banks .
Like their international counterparts , Australian finance houses are being hit by what the Australian 's economics editor Alan Wood described as the " vicious cycle [ that ] has started to operate between the financial sector and the real economy " .
The initial credit crisis has led to recession , undermining the value of financial and property assets , leading to forced sales , and further eroding the asset prices upon which banks have lent billions of dollars .
Shareholders in Babcock & Brown , the country 's second largest merchant bank , were told last week that their shares , valued at $ 10 billion only 18 months ago , were worthless .
While Babcock & Brown , together with the larger Macquarie Bank , was one of the most aggressive lenders and speculators , the so - called big four banks are also bleeding .
Shares in National Australia
Bank have dropped to a 12 - year low , and ANZ to a nine - year low , after a 15.9 percent fall last week .
Economic forecaster Access Economics warned in its quarterly Business Outlook , released last week , that the economy would " unwind scarily fast " , costing more than 300,000 people their jobs .
" Batten the hatches .
This is not just a recession .
This is the sharpest deceleration Australia 's economy has ever seen , " it stated .
Access Economics said the federal budget was " buggered " because of its heavy reliance on company taxes and mining royalties .
" The glory days of big budget surpluses are over , and the feds are now staring down the barrel of deficits as far as the eye can see , " the outlook said .
The total public sector deficit , which combines federal , state and local government balances , is forecast to blow out to $ 10.5 billion this financial year , and $ 29.4 billion in 2011 - 12 .
Such a shortfall will inevitably mean deep cuts to social spending , and also swamp the Rudd government 's capacity to keep bailing out the banks and other corporate giants via so - called stimulus packages .
Because of the rapidly deteriorating economic situation , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd last week cancelled a scheduled overseas trip to India and the World Economic Forum in Switzerland and unveiled yet another bailout plan .
Saying " unprecedented " conditions required " extraordinary " measures , Rudd claimed the government would attempt to protect 50,000 construction jobs by creating a $ 4 billion fund with the four major banks to prevent partly - completed commercial property projects , such as shopping centres , industrial complexes and office buildings , being halted by the withdrawal of overseas banks from financing consortia .
Taxpayers would provide $ 2 billion , with the remainder coming from the banks .
But the potential losses for the government could be far greater .
The fund , due to be operating by March , can borrow up to another $ 26 billion backed by a government guarantee .
Even this amount will not suffice to stop the destruction of an estimated 150,000 commercial property construction jobs .
Loans worth about $ 75 billion are due to be refinanced over the next two years , just to keep current projects going , not to underwrite new construction .
These property project loans are only part of a bigger picture across the entire economy .
According to a recent estimate from Merrill Lynch , the US investment bank , foreign banks accounted for more than half of the $ 285 billion in syndicated loans issued to Australian companies since 2006 .
Many of these loans could be withdrawn because of the losses and collapses being suffered by international banks .
The new fund will be the government 's fifth economic rescue package in three months , including unlimited government guarantees for all Australian financial deposits , $ 8 billion for the car industry and a $ 10 billion pre-Christmas one - off handout , largely to families and pensioners .
Writing in the Weekend Australian , Andrew Main commented that the $ 10 billion " seems to have disappeared like a puff of dust on the wind " because it had been " thrown against a slowing economy " .

This pair of quivering meerkat pups are so small that they easily fit into the palm of their keeper 's hand .
And though they are only 28 - days old , brother and sister Zanzibar and Nairobi are already a huge hit with visitors to Taronga Zoo , in Sydney .
They are the latest additions to the site 's meerkat manor - and are the first pups to be born there for nine years .
Supercute : Zanzibar and Nairobi are now four weeks old and are the first meerkat pups to be born at the Taronga Zoo , in Sydney , in nine years
Meerkat keeper Bobby - Jo Vial said : ' I 'm extremely thrilled , I 'm over the moon , I 've been waiting for this for quite a long time now .
' They make me very clucky - Mamma Meerkat , that 's me .
' They 're already eating solid foods and displaying behaviours similar to adults .
They 're very precocious .'
Thriving : Both babies are doing well according to their keeper
Nairobi and her brother Zanzibar are part of nine - strong family at the zoo and weighed around 40 grams at birth .
They will weigh about one kilogram ( 2.2 lb ) when fully grown .
The pups still spend most of their day living underground in extensive burrows so visitors have to patiently wait to spot them .
Making friends :
One of the pups licks keeper Bobby - Jo Vial 's nose
Feeding time :

' Over the next two weeks they should start emerging from their indoor area so we really want to encourage visitors to just be patient as they 're learning how to come out out , ' Miss Vial said .
' We leave them with access to that safe area because being in Sydney , we have large aerial predators about and exhibit 's quite open .
' Meerkats have to be doing exactly what they do in the wild - they have to be on guard , so we give them that option that they can run into their safe place . '

Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser ( January 22 , 1855 , Schweidnitz - July 30 , 1916 , Breslau ) was a German physician who discovered the causative agent ( pathogen ) of gonorrhea , a strain of bacteria that was named in his honour .
Neisser was born in the Silesian town of Schweidnitz ( now Świdnica , in Poland ) , the son of a well - known Jewish physician , Dr. Moritz Neisser .
After he completed the elementary school in Münsterberg , Neisser enrolled in the St. Maria Magdalena School in Breslau ( now Wroclaw , in Poland ) .
In this school , he was a contemporary of another great name in the history of medicine , Paul Ehrlich .
He obtained the Abitur ( habilitation ) in 1872 .
Neisser began to study medicine at the University of Breslau , but later moved to Erlangen , completing his studies in 1877 .
Initially Neisser wanted to be an internist , but he did n't find a suitable place .
He found work , however as an assistant of the dermatologist Oskar Simon ( 1845-1892 ) , concentrating on sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy .
During the following two years he studied and obtained experimental evidence about the pathogen for gonorrhea , Neisseria gonorrhoeae .
He was only 21 years old .
Neisser was also the co-discoverer of the causative agent of leprosy .
In 1879 the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen gave to young Neisser ( who had visited him in Norway to examine some 100 leprosy patients ) some tissue samples of his patients .
Neisser successfully stained the bacteria and announced his findings in 1880 , claiming to have discovered the pathogenesis of leprosy .
There was some conflict between Neisser and Hansen , because Hansen had failed to culture the organism and demostrante unequivocally its link to leprosy , although he had observed the bacterium since 1832 .
In 1882 Neisser was appointed professor extraordinarius by the University at the tender age of 29 , and worked as a dermatologist in the university hospital of Breslau .
Later he was promoted to the director of the hospital .
In the following year he married Toni Neisser , née Hoffmann .
In the years 1905 and 1906 Neisser travelled to Java , in order to study the possible transmission of syphilis from apes to humans .
He later cooperated with August Paul von Wassermann ( 1866-1925 ) to develop the famous diagnostic test for detecting Treponema pallidum infections , and also in the testing of the first chemotherapeutic agent for syphilis , Salvarsan , which was discovered by his former school fellow Paul Ehrlich in 1910 .
In 1907 , Neisser was promoted to professor ordinarius of dermatology and sexually - transmitted diseases at Breslau .
As a scientific leader , Neisser was also very active .
In the field of public health , he promoted vigorously preventive and educational measures to the public , and the better sanitary control of prostitutes , in order to combat venereal diseases .
He was one of the founder of the Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Bekämpfung der Geschlechtskrankheiten ( German Society for the Fight Against Venereal Diseases ) in 1902 , and of the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft ( German Dermatological Society ) in 1888 .
At the age of 61 years , Professor Albert Neisser died of septicemia on July 30th , 1916 , in Breslau .

Week 37 300 Club - Sunday
25th June - 2nd July 2000
Has it been cold this week !!
Below - 70C for a number of days .
On Friday it got down to a record low for the year of - 75.7C/-104.3 F .
And what does that mean ?
300 Club !
300 Club is one of the those rare chances in life to do something really dumb .
The concept is simple enough - a 300 degree change in temperature .
This is accomplished by going into the sauna and cranking it up to +200 F , and then going out of the dome when the official Met thermometer is registering below - 100 F .
Dave Z. had had some great cloth patches made up before we came down for the people that did it .
But to qualify for a patch you had to get to the top of the hill outside the dome entrance .
For extra stupidity points you could go all the way to the Geographic Pole .
There is one other catch - sans clothing - birthday suite only .
On Friday morning our friendly Met person made an All Call to let us know we had made it below the - 100 mark .
It seemed a bit early to be running around naked , so no takers .
At lunch everyone started getting more excited about the idea , and a group of blokes piled into the sauna and set it to extra crispy .
I had planned to wait till after work , and wandered back to my room just in time to see a troop of very hairy and frosty blokes come tearing back into Upper Berthing .
It looked a lot of fun ;
So I decided to go for it with the next group .
I thought I knew what hot was .
No I did n't !
I 'm assured that it is really important to stay in the sauna as long as possible .
I bet the person that came up with that story is still doubled over laughing about all the people that believe it .
After 10 minutes in the inferno I 'd had enough and starting making noises about it to try and move the herd .
Towel off the sweat , and go for it .
The impulse is to run .
And when everyone else is following their impulse , it 's hard not to follow also .
But this is a mistake .
Not only does it cause more windchill , but you start panting , and risk burning your lungs .
I walked the length of the tunnel .
Decided to run up the hill , and once at the top jumped around a lot .
Most people made an attempt at the pole .
I was starting feel a bit chilly , so decided to stroll back in .
In the tunnel I went for style points with some poses for the blokes who had come to watch the women .
Seemed a bit silly for them to be standing around for ages in the cold tunnel , when they could have just piled into the sauna with them .
Shy ?
Going back into +200 after being outside was a far worse shock than the other way .
My mistake was running up the hill .
I had a cough for the rest of the day .
As for the people that went for the pole , or ran the whole way , many are still coughing .
Nothing fun about frost biting your lungs .
Only a few made it all the way to the pole without realising how stupid it was .
The most important thing is that I 'm now the owner of a ultra cool cloth patch .
This week demonstrates how life here can go from an amazingly fun time to very sobering in the blink of an eye .
And then we go back to work .
On the day we had a memorial for Rodney we were still in shock .
When Rodney leaves the pole we will all be working like crazy for station open .
Only a few of us will get the chance to go to his funeral .
It was now the time for the station to say goodbye .
At the end of winter Rodney 's body will be returned to Australia to buried in his home town .
In the mean time he had to be placed somewhere .
Pole is so small and crowded that there just was n't anywhere convenient other than in a service area of the station .
This was not as respectful as many people wanted it to be , and thus wanted to do something else .
Someone came up with the idea of burying Rodney at the pole .
For us this seemed very fitting and much more dignified .
The carpenters soon found a supply of oak , and set to work making Rodney a magnificent casket .
Over the past month many of Rodney 's friends worked on this , manufacturing every piece including the outside fittings .
Sonja made a beautiful plaque out of maple , with Rodney 's favorite constellation , Scorpio , inlaid in brass , with engraved pieces of brass above and below Scorpio .
The casket was finished last week and it was time to bury Rodney .
No public announcement was made .
Everyone was told personally .
At 1:30 on Sunday afternoon everyone met in the galley .
Almost the whole station was there .
We went down the tunnel that goes to the entrance of the dome .
Some of Rodney 's closest friends carried the casket out to the entrance and placed it on a Nansen sled .
A Nansen sled is a beautiful long wooden sled that was used back in the days of Antarctic exploration .
I think it was a fitting way for Rodney to be taken out to the pole .
The whole station then took Rodney out to the Geographic Pole .
The air was still and crisply cold .
The moon was down and it was inky black except for the beams of the high power torches cutting across the sky .
Once Rodney was in place Jake said some very nice words , and read something Rodney 's mother had sent .
Dave P. then said some words about his friend that were incredibly moving .
It was the most touching thing I 've ever heard .
Rodney is buried 15 feet from the South Pole at about 110 degrees east , in the Australian Antarctic Territory .
This is roughly south of Perth , and also south of the Australian station Casey .
Having wintered at Casey , I was pleased about this .
I had quite a few drinks for Rodney that night .

Gang of children - some as young as TEN - caught slowly roasting puppies over bonfire
Shocked and huddled together for safety , these puppies are lucky to be alive after being saved from an act of almost unbelievable barbarity .
A gang of youths had seized the seven - week - old brother and sister and were slowly roasting them over a bonfire on a canal bank .
Yelping in panic and distress as their fur began to burn , the pair struggled desperately to escape the children 's clutches .
Lucky to be alive :
The two puppies saved after a gang of children were caught roasting them on a fire
The commotion attracted a walker who ran over to the bonfire and ordered the gang to release them immediately .
Melanie Johnson , 32 , said : ' I just could not believe the cruelty being shown by these kids .
If I had n't turned up , I think they would have burned the dogs alive . '
Miss Johnson , from Rochdale , added : ' Most of the kids were aged 12 , 13 or older .
But some were as young as ten .
I was ripping mad and still am to think that anyone - least of all children - could do this . '
She took the two puppies from the bank and carried them to the safety of her home before wrapping them in a towel and taking them to an RSPCA shelter .
The cross - bred pups were examined by a vet after the incident in Newbold , Rochdale on Friday and were found to be in generally good health .
Jean Spencer , the RSPCA shelter manager , said : ' The puppies are only seven weeks old and still smelled of smoke from the bonfire when they arrived .
' The fur on one of them was singed and the other has a small hernia .
Fortunately , they are going to be fine . '
She added : ' To think that children could be so cruel is really disgusting .
The puppies are absolutely gorgeous .
Everyone here has fallen in love with them . '
The male puppy has been named Guy and his sister Cinders .
They will now go to a shelter in Halifax to be re-homed .
No arrests have been made in connection with the incident .
( CNN ) -- Questions continued to swirl Thursday over the president 's decision to withdraw a pardon for a New York developer involved in a Long Island mortgage fraud scheme .
President Bush withdrew the pardon of Isaac Toussie after a firestorm of criticism .
Isaac Toussie , 36 , was convicted in 2001 of mail fraud and of making false statements to the Department of Housing and Urban Development that stemmed from the mortgage scheme .
The White House initially announced the pardon Tuesday afternoon , immediately setting off a firestorm of criticism from angry homeowners and investors , as well as government watchdog organizations quick to note Toussie 's ties to prominent Republican officeholders .
Among the questions now being asked are :
• Why did n't the White House conduct a more thorough investigation of Toussie 's background ?
• Why did White House Counsel Fred Fielding circumvent the typical pardon application process by directly considering Toussie 's clemency request instead of leaving it to the Justice Department ?
• Did Toussie get special treatment because of his political connections ?
Watch why Bush withdrew the pardon »
Toussie and his father , also a developer , are defendants in a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on behalf of more than 400 minority home purchasers who allege a conspiracy involving racial steering , racketeering and fraud related to homes the Toussies built on Staten Island , attorney Peter Seidman told CNN .
Do n't Miss Bush orders pardon re-examined
Bush orders pardon re-examined Read full pardon list
Seidman , a partner in a law firm representing the plaintiffs , said he was " very pleased " with President Bush 's order for a review of the pardon .
" It [ the pardon ] was a bitter pill for the home purchasers to swallow , " he said .
The Toussies had previously been accused of conspiring with lenders and others to build and sell substandard homes -- a charge they denied .
According to a senior administration official , the White House learned new information about Toussie 's case Tuesday night -- hours after the pardon was announced .
Specifically , the White House learned , according to the official , " additional information about the nature of fraud [ Toussie ] carried out . "
The White House also learned that Toussie 's father had made numerous contributions to leading GOP politicians .
In 2008 , Toussie 's father donated almost $ 40,000 to Arizona Sen . John McCain , Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman , Oregon Sen. Gordon Smith and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor .
White House press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement Wednesday saying that " based on information that has subsequently come to light , " Bush had told the Justice Department 's pardon attorney not to act on the pardon extended to Toussie .
Instead , Perino said , " The president believes that the pardon attorney should have an opportunity to review this case before a decision on clemency is made . "
While almost all pardon requests go through the Justice Department , the Constitution allows the president to grant a pardon or commutation to any individual for any reason .
Perino said Toussie 's pardon was withdrawn before it reached the final stage of the process .
The president 's request never made it to the pardon attorney , who actually executes the pardon requests .
Bradford Berenson , Toussie 's lawyer , issued a statement saying Toussie " remains confident " that the pardon attorney will find in his favor .
Toussie was sentenced in September 2003 to a five - month prison sentence in the Long Island case , as well as three years of supervised release .
Seidman told CNN that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Toussies allege that the quality of construction in homes they bought on Staten Island was inferior to that in the model homes upon which they had based their decision to buy .
They also allege that their applications were coded by race , a violation of civil rights laws , and that they were steered away from racially integrated neighborhoods to segregated neighborhoods , he said .
" I 'm baffled that Toussie was selected as a candidate for a pardon in the first place , " Seidman said .
" So I do n't know what I would say about the re-examination , other than why in the first place they thought he was worthy . "
The Toussies deny the allegations in the lawsuit .
An administration official noted it is rare for a pardon to be reversed .
Bush 's 189 pardons and nine commutations are far fewer than those granted by Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in either of their two - term administrations .
Bush 's planned pardon of Toussie was one of 19 presidential pardons announced earlier this week .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn , Elaine Quijano and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .
All About George W. Bush • U.S. Department of Justice
Britain's leading employers ' organisation warned Gordon Brown yesterday that unemployment would crash through three million , just ahead of the likeliest date for the next general election .
In its latest snapshot of the economy , the CBI said 2009 would see the single biggest drop in output of any year since the second world war and lead to a rise of more than a million in the jobless total by early 2010 .
The prime minister has to hold an election by the spring of next year , but the CBI said the economic news over the next 18 months would remain grim .
" Firms are making cutbacks much quicker than in previous recessions because they are worried about lending , " the CBI said .
Average earnings growth is expected to weaken over the first three quarters of the year to a low of 1.1 % as more people accept pay freezes and cuts .
The CBI is revising its forecasts down sharply and now expects the economy to contract by 3.3 % this year , down from its previous forecast in November of a 1.7 % decline , as the global economic downturn continues to worsen .
It expects GDP growth to flatten out at 0 % in 2010 .
Ian McCafferty , the CBI 's chief economic adviser , said : " Given the rapid contraction in global economic activity , and the continuing credit squeeze , we believe the UK will be mired in a deep recession for the whole of 2009 , lasting six quarters in total and accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment . "
This prediction is much gloomier than the International Monetary Fund 's forecast of a 2.8 % annual drop - the worst prediction its has made for any of the G7 countries .
" Faced with a global confidence crisis , a rapid fall in demand and credit constraints , UK firms have been forced to scale back investment and cut jobs , " said Richard Lambert , director general of the CBI .
The CBI said the situation would worsen if the government did not take immediate action .
" Ultimately the severity of this recession will depend on the speedy implementation of the government 's measures to unblock the credit markets and the success of various global stimuli packages in repairing business and consumer confidence , " said Lambert .
The impact of the recession and the fiscal stimulus will take its toll on the public coffers , with the CBI forecasting that net borrowing for 2009 / 10 will reach £ 149bn and £ 168bn in 2010 / 11 , which represent 10.6 % and 11.8 % of GDP respectively .
The speed and severity of the recession , combined with the impact of lower energy prices and the recent VAT cut , will push CPI inflation to a low of - 0.1 % in the third quarter of this year , the CBI said .
In 2010 , it expects inflation will remain under the Bank of England 's official target of 2 % .
Interest rates are expected to stay at a very low level until the end of 2010 .
At the Bank of England 's quarterly inflation report this week , Bank governor Mervyn King said the Bank rate did not have to go to zero , because " we 're getting to the point where it does n't make a great deal of difference where it is " .
The CBI said that manufacturing output would fall sharply by 10.1 % in 2009 while business investment is expected to drop by 9.2 % and investment by construction firms in private housing is set to dive by 23.5 % .
It expects house prices to plunge 15.5 % this year and by a further 6.7 % in 2010 .
" We do not see any sustainable pick up in the housing market until we see a pick up in the economy as a whole and that wo n't happen until business confidence is restored , " said McCafferty .
Lambert indicated that he believed the VAT cut had been largely ineffective .
He said if he was asked if using £ 12bn on reducing VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % was a good way of spending public money , he would say no .
" The most urgent requirement is to get the credit support schemes , announced recently , underway , " said McCafferty .
" Faced with continued uncertainty about access to credit , firms will continue to take drastic action to protect their businesses .
But if we can get credit flowing across the economy , the considerable monetary and fiscal stimuli already in the pipeline should start to feed through later in the year and provide the pre-conditions for an eventual recovery through 2010 . "
VAT cut ' no help '
More than 90 % of British firms believe the government 's VAT cut has failed to help their business .
In its monthly business survey , the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) found 76 % of firms said it had been of no benefit , while 16 % said it was a burden .
The BCC also found an increasingly pessimistic mood about turnover prospects , with 43 % of firms predicting declines of up to 50 % in the next three months .
In a sign that cashflow remains a serious problem , 28 % of firms said they planned to reduce working hours in the coming quarter .
Judging by her Asian tour , Hillary Clinton clearly thinks she is more realistic about the world than her predecessor .
The Secretary of State said , for instance , that pressing China on human rights " can't interfere " with cooperation between Washington and Beijing on other issues like the economic crisis or climate change .
But strangely -- or perhaps not so strangely -- Mrs. Clinton and her boss seem to have a far more pinched conception of realpolitik when it comes to Colombia .

He 's got a stunning shot which he usually strikes sweetly with immense power , but his biggest strength lies in his decision making , positioning and overview of the field as his overall completed passes statistics is over 90 % .
The Banská Bystrica - born star started playing for a small youth team called Jupie Podlavice in his hometown before signed with a major Slovak team Slovan Bratislava in 2002 .
He learned his craft in the youth ranks at Slovan and played for the A - team in one match , in which he scored a goal .
His talent were immediately noticed by Italian club Brescia , which in the summer of 2004 , offered him a five - year professional contract and paid the Slovak side € 500,000 in compensation .
Aged just 17 and 237 days , Hamšík made his professional and Serie A debut with Brescia in a 3 - 1 defeat against Chievo Verona on March 2005 , becoming the third Slovakian to play in the Italian top flight after Ancona 's Miloš Glonek and Vratislav Greško of Parma .
Brescia were later relegated , but his progress has continued quickly in Serie B.
In 2005 / 06 season , Hamšík was an ever - present at the heart ofmidfield as the club finished 10th in Serie B , resurrecting his side after the retirement of Roberto Baggio .
In the next season , he was able to score 10 goals in 40 appearances with Brescia .
And there was an interesting story attached to his name as he was scored a 56 consecutive penalties in a training session , without any of the three Brescia goalkeeper has been able to deny one of his spot - kicks !
Hamšík has represented Slovakia since the junior categories .
He played for the Slovak U - 17 , U - 19 and U - 21 national team before handed his senior debut in a 2 - 2 friendly draw against Poland on February 2007 .
On June 2007 , newly - promoted Serie A club Napoli bought Hamšík from Brescia for € 5.5 million with a contract until 2012 .
Napoli against Cesena in the first round of Coppa Italia , which they won 4 - 0 with Hamšík providing the opening goal and scoring the second goal himself .
He then scored his first Serie A goal in the match against Sampdoria on September 2007 .
The youngster ended his first season with Napoli as the club 's top scorer , with nine goals from 37 games .
Hamšík , who is dreaming of emulating his hero Pavel Nedvěd , was named the 2007 Young Slovak Footballer of the Year while he was also voted second for the Slovak Footballer of the Year - behind Martin Škrtel .
A stunning season with Napoli has seen Hamšík become one of the highly regarded youngsters in Europe with many clubs chasing his signature , including Chelsea , Juventus and Liverpool .
Chelsea scouts are said to be hugely impressed by what they have seen of the Slovakian star , and have told Roman Abramovich to get his chequebook out .
Hamšík , though , is said to be on the verge of signing a new contract with theand has stated that he sees his long - term future at Stadio San Paolo .

A 70 - year - old woman who had been living under an assumed name in a Mesa retirement community has been arrested in connection with the theft of $ 106,000 from a Washington state credit union 26 years ago .
Police said employees arrived at a Kennewick credit union on Valentine 's Day 1983 to find the safe open and $ 106,000 missing .
Employee Barbara Kurz , a married mother of four , was also missing and immediately became a suspect .
Her car was found abandoned and partially burned in Pendleton , Ore. , the same day as the theft .
Several days after she disappeared , she called her husband and one of her daughters and claimed she had been kidnapped .
That apparently was the last contact she had with her family .
Recently , investigators from the Kennewick Police Department started looking at the case again .
Using different combinations of Kurz 's name with the help of online database searches , investigators found out that she was living in Mesa , police reports said .
Mesa and Kennewick police took Kurz into custody at the Sunrise Village retirement community , 5402 E. McKellips Road in Mesa , according to a police report .
She was arrested on a warrant for first - degree theft .
She is currently being held in a Maricopa County jail in lieu of $ 500,000 bail and will face extradition to Washington .
" It will be nice to bring this gal back to justice and have her held accountable for her actions 26 years ago , " Kennewick Police Chief Ken Hohenberg said .
A representative for Sunrise Village said Kurz had lived at the community under the name Rene Fulgham since 1992 .
She worked as a caretaker for one of the residents and never stood out or gave anyone a reason to suspect her past , the representative said .

As was widely rumored , leaked , and predicted , Microsoft made a series of announcements regarding its Windows Mobile platform at the Mobile World Congress ( MWC ) 2009 in Barcelona on Monday .
CEO
Steve Ballmer proclaimed that smartphones would soon comprise 50 percent of worldwide mobile phones and that Windows would be the platform that would continue to be adopted not only on the PC but on mobile devices as well .
As part of the various announcements relating to devices , software , and services , Ballmer unveiled Windows Mobile 6.5 , Microsoft My Phone , and Windows Marketplace for Mobile .
To simplify things , the new Windows Mobile phones would start to be marketed as " Windows phones " in the fall , which is when the new devices from Microsoft partners will begin to ship .
" Windows phones bring together the best of the Web , the PC , and the phone so you can connect instantly to the experiences you care about , no matter where you are , " Ballmer said .
" We 're working with partners across the industry to deliver a new generation of Windows phones that break down the barriers between people , information , and applications and provide great end - to - end experiences that span your entire life , at work and at home . "
Windows Mobile 6.5
Windows Mobile 6.1 is saddled with a user interface that was not really designed for finger use .
Windows Mobile touchscreen devices are designed to be used with a stylus , rather than a finger , and some Windows Mobile devices do not even have touchscreens at all , resulting in a UI with lots of small buttons and menus — and none of the touch features ( such as touch - based scrolling with inertia ) that users now expect .
Windows Mobile 6.5 replaces these old interfaces with a system designed for touch .
This new UI has two main components : a new finger - friendly Today screen , and the honeycomb Start screen .
We 've seen both of these in leaked screenshots and builds , and the software shown off today matches those leaked images .
The new Today screen serves a similar purpose to Today screens of old , but offers large buttons , smooth finger scrolling , and considerably improved graphics .
The Start screen is a new concept .
It replaces the Start Menu and Programs browser in current versions with a single finger - friendly panel .
IE Mobile 6.5
Finger - friendliness is also apparent in the newly - designed unlock and call answering screens .
The unlock screen includes a simple but desirable innovation .
The basic unlock action is to slide a button across the screen .
What 's novel is that you can jump straight from the unlock screen to other parts of the user interface ( such as e-mail , text messages , or voicemail ) by changing where you slide .
The top position just unlocks the phone ; the lower positions jump to particular locations within the software .
This is a simple idea , but a useful one nonetheless .
The call answering screen similarly uses slide , offering both slide - to - answer and slide - to - ignore .
Before version 6.5 was even in beta , Microsoft released an updated version of its mobile browser for Windows Mobile 6.1 .
Though this made big improvements to the rendering engine , the user interface remained in the Windows Mobile 6.1 era .
With 6.5 , not only are there further renderer improvements , but the interface itself has also been overhauled , again with the objective being greater finger - friendliness .
Microsoft stressed that it is now delivering on the demand from users to have the PC browsing experience on their phones .
This means that IE will not just provide a decent renderer ; it means that it will also support Flash , and allow for switching between mobile and regular versions of websites .
Though others ( most notably Apple ) have made this claim before , the inclusion of full Flash support should lead to far greater uniformity across browser platforms than is currently possible .
Microsoft My Phone
My Phone is a backup and storage service for your phone .
It moves everything from your phone up into the cloud so that you can access and manage it from anywhere , allowing you to look up and edit contact information on the Web , share photos and videos with friends , or even move your text messages and calendar appointments to a new phone .
The technology is possible thanks to Microsoft 's acquisition of MobiComp in June 2008 .
The site for My Phone went live last week , but sign - up for the beta is only now working , so if you 're interested in getting into the invitation - only beta , go there now .
Although My Phone will be built - in for Windows Mobile 6.5 phones , it will also be downloadable for versions 6.0 and 6.1 .
The site outlines three main features for the service , which comes with only 200 MB of storage ( we 're a little disappointed this does n't simply use the 25 GB that every Windows Live user gets with SkyDrive ) .
Automatic syncing can be set up to run automatically every day at a time of your choosing , or you can force the sync at any time ( in a manner similar to Windows Update , say ) .
In this way , calendar items , contacts , tasks , appointments , text messages , and other information are kept up - to - date in the cloud .
It also allows the user to store music , photos , documents , and videos at a third location ( the first two being your Windows phone and the second being your PC ) .
According to the unofficial roadmap , Microsoft is already planning My Phone versions 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 .
While version 1.0 will be a free and ad - supported , a subscription - based premium service will come sometime this summer , when Microsoft starts testing version 1.5 .
Officially , there are no plans to offer the service for non-Windows phone operating systems , but unofficially there are plans to extend it to non-Windows platforms this summer .
Version 2.0 will be integrated with other Microsoft properties like Live Mesh and the new Windows Marketplace for Mobile , providing users with a way to buy and store applications and their data on remote servers .
Windows Marketplace for Mobile
Originally codenamed SkyMarket , Windows Marketplace for Mobile was meant to ship with Windows Mobile 7 , but since that has been delayed to sometime in 2010 , it will now arrive with 6.5 .
The marketplace , which goes beyond the current Windows Mobile Catalog , will provide direct - to - phone mobile applications and will be accessible from both the Windows phone and the Web .
Users will be able to use the marketplace to find and purchase mobile applications with their Windows Live ID .
Although applications on Windows Marketplace for Mobile will undergo a simple security and compatibility check , it looks like they wo n't be subject to the same kind of arbitrary scrutiny as software on the iTunes store .
Microsoft will also host its own applications on the marketplace .
At MWC , the company also announced Microsoft Recite , a voice search technology for Windows phones version 6.x , which lets users capture , search , and retrieve spoken notes using just their voice .
The website with the Technology Preview became available yesterday , demonstration video and all .
Beyond 6.5
Windows Mobile is in need of some serious love from Microsoft .
In spite of Microsoft 's relatively long history in this market , the much newer mobile phone operating systems from both Apple and Google ( not to mention the forthcoming Palm webOS ) have in most regards trounced Windows Mobile , leaving Redmond playing catch - up .
The improvements in 6.5 will certainly go some way towards redressing this deficit .
Making the UI finger - friendly will address probably the biggest problem with Windows Mobile as it currently stands .
Microsoft 's attempt to cram the desktop Windows interface into a phone have n't resulted in a pleasant UI ; Windows Mobile is too fiddly , too cluttered , and too complex .
The new 6.5 UI looks like a big improvement , giving Windows Mobile users a proper touch interface that works without a stylus .
That said , there still appears to be ample scope for improvement .
Some parts of the new OS are apparently untouched ; Windows Media Player , for example , is unchanged from 6.1 — meaning it 's still going to need a stylus .
This kind of jarring inconsistency makes for an extremely unpleasant user experience , and it looks like we will have to wait for Windows Mobile 7 ( which will hopefully have a more Zune - like media player ) before that gets remedied .
The piecemeal approach taken in 6.5 is never going to deliver the coherent interface that we see on competing devices that have been designed from the ground up for touch .
Windows Mobile 6.5 is not going to put an end to the diversity of hardware capabilities currently seen in the Windows phone market , either .
Although there are compulsory requirements — Windows Mobile 6.5 hardware must all have a set of hard keys to do things like open the Start screen — specifications like the screen resolution and even the presence of a touchscreen are still going to be up to the hardware vendors .
This variation makes it much harder for both Microsoft and third parties to deliver truly compelling Windows Mobile software .
Even a measure as simple as mandating a touchscreen would enable software vendors to tailor their software to the hardware much more effectively than is currently possible .
As flexible as the hardware specs are in some ways , they 're lacking in others .
Chief among the deficits is the lack of support for capacitative touchscreens .
All touch - enabled 6.5 devices will have resistive touchscreens .
The upshot of this is that they will all also lack support for multitouch .
With Windows Mobile 7 still not likely until April 2010 , Windows Mobile is going to continue to have a tough time against competing phone platforms .

* Assets down 44.4 pct to $ 13.3 bln
* Says sold some international , local assets in 2008
* Most losses realised on investments in shares
* Declines to say if Citigroup stake sold
( Adds board member remarks to TV )
RIYADH , Jan 20 ( Reuters ) -
The investment firm of Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , the largest private shareholder in Citigroup C.N , posted a $ 8.26 billion net loss in the fourth quarter as the value of its assets dove .
Kingdom Holding Co 4280.SE , also the largest private shareholder on the Saudi bourse , liquidated " some international and local " assets in 2008 , board member Ahmad Halawani , told Al Arabiya television .
“ The company ’s investment committee has taken some decisions last year to sell some of the company ’s assets ...
The majority of these losses were realised on investment in shares traded internationally and locally , ” Halawani said .
He declined to say if the Citigroup stake was part of the stakes it had shed , but said Kingdom ’s assets had fallen 44.4 percent to $ 13.3 billion .
“ I do n’t want to give more details on where these investments were , ” he said when asked if Citigroup shares were part of assets sold .
The company is now in the process of “ achieving balance in our investment portfolio ” , Halawani added , without elaborating .
The firm , which holds minority stakes in several of the world ’s top firms , has booked $ 4 billion provision by end -2008 for declines in local and international share prices , Halawani said .
Kingdom Holding announced a fourth - quarter net loss of 30.97 billion riyals after the Saudi bourse closed on Tuesday .
“ The loss is mainly due to losses realised on our investments in capital markets , ” the company said in a statement posted on the stock exchange ’s website .
Board member Halawani said the “ current global and local conditions affecting stock markets have a direct impact on Kingdom Holding Co ” .
Kingdom made a net profit of 255.7 million riyals in the three months to Dec. 31 , 2007 .
Alwaleed was the world ’s 19th richest person with a $ 21 billion fortune according to Forbes ’ latest survey .
About 90 percent of Alwaleed ’s holdings in Saudi shares are in Kingdom , in which he owns a 94 percent stake .
Kingdom last week reduced to below 5 percent its stake in Samba Financial Group 1090.SE , Saudi Arabia 's second - largest listed bank , and it also owns 10 percent of Savola Group 2050 .SE , according to bourse data .
[ ID:nLK469224 ]
The conglomerate also owns 6.2 percent in Saudi industrial group Tasnee 2060.SE and is the largest shareholder in Saudi Research and Marketing Group 4210.SE , publisher of pan-Arab daily newspaper Asharq al - Awsat , with a 29.9 percent stake .

" I will love you forever , " swears the poet .
I find this easy to to swear . " I will love you at 4:15 p.m. next Tuesday " : Is that still as easy ? " - W.H. Auden , ( 1959 ) .
" It is difficult to define love .
What can be said is that in the soul it is a passion to dominate another , in the mind it is mutual understanding , whilst in the body it is simply a delicately veiled desire to posses the beloved after many rites and mysteries .
If pure love exists , free from the dross of our other passions , it lies hidden in the depths of our hearts unknown even to ourselves .
Where love is , no disguise can hide it for long ; where it is not , none can simulate it .
There are few people who , when their love for each other is dead , are not ashamed of that love .
You can find women who have never had a love affair , but seldom women who had only one .
There is only one kind of love , but there are a thousand copies , all different .
Love , like fire , cannot survive without continual movement , and it ceases to live as soon as it ceases to hope or fear .
True love is like ghostly apparitions : everybody talks about them but few have ever seen one .
Love lends its name to countless dealings which are attributed to it but of which it knows no more than the doge knows what goes on in Venice .
We cannot love anything except in terms of ourselves , and when we put out friends above ourselves we are only concerned with our own taste and pleasure .
Yet it is only through such preference that friendship can be true and perfect .
Constancy in love is perpetual inconstancy , inasmuch as the heart is drawn to one quality after another in the beloved , now preferring this , now that .
Constancy is therefore inconstancy held in check and confined to the same object .
Constancy in love is of two kinds : one comes from continually finding new things to love in the beloved , and the other from making it a point of honor to remain constant .
We are nearer to loving those who hate us than loving those who love us more than we want . "

Activist organizations file suit against FBI over raid , seizure of computers Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday January 14 , 2009
Print This Email This The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of California have filed a federal lawsuit against the FBI and local authorities over the seizure and search of two organizations ' computers , they jointly announced Wednesday .
On August 27 , 2008 , the University of California Police , the Alameda County Sheriff 's Department and the FBI took part in a raid of the Berkeley offices of two politically active groups , Long Haul Infoshop and East Bay Prisoner Support Group ( EBPS ) , seizing every computer in the building , even those behind locked doors , which were opened by force .
The raid was conducted despite no allegations of wrongdoing on the part of either organization or any of their members , and the complaint questions the legality of the warrant obtained by authorities .
Long Haul Infoshop , an all - volunteer collective , provides community space , a lending library and Internet - connected computers to the public .
It also publishes a quarterly newspaper called Slingshot .
EBPS , while sharing its building , is not affiliated with Long Haul .
EBPS publishes a newsletter of writing by prisoners , also distributes literature to , and advocates for , the prison population , including LGBT and female inmates .
The computers were eventually returned , but copies of their data were likely made .
" As long as the government keeps the copies they made of these hard drives , " ACLU staff attorney Michael Risher said , " they are continuing to violate the privacy of everyone who wrote or stored a document on the computers . "
The seizures violated not only the federal Privacy Protection Act , but the First and Fourth Amendments , said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick .
" The Slingshot and EBPS computers were clearly marked and left behind locked doors ... Yet the raid officers broke into the offices to take information these organizations collected and relied on to publish information to their readership . "
The complaint also charges similar violations under the California Constitution .
Damages sought in the suit include legal fees , expenses , permanent injunctions to prevent retention or use of the copied data by all parties in possession thereof , and a judicial declaration that the organizations ' rights under the United States and California Constitutions , and California state statute , were violated .
" We think the police should have treated us with the same respect due to any library whose public - access computers they suspected had been used for improper activity , " said Long Haul 's Jesse Palmer .
" Instead of asking for our assistance , they used their investigation as an excuse to break into Long Haul , search through our records , and seize our computers . "
Warren Buffett became one of the wealthiest people in the world by making predictions and putting money behind those predictions .
Every time he buys a stock or a business or some other investment , he 's forecasting the future .
Judging by the incredible returns of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway , Buffett and his colleagues are very good at making those predictions .
Of course , it helps when you can give your predictions plenty of time to come true .
That 's one reason Buffett 's favorite holding period for investments in " outstanding businesses with outstanding managements " is " forever . "
After all , " We do n't get paid for activity , just for being right .
As to how long we 'll wait , we 'll wait indefinitely . "
With that in mind , here are Warren Buffett Watch 's " Eight for ' 08 " .. and beyond .
1. Recessions can't be avoided forever .
In the last few days , Buffett told our Becky Quick that if unemployment picks up significantly , the " dominoes " will fall and the U.S. economy will fall into recession in 2008 .
He 's not sure , however , that unemployment will go up next year .
In fact , he 's surprised that all the weakness we 're seeing in housing has n't affected the jobs market ... yet .
Here 's what he is sure about : " It is the nature of capitalism to periodically have recessions .
People overshoot . "
( He told Becky she 's young enough to expect to see 6 or 7 or them . )
2 . We 'll survive future recessions just as we 've survived past problems .
As Buffett told us in August , " We 've got a wonderful economy ...
There 's never been anything like that in the history of the world .
We live seven times better than the people did a century ago on average ...
We 've had problems all along .
If you look at the last century , we had that Great Depression and World War Two , we had the Cold War , we had the atomic bomb , but the country does well . "
3. Recessions will create opportunities .
" I made by far the best buys I 've ever made in my lifetime in 1974 .
And that was a time of great pessimism and the oil shock and stagflation and all those sort of things .
But stocks were cheap . "
British telecommunications firm FreedomCall has terminated its cooperation with Israel 's MobileMax due to the IDF operation in Gaza .
" We received an email from the British company informing us that it is severing all ties with us and any other Israeli company following Israel 's strike in Gaza , " said CEO Raanan Cohen .
" We were n't expecting this from them and there was no prior warning .
I do n't intend to appeal to them or answer the letter . "
The email from FreedomCall said , " As a result of the Israeli government action in the last few days we will no longer be in a position to consider doing business with yourself or any other Israeli company . "
MobileMax , established in 2004 , produces a program providing cellular phones with inexpensive international service .
First , some caveats :
I use the word " maintenance " to refer to software under current development , even if that development is only for bugfixing purposes , and not adding new features .
Thus almost all software undergoes maintenance .
The risk guidelines apply only to code undergoing maintenance .
If you are not and will not modify software , the risks are immaterial .
Guidelines are guidelines , not universal precepts .
They 're rules of thumb .
They may not apply in all cases .
They meet my experience , but I know that a few projects have had different experiences .
Some people who smoke never get lung cancer , but it 's foolish to ignore the connection .
That 's why I call them risks and guidelines .
I believe that software can and should get better over time .
Suppose you write a successful library .
You had a great idea , and you implemented it , and now people use it .
That experience has given you further ideas for enhancements .
You 'd like to make your library more powerful , or easier to use , or generally better .
Thus you experiment .
You play with different API ideas .
You look at solutions to similar problems .
You ask some of your best users for feedback , and you release a new version of the library .
Repeat this a few times , and you 'll discover that you do n't always get everything right the first time .
You face the awkward question of how to make improvements while not stranding your existing users .
Consider the risks .
First , you risk getting an API or a design wrong by making any changes or adding any features .
You can ameliorate these risks by being very cautious , but you can't eliminate this risk .
You 're probably not an expert on the problem area unless you 've already solved the problem with code multiple times , in which case why are you starting over ?
Only feedback will tell you if you 've done it right .
The second risk is that no one will care .
You can't mitigate this .
Release it anyway .
The third risk is that you did it wrong , and you 'll look like a fool .
Research can fix this .
Not caring what random people on the Internet will think helps .
Adding disclaimers helps ( but only because you can tell people to read the disclaimers before arguing with you , and then they look silly ) .
The fourth risk is that you get it kind of right and kind of wrong , and to get it more right , you have to make changes to the wrong parts , and that will change how your users interact with the code .
That 's the scariest risk .
With all of these wonderful users , how can you tell them that you did n't get it all right , and they may have to suffer through an incompatible change ?
( I think the argument is easy to make ; you need a sober assessment of their risks and responsibilities , but that 's a different facet to explore another day . )
Consider the risk of not making improvements when you see them .
Ahh , now you understand all the talk of risk .
Technical Debt ( see also Design Debt ) is a measurement of how easy it is to work with the code .
An Approximate Measure of Technical Debt argues that every line of code is a good approximation of technical debt .
In general , the more code , the more technical debt a system is likely to have .
You see technical debt every time you go to add a feature or fix a bug and it's more difficult than it should be .
Perhaps the name of a variable or function is wrong .
Perhaps a comment is misleading -- imagine that .
Perhaps there 's duplication , or near duplication .
There may be good reasons why the code is in that state .
Sometimes those shortcuts are necessary , or sometimes the right approach is n't obvious without more experience , or sometimes changes elsewhere give you the opportunity to improve abstractions and coalesce near - duplication into duplication to remove it .
If software really can get better over time , we should expect this to happen .
Consider , however -- every feature you do n't need represents technical debt .
Code you might use in the future represents technical debt , even if only scrolling past it in your editor , or that extra second spent compiling , or a function name you have to skip over in the API documentation .
Take that argument one step further .
Code that exists solely for backwards compatibility -- to allow people to continue to use broken , or old , or clunky , or wrong code -- is very nasty , very expensive technical debt .
You can't always avoid taking on technical debt , but if you 're maintaining software , you 'll always pay interest on that debt until you pay off the debt .
Like duplication , backwards compatibility leading to huge amounts of technical debt can eventually crush a project .
You need a plan to get rid of it .
Refactoring helps remove duplication and improve designs .
Only deprecation -- and removal -- can remove backwards compatibility debt .
Self - concept may be defined as the totality of perceptions that each person has of themselves , and this self identity plays an important role in the psychological functioning of everyone .
To date , however , there has been no investigation into the relationship that physical self - concept has with psychological well - being or psychological unwellness .
The author of the thesis is Ms Arantzazu Rodríguez Fernández , who presented her work under the title , El autoconcepto físico y el bienestar / malestar psicológico en la adolescencia ( Physical self - concept and psychological well - being / unwellness during adolescence ) .
Ms Rodríguez is a graduate in Psychology and carried out her PhD under the direction of doctors Alfredo Goñi Grandmontagne and Igor Esnaola Etxaniz , of the Department of Evolutionary Psychology and the University School of Education at the UPV / EHU .
She currently works as a research worker at the university .
This research had three fundamental objectives : to study the relationship between physical self - concept and psychological well - being , to identify the relationship between physical self - concept and anxiety and depression and , finally , to analyse the relationship between physical self - concept and Eating Behaviour Disorders ( EBDs ) — amongst both the non-clinical population in general as well as amongst patients previously diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia nerviosa .
A study on adolescents
To undertake the research , a total of 1,959 young people between the ages of 12 and 23 from the Basque Country , Burgos and Rioja were studied .
48 of these were patients diagnosed with some form of EBD .
The data obtained indicated that physical self - concept is related in a positive manner with the psychological well - being of the individual and in a negative manner to psychological unwellness , in such a way that the more one is happy with one 's physique , the more psychological well - being one has , with less levels of anxiety and depression and less risk of suffering from an EBD .
This relationships have also been analysed as a function of age , gender and physical activity .
As a general rule , it is seen that , taking into account physical self identity , male adolescents present higher scoring for psychological well - being than their female peers .
This same relationship is established between 12 - 14 year old adolescents on the one hand and 15 + adolescents on the other , and between those who do physical activity and those who do not .
But , considering all the variables at the same time , it was seen that adolescents with more positive physical self - concept and who are , at the same time , between 12 and 14 or carry out physical activity , score higher for psychological well - being , without any significant difference between the sexes being observed .
This research also showed young people experienced psychological unwellness in relation to their physical appearance throughout their adolescence , whether their perception of their physique is low , average or high .
Nevertheless , undertaking sporting activity appears to be a good way to minimise any psychological unwellness , probably because it enhances physical self - concept .
It is only when physical self - concept is low that doing physical exercise gives rise to the potential risk of suffering EBD .
As a rule , however , sport can be defended as a way of increasing personal well - being and reducing psychological unwellness .
Stages of greater risk
As regards disorders associated with physical appearance , the greatest risk of developing an anxiety disorder is after the age of 15 ; for a depressive disorder the risk stage is between 12 and 17 ; and for anorexia or bulimia nerviosa the risk period is between 18 and 23 .
Finally , of all the elements conditioning physical self - concept , the outstanding one is that of an attractive physical appearance , because the self - perception of this is strongly related to anxiety , depression and psychological well - being .
All this , of course , is a reflection of how society favours relationships between what is attractive as perceived by one and how anxious , how depressed or how happy one feels with oneself .

Behold the 11 games that we ’re looking forward to the most in 2009 .
Yes , 11 .
Because 2009 is going to be one louder .
In choosing the games that should make waves this year , Game |Life contributors Nate Ralph , Earnest Cavalli , Chris Baker and I made sure to select titles that we were personally excited about .
The types of games that pack the most appeal will naturally be different for each of us .
For example , Nate is too young to remember Punch - Out !! , but when I get the Wii version of the game , I am going to tear open the shrink - wrap with my teeth .
We also tried to constrain this list to games that will actually come out this year .
So no Alan Wake , no God of War III and certainly no Duke Nukem Forever .
With these factors in mind , we present the 11 most anticipated games of 2009 .
Time to sharpen your incisors .
Punch - Out !!
( Wii )
This revival of Nintendo ’s classic puzzle - sports - rhythmic - punching game has been a very long time coming .
The original is probably my favorite 8 - bit game ever , and no boxing game has ever been as much fun .
Probably because Punch - Out !!
never had anything to do with boxing .
It was about perfecting your twitch reactions while trying not to fall over laughing at the ridiculous ethnic stereotype cartoons that served as your opponents .
Punch - Out !! for Wii will continue that storied tradition :
Watch the croissants fly from Glass Joe as he ’s knocked to the canvas .
Will the addictive gameplay be as perfectly replicated ?
I hope and pray that it will .
The game might go off the rails if it makes too much use of Wii waggle controls and feels too much like a Wii Fit exercise minigame .
But the return of Punch - Out !! is reason enough to get excited .

Infamous ( PlayStation 3 )
Fact : Sucker Punch makes excellent action games — the Sly Cooper series was a great addition to Sony ’s PlayStation 2 lineup .
Fact : Grand Theft Auto plus superpowers can equal an amazing experience — I do n’t think I need to remind anyone of Crackdown .
Sucker Punch is billing Infamous as the ultimate superhero simulator , a game that lets you choose your path , saving the city or wreaking destruction .
I ’m really interested to see how the story plays out and how the open world environment is used — is it just window dressing for your destructive amusement , or will you really feel like the most powerful being in a living , breathing world ?
We know so little about how Infamous will play , but as it is likely to be Sony ’s marquee title for 2009 , I imagine we will be hearing a lot about it .

Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and the Damned ( Xbox 360 )
I ’m sick of hanging out with Niko Bellic .
I mean , I know he had a rough adolescence in Serbia and all , but that can only excuse so much murderous , sociopathic behavior .
But man , oh man , I sure do miss kicking it in Liberty City .
What a place !
The sights , the sounds , the insane stunt jumps and plentiful rocket launchers !
I ’m itching for the chance to visit again , this time in the company of grizzled biker Johnny Klebitz .
The new Xbox 360 downloadable expansion to GTA IV offers a lengthy new narrative , and upgrades my favorite virtual metropolis with new weapons , missions , vehicles and multiplayer modes .
What ’s that you say ?
Klebitz is probably a murderous sociopath just like Niko ?
Yeah , well … as long as he does n’t have an annoying cousin that ’s always phoning him , I think I can put up with that .
— Chris Baker
Resident Evil 5 ( PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 )
Until we zombie purists convince George Romero to open a game development studio , Capcom Entertainment is our best substitute in the pixelized fight against the undead .
Metal Gear Solid 4 - level visual polish , a nicely modified strain of the Resident Evil 4 control scheme , online co-operative multiplayer and the woefully underrepresented setting of the African Savannah all indicate that Resident Evil 5 almost has to be something special .
Honestly , I ’m just giddy for a chance to pop off heavy munitions into the brains of some undead foes .
At the end of a long workday , nothing is more satisfying than the wholesale slaughter of shambling hordes .
— Earnest Cavalli
The Beatles Game ( Multiplatform )
We do n’t know what it ’ll look like , how it ’ll play or even what it ’ll be called .
But Harmonix ’s collaboration with The Beatles is the odds - on favorite to be the biggest thing to happen to videogames , and maybe even music , in 2009 .
The creators of Guitar Hero and Rock Band have turned millions of gamers into faux rockers with plastic instruments , letting non-musicians experience the joy of jamming .
And what better way to put on a show in your living room than with the legendary music of the greatest band of all time ?
Harmonix is forgoing Rock Band 3 this year to concentrate its efforts on re-creating the Fab Four ’s music in interactive form .
Even if this were just downloadable content for Rock Band , it would be one of the best things to happen this year .
As a standalone game , it ’ll be unstoppable .
( As long as Harmonix includes an option to sing the entire B side of Abbey Road without stopping , I ’ll be happy . ) — Chris Kohler
Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War II ( Windows )
For more than two decades , the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000 has captivated countless fans with relentless miniature figurine battles waged between hyper- religious superhuman space fascists , space Orks , space Elves and savage , genetically engineered insect - things that are also from space .
The transition to the real - time strategy genre on the PC went fairly well , but the onset of sequel - itis has left the original Dawn of War looking a bit tired .
Fortunately , Relic Entertainment is bringing players back to the basics with Dawn of War II — namely , control of small , elite squads embroiled in close - quarters combat , with a number of traditional RPG mechanics rolled in .
Dawn of War ‘s gleefully excessive brutality and visual flair have been revamped , adding tantalizing levels of detail to the act of vigorously throttling enemy units before hurling them through the air like a large , wet sack .
There will also be bits of traditional base - building and resource gathering on the multiplayer side of things , but confess :
We ’re all really in it for jetpacks and chainsaw - swords .

BioShock 2 : Sea of Dreams ( Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC )
I ’m anticipating this game in the sense that I ’m anxiously holding my breath .
2 K says that BioShock can be its Star Wars , meaning that this episode could be as awesome as The Empire Strikes Back .
But the original BioShock worked so well because it had such a unique story .
Will a trip back into the world of Big Daddies and Little Sisters be as interesting this time around , now that we ’ve already experienced it ?
More worrisome than that :
Will the fact that Ken Levine and 2 K Boston are passing off development to the new 2 K Marin studio in Northern California change things ?
Developing the BioShock sequel is a tall order for a rookie developer .
The original ’s blend of intelligent political commentary and riveting human drama had me hooked , and I ’d fall in love with a game that managed to recapture that feeling .
I ca n’t wait to find out if Sea of Dreams can pull it off .

Dark Void ( PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , Windows )
Gears of War ‘s cover system is getting a bit tired these days , so when I heard at E3 that Capcom ’s upcoming shooter Dark Void lifts it , I had to stop myself from yawning .
But then the developer giving the demo twisted the camera angle to reveal that we were n’t walking down some dark hallway blasting enemies — we were flying up the side of a tower , leaping from cover point to cover point courtesy of a very Rocketeer - ish jetpack .
Moments later , the protagonist leaped off the side of the tower , cutting a beeline toward a wildly maneuvering metal disc .
Try as it might , the disc could n’t get out of his path , and when he alighted on top of the frame , a familiar sequence of button presses popped up just as they might in God of War .
Triangle , X , Square and the craft ’s pilot had been beaten soundly and thrown from the disc — only to have his ride hijacked , Grand Theft Auto - style , by our hero .
Three minutes of gameplay and Dark Void had cemented itself in my mind as the sleeper hit of 2009 .

StarCraft II ( Windows , Mac )
Let ’s review :
The original StarCraft , released in March of 1998 , was one of the deepest , best balanced , most addictive real - time strategy games ever made .
It had three richly varied races , an actual story and near - limitless potential for strategic variations .
Now , Blizzard Entertainment — a developer that has never released a bad game — is finishing up a sequel with gorgeous graphics , new unit types and abilities , and improved online matchmaking .
What ’s not to anticipate about StarCraft II ?
I mean , except for the fact that I ’ll be losing my job and my friends and getting scurvy because the game will end up devouring every waking moment of my life .
Some people are griping because Blizzard has already announced plans to hold back some content for expansion packs .
But come on , do you really think you wo n’t get your money ’s worth ?
People are still playing the original , 11 years later .

Killzone 2 ( PlayStation 3 )
With a name like Killzone , you ’d be forgiven for dismissing this first - person shooter as yet another hypermasculine , shades - of - gray gorefest .
Do n’t get me wrong — there ’ll be plenty of blood sprays and vulgar übermenschen , but Guerrilla Games ’ next stab at the good - guys - versus - space - Nazis formula promises to deliver much more .
The run-and - gun mantra of console shooters past has given way to a focus on tactical supremacy , with a snappy cover system giving you time to plan your next move .
The slower pace should let us really appreciate the eerily hypnotic reloading animations and the stunningly realized crackle and pop of machine - gun fire .
Right up until those brutally clever baddies either flank your position , or blow chunks out of whatever it is you were hiding behind .
Good looks and brains to match .
Where do I enlist ? — Nate Ralph
Rhythm Heaven ( Nintendo DS )
I ’m cheating a bit here , because I ’ve already played the hell out of Rhythm Heaven .
The game has been available in Japan for months , and it ’s been riding the sales charts as if its name were Brain Age or Nintendogs .
If you think that hard - core games have been pushed to the back burner in the Japanese consciousness , you obviously have not yet played Rhythm Heaven , a collection of hilarious , inventive and often brutally difficult music - based minigames created by the WarioWare team .
Failing to release the stellar Game Boy Advance original is one of the crappier things that Nintendo of America has ever done to you , but at least you ’re not being cheated out of the sequel .
I can say with deep certainty that this is one of the best games on Nintendo DS , and you should be anticipating the hell out of it if you like Parappa the Rapper or Elite Beat Agents .

With Macworld San Francisco 2009 ( MWSF ) beginning next week , MacRumors provides this Rumor Roundup as a summary of major rumors circulating around the Mac Web before the event .
The biggest news about Macworld came early when Apple announced that Steve Jobs would not be delivering the 2009 keynote address nor will Apple be participating in future Macworld events .
While Apple 's official reason for the withdrawal was that trade shows are becoming less important , some believe that Apple simply wanted more control of their own release timetable rather than being dependent on this yearly event .
Of course , health questions about Steve Jobs were again raised as another possible reason .
While this rumor season started off slowly , the past few weeks have raised some interesting possibilities .
New iMac and Mac Mini - NVIDIA Based
The most likely hardware releases for Macworld San Francisco include updated versions of the iMac and Mac mini .
While there has been talk about these updates for months , the most convincing evidence actually came from Apple themselves .
The latest versions of Mac OS X were found to include references to NVIDIA - based iMacs and Mac minis .
The NVIDIA chipsets were just introduced into Apple 's notebook line and promise faster graphics hardware for these new models .
DigiTimes has reported that iMacs should be shipping in quantity in January and Apple may have been waiting specifically for new Quad - Core processors from Intel .
Early details about the Mac mini update came from internet hosting company MacMiniColo.net , who was able to confirm that the new mini would include a Mini DisplayPort , increase in max RAM to 4 GB and an SATA Optical drive .
Since then , Wired and TUAW have confirmed that we 'll see a Mac mini release at Macworld .
Other claims from AppleInsider suggest that the mini will get some significant new features , including FireWire 800 , dual - monitor capabilities and an additional USB port .
All of these changes will be welcome to this otherwise neglected product line .
17 " MacBook Pro - Fixed Battery
One product that was left behind during the October notebook updates was Apple 's high - end 17 " MacBook Pro .
New reports released in the past few days have revealed that Apple will be releasing the new 17 " MacBook Pro as early as Macworld .
Aside from adopting the NVIDIA chipset and aluminum unibody design , the most notable change that was first reported by 9to5 Mac is the elimination of a removable battery .
Instead , Apple is said to have chosen a slimmer but longer - lasting battery that is not replaceable , as in the MacBook Air .
This information has been confirmed by a number of sources , and we feel accurately describes the new 17 " MacBook Pro .
i Life '09 .
i Work '09 - The Cloud
A series of reports from 9to5 Mac indicate that Apple is going to make a major effort to turn portions of their iLife and iWork products into Internet services .
This would allow some or all of iWork and iMovie to be accessed from your web browser and possibly your iPhone .
Critics of the move , however , point to the problematic launch of Apple 's MobileMe web - services .
While these original reports drew some outrage from existing customers , many expect that Apple will continue to offer traditional Mac - based applications .
To further add to 9to5 mac 's source 's credibility , we 've heard their most recent report about a Garage Band update may also be true .
The rumor site believes that Apple will begin selling " celebrity music lessons " to Garage Band customers .
Snow Leopard
Some reports have suggested that Phil Schiller may demonstrate or provide more info on Apple 's upcoming Mac OS X revision codenamed Snow Leopard .
An Apple employee presentation first suggested that we could see the release of Snow Leopard in the first quarter of 2009 .
Meanwhile , Apple rushed certification of OpenCL to be ready in time for Snow Leopard 's release .
i Phone and iPhone Nano
The rumor that has gotten the most attention seems the least likely possibility for a Macworld update .
In fact , we had originally heard that Apple was planning on focusing on Mac products at Macworld , though this was well before Apple 's announcement that they were withdrawing from the event .
This rumor gained traction after both XSKN and Vajacases posted teasers and case designs on their sites about a new iPhone Nano .
This fact by itself may not have generated so much interest , but both sites also provided links and photos to iPhone 3G cases in May before its release .
We 're still unsure what to make of the iPhone Nano claims , since there have been no reliable sources stepping up to corroborate this possibility .
Even if the iPhone Nano coming , it seems Macworld is unlikely to be the venue for its release .
Finally , there have been suggestions that some updates may have been delayed from Macworld altogether , which could mean this or other iPhone announcements may be forthcoming in the next few months .
Cinema Displays / Mac Pros / Home Media Server / Tablet or PDA
- Despite an early rumor that we might see new LED Cinema displays at Macworld 2009 , there has been no other confirmation .
While it seems obvious that Apple will be moving towards LED across all their displays , no one seems to have heard if Tuesday will be the day .
- Unfortunately , despite a long wait on Mac Pro updates , desktop customers may have to wait a little longer .
Mac
Pro-suitable processors will be released in the first quarter of 2009 but may not be available in time for a Tuesday release .
- Apple Home Media
Server seems like an interesting idea that Apple has been toying with , but no one knows when or if Apple will release this to the market .
- The latest about an Apple Tablet seems to push off the product until at least the Fall of 2009 .
And , of course , there 's always the promise of something amazing that we 've never heard of before .
3rd Party
- Google is rumored ( unconfirmed ) to be releasing a Mac version of Picasa .
- Cultured Code will be releasing the 1.0 version of Things , a task management app for the Mac .
- Freeverse Slotz Racer iPhone / iPod
Touch game .
- Delicious Monster hints at a free iPhone app .
- Filemaker 10 said to be announced on Monday .
We 'll have more 3rd party coverage at Macworld Expo throughout the week .
Keynote Coverage and Meetup
MacRumors will be providing live keynote coverage at MacRumorsLive with photos and text updates .
The system has been improved and should provide even faster updates than in the past .
While there is no live video stream available for the event , those who wish to watch the time - delayed stream without any spoilers can sign up for the spoiler free announcements .
Finally , Twitter users can sign up for SMS updates at http://twitter.com/macrumors.
The Keynote begins at 9 a.m. on Tuesday , January 6th , 2009 ( view local times ) .
Readers at Macworld Expo should join us in person at the Macworld Finale Bash on Tuesday , January 6th starting at 6 p.m ( details ) , hosted by Delicious Monster .
Next time you order a new pair of skinny jeans from Gap.com , you should know that you are helping welcome in the hive - mind robot overlords of retail .
Warehouses run by Gap , as well as Zappos and Staples now use autonomous robots to pluck products from their shelves and send them to you .
All the robots are told is where products are located and where they need to go .
From there , the robots , which look like massive orange Roombas , figure out the rest .
They locate the stack of shelves with the needed product on it , slide beneath the stack to pick it up and then find their own routes from the stacks of stuff to human operators .
And they manage to find just the right time to get themselves recharged for five minutes out of every hour .
" It ’s a major game - changer .
There ’s no question about that .
You can increase productivity immensely , " said Michael Levans , editorial director for a group of supply - chain trade magazines like Logistics Management .
" The Zappos guys claim that from the moment you put your order in and it is submitted to the time the box is on the dock and ready to be put on a truck is 12 minutes . "
The robots , which in the largest distribution center currently number over 500 , are built by a small company called Kiva Systems ( no relation to the microfinance outfit ) .
In total , they ’ve installed more than 1,000 bots at a dozen warehouses and are growing quickly .
By the end of this year , they expect single locations to have systems with 1,000 of the machines .
Dreamed up and executed by old M.I.T. buddies , these teams of retail robots presage an automated future in which multiagent robotic systems put computer science theories into practice .
" The basic technology will be the de facto way to run a warehouse , " said Pete Wurman , computer science Ph.D. and a technical lead on the team that developed the robot .
" We ’ll start to see these same techniques that become the de facto techniques in manufacturing . "
While the humanoid robotic visions of the 1950s have never come to Jetsons - like fruition , less sexy robots have become indispensable parts of many industries and service professions .
A recent report by the International Federation of Robotics found that 6.5 million robots serve humanity around the world .
Still , most of them are standalone or primarily operated by human beings .
Kiva robots are different :
They ’re both autonomous and networked .
What that means for workers in the warehouse is that the Henry Ford - era distribution system of the conveyor belt has been broken into pieces and distributed across the entire operation .
Any worker ( sometimes called " pickers " in the industry jargon ) can ask for anything from anywhere in the warehouse and ship it out .
" Every worker has random access to every product in the warehouse , " Wurman said .
The system adjusts to the nature of the products and workers , too .
In a typical setup , the humans are placed around the edges of the room .
As the robots pick up loads of products and put them back , they adjust the warehouse for greater efficiency .
More popular products end up around the edges of the warehouse while more obscure products , like those acid - washed bell bottoms , end up buried deep in the stacks .
The self - tuning nature of the system creates big efficiencies .
" We find that it ’s two to four times more efficient [ than the average warehouse ] , " said Wurman .
" A big chunk of the benefit comes from the fact that we ’ve eliminated all of the walking . "
The success of Kiva Systems could help teams of autonomous robots gain ground outside the computer science lab .
" I could see some of the techniques that we are developing being applied outside the warehouse , " Wurman said .
" When we have autonomous automobiles , you could imagine they ’ll have similar types of coordination problems . "
But autonomy wo n’t work for all situations , Lonnie Freiburger , a robotics specialist with the U.S. Army ’s Tank Automotive Research , Development & Engineering Center .
The military is looking more at " semi-autonomous " bots , rather than ones with relatively full control over their actions .
But Freiburger and the Kiva Systems engineers both agree that robots do n’t have to be humanoid to be useful .
In fact , endowing them with characteristics humans do n’t have can be more useful than giving them eyes or opposable thumbs .
" Sure , it ’s nice to have robots that can do what the humans can do , but it ’s also nice to have robots to do what humans ca n’t do , " Freiburger said .
" Humans have physical limitations but the robots do n’t necessarily have those limitations . "
Unlike the Honda ASIMO , Kiva robots do n’t look anything like a human or try to perceive the world through humanlike senses .
They do n’t use sophisticated visual sensors to navigate ; instead , they know where they are by using a simple and cheap grid system that ’s stuck onto the floor of the warehouse .
That allows warehouse operators to switch off the lights and climate controls in the large areas of the warehouse that are patrolled solely by robots , cutting energy costs by as much as 50 percent over a standard warehouse .
One marketing trick the company uses is to bring people out to the center of a warehouse and switch out the lights :
The robots keep working around the people , cruising around in the dark .
While that may sound disconcerting , for now , at least , robots remain our underlings — fetching our underwear , delivering our jeans — not our overlords .
At many sites , workers have begun to name their robots , complete with
" Hello , My Name Is " name tags .
From there , it ’s only a short step to playing fetch with your robot .
" One of our customers calls those name tags tattoos , and the robots are adopted by employees , " said Mitch Rosenberg , Kiva Systems ’ VP of
Marketing .
" Your robot sends you a card on your birthday — this is a corporate sponsored thing , so I asked the management why they let them do it .
They said , ‘ We do it because the employees get a lot of joy , a lot of happiness out of anthropomorphizing the robots and turning them into pets . ’ "

On Thursday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs confirmed at Thursday 's press briefing that President Obama has held on to his beloved smart phone , though he did not provide details on what kind of BlackBerry the president is using .
President Obama will use the device to communicate with select staff and a few friends , Gibbs said .
He did not elaborate on who is allowed to e-mail Obama .
Gibbs told reporters that He [ President Obama ] has a BlackBerry through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends in a way that use will be limited and security enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate , but to do so effectively and to do so in a way that is protected .
Speculation about the fate of the president 's BlackBerry has been swirling since Election Day .
Also , Gibbs would n't elaborate on how the president 's handheld will be protected , or the type of security enhancements that have been added .
One limitation of the BlackBerry , though , is that it does not appear to have been certified by the National Security Agency as secure enough for Top Secret voice communications .
If the president wants to keep his BlackBerry it is possible to add encryption and authentication on top of the device .
In history neither George W. Bush nor Bill Clinton used email during their presidencies , although Bush has claimed he used email before becoming president .
GNOMEのプログラミング言語Valaを使えば、わざわざANSI Cでオブジェクト指向的なプログラミングをしなくても、GNOMEデスクトップのコア部分であるGLib2オブジェクトシステムを利用できる。MonoやJavaとは異なり、Valaのプログラムには仮想マシンもランタイムライブラリも必要なく、Valaオブジェクトを利用する人々はそれらがC以外の言語で書かれていることを知る必要さえない。
Valaコンパイラのvalacは、ValaのコードをCのコードに変換し、その結果をgccでコンパイルすることによってオブジェクトコードを生成する。従来のC言語環境で高水準言語を使おうとすると、言語のバインドという大きな問題に直面する。具体的には、それらの出所、メンテナンス状況、バグの有無などだ。バインドの質が低いと、高水準言語の利用はC言語以上にストレスを感じさせるものになり得る。ValaにはGLibのイントロスペクションが使えるツール群が含まれており、任意のGLib2オブジェクトでValaバインドを生成できる。ValaのFedora 9用パッケージには、GLib2、GTK+2、SDL、SQLite、WebKit、libsoup、libglade-2、hildon、hal、gstreamer、cairo、dbusの各種バインドが含まれている。GLib2/GTK+2ベースのデスクトップやハンドヘルドアプリケーションで必要になりそうなライブラリの多くは、すでにValaアプリケーションで利用可能なわけだ。Valaプロジェクトは、Valaバインドを提供するプロジェクトのリストも用意している。
ValaはC言語コードの利用に重きを置いている。それ以外についてはどうだろうか。Valaでは、C/C++開発者が簡単にオブジェクトを再利用できるように、GLib2オブジェクトのヘッダファイルを生成することができる。GLib2オブジェクトについて記述したCのヘッダファイルが扱えるものなら、どんな言語でもValaオブジェクトを利用できるはずなので、Valaで実装されたオブジェクトはPerlやPythonでも使えるはずだ。
GLib2では、シグナルとプロパティを用いて独自のクラスを定義できる。Cで書かれたGLib2プログラムの場合は、class_init関数で g_signal_new を使うことで、GObjectに対して新たなシグナルを関連付けて登録する。この新しいシグナルには、固有の数値IDであるsignalIDを与える。シグナルを発行するには、 g_signal_emit 関数を使って、そのsignalIDと、必要に応じてほかのパラメータも渡す。新しいシグナルの登録は非常に煩雑で、シグナルの呼び出しには数値のsignalIDを使う必要があるため、シグナルを発行する行では静的な型チェックが十分に行えない。
以下 のCコードでは、最初に“ test - signal1” という新しいシグナルをGLib2オブジェクトに登録している。 notify は、このシグナルへの接続が可能が関数で、test-signal1シグナル発行時の変更への対応に使われる。 g_signal_connect 関数の実行により、test-signal1シグナルが発行されるたびにnotify関数の呼び出しが行われるようになる。最後の行では、このシグナルを実際に発行しており、その結果notify関数が呼び出される。
... class_init ( ) { ... g_test_signals [ TEST_SIGNAL1 ] = g_signal_new ( " test- signal1 " , G_TYPE_FROM_CLASS
( klass ) , G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST , G_STRUCT_OFFSET ( GTestClass , test_signal1 ) , NULL , NULL , g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__INT , G_TYPE_NONE , 1 , G_TYPE_INT ) ; ... } ... static void notify ( GObject * object , GParamSpec * spec , gpointer user_data ) { gint value ; g_object_get ( object , " test - prop " , &value , NULL ) ; g_print ( " + %d " , value ) ; } ... test1 = g_object_new ( G_TYPE_TEST , NULL ) ; g_signal_connect ( test1 , " test- signal1 " , G_CALLBACK ( notify ) , NULL ) ; ... g_signal_emit ( G_OBJECT ( test ) , g_test_signals [ TEST_SIGNAL1 ] , 0 , 0 ) ;
一方、次のコードは、やは りGLib2 のシグナル test_signal1 を定義して利用す るValaのコードだ。シグナルのシグネチャは先ほどのCのコードと同じだが、引数として整数を1つ取り、返り値は持たない。このシグナルがほぼメソッドと同じ形で宣言されていることに注意してほしい。パラメータの定義は、
G_TYPE_NONE /G_TYPE_INT
といったマクロではなく、コードのほかの部分と同様の型が使われている。また、最後の行におけるシグナルの発行も、関数の呼び出し構文によって行われている。シグナルに対して “ += ” 演算子を用いている行では、引数を標準出力に書き出すだけのハンドラ関数がインラインで定義されている。
public class Test : GLib .
Object { public signal void test_signal1 ( int a ) ; public static void main ( string [ ] args ) { Test t1 = new Test ( ) ; t1.test_signal1 += ( t , a ) => { stdout.
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; } ; t1.test_signal1 ( 5 ) ; } }
上記のValaコードはかなり簡潔だが、実際には先ほどのCコードよりも多くの処理を行っている。このValaのソースコードだけで、カスタムのGLib2クラスを使った実行可能なプログラムになっているのだ。
なお、シグナルを発行する行ではValaによって静的な型チェックが行われる。そのため、この行の引数を文字列に変えてtest_signal1を発行しようとすると、次のようなコンパイルエラーが出る。
$ valac -o signal signal.vala signal.vala:12.25-12.29 : error : Argument 1 : Cannot convert from `string ' to `int ' t1.test_signal1 ( " foo " ) ; ^^^^^ Compilation failed : 1 error(s ) , 0 warning (s )
Vala言語の特徴は、オブジェクトの作成やシグナルの定義および扱いを簡単にしたことだけではない。Valaはローカル変数の型推論もサポートしており、「 var foo = getFoo( ) ; 」とすればGLib2のエラーが例外に変わるほか、 foreach を使うことで、GLibのC言語APIよりもずっと楽にコレクションに対する繰り返し処理が行える。
GLib2のオブジェクトを利用したプログラムを書くのに、foreach構文やラムダ関数といった言語設計上、比較的新しい機能を持つ言語が使えるのは、すばらしいことだ。Valaでは自作オブジェクトのヘッダファイルを生成することができる。そのため、ほかの言語を使っている開発者には、その実装の中身に対する検討を強いることなく、オブジェクトを使ってもらえる。
ただ、できるだけシンプルかつ気持ちよくGLib2プログラムを書けるようにする特徴を備えていながら、Vala言語にはそれを学ぶための参考書はもちろん、ドキュメント類も少ないのが玉にキズだ。

We know it 's going to happen .
Scientists tell us that if something does n't wipe us out in the next thousand years the death of the sun will .
Such a fun thought .
But what do scientists know ?
Besides the secrets of the natural world , that is .
Here at JPP we use movies to divine our futures - and hell , the future looks bleak .
To get an accurate sampling of every conceivable death for humankind we sampled 100 movies and divided the grim fates into 11 categories .
We found it surprising that while there are certainly apocalyptic categories that stand out in our mind ( thanks to blockbuster advertising ) the ones we thought would be highest ... are n't .
Here we go ...

Except for E.T. , for now .
Das Corporate Europe Observatory ( CEO ) und die Londoner Umweltorganisation Platform haben Anfang der Woche eine Studie zum Einfluss des Ölkonzerns bp auf die Energiepolitik in der EU vorgelegt .
CEO und Platform untersuchen die engen Verbindungen des Unternehmens mit Entscheidungsträgern anhand von zwei Fallstudien , zum einen zum Emissionshandel und zu den Verbindungen nach Russland ( neuerdings mit Ex-Kanzler Schröder als Aufsichtsrat des Öl - Joint - Ventures TNK - BP ) .
Ihr Ergebnis : die Lobbyarbeit und die personellen Verflechtungen von bp mit der Politik haben dazu beigetragen , dass die EU die Interessen von bp als europäische Interessen behandelt und unterstützt .
bp hat starken Einfluss auf eine unternehmensfreundliche Ausgestaltung des Emissionshandels .
So wurde der Vorschlag der EU - Kommission , dass Raffinerien in Zukunft Teile ihrer Verschmutzungszertifikate ersteigern sollten , aus dem Text gestrichen .
bp hat als drittgrößtes privates Ölunternehmen große Raffineriekapazitäten , u.a. in Rotterdam , Deutschland und Spanien .

Für die deutsche Seite der Lobbyarbeit zum EU - Emissionshandel lohnt sich auch das Fachbuch von Matthias Corbach 2007 : Die deutsche Stromwirtschaft und der Emissionshandel .
Stuttgart : ibidem Verlag .
Obwohl im Titel „ deutsche Stromwirtschaft “ steht , tauchen auch bp und weitere Unternehmen in dieser Netzwerkanalyse auf .
Das Buch untersucht u.a. die „ Arbeitsgruppe Emissionshandel zur Bekämpfung des Treibhauseffektes “ , die die EU - Richtlinie zum Emissionshandel begleitete .
Dabei wurde die Arbeitsgruppe und deren Sekretariat von Wirtschaftsseite finanziell gesponsert , was sich auch in einem privilegierten Zugang für diese Unternehmen zeigte .
bp stellte beispielsweise den Leiter des Sekretariats ( S. 73 ) .

Mosi -oa - Tunya ( the Smoke that Thunders ) or The Victoria Falls , which was named by Scottish explorer , David Livingstone , is located in Zimbabwe , Southern Africa .
The height of the magnificent waterfalls is 108 meters , which can be considered among the highest waterfalls in the world .

The most popular location is known as the “ Devil ’s Swimming Pool ” where during the months of September and December , visitors can swim as close as possible to the edge of the falls without falling over .
Pretty cool is n’t it ?
Below are the brave and splendid photos of people who have visited the scariest pool .

Diesels are fuel efficient and practical , but they 're dogged by a reputation for being about as much fun as a tax audit .
VW 's worked hard to change that perception with cars like the Jetta TDI , but it might be the sweet Concept BlueSport roadster that finally convinces Americans diesels are cool .
The mid-engined sports car made its world debut at the Detroit auto show , and although it 's just a concept , there 's no reason why VW could n't - or should n't - build it .
The car gets 42 mpg and emits about as much CO2 as a Toyota Prius , and it is emissions - legal in all 50 states so even car - crazy Californians could buy one .
BlueSport relies upon three technologies VW believes will become more prevalent as the auto industry develops cleaner , more fuel - efficient cars : turbocharging , automatic start - stop technology and regenerative braking .
" The future of Volkswagen belongs to cars like this , " company chairman Martin Winkerhorn Winterkorn said as he unveiled the car , which could appear in showrooms in 2011 .
We sure hope so .
Volkswagen has been toying with the idea of a two - seat , mid-engined sports car since unveiling the Concept R in 2003 .
It rolled out another one , the EcoRacer , two years later at the Tokyo auto show .
Such a car always seemed like a long shot , though , given it would compete with the Audi TT and perhaps the Porsche Boxster .
But VW keeps teasing us , and along comes the BlueSport , built with off - the - shelf parts to keep costs down - and raise our hopes that production might be financially feasible .
VW started with an aluminum chassis and body to minimize weight , then shaved more weight with an aluminum manual folding top , lightweight leather seats with one - piece backs and other tricks .
As a result , the 13 - foot - long car weighs just 2,640 pounds , making it about the same size and weight as a Honda Fit .
Propulsion comes from a 2.0 - liter turbocharged common - rail TDI clean diesel similar to the mill in the 41 - mpg Jetta TDI - thecar Green Car Journal named Green Car of the Year .
VW says the engine produces 177 horsepower and a very respectable 258 pound - feet of torque .
It 's enough to propel the BlueSport to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds and a top speed of 140 mph .
Power flows through a six - speed paddle - shifted DSG transmission with dual clutches .
Start - stop technology helps improve fuel economy , and regenerative braking provides additional energy for on - board systems like air conditioning .
The styling , led by VW group design director Walter de'Silva , reflects the design language of the Scirocco and new Golf and looks like an angrier , more muscular Audi TT , though the front end also bears a similarity to the Honda S2000 - a car that , like the Lotus Elise and Miata , almost certainly would be the car 's competitors should it see production .
" It is the symbiosis of outstanding technology and timeless Volkswagen design that makes this car an exceptional sports car , " de 'Silva said .
" Its styling is clear and is reduced to the essentials . "
VW is among the few automakers that did n't take a beating last year .
Although sales were down for the industry as a whole , VW sold 6.2 million cars last year , a 6 percent increase over 2007 .
" We all know 2009 is going to be a very difficult year for the auto industry , " Winterkorn said .
" So far Volkswagen group has handled the market well . "
We 'd wager VW would handle the market even better if it built the BlueConcept .

Last week I was talking to Aloa , one of the Abduzeedo writers , and he was showing me some images that he thought were cool for tutorials , one of those had this mix of vectors and gradients but very geometric .
It was a nice inspiration so I decided to do something mixing Illustrator and Photoshop .
In this tutorial I will show you how to create an abstract image for a poster using Illustrator and Photoshop .
We will do all the vectors and shades in Illustrator then in Photoshop we 'll give to the image a nice retro style using some textures and brushes .
Step 1
Open Adobe Illustrator and with the Rectangle Tool ( M ) create some rectangles .
Make sure they are aligned and , also , that you have different heights and widths .
Use the image below for reference .
Tip : you can duplicate the rectangles by holding the ALT key and moving the object .
Step 2
Select a few rectangles , move them to the right holding the ALT key to duplicate them .
Now you will have 2 columns .
Step 3
Repeat the same thing , but now to the left to create a third column .
Step 4
Again repeat the same thing you did in the previous steps , now to create the fourth column .
Notice that I also added a few new rectangles .
You can create more rectangles or columns if you want as well .
Step 5
Select the first column and go to Object > Transform > Shear .
Use - 40 for the Shear Angle and Vertical for the Axis .
Step 6
Repeat the Shear transformation to the other columns .
Use 40 º , - 40 º , 40 º and - 40 º for the angles .
Step 7
Now start filling the rectangles with gradient and solid colors .
I used 3 colors to create the shades .
Pink , Yellow and Cyan .
Use the Gradient Tool ( G ) to create the gradients , such as : Pink to Yellow and Cyan to Yellow .
Also leave some white rectangles .
Step 8
Apply line patterns to some elements .
I used the Basic Graphic_Lines library that comes with Adobe Illustrator .
Just go to Window > Swatch Libraries > Patterns > Basic Graphic_Lines .
Use different patterns to the elements ( 1 - 4 ) .
Step 9
One of the best features in the new version of Illustrator is that now we can have different opacity for the gradient colors .
What I did here was pretty simple .
Duplicate some rectangles and move them to the opposite column so the angle will be the opposite .
Then add a Gradient from Black to Black but in one end change the opacity to 0 , so it will be from black to transparent .
That will add a nice style to some areas of the image , creating nice shades .
Step 10
Now just create a black rectangle beneath the vectors so you can make some adjustments .
Notice that the there are more elements like black rectangles .
Here you work on the final adjustments and details , because in Photoshop you wo n't be able to edit the elements , unless you come back to Illustrator using the Smart Objects feature .
Step 11 - Photoshop
Select all vectors but the black recangle .
Copy them in Illustrator and then open Photoshop .
Create a new document .
I used the A4 format .
Fill the Background layer with a very dark grey # 080 a0f , then paste the vectors as Smart Objects .
Step 12
Duplicate the vectors layer , that is a smart object then go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur .
Use 20 pixels for the Radius and change the Blend Mode of the layer to Screen .
For the opacity use 80 % .
Step 13
Create 6 rectangles and fill them with a gradient from Black to Transparent .
You can use Black and White with Multiply for the Blend Mode .
Just make the Gradient size different for each element like the image below ( 1 - 6 )
Step 14
Now lets add some space effects .
First , create some stars using the Noise Filter .
You can follow that from another tutorial I wrote you can find it at http://abduzeedo.com/surprise-behind-curtain-photoshop, the Step 3 .
Also let 's use a nice flare effect .
I used a photo to do that , you can find it at http://weheartit.com/entry/327989.
Place the image and just change the Blend Mode to Screen .
Step 15
To get a very vintage style to the image I used a paper texture .
You can download it at http://www.danevins.com/_wizardimages/old_paper.jpg.
Change the Blend Mode to Multiply and the Opacity to 80 % .
Step 16
Create a new layer right below the paper texture .
Then using some Grunge Brushes paint some areas to give that old style effect .
Use white for the color , but as the layer will be beneath the paper the color will be a sort of beige .
Tip :
The brushes I used are from misprintedtype.com , created by the Master Eduardo Recife .
Conclusion
The new version of Illustrator has very useful features , like the opacity in gradients .
Also the Smart Objects integration between Illustrator and Photoshop allows us to edit vectors in illustrator while working on the image in Photoshop , what is really useful too .
I 'm a big fan of vintage style images and in this tutorial I showed some techniques to create that .
I hope you like the tutorial .
Enjoy .

So it 's a good thing MTV Multiplayer 's Stephen Totilo is there to hear stuff like this : this afternoon Electronic Art's John Riccitiello mentioned that there will be a new installment to American McGee 's Alice series this year .
As I was writing this , EA hit our inbox with a press release which clarifies that the title will come to Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and PC in 2009 .
It 's being developed by McGee 's Shanghai - based Spicy Horse studio , most recently responsible for the GameTap - episodic - exclusive , Grimm .
Originally released in 2000 for PCs , Alice was a third - person action title that was a twisted take on the Alice in Wonderland story through the eyes of game designer American McGee .
Word of the title being spun off into a film ( and being ported to the consoles ) never quite panned out .
Perhaps this sequel will give the series some much - needed new life .

Barack Obama has warned that it will take time to turn around the economy US President Barack Obama has welcomed Congress 's approval of his $ 787bn ( £ 548 bn ) economic stimulus package .
He described it as a " historic step " and " major milestone on our road to recovery " , and is expected to sign the bill into law early next week .
The Senate approved the measure with just three Republican votes , hours after the House of Representatives backed it without Republican support .
Mr Obama has said the plan will " save or create more than 3.5 million jobs " .
Republicans argue the tax cuts are insufficient , and that the economy will be saddled with debt for years to come .
Members of both houses of Congress reached a deal over the content of the stimulus package on Wednesday .
This historic step wo n't be the end of what we do
President Obama
Battle exposes partisan rifts
Send us your comments
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says the first set - piece drama of the Obama era ended in a comfortable but not entirely unqualified victory for the president , who had hoped for more bipartisan support .
All 176 Republicans and seven Democrats voted against the revised package in the House .
It was backed by 246 House Democrats .
The three rebel votes in the Senate were enough under Congress rules to stop the Republican Party using blocking tactics to delay the stimulus plan , and it passed 60 - 38 .
' Immediate investments '
In his weekly address , President Obama described his economy recovery package as " an ambitious plan at a time we badly need it " .
" This is a major milestone on our road to recovery , and I want to thank the members of Congress who came together in common purpose to make it happen , " he said .
" I will sign this legislation into law shortly , and we 'll begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people back to work doing the work America needs done .
" This historic step wo n't be the end of what we do to turn our economy around , but the beginning . "
The approved version of the plan is split into 36 % for tax cuts and 64 % percent in spending and money for social programmes .
STIMULUS PACKAGE $ 240bn in tax breaks for individuals and businesses $ 140bn for health care $ 100bn for education $ 48bn for transportation projects Source : Associated Press Running to more than 1,000 pages , it includes new road building , cash to pay police in hard - up cities , and tax breaks for consumers buying houses and cars .
The package also imposes new limits on cash bonuses and other incentive compensation for executives on Wall Street , which are much tougher than those proposed by the Obama administration last week .
The provision , inserted by Senate Democrats , targets senior executives at financial institutions receiving government bail - out funds .
The colossal package is all to be funded with borrowed money .
Republicans had insisted on larger tax cuts instead of big spending programmes .
Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said : " This is n't Monopoly money .
It 's real .
It adds up , and it has to be paid back , by our children and by their children . "
The Democratic leader of the Senate , Harry Reid , praised the three Republicans who had voted for the bill and said it was the most important piece of legislation he had worked on .
" The country is in trouble and we 're so fortunate we were able to get it passed , " he said .
" It 's going to give this country a shot in the arm . "
Earlier , Mr Obama had said that in the longer term the government needed to rein in spending , and that " we are going to have to once again live within our means " .
The president told members of the Business Council in Washington that the package was " only the beginning of what I think all of you understand is going to be a long and difficult process of turning our economy around . "
Presidential pressure " We have a once - in - a - generation chance to act boldly , and turn adversity into opportunity , and to use this crisis as a chance to transform our economy for the twenty - first century , " Mr Obama said .
Among the measures in the approved package is a " Buy American " clause that had caused alarm among US trading partners .
The EU and Canada said that provisions favouring American - produced materials for government projects risked provoking retaliatory protectionist measures .
In the face of this reaction , the clause was softened to a version requiring the government not to violate trade agreements .
Last week , the House had approved an earlier $ 825 bn version of the package without any Republican support .
The Senate voted to approve a different $ 838bn version on Tuesday , with few Republicans opting to back it .
The two versions had to be reconciled in a joint House - Senate committee before facing final votes in the two chambers .

Gloria Luther , 28 , from Sweden , said she felt sick after almost biting the larva in half .
She said : " It was disgusting .
I nearly bit it in half .
I felt sick .
It was just sitting there in the middle of the burger .
" What worries me are all the things I might have eaten in the past and not even known about it , ” she added .
The fast food giant has blamed their green environmental policies for the incident , as reported in the Austrian Times .
McDonald 's spokeswoman Claes Eliasson said : " There always is a risk that there are larvae because our suppliers do n't spray any pesticides on their lettuce but wash them in water .
This Manzi post would be their argument going forward .
Here 's why they are not being intellectually honest , and Manzi 's post includes the relevant facts .
The GOP has passed what amounts to a spending and tax - cutting and borrowing stimulus package every year since George W. Bush came to office .
They have added tens of trillions to future liabilities and they turned a surplus into a trillion dollar deficit - all in a time of growth .
They then pick the one moment when demand is collapsing in an alarming spiral to argue that fiscal conservatism is non-negotiable .
I mean : seriously .
The bad faith and refusal to be accountable for their own conduct for the last eight years is simply inescapable .
There is no reason for the GOP to have done what they have done for the last eight years and to say what they are saying now except pure , cynical partisanship , and a desire to wound and damage the new presidency .
The rest is transparent cant .
There is a way to spend and borrow enough to mitigate the sudden downdraft - while working to mend long - term fiscal problems .
Manzi sets it out here :
2 . Make an at least off - setting change in future liabilities under entitlement programs .
This would include things like means - testing benefits , increasing the retirement age and making this sustainable by linking it to a longevity measure and so forth .
3 . Reduce the military budget by reducing military commitments .
The United States is increasingly a nation among nations .
This will likely become ever truer as the economic rise of the Asian heartland continues .
We need to recognize this , and scale our expenditures accordingly .
The great tragedy of the Gregg withdrawal is that this was precisely what he had been selected to achieve .
The chance of real entitlement reform - the one thing that can indeed put the US back on a path to fiscal sanity - is real in the first year of an Obama presidency .
But it will require bipartisanship ; and if a decent fiscal conservative like Gregg is simply forced by his own party to have no role in it , then it will not happen .
My sense is that this is indeed why he felt it necessary to withdraw .
The GOP is not interested in the long term fiscal health of this country .
Their reckless stewardship over the last eight years proves that .
They are not interested in helping this new president , who has done everything he can to create a civil atmosphere , to use this moment to prevent the worst in the short term and move to improve matters in the long term .
Instead , they spin .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The law experts said many anti-terror measures breached human rights Anti-terror measures worldwide have seriously undermined international human rights law , a report by legal experts says .
After a three - year global study , the International Commission of Jurists said many states used the public 's fear of terrorism to introduce measures .
These included detention without trial , illegal disappearance and torture .
It also said that the UK and the US have " actively undermined " international law by their actions .
It concluded that many measures introduced to fight terrorism were illegal and counter - productive .
It called for justice systems to be strengthened and warned that temporary measures should not become permanent .
The Geneva - based International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) is a non-governmental organisation which promotes the observance of the rule of law and the legal protection of human rights .
The panel of eminent lawyers and judges concluded that the framework of international law that existed before the 9/11 attacks on the US was robust and effective .
Lack of safeguards
But now , it said , it was being actively undermined by many states and liberal democracies like the US and the UK .
The report remarks upon the extent to which undemocratic regimes with poor human rights records have referred to counter - terror practices of countries like the US to justify their own abusive policies .
ICJ REPORT Assessing Damage , Urging Action [ 1.9 mb ]

The report will make uncomfortable reading for many in governments on both sides of the Atlantic , says BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner .
The panel said the legal systems put in place after World War II were " well - equipped to handle current terror threats " .
It said countries should use civilian legal systems to try suspects and " not resort to ad - hoc tribunals or military courts to try terror suspects " .
The report 's authors expressed concern at the lack of adequate safeguards in the use of control orders , the weakness of diplomatic assurances in relation to deportations and " excessive detention without charge " .
Public protection Britain 's pre-trial detention time limit of 28 days is one of the longest in the world .
The British Home Office said the UK faced a severe threat from terrorism .
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS
Promotes understanding and observance of international law and principles that advance human rights Founded in Berlin in 1952 Comprised of up to 60 lawyers , including senior judges , attorneys and academics Reflects geographical diversity of the world and its many legal systems Current president is Mary Robinson , former Irish president and UN Human Rights Commissioner " We recognise clearly our obligations to protect the public from terrorist atrocities whilst upholding our firm commitment to human rights and civil liberties , " it said in a statement .
" Our policies strike that balance , with new legislation facing rigorous scrutiny through external consultation and in Parliament as well as being subject to the Human Rights Act , which the UK government enacted . "
The ICJ report recommended an urgent review of counter - terrorism laws and policies to prevent serious and permanent damage to fundamental human rights principles .
Fear of terrorism
The panel reviewed counter - terrorism measures in over 40 countries , and heard from government officials , victims of terror attacks , and from people detained on suspicion of terrorism .
It found that many states have used the fear of terrorism to introduce measures which are illegal such as torture , detention without trial , and enforced disappearance .
Some of the world 's top international law experts served on the ICJ panel , including Mary Robinson , former president of Ireland and former United Nations human rights commissioner , and Arthur Chaskelson , former president of the constitutional court of south Africa .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .

More from BBC World Service Mr Chaskelson , chairman of the panel , said : " In the course of this inquiry , we have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive or abusive counter - terrorism measures in a wide range of countries around the world .
" Many governments , ignoring the lessons of history , have allowed themselves to be rushed into hasty responses to terrorism that have undermined cherished values and violated human rights .
" The result is a serious threat to the integrity of the international human rights legal framework . "
The report also called on the US administration of President Barack Obama to repeal any policies that were instigated under the " ' war on terror ' paradigm " that were inconsistent with international human rights law .
" In particular , it should renounce the use of torture and other proscribed interrogation techniques , extraordinary renditions , and secret and prolonged detention without charge or trial , " the report recommended .
It added that the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay should be closed in a " human rights compliant manner " , with inmates either released or charged .
President Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay within hours of becoming president last month , as well as ordering a review of military trials for terror suspects and a ban on harsh interrogation methods .

Kenneth Benefiel of Conklin , Mich. , bought a Swift turbine last fall , and had it installed on his 150 - year - old post - and - beam barn , now a garage and workroom , in time for Christmas .
“ I had already switched to energy efficient appliances , ” he said , reducing electricity usage by a third by buying a more efficient freezer and refrigerator and changing to fluorescent light bulbs .
“ The turbine was the next step . ”
Mr. Benefiel , who is a retired carpenter , said that in the first five weeks after its installation , the turbine produced about 60 kilowatt hours of electricity , enough to power his house for about three days .
The machine is quiet , but the old building to which it is mounted does its share of groaning in a stiff wind , he said .
So far , he is satisfied with his purchase .
“ The turbine will conserve energy , ” he said .
“ It ’s making us more self - sufficient , and we ’re doing our part to cut consumption .
You have to think not only about saving money , but about saving resources . ”
Turbines must be placed well above the roof to benefit from wind energy , said Sander Mertens in Voorburg , the Netherlands , who is a consultant in wind energy and author of “ Wind Energy in the Built Environment . ”
For a two - story building , for instance , the turbine should be at least 15 feet above the roof .
“ Put it lower , and you will suffer from small wind speeds and a lot of turbulence , ” he said .
Dr. Mertens offers a spreadsheet at his Internet site , www.ingreenious.com, that can be downloaded by people who want to do their own calculations for optimum turbine placement .
The American Wind Energy Association , a trade group in Washington , recommends placing the turbine at least 30 feet above anything in a 500 - foot radius , said Ron Stimmel , a specialist in small wind turbines at the trade group American Wind Energy Association , in Washington .
“ That way the wind can stretch its legs a bit . ”
For these taller towers , homeowners should be aware that they may have to deal with local rules prohibiting structures higher than 30 feet or so .
State and federal incentives will whittle down the price tag for many prospective buyers .
For instance , about half the states have some sort of incentive , Mr. Stimmel said .
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority , for instance , covers up to half of the homeowner ’s initial cost for a wind turbine .
Another small wind turbine for residences is the Energy Ball , to be sold in the United States by Home Energy Americas , in McKinney , Tex .
Robert Thompson , its chief executive , said he hoped to have the turbines on the market shortly .
The Energy Ball is shaped like an eggbeater placed sideways , so that its blades turn around a horizontal axis .
One model , the V100 , will cost $ 10,000 to $ 11,000 installed , he said , and will provide a maximum of 500 watts .
One way to mount it might be on a cupola , Mr. Thompson said , “ just like you would mount a weathervane . ”
I work on LangPop.com for fun .
I make a tiny bit of money from the adsense there , but nothing much to speak of .
Unlike the TIOBE folks , I do n’t sell my data to anyone .
So it can be a bit frustrating when people get all bent out of shape about the results .
A case in point was my recent article here , entitled Python “ Surpasses ” Perl ?.
In case the title was n’t a dead giveaway , I ’ll spell things out :
I was poking a bit of fun at the idea that any statistics of this nature could pinpoint , to a specific month , the moment when one language “ passes ” another .
They ’re way too fuzzy for that !
I point out that Perl is still quite popular .
According to the Freshmeat metric I was reporting , Perl actually still has more code out there than Python .
And just to be clear : I do n’t use Perl or Python or really care which one is more popular .
I mostly use Ruby these days , with Tcl , Java , and bits of C thrown in for fun .
In other words : langpop.com is not an evil conspiracy to discredit Perl .
However , I also had the temerity to suggest that Python might be a little bit more popular in terms of new things happening .
Shock !
Horror !
Well , that certainly irritated some Perl users .
They called my statistics lies , they misspelled my name ( as well as the word “ you ” , which is a lot simpler than my name by any standard ) , and some of them went off on rants that were pretty badly off target ( SourceForge is never mentioned in Langpop or this online journal ! ) .
However , not once did they really get around to answering my points , or proposing any sort of valid alternative metrics .
One of my favorite Linux / Free Software news sources , lwn.net published their 2009 predictions , and had this to say about Perl :
It will be a make - or - break year for Perl .
If the Perl developers cannot either bring new life to Perl 5 or turn Perl 6 into something real , this language will , by the end of the year , have moved well down the road to “ legacy ” status .
As can be imagined , that set them off all over again .
The mental image I get is a big angry bull , frothing at the mouth , and ready to stomp that damn red cape .
Here ’s the problem , though , guys : the cape is n’t what ’s holding you back .
Trust me , I know .
Once upon a time , when people spoke of scripting languages , they talked about “ Perl , Python and Tcl ” .
No Ruby , no PHP , although both existed .
I happen to like Tcl a lot , and it measures much worse than Perl on all the popularity charts … worse than plenty of other languages , these days .
Lately , I do n’t use it so much , but once upon a time I dedicated a lot of mental energy to wondering why things were n’t going better .
And in that community too , there were people who consistently held their fingers in their ears and yelled “ LALALALA there is no problem ! ” .
In the long term , it ’s not an effective strategy : it makes everyone but the other True Believers think you ’re going off the rails , because the evidence is plain to see that things were n’t quite like they used to be , that there are problems .
And it does n’t really address the problem in a constructive way , either .
Long term , what works is to produce good code , and get it in people ’s hands .
The most effective way of dealing with problems of this nature includes these points :
Not froth at the mouth any time you perceive a slight to your technology of choice .
Talk up the cool things you ’re working on .
Be positive , explain what ’s new and exciting .
Acknowledge reality .
For instance with Perl ( or Tcl ) , it ’s plain to anyone that they are n’t as popular as they once were .
Do n’t deny it , but focus on the fact that they ’re still widely used , and lots of new code is still written in them , and that they ’re still the focus of a lot of work to improve them .
Actually follow through .
Jon Corbet ’s ( Linux Weekly News ) point is not a bad one – you can have all the internal releases and milestones and general fun hackery that you want , but at a certain point , you need to get working code out in front of people .
This is something Ruby seems to be suffering from these days too ( as observed from afar ) – lots of next generation fiddling , and tons of good ideas and energy , but to me there is a lack of technology actually flowing my way in a timely manner .
With the possible exception of JRuby , which is making lots of progress and putting good code out there for people to use .
To conclude things , since the Perl guys were so unhappy with Freshmeat , here are some statistics from Amazon and Craigslist , comparing about a year ago with the most recent numbers :
As can be seen , both Perl and Python are dropping in Craigslist postings , but Perl is falling farther .
As a final footnote , I am sorry about this journal not accepting comments past a certain point ( 10 days is the cutoff ) – otherwise I get 100 ’s of spam postings a day .
Unfortunately , the software I ’m using did n’t deal well with alerting people to the fact that comments were closed .
I filed a bug , and they ’re working on it .
The common toad is becoming much less common in England due to a sharp increase in traffic - and road - related deaths , but with the help of Google Earth , some conservationists hope to reverse the trend .
[ social_buttons ]
Froglife , an amphibian conservation group , has mapped 700 crossings throughout the United Kingdom with a tweaked Google Earth application .
The data returns live results on toad fatalities and crossings so that the group can notify the public of areas where the animals tend to cross .
“ Google Earth software is allowing wildlife experts to use new creative ways to communicate important conservation issues to an increasingly techno - savvy public , ” said Jules Howard of Froglife .
“ We ’re delighted that more people can get involved in the Toads on Roads campaign by using this free software . ”
You do n’t need Google Earth to help out .
If you see toads crossing a road , Froglife asks that you notify their campaign here .
The common toad was listed as a threatened species in 2007 .
Froglife blames high curbs on roads for many toad deaths .
The animals ca n’t jump high enough to get out of the gutter and are eventually washed into drains where they starve to death .
The group can also dispatch their volunteer toad patrols who can help toads cross the roads safely .
In the future , Froglife hopes that Google Earth can help the government decide where to build new roads and highways .
There were conflicting reports about the circumstances : the Americans said they were returning fire from a nearby building and found the two dead men there afterward .
However , the Nineveh provincial operations center said that the policemen were at a checkpoint when the Americans suddenly opened fire .
Over all , there seemed much eagerness to vote , but also confusion .
Some voters showed up at the polling place closest to their home instead of the one they were assigned to because of the ban on driving .
Others were turned away because their names were not on voter rolls .
Voter registration is organized around a national system for delivering food rations , a holdover from the Saddam Hussein era .
Voters have to consult two lists to find out if they are registered at a given polling station .
First , each person has to find the name of his or her food ration distributor .
Then the voter must consult a much larger list of all of the families served by that distributor .
If the voter ’s name is missing , he or she can not vote at that station .
Some frustrated Iraqis gave up , while others reported going from center to center before finding the one associated with their distributor .
Nasreen Yousif , a 54 - year - old Christian , visited three polling places in the New Baghdad district of the capital but could not find her name at any of them .
“ Now I am going home , ” she said .
“ Maybe there is a fourth school , but it is too far and I ca n’t walk any more . ”
She added : “ It is obviously a mess .
If it is not a mess , where is my name ? ”
The Iraqi government and election officials blamed voters for the confusion .

Half technical , half intuitive , the design process is tough to explain .
But that s my job Im a design writer .
I write so you dont have to , putting into words the work that youd rather do than write about .
But write you must website copy , proposals , captions , emails to clients and though the worse designers are at it , the more work I get , in the spirit of collaboration I m going to share my secrets .
So what if it puts me out of a job .
What follows are five fairly broad tips to keep in mind .
Many of them will probably sound obvious .
Some of you might be following these suggestions already .
That s good , but having them explained like this will help you see what you re doing right , or simply give you a new way to think about how you re already writing .
It s by no means an exhaustive list ; add more suggestions in the comments if you want .
My goal is to get designers thinking more about writing the way writers doas a tool , a craft , and yes , an art in its own rightrather than a necessary chore .
Your training as a designer will influence your writing , and your work at turning ideas into narratives will influence your design , and who knows , that might not be a bad thing .
Pencils ready ?
Like designing , writing can straddle the line between art and craft half blinding flashes of inspiration and unexplainable moments of brilliance ( maybe a little less than half ) , and half moving words around , making and breaking sentences , typing commas then deleting them .
1 . Use your skills .
You re a designer , which means you re good at the same kinds of things writers are good at , but you use different tools .
You re a fixer : you work within constraints to find elegant solutions to complicated problems , and that s kind of what writing is , too .
So , faced with a writing task , do what you do best .
Break it down into a problem you can solve .
Ask yourself :
Whos this for ?
What s the big idea ?
What are the pieces I m using ?
What do I want to say ?
Like designing , writing can straddle the line between art and craft half blinding flashes of inspiration and unexplainable moments of brilliance ( maybe a little less than half ) , and half moving words around , making and breaking sentences , typing commas then deleting them .
Nuts and bolts stuff .
If you get too caught in one side , move to the other .
Writings about thinking big and thinking small , putting complex ideas into simple boxes , and you can do that .
2. Kill jargon .
Like any field that has to fight for relevance , design is mired in jargon .
Im talking not only about technical terms , Adobe-isms , and that sort of thing , but also verbal SUVs big , pointless words that look fancy but dont do anything .
Dialectic .
Utilization .
Orchestrate .
Dynamic .
Synthesis .
Do what Michael Pollan tells us to do with food : ask , would my grandma use this ?
If not , scrap it , and tone things down .
Remember , design is a mystery to most people .
Make it real and relatable and yes , relevant by using real and relatable words .
Read Ralph Caplans essay  Theoretically Challenged  for a sense of what I mean ( the PDF is here , thanks to SVA ) .
This is the kicker :
Unfortunately , in design , as in many other fields today , there is a strong drive to complicate description in the belief that complication in itself represents substance and depth .
So we borrow arcane language from disciplines historically associated with substance and depth .
In design the mathematical term parameter is used to mean nothing more than constraint ; the engineering term feedback is used to mean nothing more than response ; the logics term paradigm is used to mean nothing more than model ; viable ( a biological term ) is used to mean feasible .
Or , often as not , to mean nothing at all .
On a related note , think about verbs .
Designers arent usually shy about having their work say or do things , but you wouldnt know it reading some of their writing .
Often , the design for a dining table wont capture the thrill of a Medieval feast ,  say , it will strive to capture the trill or seek to capture it .
These verb - plus - infinitive constructions ( sorry for the jargon ) are just plain boring .
Dont be shy after all , if your work is only trying to do something , why should we care ?
A chair may strive to illuminate dialectics , but you probably wont talk about yourself that way .
A little informality goes a long way .
3 . Tell a story .
When you re captioning an example of your work in a portfolio or on your website , or when you re explaining your work to a client , think less about what it is , and more about how it happened .
You should be able to explain the projects main concept in a hundred words ; if you cant , you might want to rethink your design .
Focus instead on the thought process behind the work .
Why ?
First of all , its more interesting to read .
We re narrative creatures our minds are geared to ask , and then what happened ?  before they ask ,  what does it mean ? 
We want a story .
Tell us how you thought through the proposal , what you struggled with , where the epiphanies came , what changed , what didnt .
Itll make the work more personal , and more unique .
Look at how Michael Bierut explains Pentagrams redesign of the Saks Fifth Avenue identity .
But simply reinstating a 30 - year - old logo would n't be enough .
Saks was happy to emphasize its heritage , but it was even more eager to signal that it was looking to the future , a place of constant change and surprise with a consistent dedication to quality .
In our early creative sessions at Saks , wed gathered a lot of visual inspiration .
The team kept coming back to the boldness of artists like Franz Kline and Barnett Newman .
Was there a way to get that kind of dramatic scale and energy into the program ?
Which brings me to
4 . Dont be afraid to put yourself into your writing .
Use the first person , making the subject of your writing yourself , not the thing you designed .
This helps in a couple ways .
It makes you less likely to over - season your writing with fancy jargon a chair may strive to illuminate dialectics , but you probably wont talk about yourself that way .
It makes your work more personal , which makes it more interesting to read .
It also makes you , your work , and design in general , more accessible and less formal .
A little informality goes a long way .
Akiko Busch ( no , shes not a designer , she just writes about it ) is great at this .
When she writes about a vegetable peeler , say , she writes about her vegetable peeler .
it does seem apparent that the shape of the things we use , these ordinary kitchen utensils like potato peelers and cucumber slicers , can engender not only better living , but also better human behavior .
When you think of it this way , it makes all the sense in the world that the OXO vegetable peeler came into being because a man wanted to help his wife ; the result was an act of kindness disguised as a kitchen accessory .
Possibly this is what the OXO company means when it talks about making everyday living easier , and maybe this is what my sons sixth - grade teacher had in mind as well .
( from  The Uncommon Life of Common Objects  )
Michael Bierut brings himself into the explanation of that Saks bag :
Of these , one stood out , the logo drawn in 1973 by Tom Carnese , adapted from a signature introduced almost twenty years before .
In many people 's minds , this still was the Saks logo .
By coincidence , I knew it well : it was the logo that was at the heart of the identity system designed by my first boss , Massimo Vignelli , shortly before I started working for him in 1980 .
And Chip Kidd
Well , he might be the master of this technique .
Heres how he explains his cover for  Jurassic Park . 
It s all about him : what he does , what he thinks .
A bit of an ego ?
Yeah , OK .
But it s damn entertaining to read .
Notice how hes concerned more with the narrative of the process than trying to ( striving to ? ) puff up big ideas .
We needed a dinosaur , but how to render one without making it look like a pulp magazine ?
Somehow we had to show it without showing it . [ ]
On the stat machine I blew up a diagram of a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton , laid a sheet of vellum over it , and traced it with a Rapidiograph mechanical pen .
As I went along , I selectively obscured parts of it , so the effect was more like that of an x-ray in reverse .
To give it as much of a sense of menace as possible , I sharpened the teeth , the claws , the ribs .
I also cheated  the holes in the head a bit to give a clearer sense of where the eyes and nose would be .
( from  Chip Kidd : Book One .  )
5 . Finally , and most importantly , dont say too much .
Theres a lot of fluff in design writing , a lot of bullshit .
When describing the narrative of a project , if you dont have a reason for making a certain choice ( if the only reason was it looked good ) , then be honest .
Or make a different choice that has a better story behind it .
What you absolutely shouldnt do , is make something up to justify and aggrandize your work .
Typically , you can and should cut ten percent of all the words you write .
So spare us all , and keep it simple .
On that note , heres a wrap - up : write about yourself , write a story , write real words , dont write too much .
And if all else fails , hire me .

He lives in New York .
I realized that my previous article regarding the Minnesota Senate Election Contest Court 's Tuesday rulings may have been vague , as well as incomplete .
I want to take this opportunity to clarify those rulings with respect to previous and future events .
To begin I 'd like to restate the pertinent information from Tuesday 's rulings :
The above - entitled matter came before the Court upon a Motion in Limine by Contestee Al Franken to Limit Absentee - Ballot Evidence to Ballots Pleaded in the Notice of Contest .
The Court having read the arguments of counsel , and based upon the files , records , and proceedings herein , makes the following : ORDER 1 .
Contestee A1 Franken 's Motion in Limine to Limit Absentee - Ballot Evidence to Ballots Pleaded in the Notice of Contest is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows : a .
The scope of this trial shall be limited to the following : i. Absentee ballots where it is claimed that the voter complied with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes § 203B.12 , subd , 2. ii .
Absentee ballots where it is claimed that the voter 's non-compliance with Minnesota Statutes § 2038.12 , subd .
2 was not due to fault on behalf of the voter .
b. Contestants estimate the total number of these ballots to be 4,797 .
c. Contestants are limited to presenting evidence on only those ballots that were specifically disclosed to Contestee on or before January 23,2009 .
2 . Any other relief not specifically provided herein is DENIED .
3 . The attached memorandum is incorporated herein by reference .
[ From the attached Memorandum ] [ I ] n order for Contestee to be given a fair opportunity to meet the asserted claims , Contestants are limited .
to the individual voters whose ballots they believed were wrongly rejected prior to the commencement of trial , Contestants , therefore , are limited to presenting evidence on only those ballots that were specifically disclosed to Contestee by name as of January 23 , 2009 .

At this juncture , the Election Contest Court will only consider absentee ballots that are contained within the area specified by the above order in sections 1.a.i. and 1.a.ii ; section 1.c also applies , but only to the Contestant , Norm Coleman .
This order only applies to absentee ballots , it does not affect the double counting issue or any other anomaly .
I 've created an Euler Diagram below that illustrates the now restricted universe of absentee ballots , as the above order applies to Norm Coleman :
C1 .
This circle represents the initial list of some 12,000 absentee ballots that are currently rejected ; the Coleman campaign presented a Motion for Summary Judgment requesting that these 12,000 ballots be opened , counted and certified .
As of yesterday , their motion was denied :
The above - entitled matter came on for hearing before the Court on January 23 , 2009 , upon Contestants ' " Motion for Summary Judgment .
Counsel noted their appearances on the record .
The Court having heard and read the arguments of counsel , and based upon the files , records , and proceedings herein , makes the following : ORDER 1 . Contestants ' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED .
2 . Any other relief not specifically ordered herein is DENIED .
3 . The attached Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference .
Source : Order on Contestants ' Motion for Summary Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
C2 . Represents the 4,797 absentee ballots as estimated within section 1.b by the Coleman campaign .
The ruling in 1.b does not apply to the Franken campaign in any way shape or form because the request was filed by Franken requesting restrictions upon Coleman .
The Coleman campaign did not append any requests to Franken 's motion , as they are allowed to do , requesting restrictions on Franken .
If there was no request for restrictions , restrictions cannot be created .
C3 .
This circle explicitly outlines section 1.c , although the exact number of presentable ballots remains unclear .
The best guess I can provide stems from the original election contest filing ; on page 36 the document reads , " the Coleman campaign contends that there are 654 [ rejected absentee ] ballots , in addition to those identified by local election officials , that should be examined . "
The Coleman campaign disclosed at least 654 specific , rejected absentee ballots before the January 23rd deadline .
C4 .
This circle deals with the future tense and represents the ballots which will be explicitly presented as evidence to the court by Norm Coleman .
Franken will be allowed to file rebuttal evidence on any ballot Coleman presents to the court within this subset .
C5 .
This final circle represents the final number of currently rejected absentee ballots that will eventually be counted that were originally presented by Coleman .
The Election Contest Court uses the adversarial legal system ; each side presents their side of the issue and in doing so both sides are represented .
This , in theory , ensures that each ballot , presented by either side , receives fair consideration .
Coleman 's side is very well established , while Franken 's is less understood .
To begin defining Franken 's outer circle , I will make an assumption ; Franken wants to maximize the ratio between potentially rejected absentee ballots and potential Franken votes .
In other words , Franken would n't submit a rejected absentee ballot if it is more likely to contain a vote for Coleman ; the burden is on Coleman to ensure that each ballot cast for Coleman is considered in accordance with the ECC .
The document below was presented by Franken on January 12th in response to Coleman 's election contest filing ; pay close attention to the specifically referenced absentee ballots that were rejected :
INTRODUCTION Contestee , Al Franken ( " Franken " ) , certified as having been chosen as United States Senator by the people of Minnesota in the November 4 , 2008 , election ( " Election " ) , files this Answer to the Notice of Contest ( " Notice " ) filed by Contestees Norm Coleman and Cullen Sheehan ( collectively , " Coleman " ) .
...
FIRST COUNTERCLAIM
[ Page 21 of 565 ] LAWFULLY CAST ABSENTEE BALLOTS REJECTED BY COLEMAN 3 .
Although Franken agreed with local election officials that many of the absentee ballots on the list of 1,346 ballots were obviously erroneously rejected , Coleman 's campaign objected to the opening and counting of many such ballots .
In Duluth , in S1 .
Louis County , Coleman refused to allow 35 absentee ballots , identified below , to be counted solely because the dates of the signatures of the voter and witness were not the same : [ Table of 35 absentee voters from 11 Duluth precincts in St. Louis County ] ...
SECOND COUNTERCLAIM
[ Page 23 of 565 ] ERRONEOUSLY REJECTED ABSENTEE BALLOTS
5 . Franken has identified a large number of absentee ballots that were rejected in error by election judges and local election officials , and which were not included on the list of 1,346 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots created by local election officials , and were not counted as part of the recount .
In Exhibit D , for each voter identified below , Franken attaches declarations from each voter and / or other supporting documentation demonstrating that local election officials rejected each ballot in error .
[ Table of 86 absentee voters from 79 precincts , across 20 counties ]
THIRD COUNTERCLAIM [ Page 26 of 565 ] MISSING BALLOTS 6 .
In a number of precincts not selected by Coleman , ballots went missing between Election Day and the recount .
Under Minnesota case law , a ballot serves as the best evidence of a vote .
But when ballots are missing , or their integrity is otherwise compromised , election officials must turn to the next best evidence : here , the vote totals provided by election officials on Election Day .
Where , as here , actual ballots cast on Election Day cannot be found , local election officials must submit - and the State Canvassing Board must accept - the Election Day return as reflecting the proper tally of votes for purposes of the canvass , the recount , and the Board 's certification of the results under Minn .
Stat . § 204C.33 . ... 8 . Similarly , ballots went missing during the course of the recount from the following precincts and were not adjusted for , resulting in a net loss of votes for Franken : [ A total of 16 precincts were listed , across 9 counties totaling 55 votes ; the individual ballots are not explicitly listed ] ...
FOURTH COUNTERCLAIM
[ Page 27 of 565 ] COUNTING OF ORIGINAL AND DUPLICATE BALLOTS 9 .
If and when Coleman is allowed to and does identify the " numerous precincts throughout the State of Minnesota , " and proves that irregularities did , in fact occur during the recount , Franken reserves the right to identify additional precincts in which the numbers of original ballots and duplicate ballots were not identical and propose procedures whereby all identified precincts are treated uniformly with respect to inspection and relief , if any , ordered by the Court .
10 .
Coleman gained votes in the recount in certain precincts where the increase is as likely due to counting of original and duplicate ballots as in the precincts identified by Coleman .
Those precincts are : [ A total of 12 precincts were listed , across 6 counties totaling 34 votes ; the individual ballots are not explicitly listed ]
FIFTH COUNTERCLAIM [ Page 28 of 565 ] ILLEGAL VOTES 11 .
Under Minn. Stat. § 201.014 , subd .
2 , individuals convicted of felonies whose civil rights have not been restored are ineligible to vote .
Under Minn. Stat . § 204C .13 , if election judges determine that a voter is not eligible to vote , they must place the ballot of that voter unopened among the spoiled ballots .
... EXHIBIT E [ Page 545 of 565 ] Lawfully Cast Absentee Ballots That Were Not Counted [ A list of 673 voter 's names is detailed along with the precinct and county in which they voted ]
Source : Contestee 's Answer and Counterclaims via MNCourts.gov [ PDF , 17.3 MB ]
The above document lists 794 specific voters who cast absentee ballots that were rejected , and still remain uncounted .
I think it is fair to assume that Franken 's outer circle roughly encompasses these 794 specific voters , as listed directly above , who cast absentee ballots .
From this list we can construct an Euler Diagram of Franken 's absentee ballot universe :
F1 . This circle represents at least the aforementioned 794 specific absentee ballots , but this number may , and probably will change , as evidenced in this motion filed by Franken on February 4th :
MOTION Contestee Al Franken moves for leave to amend his Answer and Counterclaims in light of the Court 's Order dated February 3 , 2009 , allowing Contestants to pursue claims involving approximately 4,800 absentee ballots .
Specifically , Contestee intends to amend his counterclaims to reflect his continuing review and analysis of the approximately 11,000 rejected absentee ballots .
Among other things , Contestee will further refine Exhibit E to the Second Counterclaim , eliminating some ballots and adding others .
Source : Contestee 's Motion to Amend Answer and Counterclaims via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The Franken filing does not however reference any specific changes and for this reason it is likely to fail .
The Coleman campaign has yet to file a response .
F2 . The Election Contest Court has yet to determine the number of ballots from Franken 's list , estimated at 794 , that qualify for consideration under 1.a. i and 1.aii .
It is possible that F2 is a subset of C2 , but the information expressed in 1.b is somewhat unclear .
Are there 4,797 total absentee ballots meeting the requirements expressed in 1.a. i and 1.aii , or are there 4,797 absentee ballots that Coleman has cherry picked that meet the restrictions ?
If the first statement is true then F2 is a subset of C2 , otherwise it is not and the total universe of considerable rejected absentee is whatever Franken 's list is determined to be plus the 4,797 in which Coleman is already restricted .
F3 .
This region represents the number of ballots that are eligible for future consideration and may be presented as evidence .
Coleman will be allowed to file rebuttal evidence on any ballot Franken presents to the court within this subset .
F4 . These are the ballots that will eventually be presented to the Election Contest Court as evidence .
Like C4 , this region is not explicitly defined , although the aforementioned 794 will likely be eligible .
F5 .
This final circle represents the final number of currently rejected absentee ballots that will eventually be counted that were originally presented by Franken .
If we put everything together , the set of all ballots , that will eventually be counted as a result of the Election Contest Litigation is shown below :
It remains to be seen how these various sets of ballots will be counted but the review will not be done on a ballot by ballot basis .
The court will likely request an election inspector to examine all ballots in a certain subset if the Coleman campaign is able to prove that there were inconsistencies when applying election statutes or if there were generic equal protection violations .
In any case , the Election Contest continues and the burden still lies upon the Coleman campaign .
Full Disclosure :
The empirical information is authoritatively correct , but my interpretation of the legal proceedings may not be accurate .
If you notice any legal fallacies , please alert me of my error ; I am not a legal expert , but I have thoroughly researched the preceding article .
I know .
I know .
I 'm trying to move on .
But if you are in any way still interested in the weird lies of Sarah Palin , and have n't yet figured out what the hell happened last year , this email exchange published yesterday between Pat Dougherty , editor of the great Anchorage Daily News , and governor Palin , is fascinating .
For some reason , governor Palin fired off an email to the editor furious that the ADN had run an AP story that stated that her kinda - son - in - law was a high school drop - out .
It 's classic Palin : she insists that Levi Johnston is not a high school drop - out , even though , in the actual world the rest of us live in , he is .
Dougherty handles that issue with hilarious dead - pan .
But the fascinating part of the email exchange - and one that will no doubt interest Dish readers - is the following .
( The emails are divided up into sections , but the whole thing can be read here . )
PALIN : [ I ]s your paper really still pursuing the sensational lie that I am not Trig 's mother ?
Is it true you have a reporter still bothering my state office , my very busy doctor ( who 's already set the record straight for you ) , and the school district , in pursuit of your ridiculous conspiracy ?
You may have been too busy with the campaign to notice , but the Daily News has , from the beginning , dismissed the conspiracy theories about Trig 's birth as nonsense .
I do n't believe we have ever published in the newspaper a story , a letter , a column or anything alleging a coverup about your maternity .
In fact , my integrity and the integrity of the newspaper have been repeatedly attacked in national forums for our complicity in the " coverup . "
I have personally received more than a 100 emails accusing me and the paper of conspiring to hide the truth .
( I should note , however , that many people who commented on adn.com have alleged a coverup .
Many of those were deleted as soon as we saw them , but many were not . )
I want to be very clear on this : I have from the beginning and do now consider the conspiracy theories about Trig 's birth to be nutty nonsense .
If that 's true , then why has Lisa Demer been asking questions about Trig 's birth ?
Because we have been amazed by the widespread and enduring quality of these rumors .
I finally decided , after watching this go on unabated for months , to let a reporter try to do a story about the " conspiracy theory that would not die " and , possibly , report the facts of Trig 's birth thoroughly enough to kill the nonsense once and for all .
Lisa Demer started reporting .
I do n't believe she received any cooperation in her efforts from the parties who , in my judgment , stood to benefit most from the story , namely you and your family .
Even so , we reported the matter as thoroughly as we could .
Several weeks ago , when we considered the information Lisa had gathered , we decided we did n't have enough of a story to accomplish what we had hoped .
Lisa moved on to other topics and we have n't decided whether the idea is worth any further effort .
Even the birth of your grandson may not dissuade the Trig conspiracy theorists from their beliefs .
It strikes me that if there is never a clear , contemporaneous public record of what transpired with Trig 's birth that may actually ensure that the conspiracy theory never dies .
Time will tell .
PALIN : And , oh , I could go on . . .
DOUGHERTY : Governor , I would encourage you to go on .
I cannot address your concerns if I do not hear them .
Perhaps after reading this you will conclude that the facts are not exactly as you thought , or that there was more to these issues than you knew .
I hope you see that we have tried hard to practice sound journalism .
We may have trusted the accuracy of the AP too much , but I wo n't know that for sure until you confirm that Levi will graduate from high school .
When we heard that you were upset about Lisa 's inquiries , we immediately extended an invitation to your office for you to meet with me and other editors so we could explain our interest in the Trig matter , and answer any other questions you might have .
As far as I know , that invitation was never acknowledged .
We remain willing and available to meet with you to discuss these or any other issues .
I would be happy to meet with you one on one , as would Pat Doyle , or as part of any group of editors and publisher you would like .
Based on our experience , I do not think it would be constructive to include Bill McAllister , but that 's up to you .
If I have not addressed your concerns fully enough , please let me know .
Sincerely , Pat Dougherty
The duo reunited on Friday night at the end of a Paul Simon concert in New York
By Liam Allen
Entertainment reporter , BBC News
Simon and Garfunkel are planning to tour together for the first time in five years , Art Garfunkel has said .
The singer revealed the plans five days after making a surprise appearance at a Paul Simon concert in New York where the pair performed three songs .
" Our plan to work together is coming together but it does n't go through England this time , " he told BBC News .
Garfunkel , 67 , would not confirm if the tour would be in the US .
The duo last toured together in 2003 and 2004 .
Their 2003 concerts marked their first US tour in 20 years .
On Friday night , Simon and Garfunkel performed together to rapturous applause at a concert to mark the reopening the Beacon Theater after refurbishment .
Worldwide success Simon was joined on stage at the end of his concert by Garfunkel for the last three songs of the night - The Sounds of Silence , The Boxer and Old Friends .
Garfunkel , who performed solo shows in Florida on Thursday and Saturday nights , said : " It had a real reaction - it was extraordinary .
" It was extraordinary so I squeezed that in and did a lot of running around in the last week .
" Just a hell of a knockout of a reaction .
" I said to the audience , ' you do n't have a right to expect - and we did n't expect - that the interest in us would last and you would still care right to today and I 'm touched ' . "
Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon met at school in New York Simon and Garfunkel had worldwide success with songs including Bridge Over Troubled Water , Mrs Robinson and Scarborough Fair .
The duo have famously fallen out on a number of occasions since they first made music together as school friends in New York in the 1950s .
They split up in 1970 , reuniting in 1981 for an open - air concert in New York 's Central Park and playing Wembley Stadium the following year .
The pair did not play together again until 1993 , when they got together for a series of concerts in New York .
They reunited at the Grammys in 2003 - their first public performance in 10 years - where they played The Sounds of Silence and were presented with a lifetime achievement award .
That led to their US tour of 2003 and a further string of dates , including some in Europe , the following year .

Editor ’s note :
The following article is drawn from a long - form analysis of the history of the Iranian nuclear program in the Bulletin ’s January / February 2009 edition .
That analysis can be found here .
Today , most of the debate about Iran concerns the purpose of its ongoing nuclear activities .
But Tehran ’s interest in nuclear technology dates back more than 30 years to when Shah Mohammed Rez Pahlavi sought a “ full - fledged nuclear power industry ” with the capacity to produce 23,000 megawatts of electricity .
Although the Shah sought nuclear power to help turn Iran into a powerful modern state , the program ’s size and some of its objectives raised questions in Washington about a nuclear proliferation risk .
In addition , despite the Shah ’s claims that he did n’t want to build a nuclear weapon , his regime ’s interest in reprocessing plutonium and its insistence on a “ full right ” to reprocess raised apprehensions .
To achieve his goal , the Shah wanted to buy nuclear reactors from the United States ( as well as Western Europe ) , but U.S. presidents would n’t approve the sales without conditions limiting his freedom of action to use U.S. - supplied resources .
After protracted negotiations , Iran and Washington did reach an agreement , only to be derailed by the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
From the very beginning , proliferation concerns shaped the U.S. approach toward negotiations with Iran .
The 1974 Indian nuclear test had caught the Nixon administration by surprise , and when Gerald Ford became president shortly thereafter , his administration looked more closely at the risks of nuclear proliferation .
The Ford administration reasoned that a world with more nuclear powers would be more unstable :
The danger of war would increase ; U.S. influence would ebb as nuclear weapons gave “ nations a sense of greater independence ” ; and dangers of “ subnational theft and blackmail ” would increase .
That India had produced weapon - grade plutonium from a Canadian - supplied reactor meant that nuclear exports could never again be considered as simply commercial matters .
While past U.S. presidents had aligned themselves closely with the Shah–his dictatorial rule and human rights abuses notwithstanding –Washington did n’t take on faith his disavowals of nuclear weapons .
Indeed , the Shah had said that he could revisit his stance if other powers in the region developed nuclear capabilities .
To limit the possibility that a close ally such as Iran could go nuclear , the U.S. government wanted to create significant constraints on any commercial or technical nuclear assistance that it provided .
Washington was especially worried about the Shah ’s interest in a reprocessing facility that could provide Iran with weapon - grade plutonium .
But the Ford administration had a problem in that it wanted to impose tighter restrictions on Iran than Washington had required in agreements with other countries .
Recognizing that an “ overly receptive U.S. reaction ” to Iranian interest in reprocessing could weaken efforts to discourage it in Pakistan and elsewhere , U.S. officials wanted to seek a virtual veto of Iranian reprocessing of U.S. - supplied reactor fuel .
As such , they pressed Tehran to accept a multinational reprocessing center to avoid an Iranian domestic capability .
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also became interested in a “ buyback ” option so that the United States could acquire spent fuel rods from Iranian reactors .
With buyback , Kissinger believed , Washington could ensure that any reprocessing occurred in the United States , not Iran .
Not unsurprisingly , the Iranians criticized U.S. efforts to limit their freedom of action .
Rejecting “ second - class citizen [ ship ] ” and a U.S. veto of Iranian reprocessing of U.S. - supplied spent fuel , Akbar Etemad , the chairman of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , argued that Iran should have the “ full right to decide whether to reprocess or otherwise dispose or treat the materials provided under the agreement . ”
Nevertheless , the Iranians became interested in the buyback option .
But the 1976 election and Ford ’s electoral defeat put the talks on hold until President Jimmy Carter came to power .
In its last months , the Ford administration , partly responding to criticisms from the Carter campaign , took an even more restrictive approach to reprocessing anywhere , even domestically , because of the proliferation risks .
Recognizing the trend , in early 1977 , Etemad publicly renounced interest in reprocessing –although U.S. observers wondered whether Tehran was spinning them .
In any event , significant policy statements by Carter and congressional action on the Nonproliferation Act produced a tougher U.S. government approach toward reprocessing .
During the second half of 1977 , the Shah and Carter administration reopened the nuclear negotiations , and by mid-1978 the two sides had initialed an agreement .
The Shah ’s regime , however , was beginning its descent , and neither Carter nor the Shah would ever sign it .
As in the 1976 draft , the agreement retained a U.S. veto on reprocessing , but in light of Carter ’s tougher approach on that issue , it did n’t include options for buyback or a multinational plant .
Iran ’s spent fuel could be reprocessed in Western Europe , but only if the material could n’t be stored in Iran , the United States , or Europe .
All options would be “ subject to U.S. law which includes determination of no significant increase in the risk of proliferation associated with approvals for reprocessing . ”
It would be possible to return recovered plutonium in the form of fabricated fuel to Iran , but only “ under arrangements which are deemed to be more proliferation resistant than those which currently exist . ”
Although part of the agreement ’s purpose was to constrain Iran ’s freedom of action , apparently the Shah and his advisers believed that such conditions were the price of the nuclear reactors and , presumably , good relations with Washington .
Even as the Shah ’s regime weakened , Iranian officials were bullish about their country ’s nuclear prospects telling a local Westinghouse representative that they wanted to work with the U.S. nuclear industry and that “ the bilateral would certainly not be scrapped . ”
Nevertheless , when the regime collapsed so did Iran ’s nuclear relations with the West .
The apprehensions about nuclear proliferation in the region that may have encouraged the Shah to consider a nuclear option for the long run did n’t vanish with his overthrow .
The same nationalism that emphasized Iran ’s “ full right ” to reprocess and rejected “ second - class ” status foreshadowed Iran ’s present - day claims about nuclear “ rights ” under the NPT .
Moreover , U.S. enmity toward Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution significantly increased the regime ’s interest in nuclear deterrence .
Understanding the background to Iran ’s quest for nuclear power wo n’t automatically produce better negotiating positions , but a better grasp of the motivations at play in Tehran and their long history may help if negotiations are to succeed .
An imaging analysis technique developed to find defects in semiconductors is being used to diagnose the eye problems associated with diabetes over the internet .
Pictures of diabetic patients ' retinas , the inner surface of the eye , are uploaded to a server that compares them to a database of thousands of other images of healthy and diseased eyes .
Algorithms can assign a disease level to the new eye image by looking at the same factors , mainly damage to blood vessels , that an eye doctor would .
Right now , ophthalmologist Edward Chaum of the University of Tennessee double checks the system 's work , but he expects the algorithms to be diagnosing patients on its own within three months .
" At that point , the system becomes completely automated with just oversight from me , " Chaum said .
" That 's unique .
There is n't anything like that going on anywhere in the world . "
Chaum 's work goes beyond telemedicine , in which physicians connect to patients through data networks , to automated medicine .
There are huge advantages to the system : Chaum is expensive , while a bit of computer processing power is cheap .
Also , like other telemedicine systems , it moves images over the internet , instead of patients through a health care network , which is easier for everyone involved .
Patients get faster , cheaper care and doctors can spend their time treating patients that computers have already spotted as needing help .
Increasing acceptance of these types of technologies could mean better medical care for people in areas of the country and world in which access to doctors is limited .
" We do n't want to manage the patients , we want to manage the images [ of their eyes ] and leverage the power of the connectivity of the internet and image analysis methods , " Chaum said .
" We collect large numbers of images and manage that data and do the screening through data processing . "
More than 25 million Americans suffer from diabetes , which , if left untreated , can cause blindness , among other physical problems .
The huge numbers of people who need to be screened for diabetes - linked eye problems have created a problem that our health care system , and its relatively small number of ophthalmologists , is not well - structured to solve .
Because of the time and expense involved , only half the people who should be getting screened so they wo n't go blind actually go in for tests .
But new technology could help , reducing the cost and increasing the availability of screening for the eye problems that impair the vision of thousands of patients each year .
In the rural , poor areas of the Mississippi Delta where the special internet - linked retinal cameras are being installed , preventative care could be transformed for a population in which diabetes affects up to 20 percent of the population .
" Basically , we 're putting these cameras in communities in which there are no eye doctors , " Chaum said .
" Certainly , there are no retina specialists who can diagnose and refer those patients in a way that makes sense to get them in for the care that they need at the time that they need it . "
The project spun out of a chance visit by Chaum to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee .
He listened to Ken Tobin , an engineer at the lab , who 'd developed the image - processing ideas for the semiconductor industry .
In that world , they 'd used huge databases filled with images of defective products to help engineers spot similar types of failures .
As Tobin described his work looking for defects in the wafers to the visiting Tennessee faculty , Chaum realized the same image - recognition system could be geared to find diseased eyes by using his huge database of retinal pictures ( like those at the top of this story ) .
" As he was describing his methodology to me , it became very clear that what he was doing was exactly what I do as a physician when I 'm examining a patient with diabetic retinopathy , " Chaum said .
" I look for specific features that are present in that retina and I go into my own [ mental ] library — thousands and thousands of patients I 've seen over the eyars — to say , ' This is diabetic retinopathy of a certain level . ' "
After several years of collaboration , Chaum has successfully transferred that knowledge from his brain into the server that does the calculations .
" The computer is a reflection of my perspective , " Chaum said .
Now , Tobin claims that the system correctly identifies between 90 and 98 percent of the diabetic patients , tagging patients on a scale from healthy to severe versions of the disease .
" We 're looking for lesions .
They are like the defects on a semiconductor device .
White spots or dark spots , " Tobin said .
" By finding those and knowing how many there are , and certain combinations of bright and dark lesions , we can tell not just whether they have the disease but how bad it is . "
The retinal images are particularly well - suited for analysis by computers .
Tobin describes them as nearly two - dimensional with well - defined areas of light and dark .
Other areas of the body are tougher .
Mammograms and lung X - rays , for example , look at areas with more depth and less well - defined disease indicators .
" In a chest x-ray , you are looking for things that are sort of cloud - shaped amongst other cloud - shaped objects , " Tobin said .
" It 's not really something where it's at a point where it could replace an oncologist or radiologist . "
That 's why automated diagnosis faces an uphill battle for widespread acceptance in the health care industry .
The presence of a doctor just seems necessary — and institutions are loathe to take chances with a computer misdiagnosis when doctors do a generally adequate job .
It does n't help automated diagnosis that , as described in a review article on the use of computers in diagnosis , early missteps led many medical practitioners to write off the technique based on outdated technology from the previous decades .
One doctor wrote , " We do not see much promise in the development of computer programs to simulate the decision - making of a physician . "
The other big hurdle is that insurance companies require a doctor 's sign - off for reimbursement .
Practically , that 's a deal - breaker for most clinics .
Chaum and Tobin 's automated system could be groundbreaking in providing the first in - the - field test of an automated diagnostic system that the pair are confident will work .
That could turn some heads in the medical field and get more doctors thinking about how to treat more patients for less money by using technology .
" What we 're trying to show is that at least in a screening environment , we can take the ophthalmologist out of the loop , " Tobin said .

Today programme
Divorced last year , 30 - year - old Amina is slowly rebuilding her confidence .
Polygamy is not outlawed under Islamic law During the 10 years of her marriage , the mother of three says her husband tried to force her to accept his taking another wife .
She resisted , even though he said that it was the right thing to do in Islam , their shared religion .
" There was tremendous amounts of pressure from him , " she says .
" It drops your confidence - you feel worthless , unworthy of someone 's companionship .
A failure as a wife , a failure as a person . "
Even though she said no , she still has no idea whether he married someone else without telling her .
Mission impossible
The rules within Islam are strictly defined and make it virtually impossible for a man to take more than one wife .
A man should only marry women who are divorced , widowed , ill or if his first wife cannot have children .
A husband has to treat each wife equally , down to the time , money and emotional support he gives them .
In this country one married man is allowed to marry one woman .
That must be the way for everybody who lives in this country
Baroness Sayeda Warsi Polygamy is illegal under UK law , but religious marriages are not registered and so are not legally valid - a man might marry his first wife in a civil ceremony and then marry someone else in a religious one .
There are no official figures on the number of people in polygamous marriages in Britain , but Zlakha Ahmed , a project manager of Apna Haq , a woman 's support service based in Rotherham , says that the number of polygamous marriages is growing .
In her experience , it is younger British - born Muslim men who are the driving force for the increase in numbers .
She says that women under pressure to enter into polygamous relationships often do not have anyone to turn to for help and that this can lead to mental health problems .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Religious figures within the Muslim community are also concerned about the number of men practicing polygamy .
Mufti Barkatullah , a member of a UK Sharia Council , says he sees over 20 cases every year of women experiencing polygamy - related problems .
" Islamic law is very clear that it has to be done in the context of fairness , justice and fulfilling the duties , and in a situation where there is a dire need , " he says .
According to Mr Barkatullah , the rules are so strict that practicing polygamy is '' mission impossible ' ' in most cases .
The really positive point is that I know I have time for myself
Doha , wife in a polygamous marriage " They end up violating Sharia law - committing gross inequality and injustices with their various spouses , neglecting their duties towards their dependents and committing forgery , hypocrisy and constant lies , " he says .
According to Mufti Barkatullah , Imams are misled by men who do not admit to having other wives .
My co-wife
But some women say that if practiced according to the strict guidelines of Islam , polygamy can be a positive experience and the answer to many women 's needs .
Doha , a 47 - year - old who has been in a polygamous marriage for 15 years , was divorced with four children when she met her husband and agreed to be his second wife .
Both wives know each other , but have separate houses and lives .
Polygamy is often associated with religious groups in the US Her husband spends alternative nights with each of his wives , and is equal in his financial support - although he does not buy exactly the same luxuries for each wife .
" Maybe I would prefer to have books and my sister wife , my co-wife , would prefer to have a dress bought for her , " says Doha .
" The really positive point is that I know I have time for myself .
I know that if I want to work or study , to have friends come around or to visit people to go away on holiday that I can do that , I have that time in my life . "
But for Baroness Sayeda Warsi , shadow minister for community cohesion , the loophole that allows multiple religious marriages is a legal anomaly that needs looking at .
" We have just avoided discussing or dealing with this matter head on , " she says .
" There has to be a culture change .
That culture change has to be brought about by policy makers taking a very clear stance on this issue .
" In this country one married man is allowed to marry one woman .
That is the way and that must be the way for everybody who lives in this country . "

Obama expands US military intervention in Pakistan
By Barry Grey
23 February 2009
The Obama administration is significantly expanding the US military role in Pakistan beyond that pursued by the Bush administration , directly employing US military force against anti-government Pakistani guerrillas involved only marginally , if at all , in attacks on US forces in neighboring Afghanistan , according to a front - page article published February 21 by the New York Times .
The article , entitled “ Obama Expands Missile Strikes Inside Pakistan ” and authored by Mark Mazzetti and White House correspondent David E. Sanger , cites two separate missile strikes inside Pakistan carried out February 14 and February 16 as evidence that “ the Obama administration has expanded the covert war run by the Central Intelligence Agency inside Pakistan , attacking a militant network seeking to topple the Pakistani government . ”
The Times reports that the strikes , carried out by drone aircraft , are the first to target alleged training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud , an Islamist insurgent leader identified early last year by both American and Pakistani officials as the orchestrator of the assassination of then - Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , the wife of Pakistan ’s current president and Pakistan People ’s Party leader Asif Ali Zardari .
“ Under President Bush , ” the article states , “ the United States frequently attacked militants from Al Qaeda and the Taliban involved in cross - border attacks in Afghanistan , but had stopped short of raids aimed at Mr. Mehsud and his followers , who have played less of a direct role in attacks on American troops . ”
As the article indicates , the missile strikes on Mehsud ’s forces represent a qualitative expansion of the US war in the region , with the American military now directly intervening into internal Pakistani conflicts to bolster Washington ’s client regime in Islamabad .
The strikes against Mehsud came in the same week that Obama announced a major military escalation in Afghanistan , ordering an additional 17,000 US troops into the country .
They also came within days of talks in Pakistan between top political , military and intelligence officials there and Richard Holbrooke , Obama ’s special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Holbrooke also met with officials in Afghanistan and India .
The Times notes that in a telephone interview last Friday , Holbrooke declined to comment on the strikes against Mehsud , and that the White House and the CIA similarly refused to comment .
The newspaper reports that Bush had included Mehsud ’s name “ in a classified list of military leaders whom the CIA and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill . ”
It says the February 14 strike was aimed “ specifically ” at Mehsud , but failed to kill him .
The February 16 raid , it states , targeted a camp run by a top aide to Mehsud .
Earlier reports said each of the strikes killed 30 people .
The article continues : “ For months , Pakistani military and intelligence officials have complained about Washington ’s refusal to strike at Baitullah Mehsud , even while CIA drones struck at Qaeda figures and leaders of the network run by Jalaluddin Haqqani , a militant leader believed responsible for a campaign of violence against American troops in Afghanistan . ”
The article suggests that the US has initiated attacks on Mehsud and his followers , in part , to induce the Pakistani regime to intensify its military operations against Taliban , Al Qaeda and other Islamist insurgent groups based in Pakistani tribal regions on the border with Afghanistan .
“ By striking at the Mehsud network , ” it states , “ the United States may be seeking to demonstrate to Mr. Zardari that the new administration is willing to go after the insurgents of greatest concern to the Pakistani leader . ”
It then alludes to the deteriorating military and security situation of the Pakistani regime , which faces growing insurgencies in tribal regions that border on Afghanistan as well as the Taliban takeover of the Swat Valley in the more settled North West Frontier Province , and suggests that “ American officials may also be prompted by growing concern that the militant attacks are increasingly putting the civilian government of Pakistan , a nation with nuclear weapons , at risk . ”
The Times article also states that the US is continuing to carry out Special Forces operations on the ground inside Pakistan , in addition to its stepped - up missile attacks .
Last September , US Special Forces troops attacked a Pakistani village in South Waziristan , part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) in the Pakistani northwest border region with Afghanistan , killing between 15 and 20 people , including women and children .
That assault , the first clear case of an attack by US ground troops inside Pakistani territory , evoked condemnations from the government in Islamabad .
According to the February 21 Times article however , “ American Special Operations troops based in Afghanistan have also carried out a number of operations into Pakistan ’s tribal areas since early September , when a commando raid that killed a number of militants was publicly condemned by Pakistani officials .
According to a senior American military official , the commando missions since September have been primarily to gather intelligence . ”
Additional evidence of a major extension of the US war into Pakistan is the revelation that at least some of the US drones used to fire missiles into Pakistani border regions , killing scores of civilians are inflaming local anger , are operating from a base inside Pakistan itself .
Earlier this month , Senator Dianne Feinstein , the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , spoke of the existence of the base at a Senate hearing .
The Pakistani government has denied the existence of the base , but the London Times and the Pakistani News have both published Google Earth images of three drones parked at the Shamsi air field in southwestern Pakistan .
Obama has made it clear that his administration ’s response to the growth of insurgent Afghan forces and the worsening security situation facing the US and its puppet regime in Afghanistan , as well as the growing strength of anti-US and anti-government insurgents in Pakistan , is an expansion of American military violence both in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The White House and the military are treating both countries as part of a single military theater .
The administration is conducting a review of its strategy in the region , which is to be completed by the beginning of April .
This week , the US is hosting a high - level conference in Washington on the Afghan - Pakistan border region , which will be attended by Gates , Holbrooke , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Pakistan is sending its foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , its army chief , Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and the head of its military intelligence service , Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha .
Afghanistan is sending foreign minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta .
However , Obama , Gates and the military chiefs have already outlined a policy shift away from any pretense of democratic reform or “ nation - building ” in favor of a more concentrated focus on counter - insurgency operations aimed at wiping out popular resistance in both Afghanistan and Pakistan to US neo -colonial aims .
One issue to be discussed at the Washington conference this week is US concerns over a cease - fire agreement announced last week by the Pakistani government with Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley .
As indicated by the actions taken in the five weeks since Obama ’s inauguration , the US in embarked on a military escalation that will involve an even greater toll in Afghan and Pakistani lives as well as US casualties .
So far , 26 American soldiers and 13 from other “ coalition ” countries have been killed in Afghanistan this year , almost twice as many as in the first two months of 2008 , according to the web site iCasualties.org .
Last Wednesday , the day after Obama announced the dispatch of 17,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan , the top US commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David McKiernan , held a press conference in which he called for 10,000 more troops beyond the 17,000 ordered so far by Obama .
McKiernan said the additional troops did not represent a “ temporary force uplift ” but part of an expanded war that will continue for at least “ three to four to five years . ”
Some foreign policy analysts are predicting that US troop levels in the region will eventually rise to 100,000 .
In 2001 , Washington used the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to put into action long - developed plans to conquer Afghanistan and use it as a base to establish US hegemony in Central Asia , home to some of the richest deposits of oil and natural gas in the world .
The inevitable result was a military disaster and the destabilization of the entire region .
Now , in pursuit of the same imperialist aims , the Obama administration is launching a major escalation that will only further destabilize the region , intensify tensions with rival power such as China and Russia , and cause untold death and destruction .
There is a growing danger of a military conflagration throughout Central Asia and beyond .
So maybe I was wrong .
I used to consider health care our greatest national shame , considering that we spend twice as much on medical care as many European nations , yet American children are twice as likely to die before the age of 5 as Czech children  and American women are 11 times as likely to die in childbirth as Irish women .
Yet I ’m coming to think that our No. 1 priority actually must be education .
That makes the new fiscal stimulus package a landmark , for it takes a few wobbly steps toward reform and allocates more than $ 100 billion toward education .
That ’s a hefty sum  by comparison , the Education Department ’s entire discretionary budget for the year was $ 59 billion  and it will save America ’s schools from the catastrophe that they were facing .
A University of Washington study had calculated that the recession would lead to cuts of 574,000 school jobs without a stimulus .
“ We dodged a bullet the size of a freight train , ” notes Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust , an advocacy group in Washington .
Consumer group Choice has lashed out at the major banks over their decision to slug customers with an extra charge when they use a rival bank 's ATM .
From March 3 customers must be notified of charges before making a transaction at another bank 's ATM , and then given the opportunity to pull out without being charged .
But National Australia Bank , Westpac , St George and ANZ have all announced extra fees which will not be shown on the ATM screen at the time of the transaction .
Commonwealth
Bank says it is still considering its position .
The NAB will charge 50 cents per transaction , on top of the usual fee , while the others have not yet stated their price .
This means customers will be charged around $ 5 to check their account balance and make a withdrawal .
Choice spokesman Christopher Zinn says the new double fee lacks transparency , defeating the whole purpose of the laws in the first place .
" The point is that 50 cents is n't shown on screen , you only find out about it some weeks later if you peruse your statements , " he said .
" It really is counter to the whole spirit , the whole idea of these reforms - that it will be transparent , to drive competition and to lower fees .
" This has the propensity to jack up ATM fees and that really clogs up the whole system . "
He says if the big banks all decide to charge a 50 - cent fee , it will add an extra $ 200 million to bank revenue each year .
" There are significant sums at stake .
While the cost may be small to the individual , if you aggregate that up , how much you will pay over the year , that means that money is in the banks ' pockets at the end of the year and not in consumers ' , " he said .
The new laws were brokered by the Reserve Bank of Australia to generate healthy competition between banks and keep consumer costs low , but Mr Zinn says that will never happen while the big banks maintain the lion 's share of the market .
" The big four banks have far too much market power and concentration , " he said .
" The banks always claim they have plenty of competition , we claim they move in lock step when it comes to many decisions .
" That 's why we 're so keen to make a real stand on this . "
Mr Zinn says Choice is urging banks to stick with the spirit of the new laws and reverse their decision .
" It 's quite simple , it 's quite clear , it 's what the RBA wanted , it 's what everyone thought would happen , " he said .
" When there 's changes in fees being slugged here and there which are unnecessary , that just makes the hair on the back of our necks stand up , and it does so for consumers too . "
He says people in remote areas , music festivals or nightclubs will be slugged the double fee because most of the time they have no choice but to use a rival or independent ATM .
" This is where people are going to need to be more alert .
I 've heard cases of people in small bowling clubs in the bush , the last place you 'd expect to be gouged , charged $ 2.50 to find out their balance and another $ 2.50 to make a withdrawal , " he said .
" That 's the situation already , so people need to be aware of the cost that comes up on the screen . "
Opening Arguments
Last night I finally saw the 2007 Transformers movie .
It was OK , in a Michael Bay sort of way , but it clearly was made for a very specific audience : young white nerdy men who wish they could bone models after watching them sexily fight robots so sweat cascades down their luscious tanned bodies .
All right , fine .
If you must , Michael Bay .
I ’d prefer if you objectified some hot men every once in a while , but I understand that you think that would make you gay , and you do n’t want that , Michael Bay .
I understand .
But then I see this quote from Megan Fox , the actress / model playing main hottie of the film :
“ Both of the female characters in the movie were very strong characters .
Rachel [ Taylor ] ’s character is very intelligent .
I thought that they were representing women very well . ”
That ’s the last straw .
It ’s bad enough that they make movies that objectify women , but then to call those women Strong Female Characters ?
I do not think that phrase means what you think it means , Megan Fox .
So you know what I say ?
Screw Strong Female Characters .
What we need is Weak Female Characters .
My arguments below …
Strong Female Characters : A History
Once upon a time in movieland , female characters were the designated Damsels in Distress .
They were tied to railroad tracks , trapped in burning buildings , falling to their deaths , waiting for Superman to save them .
While the hero fought the Bad Guy , they ’d sit in the back biting their fingernails instead of running away to get help or throwing a punch of their own .
Sometimes they ’d seem smart , strong , and assured until the villain grasped them by their arm , leaving them powerless .
Oh , and the swooning .
Sometimes there was swooning .
Along would come the Hot Hero , strong , rugged , with a square jaw and stony buttocks , to save the day .
As in the heroic tales of old , their prize for defeating the villain would be the chance to shag the Damsel and live happily ever after .
All in all , the Damsel in Distress was kind of a terrible character , but at least she did end up with the hot hero at the end .
Sure , he might have anger issues or just be a tool ; then again , he was also probably a prince or a cowboy or a hot PI or a superhero – or if the hero was a regular “ everyman ” he ’d still be a Clark Gable or Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart – so it was n’t all bad .
Somewhere along the way feminism happened and the wymyns were all , “ Um , no ? ” It took a while , but some writers in Hollywood got the idea .
No more would female characters be Damsels in Distress .
No , there should be Strong Female Characters in cinema– emphasis on “ Strong . ”
While these women would still be young and hot , they ’d also have one characteristic that made them more masculine .
It could be physical strength or a superpower ( see Liz Sherman in the first Hellboy movie ) , the ability to shoot a gun properly ( Princess Leia ) , or something more metaphorical , like being able to out - drink a guy ( Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark ) .
Writers patted themselves on the back , saying , “ You wanted Strong Female Characters ?
Well , now they ’re strong . ”
Yeah , trouble is , while these characters were marginally better than the original Damsels in Distress , they still ended up having to be saved in the final act by the male hero .
There would usually be a scene or three where the “ Strong Female Character ” would be trapped by the villain and put into sexy clothing , I guess as a punishment of some sort .
And even when she was being strong , she was always doing it in the sexiest way possible .
She ’d never , say , get a black eye or a broken nose in a fight .
Her ability to fix cars ( a powerful , masculine trait ) would allow her to get sexy grease all over her slippery body .
Her ability to shoot a gun was so the film ’s advertisers could put her on a poster wearing a skimpy outfit with a big gun between her legs .
In short , the “ strength ” of her character was to make her a better prize for the hero at the end – and for the horny male audience throughout .
And the heroes got worse , too .
Yeah , these Strong Female Characters would sometimes be rescued by the Hot Hero .
More often , now , they ’ll be saved by the Schlubby Everydude .
Apparently somewhere along the line directors decided that film heroes should be more like audience stand - ins : dull , scrawny , nerdy .
So you would n’t have Hot “ Strong ” Marion sleeping with Hot Strong Indiana Jones at the end anymore .
You ’d have Hot “ Strong ” Megan Fox sleeping with Weaselly Weak Shia La Beouf at the end .
One thinks , if this female character is so strong and so hot and so great in every way , why in the world would she end up with that loser ?
Oh .
Because he ’s the audience stand - in .
That makes perfect sense .
Some movies nowadays go even further .
They pile up one awesome trait after another on top of this sexy female character , thinking it will make them “ stronger . ”
Consider Rachel Taylor ’s character in Transformers , who , Megan Fox claims , is an intelligent , Strong Female Character .
Of course !
She ’s a 23 - year - old , model - thin super - attractive super - genius hacker who is so very smart that everyone in the Pentagon spends the whole movie looking at her dumbly because she ’s just so much better than them at everything .
As A.O. Scott said in his Wall - E review , this is the female character ( like EVE ) who is “ a supermodel who also happens to be a top scientist with a knack for marksmanship . ”
This Super Strong Female Character is almost like a Mary Sue , except instead of being perfect in every way because she ’s a stand - in for the author , she ’s perfect in every way so the male audience will want to bang her and so the female audience wo n’t be able to say , “ Tsk tsk , what a weak female character ! ”
It ’s a win -win situation .
Except not .
Saying Yes to Weak Female Characters
I think the major problem here is that women were clamoring for “ strong female characters , ” and male writers misunderstood .
They thought the feminists meant [ Strong Female ] Characters .
The feminists meant [ Strong Characters ] , Female .
So feminists should n’t have said “ we want more strong female characters . ”
We should have said “ we want more WEAK female characters . ”
Not “ weak ” meaning “ Damsel in Distress . ” “ Weak ” meaning “ flawed . ”
Good characters , male or female , have goals , and they have flaws .
Any character without flaws will be a cardboard cutout .
Perhaps a sexy cardboard cutout , but two - dimensional nonetheless .
And no , “ Always goes for douchebags instead of the Nice Guy ” ( the flaw of Megan Fox ’s character in Transformers ) is not a real flaw .
Men think women have that flaw , but most women avoid “ Nice Guys ” because they just are n’t that nice .
So that does n’t count .
So what flaws can female characters have ?
How about the same flaws a male character would have ?
This is especially important in comedies , because many male writers are so clueless about writing funny women that female characters in sitcoms , sitcomish - movies , and comics tend to be the Smart , Gorgeous Snarky Voice of Reason in an unreasonable world .
In other words , Not Flawed and Not Funny .
I ’m sick of it .
Let ’s see more female characters
who fall down hilariously ( like Lucille Ball )
who are arrogant ( like Zhang Yiyi in Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon )
who are realistic or exuberant villains ( like Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton or Atia from Rome )
who are neurotic ( like Elliott from Scrubs )
who are just mean ( like Elaine from Seinfeld )
who are vengeful ( like The Bride from Kill Bill )
who are forgetful ( like Dory from Finding Nemo )
who say the wrong things ( like C.J. in The West Wing , or , again , Elliott from Scrubs )
who are emotionally repressed ( like Marge from The Simpsons )
who are nerdy and awkward ( like Belle from Beauty and the Beast )
who are just messed up ( like everyone , male or female , from Neon Genesis Evangelion )
who are insufferable know - it - alls ( like Hermione or Lisa Simpson )
who are depressed ( I ca n’t think of one , which is interesting , since women are more likely to be depressed in real life .
Who ’s the female equivalent of Hamlet ?
Is there one ? )
Etcetera .
They do n’t have to be physically strong , although they can be —
The Bride , the women from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon , Ripley , Sarah Connor , and even the half - naked Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop are strong Strong female characters .
Strong just means they have their own goals that move beyond “ I want to do whatever the male hero wants to do ” or “ I want to marry the male hero . ”
“ I want to have a baby ” is moderately better – moderately .
Let ’s try to be a little more creative , huh ?
( Brief interlude : And , by the way , it ’s OK if these women are hot .
The characters I just mentioned above [ The Bride , the Crouching Tiger ladies , Ripley , Sarah Connor , and Ms. Valentine ] are all quite attractive .
But they also DO get beat up and they DO look like they could kick your ass .
Except for Zhang Yiyi , who ’s like thirty pounds – but she at least looks graceful enough that she could fly and kick your ass with a sword , and she looks angry and batshit enough that she ’d do it twice .
And they all have their own goals , flaws , and back stories .
I do n’t want you thinking I have something against attractive women .
I am one myself , after all ! )
Once your female characters have some depth to them , it does n’t really matter if the male hero saves them or not .
For instance , Batman saved Rachel Dawes a couple of times , but I never saw her as only a Damsel in Distress , because she was her own person with her own moral code and own heroic goals to clean up Gotham with her Lawyer Powers .
There was nothing in her background that led me to believe she ’d be able to fight supervillains single - handedly , so when Batman has to save her ( just like he saves everyone else ) , it ’s believable .
If , say , she had beaten up the Joker with her super kung fu skills she learned in self - defense class and her super - powered mace she developed in her own chem lab after she got her PhD from Harvard , and her makeup and hair still looked good afterward , then she ’d be LESS of a Strong Female Character .
She ’d just be some image of what the nerdy male audience wants in a damsel .
Got it ?
My work here is done .
Last week , I wrote an essay on the MSM disagreeing why gas prices were rising .
“ As Gas Prices Rise , MSM Disagrees Why Prices Are Rising - Updated ” Today , the Associated Press released an article which is posted ( excerpts below ) that sheds even more light on this issue , although not in the detail that was provided by MSNBC .:
Crude oil is getting cheaper — so why is n’t gas ?
By CHRIS KAHN and JOHN PORRETTO , AP Energy Writers – Sun Feb 15 , 12:31 pm ET NEW YORK – Crude oil prices have fallen to new lows for this year .
So you ’d think gas prices would sink right along with them .
Not so .
Right now , in an unusual market trend , West Texas crude is selling for much less than inferior grades of crude from other places around the world .
A severe economic downturn has left U.S. storage facilities brimming with it , sending prices for the premium crude to five - year lows .
“ Drivers are being ripped off even more now than before , ” said Stuart Pollok , who was filling up recently at a Chevron station in downtown Los Angeles .
He pointed out Exxon Mobil Corp. reeled in billions in profits last year when oil prices neared $ 150 .
MUCH MORE
In the article posted by MSNBC which is quoted above , speculators were cited as one of the reasons for the price increases .
The American public is tired of being gouged ; in this economy , every penny counts , and gas is a commodity that each and every American that own a car has to buy , so naturally , it is a target for greedy Wall Street speculators who have already been responsible for a lot of our economic woes .
It ’s time to restore confidence in our government , and halting the price gouging for gasoline , spear - headed by the government would do a lot to help restore confidence in our own government .
Please act on this issue - and now , before they artificially inflate the prices even more .
Do n’t depend on the AP article to form your opinion , and please read the in - depth article provided by MSNBC to form your own opinion .
It ’s high time that the government start protecting the American consumer - and this is an excellent opportunity for the government to demonstrate they are attempting to offer much needed help to the American consumer and will help everyone in these dire economic times .
Most Americans no longer trust our own government ; this is an issue the public would instantly appreciate and will work to again instill the confidence in Washington that has been lost during the Bush / Cheney years .
Every patriotic American alive will appreciate any efforts by our government to begin much - needed confidence building in our governmental agencies - so please do n’t let us down again !

I fear trouble when the iPod generation - Insecure , Pressurised , Over - taxed and Debt - ridden - hits the job market this summer
To be young again , eh ?
Road trips in your little Ford Fiesta , house parties night after night , snogging in nightclubs , backpacking around the world .
What a life – few responsibilities , just loads of opportunities .
George Bernard
Shaw is right : youth is such a wonderful thing .
But that chapter in everyone ’s life has to close at some point .
Young people become anxious to grow up and settle down .
Late nights , short - term relationships , flat - sharing with your best mates - they were once fun , but the magic begins to wear off .
Recession : 400,000 university students will graduate this summer , facing a tough time in the shrinking jobs market
Twentysomethings want to get ahead : treat the one they love to nice holidays , buy a house , make their parents proud , pay them back for all they ’ve done for them .
A surprising 70 per cent even want to get married .
Youth is the life stage between childhood and adulthood – between economic dependence and economic independence .
Once upon a time , youth was short and sweet .
After the war , up until the mid-1970s , unemployment among under - 25 ’s hovered between at less than three per cent .
An overwhelming majority of youngsters would leave school at 16 , probably do an apprenticeship , and be certain they would get a job .
Such stability in income meant it would n’t be too long until they found a partner and started a family – women , on average , got married at 23 and men at 25 in 1971 .
But from the mid-1970s , extended time in education , spells of unemployment and underemployment and temporary work became the norm for young people .
By the end of the 1990s , 70 per cent of 18 year olds were still in school .
Youth unemployment rocketed - in 1995 , only 23 per cent of European youths had fixed - term contracts compared to seven per cent of those over thirty .
Less welfare and employment protection in the latter part of the twentieth century , combined with de-industrialisation and an expectation to stay in education longer delayed the attainment of economic independence , thereby extending the period of youth .
And in the past decade , youth has become even longer .
The deluge in numbers graduating from university has meant stiffer competition for jobs .
It takes , on average , three years for a graduate to find a permanent position , finally surfacing from an overdraft - funded stint of unpaid internships and temping work .
Many go on to do postgraduate study , costing thousands and thousands of pounds , to make sure they stand out from the monolithic crowd of graduates with a BA ( Hons ) 2:1 .
More frustrating still is the low salary even after years in the labour market , because the swamping of the graduate market keeps wages low in particular sectors .
After more than three years free from essays and early - morning lectures , more than a third of graduates are still not earning above £ 20,000 per annum .
With a student loan debt of above £ 13,000 on top of tax , rent and other living costs , young people are struggling to save enough to reach financial independence .
Youth seems endless .
The deepening recession may well be the straw that breaks the camel ’s back for what the think - tank Reform calls the IPOD generation - those Insecure , Pressurised , Over - taxed and Debt - ridden young people .
Unemployment is affecting this generation the most as companies operate a last - in , first - out policy - 40 per cent of all job losses are among 18 - 24 year olds .
And as one in six graduate places have been cut by the top 100 graduate employers , the Government has admitted there will be a real problem with tens of thousands of graduates unemployed this summer .
Unemployed , underemployed or an eternal gap year student , a typical young graduate today will see their youth extended even further .
Remember France in the spring of 2006 ?
Young people took to the streets in protest as youth unemployment hit 23 percent and the Prime Minister proposed 'le contrat premiere embauche ' ( first emplyment contract ) which would have eliminated for two years the obligation for employers to provide provable reasons for dismissal of an employee under the age of 26 .
The French youth had had enough - just like the Grecians before Christmas , who caused billions of pounds worth of damage to Athens and Thessaloniki after days of firebombs and tear gas .
Slowly , demonstrations and protests by young people are springing up across Europe – Madrid , Barcelona , Seville and Paris .
Here in the UK , the Government has focussed on containing the wildcat strikes by workers in Total ’s oil refinery in Lincolnshire .
But perhaps Ministers should be more concerned by the actions of disappointed and frustrated young people .
Note in your diaries this summer , when universities release 400,000 graduates .
The summer of ’09 certainly wo n’t be the best days of our lives .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal on Sunday praised Iran for helping Hamas achieve " victory " over Israel in Gaza , according to Iranian media reports .
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal , right , greets Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday .
" The victory of the people of Gaza was a miracle of God and the Islamic Republic definitely has a share in this victory , " Meshaal said after meeting with Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , according to Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency .
Meshaal arrived in Tehran for his first visit to the country since Israel 's recent military offensive on Gaza , Iranian media reported .
He also met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki .
Meshaal -- who lives in exile in Syria -- is the head of Hamas , which rules the Palestinian territory of Gaza .
Hamas has claimed victory over Israeli forces , saying the Jewish state failed to destroy its ability to fire rockets at southern Israel .
But Israel has said it achieved its goal in Gaza , which was to change the security situation for southern Israel .
According to Fars News Agency , Khamenei congratulated Meshaal , saying , " The people of Gaza and the Islamic Resistance made us all proud and with their patience and perseverance successfully passed this very difficult test . "
The Iranian leader stressed that that the war in Gaza has not yet ended , noting that " the Islamic Resistance must , with full alertness and in proper ways , prepare itself fully for the possibility of the beginning of another war , " Fars reported .
Khamenei denounced some Arab countries for criticizing Hamas , and called for Israeli leaders to be tried for war crimes .
Meshaal vowed that the " Palestine government has not , and will not , accept any of the enemy 's conditions , including the 2005 agreement regarding the Rafa crossing and the permanent cease - fire . "
The Palestinian government is split between Hamas , which controls Gaza , and Fatah , which controls the West Bank .
Israel and the United States do not directly negotiate with Hamas , which both countries consider a terrorist organization .
Iran has supported Hamas during and since the 22 - day Israeli military operation , which ended more than a week ago after Israeli forces pulled out of Gaza .
Tehran held a day of mourning for the Palestinian victims , and protested the Israeli operation .
U.S. and Israeli officials have accused Iran of providing weapons , training and cash to Hamas militants in Gaza .
Israel said its goal was to stop militants in the territory from firing rockets on southern Israel .
But Palestinian militants on Sunday fired 10 rockets and mortar shells into Israel -- in violation of the cease - fire -- slightly wounding two Israeli soldiers and one civilian .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised a " sharp Israeli response " to the ongoing strikes .
Some analysts have said that Israel was sending a message to Hezbollah when it launched its military offensive in Hamas - ruled Gaza .
Iran and Syria are key supporters of Hezbollah , which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States .

According to the Apple Store 's Web site the white 13 - inch MacBook can be purchased for $ 999 .
But the internal specs have been given a small , but important , makeover to make the laptop more attractive .
The white MacBook now boasts a new 2.0GHz Intel Core Duo processor with a 1,066MHz front - side bus .
An Nvidia GeForce 9400 M graphics card has been added , along with a 120 - GB hard drive .
The unibody 13 - inch MacBook in aluminum boasts pretty similar specs : an Intel Core 2 Duo and Nvidia GeForce 9400 M graphics card .
The hard drive on the unibody MacBook is a little more robust , clocking in at 160 GB .
The main difference between the two notebooks comes from the DDR memory .
The older version of the MacBook has 2 GB of DDR2 memory ; the aluminum version has 2 GB of DDR3 Memory .
That means the unibody MacBook computes more quickly , but at the cost of an additional $ 300 .
The 13 - inch unibody MacBook in aluminum is retailing on the Apple Web site for $ 1,299 .
The question then becomes more one of style than computing power .
Is the extra $ 300 for an aluminum body and slightly faster DDR3 memory worth it ?
The other option , of course , is getting a slightly slower , last - generation version of an Apple MacBook that will perform just as admirably at a lower price .
A Mini-DVI video out port is also listed among the specs on the white MacBook as standard equipment .
It seems likely that the MiniDisplay port that is a part of newer MacBook models probably is n't included .

Whether you ’re new to the whole concept of databases , or a hard - core database geek , you need to have The Manga Guide to Databases .
Really , you want this book .
I quote from the promotional copy : “ Princess Ruruna is stressed out .
With the king and queen away , she has to manage the Kingdom of Kod ’s humongous fruit - selling empire … a mysterious book and a helpful fairy promise to solve her organizational problems — with the practical magic of databases . ”
How many other tech books do you have with an opening like “ Princess Ruruna is stressed out ” ?
Published originally by a Japanese publisher in 2004 , this book has been competently translated into American English by No Starch Press and technically edited for accuracy by Baron Schwartz .
The book alternates between regular database textbook exercises and three to ten page well - drawn Manga comic episodes in which Princess Ruruna uses databases to manage the fruit harvest , save her country ’s economy , and avoid an undesirable marriage .
The fact that the database techniques and knowledge described by the cute - as - a - hello - kitty fairy are accurate just adds to the surreal quality of the book .
There ’s something unbelieveably head - spinning about Anime characters discussing SQL , third normal form , distributed databases and transaction concurrency ( yes , really ) .
I ’ve a feeling more copies of this will be bought by database geeks who are tickled by the whole concept , but it would also be a good purchase for any web geek you know with poor SQL who likes Anime .
Howard Dean is stepping down as Democratic National chairman .
He has been criticized as a poor fundraiser and was not entrusted with many major tasks by the Obama campaign this fall .
But Dean 's 50 state campaign plan — building a Democratic Party in every state — turned out to have been a real winner for the party .
It helped to expand the field for the Obama campaign and helped make many Democrats competitive — and successful — in states that George W. Bush carried by considerable margins in 2000 and 2004 .
Dean also kept in close touch with the mostly left - wing " netroots " that supplied so much of the energy for Democrats in 2006 and this year .
Dean apparently feels that the DNC position will be less important with a Democratic president in office , and that is surely the case .
But I think Democrats owe a big round of thanks to Howard Dean for a job well done .
SOUTHPORT , England , Feb. 9 ( UPI ) -- A 71 - year - old British man whose inline - skates were confiscated by police asked supporters to attend his trial for allegedly posing a hazard to pedestrians .
Geoff Dornan , 71 , said his health suffered after police took away his blades last year for allegedly skating in a restricted area in Southport , England , The Sun reported Monday .

" In the months during which I have been unjustly deprived of my blades , I was shocked to discover how swiftly the health of someone of my age can deteriorate , " he said .
" At the time of my arrest , I was as fit as a flea , and entirely free of pain .
Yet by Christmas , I found myself confined to bed with severe back trouble . "
Dornan , who denies that his skating poses a danger to pedestrians , said a Facebook group set up to support his bid to have the charges dismissed and his inline skates returned has grown to include 2,075 members .
" I would hugely appreciate it if as many as possible of my supporters would turn up at 2 p.m. ( Monday ) to witness my trial in the ample spectators ' gallery at Southport magistrates ' court , " he said .
" It could be fun .
If nothing else , I can assure the ladies my solicitor is drop - dead dishy . "

In an earlier post , http://chaource.livejournal.com/34530.html , I deplored the current state of functional programming .
I said that functional programming is difficult because the programmer needs to develop an adequate mental model of the language in terms of how the compiled code will actually look and run .
People pounced on me and ( amid variously directed critique ) pointed me to Haskell rather than Ocaml .
I spent a few weeks reading various Haskell tutorials , especially about the infamous " monadic programming . "
I 'd like to say that I am impressed .
It appears that Haskell is a very interesting language indeed ; more so than other " young " FP languages ( Ocaml or Erlang ; perhaps Clean comes close ) .
Haskell is a language more interesting for a mathematically minded person , for a person not interested in fashionable topics , and for a person concerned a lot with conceptual clarity .
If I had any time today for programming I would try to learn more about Haskell .
Here is a blog entry about a Haskell program for Fibonacci numbers that was automatically parallelized with just a bit of human help .
I was not very much surprised that parallelization worked " out of the box " because the program is purely functional and rather simple .
What was more surprising to me : the single - CPU implementation was already essentially as fast as a pure C implementation .
Fantastic , is n't it ?
In another article the same author ( Don Stewart ) explains how to optimize Haskell code .
This article is about exactly the kinds of " insider tricks " I felt one absolutely needs to learn before being productive with functional languages .
A trivial three - line Haskell program was written for computing the average of the list of numbers from 1 to 1 billion .
This program crashes ( apparently trying to allocate too much memory ) .
Don then writes ,
In other words , a programmer who is presumably competent but comes from the imperative ( not functional ) Fortran - C- C++- Java - Python lineage is unable to write a working 3 - line program in Haskell .
The reason for this is that the programmer is insufficiently aware of the " interaction between strictness and laziness .
" To understand this interaction in all detail , one needs to take a look at the intermediate code produced by the Haskell compiler .
Then ( one month later , when one has finished learning the compiler innards and is able to read " core Haskell " ) one notices that the list of one billion items is prematurely forced into evaluation rather than kept unevaluated .
Then one rewrites the code using straight recursion ; perhaps instead one is supposed to use some fancy combinators or what not .
( Yes indeed !
The next article by the same author does just this . )
I am insufficiently competent in Haskell ( having written exactly 5 lines of code in that language ) to understand quickly whether it's enough to keep away from thefunction , or there are more hidden traps .
Of course , once we identify the problem we can work around it .
The fact that we identify the problem by seeing the program crash is a really bad sign though .
Haskell is a fine puzzle for mathematically inclined persons having lots of free time .
I 'd like to know whether Haskell is actually ready to be used .
I have three programming projects on my mind ; should I invest the time necessary to learn Haskell if I want to work on them ?
1 . A GUI application that allows the user to construct from scratch and subsequently to modify its own graphical user interface interactively , using a set of GUI primitives and allowing limited access to its source code , but such that the user does not need to write any complicated source code and so cannot make a mistake .
Which GUI toolkit can I use with Haskell ?
While there is a choice between Tk , Gtk , and wxWidgets , none of these Haskell bindings seem to be " standard " or complete or stable , and every one appears to be the result of a research project to invent a conceptually new , purely functional replacement of the traditional object - oriented , imperative GUI toolkits .
I am unwilling to invest time into studyingin order to use a toolkit that eventually will not work because of missing library header file that was present five years ago when the toolkit was being developed .
Maybe I 'm being too pessimistic ; but most today 's languages come standard with a full set of GUI toolkits .
I downloaded the Haskell bindings for wxWidgets but was unable to compile them because of some strange error message : " wxHaskellCore not found . "
They said the latest CVS version works only with the latest GHC ( compiler ) ; that 's what I used .
Anyway , I have no time to figure this out now .
2 . I 'd like to find a Unix - like command shell that uses ( more or less ) Haskell as scripting language but provides easy interface to the file system , data streams , and the network .
In this shell I 'd like to implement some interesting bookkeeping operations , such as synchronize files over network using approximate filename matching .
The usual Unix shell is too primitive for a large programming task .
There are 3 or 4 more or less abandoned " Haskell shell " projects .
Only one of them appears to be in any kind of finished state but not actively developed any more .
3 .
I 'd like to write a program for algorithmic music composition .
The book by Hudak ( " The Haskell school of expression " ) appears to be the only one touching on some sort of multimedia or music interfaces .
Again , projects to have a Haskell interface in this area are , that is , they develop a new programming paradigm to represent , say , real - time signals ( " functional reactive programming " for instance ) and they are still figuring out whether this paradigm is useful .
Also , it is unclear whether I will be tied to platform - specific ( read : Windows - only ) tools in this area .
So for these reasons I 'm a little hesitant to think that Haskell is the Next Great Thing ( TM ) and also hesitant to devote any of my free time to learning it in more detail .
I 'm still of the opinion that " hardcore " functional programming ( which Haskell is a champion of ) is just conceptually too difficult for a casual programmer .
Surely it 's okay to put an occasional " lambda " into your imperative Python code just to make the code occasionally shorter and more flexible .
Most people will have no trouble doing that , but they will find it a hell of a time figuring out why their Haskell application does not work .
Will I be able to figure out these things by myself ?
Maybe , at a rate of one trick per week if I work constantly on it .
Let 's wait until more books on Haskell come out .

Worms are pretty odd compared to creatures we are more familiar with .
Within that already weird group , some worms are weirder than others .
Giant Blue Earthworms
Terriswalkeris terraereginae is an Australian worm .
In a land where an animal has to be pretty weird to be even noticed , the giant earthworm is not only a lovely shade of Prussian Blue , it also can grow up to two meters long !
Pig Butt Worm
One of the few things that worms all over the world have in common is that they are vermiform , or shaped like worms , right ?
Wrong !
ConsIder the deep sea worm Chaetopterus pugaporcinus .
It does n't look so much like a worm as it does a pig 's butt .
That 's why its common name is the Pig Butt Worm .
This worm is segmented like other worms , but the middle segment is inflated while the front and rear segments are flattened against the midsection .
Palouse Earthworm
The Palouse earthworm is native to eastern Washington and western Idaho .
They can grow up to three feet long and burrow 15 feet deep in the soil !
Driloleirus americanus was first discovered in 1897 and was considered extinct in the 1980s .
Two specimens were found last year , but were killed and somewhat damaged before a cautious identification .
Strange Flatworm
A worm called Xenoturbella bocki is the master of minimalism in worms .
It has no mouth , stomach , brain , or any internal organs !
The only thing this primitive worm has in common with other worms is its shape .
Scientists could n't quite classify it on discovery .
DNA tests indicated it was related to molluscs , but later testing indicated that the worms may have eaten the molluscs - somehow , even with no mouth or organs .
The most organized internal feature is the " statocyst " which keeps it oriented , an important task when an animal does n't know its head from its tail .
Bone Eating Worm
In 2002 , deep sea explorers 9,400 feet down in the depths came upon a decomposing whale carcass with an entire ecosystem , living on it .
The most numerous species was a raft of worms with distinct red plumage .
The new species was named Osedax rubiplumus , after their appearance and their habit of eating the bones of dead animals .
All the worms feeding on the whale were females .
The males were discovered living inside the females !
The males seem to be stunted developmentally , but they still provide sperm for reproduction .
Osedax has no mouth or functional gut .
Their " plumes " act as roots that extract nutrients from the bones they feed on .
Since then , twelve different species of Osedax have been identified .
Ribbon Worm
A video went around the internet last week with a plea to identify this weird worm .
Commenters at Flickr believe it to be of the phylum Nemertea , or ribbon worm , sometimes called a proboscis worm .
When it shoots out its proboscis , its length will stretch to many times its original length .
There are around 1400 species of Nemertea .
The more things change , the more they actually change .
Microsoft 's original Xbox never had legs like Sony 's fleet - footed PlayStation 2 , only managing to sell around 25 million units worldwide -- a nibble compared to Sony 's 140 million .
What a difference getting your system out first can make ( well , unless you 're the Dreamcast , may it rest in peace ) .
Microsoft said recently that the Xbox 360 would finally muscle past the original Xbox 's sell totals by the end of November , but it 's happened a week earlier than expected .
Also :
Two years faster .
The first Xbox took five years to hit 25 million , while the Xbox 360 which debuted in November 2005 made it in just three .
WITH A LITTLE HELP !
New government data on health , education and corrective services paints a gloomy picture of disadvantage for Indigenous Australians .
On coming into office just over a year ago , the Federal Government promised to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous Australians and the national average .
A report from the Productivity Commission shows the Government has a long way to go .
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have mortality rates up to three times higher than non-indigenous people and the infant mortality rate is significantly higher as well .
The data from services provided by the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments also shows Indigenous students are less likely to meet national benchmarks in reading , writing and numeracy , and they are less likely to stay in school .
The rate of children needing protection is seven times higher than the national average .
Indigenous Australians are also 20 times more likely to end up in prison than the average Australian and they likely to die at a younger age .
The US military has been using Britain 's atomic weapons factory to carry out research into its own nuclear warhead programme , according to evidence seen by the Guardian .
US defence officials said that " very valuable " warhead research has taken place at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire as part of an ongoing and secretive deal between the British and American governments .
The Ministry of Defence admitted it is working with the US on the UK's " existing nuclear warhead stockpile and the range of replacement options that might be available " but declined to give any further information .
Last night , opposition MPs called for a full parliamentary inquiry into the extent of the collaboration at Aldermaston and campaign groups warned any such deal was in breach of international law .
They added that it also undermined Britain 's claim to have an independent nuclear weapons programme and meant British taxpayers were effectively subsidising America 's nuclear programme .
The US president , Barack Obama , while on the campaign trail said he wanted to eliminate nuclear weapons and that one of his first actions on taking office would be to " stop the development of new nuclear weapons " .
But the Pentagon is at odds with the president .
The defence secretary , Robert Gates , and other senior officials argue that the US 's existing arsenal needs to be upgraded and that would not constitute " new " weapons .
Kate Hudson , of CND , said : " Any work preparing the way for new warheads cuts right across the UK 's commitment to disarm , which it signed up to in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
That this work may be contributing to both future US and British warheads is nothing short of scandalous . "
Nick Harvey , defence spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said parliament and the country would react with " outrage " at the prospect of British taxpayers funding a new US nuclear weapon .
" All this backroom dealing and smoke and mirrors policy is totally unacceptable , the government must open the Aldermaston accounts to full parliamentary scrutiny , " he added .
The extent of US involvement at Aldermaston came to light in an interview with John Harvey , policy and planning director at the US National Nuclear Security Administration , carried out last year by the thinktanks Chatham House and the Centre for Strategic Studies .
Referring to " dual axis hydrodynamic " experiments which , with the help of computer modelling , replicate the conditions inside a warhead at the moment it starts to explode , Harvey said : " There are some capabilities that the UK has that we do n't have and that we borrow ... that I believe we have been able to exploit that 's been very valuable to us . "
It is unclear whether the experiments are still being carried out but , in the same interview , Harvey admitted that the US and UK had struck a new deal over the level of cooperation , including work on US plans for a new generation of nuclear warhead known as the Reliable Replacement Warhead ( RRW ) .
He said : " We have recently , I can't tell you when , taken steps to amend the MDA [ Mutual Defence Agreement ] , not only to extend it but to amend it to allow for a broader extent of cooperation than in the past , and this has to do with the RRW effort . "
Campaigners said the comments represent the first direct evidence that the US is using UK facilities to develop its nuclear programme .
Lawyers acting on their behalf said the increasing levels of cooperation and the extension the MDA breach the non-proliferation treaty , which states : " Each nuclear weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices indirectly or indirectly . "
The MoD admitted the two countries are working together , " examining both the optimum life of the UK's existing nuclear warhead stockpile and the range of replacement options that might be available to inform decisions on whether and how we may need to refurbish or replace the existing warhead likely to be necessary in the next parliament " .
Congress has stopped funding research into RRW but campaigners believe the US military may have used facilities in the UK to get around the restrictions at home .
" Billions of pounds have been poured into the Atomic Weapons Establishment over recent years to build new research facilities , " said Hudson .
" If these are being used to support US programmes outside Congress 's controls on spending , it raises even more serious questions about why the British taxpayer is paying for a so - called ' independent deterrent ' . "
The jury at the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes has returned an open verdict .
The coroner also asked the jury to answer a number of key questions .
THE FINAL MOMENTS " Did firearms officer C12 shout armed police ? "
ANSWER : NO " Did Mr de Menezes stand up from his seat before he was grabbed in a bear hug by officer Ivor ? "
ANSWER : YES " Did Mr de Menezes move towards C12 before he was grabbed in a bear hug by Ivor ? "
ANSWER : NO These three questions were focused on the final moments of Jean Charles de Menezes ' life as he was surrounded by undercover police officers on the London Underground .
The police officers on the carriage all maintain that a warning was shouted before two of their number opened fire .
But passengers who were sitting in the same carriage say they heard no warning .
Rachel Wilson and her boyfriend Ralph Livock were sitting opposite told the inquest nothing was said to alert the man before shots were fired .
One of the police officers who was approaching the carriage seconds before the shooting told the inquest he heard several verbal warnings .
In his evidence , officer C12 , the first of two to fire , told the jury that he had no preconceived ideas as to how he was going to apprehend the man .
He said he decided on firing fatal shots because Mr de Menezes stood up and moved towards a gun pointed at his head .
He concluded that the man was about to detonate a bomb and had to be killed to protect others .
A surveillance officer says he pinned Mr de Menezes down before the shots were fired .
A majority of the jury disagreed with this account .
They said that they accepted that Mr de Menezes had stood up - but they did not believe he had moved forwards into the path of a gun .
THE WIDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OPERATION
The coroner also asked the jury to consider which of these other factors , if any , contributed to the death .
The Jury were allowed to answer " yes " , " no " or " cannot decide " .
" The pressure on police after the suicide attacks in July 2005 . "
ANSWER : CANNOT DECIDE
" A failure to obtain and provide better photographic images of failed bomber Hussain Osman to surveillance officers . "
ANSWER : YES " The general difficulty in providing identification of the man under surveillance in the time available . "
ANSWER : NO " The fact that the views of the surveillance officers regarding identification were not accurately communicated to the command team and firearms officers .
ANSWER : YES The Metropolitan Police had never been in a situation like this .
Already reeling from the 7 July attacks , the city woke up on 22 July knowing that four more suicide bombers were apparently on the run .
Resources were , to put it mildly , stretched - but the jury could not decide whether this corporate pressure on the Met played a role in the tragedy .
In the space of a few hours , the team linked one of the bombers to a gym card found at the scene - and then from there to the block of flats which was also home to Mr de Menezes .
During the inquest , the jury heard that some of the police staking out the south London flats did not have a picture of the real suspect they were looking for .
Several of the surveillance officers watching the flat had only seen a poor image of would - be bomber Hussain Osman .
Some officers had seen a picture of Osman from the gym membership card .
But it was indistinct and over - exposed , making him appear to have lighter skin .
Another picture from his wedding day , also found at a bomb scene , was clearer but had not been circulated to the same extent .
A majority of the jury concluded that this lack of a decent photograph of the suspect was a more important factor in the tragedy than the fact that nobody could identify Mr de Menezes himself .
Crucially , the jury said the confusion over exactly what the surveillance teams thought about who they were following also played a part .
The surveillance officer closest to the flat , Frank , says he was relieving himself as Mr de Menezes he left the property - so he could not help with the identification .
The Operation Room noted that the subject matched Osman 's description - and one officer said he was " possibly identical " .
Another surveillance officer told the operation room that a request for a percentage certainty was " ridiculous " .
By the time Mr de Menezes reached the Tube , Commander Cressida Dick said he had to be stopped from entering the system .
In his evidence , Charlie 2 , the second shooter , told the jury that he had heard the surveillance officers positively identify the man over the radio .
" A failure by police to ensure that Mr de Menezes was stopped before he reached public transport . "
ANSWER : YES Commander John McDowell , now the national co-ordinator of counter - terrorism operations , set the day 's strategy in the early hours of Friday morning .
Surveillance officers would surround the property and would be supported by firearms teams .
According to his plan , anyone leaving the flats would be stopped and discounted a safe distance away .
The idea behind this was to isolate the property and its occupants - but not to alert any bombers , in case they had explosives with them .
The property was in a cul - de- sac , making a quiet stop outside the front door impossible .
Crucially , the front door was a communal entrance - no officer knew who was coming from which flat .
When Mr de Menezes left the flat , the firearms teams were not yet in position to stop the possible suspect , as set out in the plan .
Within minutes , the Brazilian was on a bus and heading through London , with officers chasing - and trying to work out whether or not he was a threat .
" The innocent behaviour of Mr de Menezes increasing suspicion . "
ANSWER : NO Officers who were following Mr de Menezes reported that he was nervous and acting strangely , standing on the bus stairwell and being twitchy .
The electrician was , it later emerged , probably late for a job in north London .
When Mr de Menezes ' bus reached Brixton town centre , he got off and walked in the direction of the Underground before suddenly doubling back and getting back on a bus .
Surveillance officers are trained to look for people suddenly changing direction as a means of shaking a tail .
In reality , the Tube was closed amid the security chaos across London .
" The fact that the position of the cars containing the firearms officers was not accurately known by the command team as firearms teams were approaching Stockwell Tube . "
ANSWER : YES " Shortcomings in the communications system between various police teams on the ground . "
ANSWER : YES " Failure to conclude at the time that surveillance officers could have been used to carry out the stop on Mr de Menezes at Stockwell . "
ANSWER : YES Detective Chief Inspector Greg Purser was one of the senior officers involved in the stake - out .
He told the inquest that officers were under " undue pressure " and facing an " appalling dilemma " .
Decisions had to be taken in seconds or minutes - rather than leisurely in hours like in other investigations .
" We put undue pressure potentially on surveillance officers and then potentially on firearms teams , " he said .
" We had an enormous task that morning .
To try and take the operation to the level we would have liked would possibly have taken a day .
We were trying to do it in a short time .
It 's extremely difficult .
" We ask so much of our surveillance teams and we ask much of our firearms teams . "

WASHINGTON -- Heading into the 2008 presidential race , many Republicans thought Sen. John McCain 's image as a deal - making maverick made him the one Republican who might win in an anti-GOP year .
His defeat now has observers wondering what might have been had he stuck to his persona .
Instead , the Arizona senator ran a more traditional campaign , appealing to conservative voters who make up the base of his party .
His advisers offer a variety of reasons for why he chose this tack , but the decision confounds those who missed the ...
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
One week after the U.S. Army announced record suicide rates among its soldiers last year , the service is worried about a spike in possible suicides in the new year .
If reports of suicides are confirmed , more soldiers will have taken their lives in January than died in combat .
The Army said 24 soldiers are believed to have committed suicide in January alone -- six times as many as killed themselves in January 2008 , according to statistics released Thursday .
The Army said it already has confirmed seven suicides , with 17 additional cases pending that it believes investigators will confirm as suicides for January .
If those prove true , more soldiers will have killed themselves than died in combat last month .
According to Pentagon statistics , there were 16 U.S. combat deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq in January .
" This is terrifying , " an Army official said .
" We do not know what is going on . "
Col. Kathy Platoni , chief clinical psychologist for the Army Reserve and National Guard , said that the long , cold months of winter could be a major contributor to the January spike .
" There is more hopelessness and helplessness because everything is so dreary and cold , " she said .
But Platoni said she sees the multiple deployments , stigma associated with seeking treatment and the excessive use of anti-depressants as ongoing concerns for mental - health professionals who work with soldiers .
Those who are seeking mental - health care often have their treatment disrupted by deployments .
Deployed soldiers also have to deal with the stress of separations from families .
" When people are apart you have infidelity , financial problems , substance abuse and child behavioral problems , " Platoni said .
" The more deployments , the more it is exacerbated . "
Platoni also said that while the military has made a lot of headway in training leaders on how to deal with soldiers who may be suffering from depression or post - traumatic stress disorder , " there is still a huge problem with leadership who shame them when they seek treatment . "
The anti-depressants prescribed to soldiers can have side effects that include suicidal thoughts .
Those side effects reportedly are more common in people 18 to 24 .
Concern about last month 's suicide rate was so high , Congress and the Army leadership were briefed .
In addition , the Army took the rare step of releasing data for the month rather than waiting to issue it as part of annual statistics at the end of the year .
In January 2008 , the Army recorded two confirmed cases of suicides and two other cases it was investigating .
Last week , in releasing the report that showed a record number of suicides in 2008 , the Army said it soon will conduct servicewide training to help identify soldiers at risk of suicide .
The program , which will run February 15 through March 15 , will include training to recognize behaviors that may lead to suicide and instruction on how to intervene .
The Army will follow the training with another teaching program , from March 15 to June 15 , focused on suicide prevention at all unit levels .
The 2008 numbers were the highest annual level of suicides among soldiers since the Pentagon began tracking the rate 28 years ago .
The Army said 128 soldiers were confirmed to have committed suicide in 2008 , and an additional 15 were suspected of having killed themselves .
The statistics cover active - duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves .
The Army 's confirmed rate of suicides in 2008 was 20.2 per 100,000 soldiers .
The nation 's suicide rate was 19.5 per 100,000 people in 2005 , the most recent figure available , Army officials said last month .
Suicides for Marines were also up in 2008 .
There were 41 in 2008 , up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006 , according to a Marines report .
In addition to the new training , the service has a program called Battlemind , intended to prepare soldiers and their families to cope with the stresses of war before , during and after deployment .
It also is intended to help detect mental - health issues before and after deployments .
The Army and the National Institute of Mental Health signed an agreement in October to conduct research to identify factors affecting the mental and behavioral health of soldiers and to share strategies to lower the suicide rate .
The five - year study will examine active - duty , National Guard and reserve soldiers and their families .
CNN 's Adam Levine contributed to this report .

In what could turn out to be the greatest fraud in US history , American authorities have started to investigate the alleged role of senior military officers in the misuse of $ 125 bn ( £ 88 bn ) in a US - directed effort to reconstruct Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein .
The exact sum missing may never be clear , but a report by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) suggests it may exceed $ 50bn , making it an even bigger theft than Bernard Madoff 's notorious Ponzi scheme .
" I believe the real looting of Iraq after the invasion was by US officials and contractors , and not by people from the slums of Baghdad , " said one US businessman active in Iraq since 2003 .
In one case , auditors working for SIGIR discovered that $ 57.8 m was sent in " pallet upon pallet of hundred - dollar bills " to the US comptroller for south - central Iraq , Robert J Stein Jr , who had himself photographed standing with the mound of money .
He is among the few US officials who were in Iraq to be convicted of fraud and money - laundering .
Despite the vast sums expended on rebuilding by the US since 2003 , there have been no cranes visible on the Baghdad skyline except those at work building a new US embassy and others rusting beside a half - built giant mosque that Saddam was constructing when he was overthrown .
One of the few visible signs of government work on Baghdad 's infrastructure is a tireless attention to planting palm trees and flowers in the centre strip between main roads .
Those are then dug up and replanted a few months later .
Iraqi leaders are convinced that the theft or waste of huge sums of US and Iraqi government money could have happened only if senior US officials were themselves involved in the corruption .
In 2004 - 05 , the entire Iraq military procurement budget of $ 1.3bn was siphoned off from the Iraqi Defence Ministry in return for 28 - year - old Soviet helicopters too obsolete to fly and armoured cars easily penetrated by rifle bullets .
Iraqi officials were blamed for the theft , but US military officials were largely in control of the Defence Ministry at the time and must have been either highly negligent or participants in the fraud .
American federal investigators are now starting an inquiry into the actions of senior US officers involved in the programme to rebuild Iraq , according to The New York Times , which cites interviews with senior government officials and court documents .
Court records reveal that , in January , investigators subpoenaed the bank records of Colonel Anthony B Bell , now retired from the US Army , but who was previously responsible for contracting for the reconstruction effort in 2003 and 2004 .
Two federal officials are cited by the paper as saying that investigators are also looking at the activities of Lieutenant - Colonel Ronald W Hirtle of the US Air Force , who was senior contracting officer in Baghdad in 2004 .
It is not clear what specific evidence exists against the two men , who have both said they have nothing to hide .
The end of the Bush administration which launched the war may give fresh impetus to investigations into frauds in which tens of billions of dollars were spent on reconstruction with little being built that could be used .
In the early days of the occupation , well - connected Republicans were awarded jobs in Iraq , regardless of experience .
A 24 - year - old from a Republican family was put in charge of the Baghdad stock exchange which had to close down because he allegedly forgot to renew the lease on its building .
In the expanded inquiry by federal agencies , the evidence of a small - time US businessman called Dale C Stoffel who was murdered after leaving the US base at Taiji north of Baghdad in 2004 is being re-examined .
Before he was killed , Mr Stoffel , an arms dealer and contractor , was granted limited immunity from prosecution after he had provided information that a network of bribery – linking companies and US officials awarding contracts – existed within the US - run Green Zone in Baghdad .
He said bribes of tens of thousands of dollars were regularly delivered in pizza boxes sent to US contracting officers .
So far , US officers who have been successfully prosecuted or unmasked have mostly been involved in small - scale corruption .
Often sums paid out in cash were never recorded .
In one case , an American soldier put in charge of reviving Iraqi boxing gambled away all the money but he could not be prosecuted because , although the money was certainly gone , nobody had recorded if it was $ 20,000 or $ 60,000 .
Iraqi ministers admit the wholesale corruption of their government .
Ali Allawi , the former finance minister , said Iraq was " becoming like Nigeria in the past when all the oil revenues were stolen " .
But there has also been a strong suspicion among senior Iraqis that US officials must have been complicit or using Iraqi appointees as front - men in corrupt deals .
Several Iraqi officials given important jobs at the urging of the US administration in Baghdad were inexperienced .
For instance , the arms procurement chief at the centre of the Defence Ministry scandal , was a Polish - Iraqi , 27 years out of Iraq , who had run a pizza restaurant on the outskirts of Bonn in the 1990s .
In many cases , contractors never started or finished facilities they were supposedly building .
As security deteriorated in Iraq from the summer of 2003 it was difficult to check if a contract had been completed .
But the failure to provide electricity , water and sewage disposal during the US occupation was crucial in alienating Iraqis from the post - Saddam regime .

There ’s been a lot of talk over the last few months about how Windows has been crushing Linux on netbooks .
When Asus launched the Eee PC 701 back in 2007 , it ran Xandros Linux and open source enthusiasts started proclaiming that netbooks would help Linux finally make it as a mainstream consumer - oriented operating system .
It ’s cheaper for computer makers to deploy and it offers much of the same functionality users have come to expect from Windows or OS X .
And then Microsoft started offering netbook makers the ability to license Windows XP well below the normal price , which meant that by mid-2008 you could usually find a mini-laptop running Windows XP for just a few bucks more than a Linux model .
And over the course of the year , there was a major shift .
Early in 2008 , most netbooks sold ran some version of Linux .
By the end of the year , somewhere around 80 % were running Windows XP .
But it turns out that Linux still has a place in the netbook ecosystem .
Dell officials told Laptop magazine recently that about a third of the Inspiron Mini 9 computers the company sells run Ubuntu Linux instead of Windows XP .
While 33 % ain’t exactly a majority , that ’s a pretty big achievement for Linux , which has a huge market share when it comes to servers , but is much less popular on desktop and laptop computers .
My guess is there are two reasons for the popularity of Linux Inspiron Mini 9 netbooks :
They ’re dirt cheap , and Dell actually did a pretty good job of making sure Ubuntu worked properly with the hardware before shipping the computers .
MSI has reported that return rates for Linux versions of its
Wind netbooks are much higher than the retuns of Windows powered netbooks .
But MSI also shipped the Wind U90 with a version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop that did n’t seem to work very well .

For a long time now , Obama advisers and administration officials have been repeating the idea that the Taliban and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan wo n’t negotiate a deal because they think they ’re winning .
Now , thanks to the New York Times , we know that ’s not true .
The Taliban is negotiating .
And from the brilliant Times piece today by Dexter Filkins , we also know that what they ’re asking for is n’t unreasonable .
Here ’s the bottom line :
The first demand was an immediate pullback of American and other foreign forces to their bases , followed by a cease - fire and a total withdrawal from the country over the next 18 months .
Then the current government would be replaced by a transitional government made up of a range of Afghan leaders , including those of the Taliban and other insurgents .
Americans and other foreign soldiers would be replaced with a peacekeeping force drawn from predominantly Muslim nations , with a guarantee from the insurgent groups that they would not attack such a force .
Nationwide elections would follow after the Western forces left .
If that ’s what the Taliban asking for , then the Taliban and the Dreyfuss Report are in precise agreement .
Not on philosophy , of course .
I hate the Taliban and everything they stand for .
But it ’s time for a deal .
Unless you think that sending Zal Khalilzad to Afghanistan to run the country as President Karzai ’s CEO is a good idea .
( If you think that ’s a good idea , then maybe you ’d propose sending Richard Perle to be Iraq ’s CEO , Douglas Feith to be Israel ’s CEO , and — why not ? — pick a neoconservative to be king of Saudi Arabia , too .
King Michael Ledeen ?
None of these ideas are stupider than Khalilzad as Afghan CEO . )
FIlkins ’ piece — which you have to read in its entirety — says that the talks involve top leaders of the Taliban and its allies , including warlords Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Sirajuddin Haqqani , all of whom have had representatives involves in talks with Karzai et al . :
While the talks have been under way for months , they have accelerated since Mr. Obama took office … .
The talks under way now appear to be directed not at individual bands of antigovernment insurgents — the strategy suggested by President Obama — but at the leaders of the large movements .
And Karzai ’s spokesman officially endorsed the talks :
Afghan officials said they welcomed the talks .
“ The government has kept all channels of communication open , ” said Homayun Hamidzada , a spokesman for Mr. Karzai .
“ This includes the Taliban and Hekmatyar . ”
There ’s no question that such talks are difficult .
But the Times piece underscores the vastly different approach between ( 1 ) escalating the war , sending tens of thousands more US troops in , and developing a village - by - village counterinsurgency effort , and ( 2 ) offering to exchange a pullout of US forces for a deal .
Part of the solution lies in the United States working closely with conservative , even pro-Taliban forces in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan ’s Sharif brothers , who are very close to the Saudis , have already taken the lead in setting up Taliban talks with Karzai ’s brother and other Afghan officials .
Part of the solution involves persuading India , Iran , and Russia — who supported the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance — to accept the notion of a coalition government in Kabul .
The United States might have to use some political capital with those three countries , and others , to bring them in .
But it ’s clear , now , that the Obama mantra — that we ca n’t talk to the Taliban until we ’ve gotten the upper hand militarily — is both wrong - headed and false .

January 6 , 2009 --
In a 1969 interview , then - Israeli PM Golda Meir , referring to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 , said : “ It is not as though there was a Palestinian people … and we came and threw them out and took their country …
They did not exist . ”
Of course , the Palestinian people did , and still do , exist .
This inconvenient fact helps explain why Israel is forced to continuously resort to brutal military force .
Meir herself was part of the Zionist leadership that threw out 800,000 Palestinians in 1948 and took 78 % of their country in a meticulously planned war to establish the new , exclusively - Jewish state in historic Palestine .
Palestinian villages and towns were systematically razed and new European - style communities built .
It is impossible to understand the current bloodbath in Gaza without understanding the inherently racist nature of Israel .
The slogan of Zionism ( the ideology that advocates an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine ) since it began in the 1890s has been , “ A land without people , for a people without land ” .
Making that slogan work means , by necessity , the Palestinians had to be viewed as non-people .
Ethnic cleansing
The ethnic cleansing that accompanied Israel ’s founding in 1948 was required because the Zionist project of creating a “ Jewish democracy ” in Palestine required a Jewish majority .
In October 1948 , Israel ’s first PM David Ben-Gurion declared with satisfaction : “ The Arabs of the land of Israel have only one function left to them — to run away . ”
The 1967 conquest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip ( the Occupied Palestinian Territories — OPT ) , which formed the 22 % of Palestine not conquered in 1948 , led to the exodus of a further 250,000 Palestinians .
Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan stated : “ We must understand the motives and causes of the continued emigration of the Arabs , from both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , and not to undermine these causes after all , we want to create a new map . ”
Thus the right of all refugees to return to their homeland remains a key demand of the Palestinian movement .
Much of the population of the territories occupied in 1967 were refugees from 1948 .
Today , 80 % of the population of the Gaza Strip ( the world ’s most densely populated area ) are , or are descended from , 1948 refugees driven from lands now within the borders of Israel .
When makeshift , homemade rockets are fired from Gaza into Israel , they hit land that , until just six decades ago , belonged to those firing them .
Israeli control of Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip exacerbated the contradictions inherent in the racist notion of a “ Jewish democracy ” .
For instance , while the half - million Jewish settlers currently living in the West Bank have full Israeli citizenship rights , this has been denied to the 4 million Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza .
Until the late 1980s , Israeli capitalism used Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza as a source of cheap labour .
However , since the Palestinian uprising known as the first intifada broke out , Israel has preferred to rely on the less rebellious guest workers from Africa , Asia and Eastern Europe , while confining the Palestinians of the 1967 - occupied territories to ghettos .
Palestinian ghettos
This process has underpinned the endless “ peace processes ” that have occurred since the signing of the 1993 Oslo Agreement .
The most the Palestinian negotiators have been offered is authority over a dozen geographically - separated walled - in ghettos , carved up by Jewish - only roads and “ security zones ” that annexed most of the West Bank .
The authority came with the demand that it be used to crush any Palestinian movement deemed a threat to Israel ’s interests .
The largest ghetto was created in 2005 when Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip , while retaining total control of airspace , coastal waters and the entry or exit of goods and people .
Sponsoring these “ peace processes ” have been the US and other Western powers , in particular the European Union .
Deprived of an economy , the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) that has governed the OPT with limited powers was made dependant on Western aid .
Western rhetoric stressed the “ promotion of democracy ” , which backfired in February 2006 , when Palestinians elected a coalition led by the Hamas party — rejecting the Fatah party of collaborationist PA president Mahmoud Abbas .
The Western reaction to the 2006 elections demonstrated a perspective identical to that of Israel : the only Palestinians who were suitable as “ partners for peace ” were those willing to collaborate in the annihilation of the Palestinians as a people .
Aid to the PA was suspended in the hope that this would encourage Palestinians to overthrow the leadership they had just elected .
Israel began the systematic abduction and assassination of elected Hamas representatives , with the West echoing the justification that Hamas members were , by definition , terrorists .
In June 2007 , the US sponsored a Fatah coup against the Hamas - led government .
While Abbas ’s collaborationist forces took control of the West Bank ghettos , in Gaza the US - armed Fatah gangs were defeated .
With Western support , the siege of Gaza became total .
Since then , there have been two Palestinian Authorities and no Palestinian state .
While the Hamas - led PA has been willing to enter into a permanent truce with Israel if it returns to its 1967 borders — and has observed many ceasefires since , none of which have been honoured by Israel — Hamas ’s refusal to recognise Israel ’s eternal right to exist as an exclusively Jewish state and unilaterally renounce Palestinians ’ right to resist occupation makes negotiations with it impossible in the eyes of the West and Israel .
The reaction of Western politicians and media to the current massacre in Gaza confirms that the West sees Palestinians the same way Israel does : as non-people with no right to exist .
Western support for the Zionist project is not new , but predates the establishment of Israel by three decades .
Israel ’s existence would be impossible without Western sponsorship .
Since 1948 US military aid to Israel has averaged almost US $ 4 billion a year .
The reason is the desire of the imperialist West , especially the US , for a loyal ally in the oil - rich Middle East that would defend its interests in return for support .
For Israel and the US , the relationship is mutually beneficial .
Imperialism
When Britain conquered Palestine in 1917 and Britain ’s then - foreign sectretary , Lord Balfour , proposed the establishment of a Jewish homeland there .
Balfour ’s motives were the same as those that inform Western support for Israel today : the creation of a pro-West “ beach - head ” in the Middle East .
The genocidal history of colonial - settler states such as the US , Canada and Australia provided the template .
Before World War II , there was little support among ordinary Jewish people for the Zionist project .
The Nazi Holocaust changed this .
Many of its victims had not previously thought of themselves as Jews ( being neither adherants of the Jewish religion or speakers of the European Jewish language , Yiddish ) but the Holocaust strengthened the notion of a Jewish race .
Second , the attempted extermination of Jews increased support for the concept of a land based on being Jewish as protection from anti-Semitism .
The refusal of the Western “ democracies ” to take large numbers of Jewish refugees reinforced this view .
Brutalised young men , who had grown up in the Nazi death camps , became the shock troops for the Zionist leadership in the ethnic cleansing of 1948 .
The horrors of the Holocaust not only provides the basis for the “ us against the world ” ideological indoctrination in Israel , it is central to the West ’s justification of its pro-Israel stance .
While in Balfour ’s day , racism needed no excuses in the West , the post - World War II anti-colonial movements ( and the US civil rights movement ) changed this — making explicit appeals to anti-Arab racism unpalatable .
The horrors of the Holocaust create an understandable sensitivity to accusations of anti-Semitism that is exploited by Israel and its Western imperialist backers to silence criticism of Israeli crimes .
Western politicians and media routinely accuse Hamas of denying the Nazi Holocaust took place .
This lie actually obscures the lessons Hamas has drawn from that tragedy .
In an April 17 Washington Post article , Mahmoud al - Zaher , Hamas negotiator and health minister , said : “ Resistance remains our only option .
Sixty - five years ago , the courageous Jews of the Warsaw ghetto rose in defense of their people .
We Gazans , living in the world ’s largest open - air prison , can do no less . ”
This is hardly Holocaust denial .
Zaher ’s argument was partly directed at collaborationist Palestinian leaders .
While the Warsaw Ghetto fighters — who had to deal with Jewish collaborators as well as the Nazis — suffered appalling casualties , their survival rate was higher than those who did not resist .
It is a doomed strategy to seek to collaborate with those who see you as “ sub - human exterminable filth ” , to use the Nazis ’ term .
While Israel and the West are less candid in their language , the extreme violence repeated continuously by Israel against the Palestinians since its founding shows clearly how the latter are viewed .
Equality
You would never know this from following the Western media , but all the main Palestinian factions , including Hamas , hold a position of full equality within the territory of historic Palestine between Jewish and non-Jewish people .
That is , the stated position of the Palestinians , including Hamas , is for equal rights .
If the West Bank , Gaza and Israel are taken together ( that is , historic Palestine ) , Palestinians and Jewish Israelis are roughly equal in number .
As many have pointed out , including Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu , the status quo of a state for one segment of people over and above other peoples is apartheid .
This means that solidarity campaigners should treat Israel as the anti-apartheid movement treated South Africa — as a rouge state .
If the US announced a cessation of military aid to Israel , the latter would be forced to end its violence .
The global solidarity movement needs to demand an end to Israeli apartheid and support the creation of a democratic , secular , multicultural state that belongs to all its people — where no one religion or race subjugates all others .

* German GDP shows biggest quarterly fall since unification
* G7 finance leaders gather in Rome to discuss global crisis
* Australia passes stimulus package after deal - making
* Markets react cautiously to hints of good news ( For more on the global financial crisis , click on )
By Dave Graham and James Grubel
BERLIN / CANBERRA , Feb 13 ( Reuters ) - Germany , Europe ’s biggest economy , registered its worst quarterly contraction since 1990 reunification on Friday , while Australia ’s parliament pushed through a stimulus deal to tackle global crisis .
German GDP data , which shrank 2.1 percent quarter - on - quarter at the end of 2008 , and a French prediction of a more than one percent contraction in 2009 help set a dismal tone for a meeting of G7 financial leaders in Rome this weekend .
The German Federal Statistics Office said the contraction was led by a decline in investment and net trade .
Since 1990 Germany ’s economy had never contracted by more than 1.2 percent in a quarter .
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Friday she expected 2009 to be a “ difficult ” year during which the economy would probably contract by more than 1 percent .
“ The first quarter will be difficult ...
We will have a difficult year , ” Lagarde told RTL radio .
She was speaking the day after the statistics office said French gross domestic product contracted by 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Economic recession , beginning with a banking crisis , is spreading quickly through all continents and undermining economies and threatening social order in developed and developing countries alike .
U.S PLANS DETAILED
More details emerged about plans to lift the U.S. economy out of recession , with a plan to subsidise mortgages raising hopes for a solution to the slump in the U.S. housing market which has reverberated around the world .
The U.S. Congress is due to vote on an economic stimulus bill later on Friday after Democratic leaders in both houses tied down final details of the deal , which includes about $ 507 billion in government spending and $ 282 billion in tax cuts .
While Congressional negotiators have agreed on the $ 789 billion stimulus plan for the world ’s largest economy , financial markets remain worried by the perceived lack of detail in U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s bank bailout proposal unveiled early this week .
Rescuing the banks is seen as crucial to economic recovery and a slowly emerging mortgage plan provided some late cheer on Thursday ahead of what was expected to be more dour offerings at the meeting G7 financial leaders in Rome this weekend .
Under the proposed U.S. mortgage plan , first reported by Reuters , mortgage companies would use a uniform eligibility test before a borrower becomes delinquent .
Economies around the world suffered after a sharp rise in U.S. mortgage delinquencies crippled credit markets and led banks to shy away from lending .
Asian shares on Friday reversed three sessions of losses during which investors had sought safe havens , with hopes rising that governments around the world were coming up with measures to cushion the worst of the global downturn .
The MSCI index of non-Japan Asia -Pacific stocks rose 1.4 percent by mid-afternoon , reversing a 3.5 percent fall in the previous three sessions .
Japan ’s Nikkei rose 1.5 percent , while stocks in Australia , Hong Kong , Singapore and Taiwan were all up about 1 percent , but doubts lingered .
“ The bank and economic measures by the U.S. government so far have lacked details and that is a problem .
What the market wants to know is how and by when the government will enact measures that prove to be effective , ” said Takahiko Murai , general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities .
But the bad news on Europe ’s economy , where Italy and the wider euro zone also report GDP figures on Friday , may dull the lustre .
AGGRESSIVE CUTS
Elsewhere last - minute deal - making saved Australia ’s A $ 42 billion ( 27.4 billion ) stimulus plan , with parliament passing the package after it was sweetened with about $ 1 billion in separate spending for Australia ’s ailing rivers wanted by a key independent senator .
The senator had joined with opposition lawmakers to oppose the package , the biggest ever launched in Australia , on Thursday .
Australia , boosted by Chinese demand for its commodities , has so far avoided following the United States , Japan and leading European economies into recession , but has had to apply aggressive interest rate cuts and other measures .
The stimulus will be worth about 2 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 and 1.3 percent in 2010 .
Treasury estimates it will lift growth by 0.5 points this financial year and 0.75 percent in 2009 / 10 .
The deal lifted the Australian dollar which climbed to $ 0.6560 from a low of $ 0.6446 earlier on Friday .
DEFLATION FEARS
With the Japan flirting with deflation , Bank of Japan Governor Masaki Shirakawa joined a growing chorus urging G7 finance leaders to take concrete steps to rescue the worsening global economy .
“ The world economy is in a very severe situation at the moment , so I want ( the G7 ) to frankly exchange views on economic conditions and the outlook and to discuss policy steps to help stabilise the world economy , ” Shirakawa told reporters in Tokyo .
The G7 leaders will begin gathering after sobering economic news from Europe .
Spain ’s economy shrank 1 percent quarter - on - quarter in the last three months of 2008 , sending it into recession for the first time since 1993 .
Protectionism has also become a big issue as world leaders try to rescue their economies , and a “ Buy America ” clause in the U.S. stimulus package likely will be a hot topic in Rome .
Have you heard of Bletchley Park ?
It ’s just north of London , where more than ten thousand men and women worked during WW2 to decode messages sent between the German forces , most notably by Hitler , and the German high command .
The cracking of the codes , the use of the intelligence gained and the subsequent related actions of the Allies is said to have shortened WW2 by two years possibly saving an estimated 22 million lives .
The vast majority of spam ( 83 per cent ) is linked to sites established through ten domain name registrars , according to a new study .
An analysis of junk mail messages by anti-spam firm Knujon ( " no junk " spelled backwards ) found that while there are 900 accredited domain name registrars , spammers register their spamvertised domains though only a tiny sample .
Knujon 's study names and shames the registrars who are contributing ( unwittingly or not ) to the junk mail problem .
XinNet Cyber Information Company Limited eNom Network Solutions Register.com Planet Online Regtime Ltd. OnlineNIC Inc. Spot Domain LLC Wild West Domains Hichina Web Solutions
Registrars made the list based on factors including : the number of reported illicit domains registered through a registrar , the number of spam messages associated with those domains , and the percentage of dodgy domains within a registrar 's total portfolio .
Knujon aims to convince registrars to clean up their act and dismantle spam sites .
It reckons that registrars appearing on the list are unlikely to be " criminal or evil " , but simply lacking in " effective controls and good policy " .
Registrars may lack adequate abuse staff or awareness of the problem , it adds .
At least part of the problem is caused by slack or unscrupulous resellers .
The list published by Knujon on Wednesday marks the second time the anti-spam outfit has looked into the domain registration aspect of the wider junk mail problem .
Second take
Knujon 's first list , released in May 2008 , also featured XinNet at the head of the chart .
Beijing Innovative Networks and Joker , second and fourth on the earlier list , were issued breach notices by ICANN .
Faced with the warning of having their accreditation pulled , both cleaned up their act .
Dynamic Dolphin has dropped off the lists following successful lawsuits against notorious spammer Scott Richter .
Directi , which charted at number nine last time around but no longer makes Knujon 's blacklist , probably made it onto the May list largely because of a contract with EstDomains .
Only XinNet ( top of the chart ) and eNom , Inc ( up from fifth to second ) make both editions of Knujon 's list .
" Neither company responded to this report , nor did they take verifiable steps to curb the cited abuses , " Knujon states .
" In the case of XinNet , their numbers were much worse than Beijing Innovative Networks , but for reasons unknown to us they were not issued a breach notice by ICANN even though we recommended it . "
According to the latest figures from Knujon , XinNet harboured 9,346 dodgy domains that threw out an average of 345 spam messages , while eNom was home to 32,610 ropey websites that spewed out an average of 39.7 junk mail messages .
Abused domains represent 0.9 per cent of XinNet 's portfolio .
Quizzed by Brian Krebs of the Washington Post 's Security Fix blog , XinNet stated it tries its best to " suspend all the sites which [ are ] abused by spammers " .
The Waledec worm reportedly makes exclusive use of domain registered through XinNet , but the Chinese firm failed to explain how it planned to tackle that issue in its response .
eNom and Spot Domain , two registrars named in the latest edition of the list , both questioned Knujon 's methodology and the reliability of its data . ®
There are two things the Army does really , really well .
The first , our assigned task , is kicking the shit out of the enemy ; weâÄôre really good at that .
The other thing we do almost equally well : waste taxpayersâÄô money .
The Army is a big , wasteful , bureaucratic monster .
If you want an accurate illustration of the Army , donâÄôt look to the ridiculous commercials or sensationalized Hollywood movies , open the newspaper to the funny pages and read âÄúBeetle BaileyâÄú âÄî itâÄôs a much more honest portrayal .
Though I never served in any other branch , they all follow the same bureaucratic model , and I think itâÄôs safe to assume that other branches are equally wasteful , just on a smaller scale .
In trying economic times such as these , when nearly all American institutions are being forced to deal with massive budget restraints ( the University of Minnesota , for example ) and the collective American individual is tightening their belt , so too should our governmentâÄôs largest bureaucracies ( i.e. our military branches ) .
Yet our defense budget continues to increase âÄî a $ 35 billion increase in 2009 and tens of billions projected increase in 2010 âÄî and our military , for some reason , is exempt from the same fiscal prudence .
ItâÄôs a curious irony ; large inefficient government receives so much criticism from fiscal conservatives , yet their even larger , doubly inefficient cousin , the military , hardly ever receives the same negative appraisal .
While it enjoys the same endless tax dollars as health and human services programs , it does not have to endure the same scrutiny as to where those tax dollars go .
Last weekend , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass , chairman of the financial services committee , inquired to his Republican colleagues on âÄúMeet The PressâÄ ù why our government continues to spend $ 22 billion on an outdated and unnecessary F - 22 fighter jet program .
This program was initiated during the Cold War with the objective of defeating the Soviets in a ground conflict .
Being that the Cold War has been over for like , what , 20 years now , one would think the program would have been cut .
But no , because it falls under the sprawling , mostly unaccountable umbrella of âÄúdefense spending , âÄ ù it enjoys immunity from common sense .
The other side of the table didnâÄôt even bother to justify the question with a response .
They know that the American people like their defense spending and that the military is the one branch of government where Americans donâÄôt really mind waste .
Host David Gregory moved on to another question and the issue was gone .
To my knowledge the proposal hasnâÄôt gotten any mainstream ink and weâÄôll just keep throwing money at a useless project .
For a low - level Army grunt like myself , this is called âÄúfraud , waste and abuse .
âÄ ù
Our superiors instruct us to immediately report it up the chain - of - command .
The Army is like a woman in this way ; it says one thing and means another .
For six of the 16 months I was in Iraq , I was a desk jockey , working in an office charged with tracking vehicle repairs and ordering parts .
I personally wasted at least $ 50,000 ordering unnecessary or mistaken vehicle parts .
When I approached my commander to tell him that the motor pool and my office was wasting enormous amounts of money , he looked at me like I was naÃ¯ve , explaining that in the Army , such waste was just âÄ ú the nature of the beast .
âÄù Great leadership , sir .
WhatâÄôs worse , and more irksome to the common foot soldier , is gross misuse of government property , i.e. the troops .
My fellow Red Bulls who endured the same 22 - month deployment know what IâÄôm talking about .
Before deploying , roughly 5,000 of us spent six months âÄútrainingâÄ ù at the insufferable wasteland that is Camp Shelby , Miss .
Out of the 180 days spent on that godforsaken post , less than 30 were actually spent training ( a more than generous estimate ) .
So for more than five months taxpayers paid to house , feed and bore 5,000 troops .
Essentially , paying us to eat and workout , if you take just our salaries , it costs taxpayers more than $ 15 million a month .
But telling of only internal cases of negligence and squander would not tell the whole story .
Our militaryâÄôs contracts with civilian companies are equally egregious .
In Iraq , Afghanistan and anywhere else our military is abroad , Kellogg Brown and Root , formally a subsidiary of Halliburton ( yeah , the evil Cheney corporation ) is serving our troops in various capacities .
Anyone whoâÄôs been deployed and gathered a sense of our relationship with KBR will tell you that Uncle Sam is getting ripped off .
For example , of the 155,000 troops serving in Iraq right now , most of them drop their laundry with KBR âÄî letâÄôs say 100,000 troops , a modest estimate .
For all those troops and each bag of laundry , KBR charges our government $ 100 .
ThatâÄôs $ 100 to wash six pairs of socks , four pairs of underwear and a couple uniforms .
Do the math on that and American taxpayers are spending $ 10 million a week and $ 520 million a year to wash our soldierâÄôs dirty laundry .
I know in the age of trillion dollar bailouts half a billion dollars doesnâÄôt seem like much , but this is just one small example and inflated contract agreements define our governmentâÄôs relationship with KBR .
Given that the buddies of the bigwigs at Haliburton formerly ran the country , this type of gross thievery of American taxpayers was understandable , even if it was deplorable .
Now that thereâÄôs a new administration , thereâÄôs no reason for this to continue .
I know that the examples offered here are parts of the supplementary war cost and not included in the defense budget .
Yet they are representative of an organization thatâÄôs lost all sense of fiscal responsibility and in need of an overhaul .
To my new commander - in - chief , I say itâÄôs time for our military to get in line with the rest of the country , and tighten its belt .

There are several songs going by the title , “ The Beer Song ” .
We ’ll bring you just one version today , which is a favorite of animators on YouTube .
I am not sure who to attribute this song to , as it seems to be the source of disagreement on the internets .
Some say DVDA , others They Might be Giants , and still others claim Weird Al Yankovic .
Either way , something about Warcraft characters and Legos singing and dancing about Beer makes me happy on a dreary afternoon .

The amazing Joachim Ante from Unity3D wrote me to tell me that Cartoon Network 's new browser - based MMO for kids FusionFall has finally launched to the public .
Fusion Fall takes advantage of many new features in Unity3D for creating large worlds .
I live blogged some of the details as Joachim presented them at the Unite Conference .
Unity uses the Mono runtime on both Windows and MacOS and it might become one of the largest deployment vehicles for the Mono VM .
There is an air of coolness in the fact that Mono is being used on Windows instead of .
NET .
And part of it has to do with the fact that Mono 's open source engine allowed Unity to modify it to suit their very specific needs .
As I mentioned at my PDC talk , the .NET engine is fantastic , but up until Mono only Microsoft was in a position to reshape .NET into different forms ( Silverlight and Mesh both use a special trimmed - down . NET called CoreCLR ) .
I would love to see a world where people take Mono ( or chunks of Mono ) tune it and shape it to suit their needs .
Congratulations to the team at Unity for a job well done , and to the team that produced FusionFall .
You can see the introduction video :
One thing that stands out in FusionFall is that it shows what a big creative budget can do with Unity .
Go Mono gaming , Go !
If crucial climate negotiations later this year in Copenhagen are to have any chance of success , the US must take the lead , write Michael Northrop and David Sassoon from Yale Environment 360 , part of the Guardian Environment Network
President Obama will face one of the most important moments of his presidency this year on Dec. 18 , and he needs his entire cabinet to help him prepare for it over the next 11 months .
Dec. 18 is the final day of the global climate meetings in Copenhagen , a day that will signify whether the world community has finally mustered the will to rein in soaring greenhouse gas emissions .
That fixed date , combined with escalating scientific urgency and unparalleled political opportunity , make 2009 the do - or - die year for comprehensive federal climate action .
Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , says that emissions must be stabilized by 2015 and in decline by 2020 .
Science , in its rightful place , can tolerate no further delay .
For Obama , the political winds at his back are now as favorable as they will ever be .
He is in a position to seize 2009 and do three things to meet the climate challenge : properly educate the American public about climate change and the need for immediate action ; exercise the full might of his executive powers and regulatory discretion under the Clean Air Act to jump - start action ; and spend freely from his enormous store of political capital to lead the government to enact comprehensive federal climate legislation .
If he does , the United States will reclaim the mantle of global leadership when it takes its seat in Copenhagen .
After eight years of U.S. inaction on climate change , American leadership offers the only hope of success .
Even if President Obama himself decides to attend the talks — and hopefully he will — his mission will fail unless he carries with him a year 's worth of demonstrated results to lend weight and credibility to the promise he made in his inaugural address to " roll back the specter of a warming planet . "
In Copenhagen , his inspiring oratory alone will not be sufficient ; he must demonstrate how science has been restored " to its rightful place " in America in strong climate regulation and law .
For almost a decade , Americans have been purposefully led astray about the reality of global warming and about the positive relationship that exists between sustainable economic prosperity and environmental stewardship .
The new president must use the bully pulpit of his office to provide quick and remedial education .
Obama has well chosen his scientific team in John Holdren , the White House science adviser ; Jane Lubchenco , the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ; and Energy Secretary Steven Chu , and he should empower them and other government scientists to speak loudly , unequivocally , and frequently to the American public about the true science of climate change and the urgency of our present circumstances .
The latest science only underscores the need for immediate action , given the acceleration of global ice melt , extreme weather events , dangerous feedback loops , and potentially irreversible changes .
The president must also instruct his cabinet to clarify the impact of global climate change on each of their respective portfolios .
Global warming has been crammed into a " green " box for the sake of political expediency .
Instead , it must be appreciated for its cross-cutting immensity — it is fundamental to national security , global commerce , economic recovery , energy security , public health and safety , agricultural policy , land - use planning , and environmental protection .
Obama must also make a prime - time , televised address to the nation about the climate crisis and the need for immediate action and U.S. global leadership .
Such a speech would send a clear signal to the American public and the political establishment and prepare them to come together with the nations of the world in Copenhagen to meet this grave challenge .
Simultaneously , the president must travel to Copenhagen with real regulatory and legislative achievements .
Signs are good that Obama genuinely means business .
He is talking frequently about energy and climate change , and his economic recovery package makes important commitments toward green jobs , clean energy , and energy efficiency — $ 54 billion worth .
This is more than a third of the $ 150 billion he promised over the next 10 years for clean energy investments , so if the package survives its passage through Congress , he will be ahead of schedule on that score .
By itself , though , this investment inside a trillion dollar package merely colors the economic recovery with a pale green hue .
It is not an energy and climate plan , and Obama will still face heavy regulatory and legislative lifting to turn promise into reality before Copenhagen .
Expectations are high that he will exercise the executive authority he already has under the Clean Air Act to achieve some quick victories and put pressure on Congress to act boldly .
With former EPA chief Carol Browner heading up his climate team in the White House , Obama has tapped the talent he needs to implement a powerful regulatory strategy .
As expected , the EPA 's first order of climate business is already moving forward : granting a long - delayed waiver to California to allow the state to impose more stringent auto emissions rules , which 13 other states are poised to adopt as well .
Manufacturers will soon have to deliver higher mileage vehicles on an accelerated schedule .
By approving the waiver after a formal review process , EPA administrator Lisa Jackson will guarantee steep future emissions reductions from the transportation sector , and allow the thorny bailout of Detroit to proceed without any doubt as to where the industry must head , despite currently low fuel prices .
The boldness of Obama 's regulatory strategy , however , really hinges upon the fate of coal - burning power plants under the Clean Air Act .
Since the Supreme Court affirmed in Massachusetts v. EPA that carbon dioxide could be regulated as a pollutant under the law , it has become an open question as to how existing coal plants and permits for new ones will now fare under the act .
The EPA plainly has the right to control CO2 emissions , and the real issue is how aggressively the law will be applied .
In the short term , the question of coal rests largely in Obama 's hands , and he has the authority to stop new dirty coal plants cold .
He proved it his first week in office when the EPA revoked an air permit for the Big Stone II coal plant in South Dakota , pending further review .
If that first signal gets amplified , it will certainly change the tone of what happens with coal in Congress longer - term , where powerful lobbies have held science at bay .
The president 's executive action on coal will invigorate Copenhagen and bring seriousness to bilateral discussions with China , the world 's coal juggernaut .
At his direction , the Clean Air Act can jump - start climate action by speeding aggressive federal standards for building and appliance efficiency and placing limits on other carbon - intensive sources of pollution — steel mills , cement plants , other heavy industries , and shipping .
Coming to Copenhagen with the necessary legislative accomplishments — in addition to regulatory ones — will be harder still , but it is essential to Obama 's success .
The proposed economic recovery package has been disappointing to advocates of public transit , light rail , and smart growth , with sparse dollars allocated to those needs .
But with the federal Transportation Bill up for reauthorization in 2009 , Obama has another chance to redirect land use away from highway sprawl and in a low - carbon , mass - transit direction .
The administration should also strengthen energy efficiency incentives and clean energy tax credits , adopt a mandatory federal renewable energy target , and increase investment in a clean energy grid .
To secure his crowning achievement , Obama must expend political capital in Congress and work with leaders there to complete passage of science - based federal legislation capping greenhouse gas emissions .
The legislation must be signed into law this year , as delay into 2010 will wreck it on the shoals of mid-term elections , a time when political courage disappears .
There will not be another political opportunity as ripe as now ; nor will there be another financial context more sensitive to a strong new signal .
As the global economy starts to rise from collapse , it must do so with a price on carbon as part of its cure .
There is considerable debate about the form which a cap and a price signal should take — in recent weeks a carbon tax has even been a topic of renewed discussion .
None of the options is perfect , but one of them is rising as a preferred choice because it protects low - and middle - income families from rising energy prices .
It 's called " cap- and - dividend . "
Under this program , permits to pollute the air with greenhouse gases would be auctioned and the proceeds returned to citizens .
The extra income , which should be targeted especially to the poor , will protect the most vulnerable American families from rising energy prices and will help build a long - term constituency for climate action .
In the present economic crisis , the prospect of sending monthly dividend checks to families is a political winner .
It makes a cap - and - dividend plan largely immune from criticism that it will be costly to the public , and it increases the chances of passage this year .
Many believe it may be necessary to reserve some portion of the auction revenues for investments in clean energy programs at home and in adaptation and technology transfers abroad .
Whether the allocations should be shared and what the right ratios ought to be will be the subject of intense political negotiation on Capitol Hill .
Still , cap - and - dividend provides the best point of departure because it creates a fundamental break with business - as - usual .
It establishes a new , winning , cognitive frame of reference : the democratic principle that an equal share of the sky belongs to each person .
Indeed , Peter Barnes , who originally formulated this concept and has championed it tirelessly , began by asking a simple question :
Who owns the sky ?
Without a price signal , nobody does , and global warming pollution will proceed essentially unchecked .
With cap - and - dividend , everybody owns the sky and the emissions cap then becomes universally comprehensible as it begins to turn us toward a low - carbon future .
This American accomplishment , brought by President Obama to Copenhagen along with other concrete actions , would set the stage for passage of a comprehensive international treaty to slow global warming .
Now is the year for President Obama to act , while the window of opportunity is wide open .

The latest reports from bushfire ravaged Victoria indicate the death toll may be over 100 .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd warned the nation to “ prepare itself for even worse news ” as authorities are still unable to account for dozens , possibly hundreds of people in the chaos left by the fires that have ravaged some 400,000 hectares ( 988,000 acres ) of the State .
Among the missing dead this evening is former popular Channel 9 newsreader Brian Naylor .
The Country Fire Authority continues to fight fires on several fronts , including a fire threatening the Loy Yang power station which provides power to Melbourne ( I ’m still typing this , so the lights are still on in Melbourne at 9:30 pm AEDT ) .
The Kinglake fire is currently threatening Taggerty and Yea .
A fire that was earlier threatening Beechworth is still of concern .
Disgustingly , arsonists are being blamed for at least some of the fires , with reports that fires that had been successfully put out had later been re-lit .
Over 3,700 evacuated residents have registered with the Red Cross , with many more expected , and hospitals in Melbourne have been inundated with burns cases , many of them severe .
If you ’re concerned about loved ones , with Australian the line for information is 1800 727 077 .

Here ’s a map of the latest fire fronts , and recorded deaths :
During the final months of 2008 , as the financial markets imploded , talk on trading desks turned to food and water stockpiles , generators , guns , and high - speed inflatable boats .
“ The system really was about six hours from failing , ” says Gene Lange , a manager at a midtown hedge fund , referring to the week in September when Lehman went bust and AIG had to be bailed out .
“ When you think about how close we were to the precipice , I do n’t think it necessarily makes a guy crazy to prepare for the potential worst - case scenario . ”
Preparations , in Lange ’s case , include a storeroom in his basement in New Jersey stacked high with enough food , water , diapers , and other necessities to last his family six months ; a biometric safe to hold his guns ; and a 1985 ex-military Chevy K5 Blazer that runs on diesel and is currently being retrofitted for off - road travel .
He has also entertained the idea of putting an inflatable speedboat in a storage unit on the West Side , so he could get off the island quickly , and is currently considering purchasing a remote farm where he could hunker down .
“ If there ’s a financial - system breakdown , it could take a year to reset the system , and in that time , what ’s going to happen ? ” asks Lange .
If New York turns into a scene out of I Am Legend , he wants to be ready .
He ’s not the only one .
In his book Wealth , War , published last year , former Morgan Stanley chief global strategist Barton Biggs advised people to prepare for the possibility of a total breakdown of civil society .
A senior analyst whose reports are read at hedge funds all over the city wrote just before Christmas that some of his clients are “ so bearish they ’ve purchased firearms and safes and are stocking their pantries with soups and canned foods . ”
This fear is very much reflected in the market — prices of corporate bonds have been so beaten down at various points that they suggest a higher default rate than during the Great Depression .
Meanwhile , while the overall gold market has fluctuated , the premium for quarter - ounce gold coins — meaning the difference between the price for gold you can hold in your hand and that for “ paper gold , ” such as exchange - traded funds — rose to an all - time high of 20 percent .
“ Gold is transportable , it ’s 100 percent liquid , and it ’s perfectly divisible in the context of ounces , bars , or coins , ” says the head of a California research firm who keeps a supply of it , along with food , water , and guns , on hand .
“ And most important , there ’s no counterparty ” — i.e. , it ’s an investment beholden to no one , and perhaps one of the few assets that will retain value if the financial system collapses .
While it may look like these Wall Streeters are betting on such a collapse , their embrace of survivalism is an outgrowth of their professional habits of mind :
Having observed the economy ’s shaky high - wire act from their ringside seats , they are trying to manage their risk and “ hedge ” against a potential fall .
“ It ’s like insurance , ” says an investor who has stockpiled MREs and a hand - cranked radio .
“ And by the time you need it , it ’s way too late . ”
Leave it for others to weep for the collapse of the social order .
These guys would prefer to be in a high - speed boat or ex-military vehicle , heading off toward their fully provisioned compounds in pursuit of the ultimate goal : to win the chaos .
American Twitter users are predominately young , poor , blog - centric , social - network - happy urbanites who like to read the news on their mobile devices , according to the The Pew Internet and American Life Project .
The PIAP released a report yesterday called " Twitter and Status Updating " that discusses who uses Twitter or similar services , and how that choice impacts their daily life .
According to the paper , only 11 percent of online American adults are Tweeting , but their average age is much higher than other social network users and they have a preference for mobile technology .
The Pew Center researchers arrived at their numbers by conducting phone interviews with 2,253 adult Americans ( 502 of which were on a cell phone ) between November 19 , 2008 and December 20 , 2008 .
An important note : Pew's ( and my ) references to " Twitter users " really means anyone who regularly updates her or his status through any number of services such as Twitter , Yammer , Facebook , MySpace , or even Linked In .
Perhaps we should give them a more generic name like status updaters , but Twitter users or Tweeters sounds so much better , do n't you think ?
Portrait of a Tweeter
Surprisingly , and unlike many other social networks , the average Tweeter is 31 .
By comparison , MySpace has an average age of 27 ; Facebook is a little younger at 26 ; while LinkedIn is the social network of choice for those in their 40s .
In the tweetosphere , 25 - to 34 - year - olds hold a slight majority over 19 - to 24 - year - olds by about 1 percent .
With age comes money in our society , and that litle tidbit of truthiness is reflected among tweeters as well .
According to PIAP , 17 percent of adult Internet users who make $ 30,000 or less also tweet , while only 10 percent of households making $ 75,000 or more broadcast their status into cyberspace .
This is not particularly suprising as the memo points out , since the younger generation typically earns less money than older folks .
Tweeters are also more ethnically diverse and more likely to live in a city .
Neither statistic is suprising as American youths are more ethnically diverse than older Americans .
Twitter most likely appeals more to those in the urban jungle because city social lives are typically more active and less centralized than in rural areas .
Tweeters embrace social media
What I found most interesting from the PIAP memo was the fact that tweeters are using their status updates as one piece of a much larger social media landscape .
In other words , Twitter is an add - on for other social media .
This is not all that surprising , since Twitter welcomes third - party developers to create other uses for Twitter , such as broadcasting your tweets into your Facebook status , blog , or other web page .
About 23 percent of social network users tweet , with only 4 percent of non-social networkers do the same .
Tweeters are also more likely to consume and read blogs than other Internet users .
Fifty - seven percent of tweeters have read a blog , and 21 percent said yes when asked if they read a blog yesterday .
By comparison , only 9 percent of non-tweeters said they read a blog yesterday and only 29 percent have ever read a blog .
The statistic gets even wider when talking about blog creators : 29 percent of tweeters have created a blog , while only 11 percent of the Twitterless have ventured into the world of Wordpress and Moveable Type .
Other Tweeter facts
The PIAP memo also says that tweeters are big on wireless devices , including laptops , cell phones , smartphones , and PDAs .
They are more likely to read the news online and typically they 'll do it on a mobile device .
Tweeting is a great way to share a news story or some other little tidbit you found on the internet .
Services like TinyURL or Snurl also make it easier to Tweet your discoveries since they shorten long web addresses , allowing tweeters to maxmize their 140 character per message limit .
Tweeters may only make up a small percentage of online users at the moment , but I wonder if this is a trend that is likely to continue and expand .
Recenlty , NPR's
On The Media took a trip to Japan to study the Japanese love affair with mobile devices .
The Japanese use their phone regularly for everything from boarding a plane to paying for simple purchases ; most interestingly , however , the mobile device is the primary and sometimes only gateway onto the Internet for the average Japanese citizen .
There are a variety of reasons for this including the way their digital culture developed and financial constraints , but I wonder if U.S. tweeters are simply ahead of the curve and one day , like the Japanese , Americans will give up their personal computers and get online primarily through their BlackBerrys and iPhones .
Last week the U.S. government ’s debt exceeded the debt ceiling of $ 8.18 trillion , passing $ 8.19 trillion as of Thursday , putting the government in technical default .
Put in simple terms you and I can understand , the government went over its limit .
The statutory debt ceiling is the maximum amount that the U.S. government can by law borrow in order to pay ongoing expenses .
On Thursday the public debt reached $ 8,190,567,748,779.48 .
Public debt , of course , is just a euphemism that means , one way or another , you and I are going to get taken to the cleaners .
“ Since the debt ceiling has been raised 50 times over the past 40 years , hoping for some rational debate on the matter would be an extravagant indulgence , ” wrote economist Dr. Chris Martenson .
“ Time spent wishing pigs could fly would offer a far better potential return . ”
In other words , the government is spending too much money , and whenever it maxes out its credit line , it just goes and gets more credit .
As it stands , the government can barely pay the interest on the national debt .
If you and I did that , we ’d be called fiscally irresponsible at the least .
As those of you who have been deeply in debt know , the last thing you do is go and borrow more money and spend even more money .
Instead , it ’s time for debt consolidation and some belt tightening .
Stephen VanDyke notes the government ’s financial situation is likely to get worse .
“ Between now and whenever Congress finally notices that the government is in technical default , if the funds from shuffling money out of other investments run dry , it ’s very likely the U.S. will move from technical default to active default , ” he wrote .
The answer to this , of course , is for the federal governemnt to stop spending trillions on programs that should be run by the states instead , or not exist at all , and stop spending even more trillions trying to regulate our personal lives .

Lavish displays of synchronised swimming and extravagant rallies mark one of secretive nation 's biggest public holidays
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
North Korea today celebrated the birthday of its leader , Kim Jong - il , with lavish displays of synchronised swimming , extravagant rallies and the customary paeans in the state - owned media .
However , there were no reports that the 67 - year - old had appeared in public , fuelling speculation that he has not fully recovered from a stroke he apparently suffered last summer .
His birthday celebrations came amid fears abroad that Pyongyang plans to stage a missile test .
There are growing concerns that the country is preparing to test a long - range missile , following surveillance reports of long objects being moved towards the coast and of Chinese ships vacating the area .
The official Korean Central news agency ( KCNA ) reported earlier today that Pyongyang would press ahead with a launch , saying it was part of a space programme .
On the inter -Korean border , defectors and activists in South Korea flew tens of thousands of anti-Kim leaflets to the North by balloon , ignoring a warning from their government that the campaign could provoke Pyongyang .
Activists put North Korean cash into some of the vinyl leaflets in an effort to entice North Koreans to read their calls for an uprising against Kim .
Suzanne Scholte , the chairwoman of the North Korea Freedom Coalition , based in the US , said the leaflet campaign was a way of providing North Koreans with " true information about their circumstances " .
" It is more important than ever that North Koreans realise that the greatest threat to their well - being and security is their own dear leader , " she said during the leafleting campaign at the border town of Imjingak .
Inside the North , the KCNA reported a surge of congratulatory messages and gifts flooding in from overseas for Kim .
Streets and villages in North Korea had been festooned with flowers and other decorations to mark the anniversary , and the country was overflowing with " warm wishes " for the leader , the agency said .
" Comrade Kim Jong-il is a great politician , a heaven - made commander and an affectionate father who safeguards and illuminates the fate of our nation and people , " the country 's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a lengthy editorial .
" We have to sincerely uphold the dear general 's military - first leadership . "
Kim 's birthday is one of the North 's biggest national holidays , along with that of his late father and national founder Kim Il - sung , who died in 1994 .
His apparent stroke last year has raised concerns about possible instability in the totalitarian nation in case he is incapacitated , because he has not named any of his three sons as a successor .

Corey Gilgannon / The New York Times
“ I served this country as a U.S. marine , and now I got to watch it go down the tubes because we let anybody in , without no rhyme or reason , ” said Jim Behan , 67 , as he stood on West 72nd Street holding up a large sign with the words , “ Illegal Immigration — No Order , No Border , No Nation . ”
Mr. Behan wears battle fatigues .
After all , he is truly in the trenches here in this Upper West Side hub , where many disagree with his hard - line “ close the borders ” view .
He says he gets more than his fair share of nasty comments from passers - by .
“ Oh , you would n’t believe the things they say — it ’d curl your hair , ” he said at the spot on Saturday afternoon .
“ ‘ You ’re the reason this country ’s in such bad shape . ’
They absolutely hate me .
But my opinion is , there ’s no order at our borders , and it ’s ruining us as a country .
I ’m upset that our leaders have not enforced the laws of our country , and Obama ’s going to be a disaster . ”
Mr. Behan lives a block away , in a furnished room on West 71st Street , and his $ 70 - a - week rent is regulated by state law .
He said he was a New York City employee , first for the Department of Sanitation , and later for the Department of Transportation , on the Staten Island Ferry .
Now he lives on a partial pension and Social Security , he said , and spends many days holding up his sign to enlighten the naïve Upper West Siders .
“ Yeah , you got mostly liberals up here , but I do get some people who say , ‘ I agree with you , ’ ” said Mr. Behan , who wore a shamrock - insignia pinky ring .
He said his parents were born in Brooklyn , both the children of Irish immigrants .
They raised him in College Point , Queens , where they owned a bar and restaurant where he worked , he said .
“ They walk by and give me the finger –- my own people , the Irish , ” he said .
The scars left on Mr Robinson 's body
Enlarge Image
A woman carved her name into her lover 's arm as he slept at her home after a drunken fling , a court heard .
Dominique Fisher , 22 , of Roebuck Close in Blackburn , used a craft knife to write her name on Wayne Robinson 's arm .
Mr Robinson told Preston Crown Court he had taken sleeping pills , had been drinking and was not awake during the incident on 14 June 2008 .
Fisher was found guilty of one charge of unlawful wounding on Monday and is to be sentenced on 27 February .
She had also slashed Mr Robinson 's arm and shoulder and carved a star in his back during the attack .
The families of those who died on 11 September thought they could not possibly feel any more pain .
That was before the release of the videotape showing Osama Bin Laden expressing pleasure that the attacks on America had gone even better than he hoped .
After seeing that tape , I have never hated anyone more , I hate him and all that he stands for
Brother of victim
On the tape he is heard saying that he had not anticipated the Twin Towers would collapse , killing so many people .
In New York , still grieving over the loss of 3,000 people at the World Trade Center , the words prompted disgust and revulsion .
The release of the tape had been anticipated for a day or two , and Americans were waiting to see what was described as the final proof of Bin Laden 's guilt .
In Times Square , people stopped in the street to watch the broadcast on television screens that usually convey information about the financial markets .
There were similar scenes in offices and department stores across Manhattan .
For the most part , the broadcast was watched in silent anger .
Some relatives of people who died in the attacks said later that while they recognised the importance of the tape , they could not bring themselves to watch it .
One who did view it was Patrick Cartier , whose 26 - year - old brother James was killed when the Twin Towers collapsed .
" If this tape does not convince every nation that Osama Bin Laden is the perpetrator of evil , then nothing will , " he told BBC News Online .
" He sent his own people to die in the attacks on America , and he did n't even tell them , " he said , adding , " After seeing that tape , I have never hated anyone more .
I hate him and all that he stands for . "
Justification
President George W Bush revealed that he was hesitant about authorising the release of the tape because he knew it would be a vivid reminder to many people of their loss .
But he also knew it would be " a devastating declaration " of Bin Laden 's guilt .
" We 're going to get him , " said Mr Bush .
" Dead or alive , it does n't matter to me . "
The president 's justification for releasing the tape seems to have been accepted by most Americans .
They accept their government 's assertion that it is compelling evidence of Bin Laden 's guilt , and a demonstration to the rest of the world of the need to support the " war against terrorism " .
Undoubted authenticity
Rabbi Joseph Potasnik , the Jewish chaplain to New York 's fire department , said the tape was a re-confirmation of where responsibility lay for the attacks on 11 September .
" We have seen Middle Eastern groups cheering as blood was spilling , " he told BBC News Online .
" I do not think any of us can fully fathom the maniacal madness of a person who can rejoice at the savage slaughter of human beings , " he said .
But on the streets of New York today , there were still a few lingering doubts about the authenticity of the tape .
Pam , visiting the city from Texas , said the tape could be a smoking gun that would change views in the Islamic world .
But she went on :
" I still have doubts about the tape 's validity .
You just do n't know who is telling the truth .
People are saying there can be different translations of Arabic , so I am fairly sceptical . "
Mark Dean , a streaming video director from San Francisco , said he did not always believe the US Government , but thought the tape was probably genuine .
" If it is real , it is astonishing that this guy shows no concern for the thousands of people he condemned to die , " he told BBC News Online , adding , " To be so blasé about it is unbelievable . "
Geri Schwartz , a college lecturer from Long Island , had absolutely no doubts about the authenticity of the tape .
" I think it is disgusting , " she said , adding , " It makes you sick just to hear him .
I hate him ... it was like he was gloating . "
" I think we have to get Bin Laden and all the terrorist groups associated with him .
If we do n't , then in time they will start up again , " she said .
SFPark is the largest dynamic parking demand management project in the world , with 6,000 curbside parking spaces and 11,500 off - street spaces in city - owned garages .
The pilot will last for a year - and - a - half and focus on seven target areas , most in the downtown business district and tourist areas along the Embarcadero and Fisherman 's Wharf .
Assuming the time line is n't delayed , the MTA will release a request for proposals by the end of January for vendors to install the technology required to map parking patterns in the pilot areas .
With $ 19.8 million in federal funding from San Francisco 's Urban Partnerhip Agreement set to roll into city coffers in February , the MTA will install meters , sensors and networks within two months and start collecting baseline data in May .
After sixty days , parking managers will start adjusting parking rates , which by law can be raised by no more than $ .50 / hour every 30 days in the pilot zones ; the control zones will not see any change in pricing throughout the trial .
Jay Primus , the MTA 's SFPark project leader , believes the public outreach that has already occurred with businesses , transportation experts , environmental advocates , and community stakeholders will facilitate its acceptance .
If the pilot works as projected , Primus said the MTA expects the rate of parking fines will be reduced .
Though San Francisco 's parking fines are 57 % of parking revenues ( PDF , page 3 ) - - a far cry from New York City 's parking woes , where parking fines are half a billion dollars annually and more than 500 % of parking revenues -- the agency hopes to fulfill its mandate to voters to improve the management of city streets .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
An Italian woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose right - to - die case was being debated in the Italian Parliament has died days after doctors began removing her feeding tube .
A portrait of Eluana Englaro .
She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years .
The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro , 37 , Monday night , then called for a moment of silence in the chamber .
Even as the silence ended , one legislator declared , " She has not died -- she was killed , " prompting other right - to - die opponents to join in with calls of " Murderers ! "
Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years , after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash , when she was 20 years old .
For years , Englaro 's father , Beppino , fought to have her feeding tube removed , saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter 's life .
He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she did n't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state .
Confirming his daughter 's death Monday , Beppino Englaro told Italian media : " Yes , she is no longer with us , but I do n't want to say anything further .
I need to be left alone . "
But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on .
Watch as Italians protest against her death »
When Englaro 's death was announced , the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients , and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes .
Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament .
Last year , a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed , and Italy 's high court upheld the ruling on appeal .
Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic , where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process .
A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy 's Council of Ministers , with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort .
" I will do everything I can to save her life , " Berlusconi said .
" We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying . "
But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree .
According to a statement from Napolitano 's office , " An emergency decree can not be in contrast with a court decision . "
The case has been a controversial one in Italy , a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence .
Earlier this month , Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that " euthanasia is a false solution to suffering . "
Monsignor Elio Sgreccia , president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life , said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive .
" It is the duty of the doctors , of society , and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive .
No one has the right to take her life away from her , " he said .
Euthanasia is illegal in Italy , but patients have the right to refuse treatment .
It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die , because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment , he said .
All About Euthanasia
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she 'll meet someone , fall in love and get married .
But when her wedding day comes , her husband wo n't see her eyes , and she wo n't see her husband .
Bahrami is blind , the victim of an acid attack by a spurned suitor .
Ameneh Bahrami said her attacker pestered her with marriage demands .
If she gets her way , her attacker will suffer the same fate .
The 31 - year - old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of " an eye for an eye , " and , in accordance with Islamic law , she wants to blind Majid Movahedi , the man who blinded her .
" I do n't want to blind him for revenge , " Bahrami said in her parents '
Tehran apartment .
" I 'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else . "
Bahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002 , when they attended the same university .
She was a 24 - year - old electronics student .
He was 19 .
She never noticed him until they shared a class .
He sat next to her one day and brushed up against her .
Bahrami says she knew it was n't an accident .
" I moved away from him , " she said , " but he brushed up against me again . "
Watch Bahrami return to the attack scene for the first time »
When Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop , Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence .
He would n't stay silent for long .
Bahrami said that over the next two years , Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats , even as he asked her to marry him .
" He told me he would kill me .
He said , ' You have to say yes . ' "
On a November afternoon in 2004 , Movahedi 's threats turned to violence .
That day at 4:30 p.m. , Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked .
As she walked to the bus stop , she remembers sensing someone behind her .
She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi .
A moment later came the agonizing pain .
Movahedi had thrown something over her .
What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin .
" I was just yelling , ' I 'm burning !
I 'm burning !
For God 's sake , somebody help me ! ' "
The acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth .
When she covered her face with her hands , streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms .
Watch how the still - pungent acid destroyed Bahrami 's clothes »
Two weeks after the attack , Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court .
He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along .
Bahrami's lawyer , Ali Sarrafi , said Movahedi had never shown any remorse .
" He says he did it because he loved her , " Sarrafi said .
Attack victims in Iran usually accept " blood money " : a fine in lieu of harsh punishment .
With no insurance and mounting medical bills , Bahrami could 've used the cash , but she said no .
" I told the judge I want an eye for an eye , " Bahrami said .
" People like him should be made to feel my suffering . "
Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes ( includes graphic content ) »
Bahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists .
Criticizing acid - attack victims is almost unheard of , but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami 's decision .
" We cannot condone such cruel punishment , " wrote one blogger .
" To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights . "
Late last year , an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for .
It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye .
This month , the courts rejected Movahedi 's appeal .
Bahrami's lawyer , Sarrafi , said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks .
He said he does n't think Bahrami will change her mind .
Neither does Bahrami .
" If I do n't do this and there is another acid attack , I will never forgive myself for as long as I live , " she said .
Bahrami is largely self - sufficient despite not being able to see .
She can make a salad , prepare tea and walk up the five flights of stairs that lead to her parents ' apartment .
She has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face , but she says there are many more to come .
She can't afford to pay for her medical care , so she 's using the Internet to raise money .
She 's lost her big brown eyes , but she likes to smile , especially when she imagines her wedding day .
" I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown , and why not ? "

Governments are preparing to breach the worldwide whaling ban , legitimising commercial killing of the giant creatures for the first time in more than 20 years .
Key whaling and anti-whaling nations have thrashed out a plan at a series of unpublicised closed - door meetings to allow Japan to kill the leviathans for gain , after outlawing it for two decades .
It is to be presented to a special meeting of the official International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) early next month .
Environmentalists say that the plan amounts to “ waving the white flag ” to Japan and they fear that it will usher in a new era of legal whaling around the world .

All commercial whaling has been banned since 1986 after the governments who make up the IWC voted by a three - quarters majority for a moratorium on the practice which drove species after species to the brink of extinction .
But Japan has continued to slaughter in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica , by exploiting a loophole in the international law which allows whales to be killed for “ scientific ” purposes .
Conservationists have harried these annual whale hunts on the high seas with their own ships , but the IWC has been powerless to stop the killing , even though Japan has steadily increased it beyond anything that could be justified for scientific research , and has sold the whale meat for food ; this winter it is aiming to catch 935 minke and 50 fin whales .
The international body has remained powerless and deadlocked for decades , and even though both whaling and anti-whaling nations have assiduously recruited other countries to join them , neither side has been able to accumulate enough votes to give it victory under the IWC ’s complex decision - making processes .
A year ago , as The Independent on Sunday exclusively reported at the time , the IWC began a series of closed meetings to try to find a compromise .
Since then a working group of 28 nations has met twice – in St Petersburg , Florida , in September and in Cambridge in December – and its leaders have thrashed out a package - deal proposal to put to a meeting of the full commission in Rome in two weeks ’ time .
The proposal is so sensitive that the document containing it is officially classified as a “ non-paper ” , and only two people – the chairmen of the IWC and of the working group – formally take responsibility for it .
But sources say it has been thrashed out by Japan and five leading anti-whaling nations , including the United States .
The package would accede to a long - standing Japanese demand by allowing it to hunt minke whales near its coasts for an initial five - year period .
It presents two options for dealing with “ scientific ” whaling – phasing it out over five years or effectively legitimising it – but Japan has already ruled out ending the practice , leaving only legitimisation on the table .
Patrick Ramage , of the International Fund for Animal Welfare , yesterday denounced the plan as “ a political fix to give Japan what it wants ” and accused conservationist nations of “ waving the white flag ” .
Mark Simmons , of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , said that the package amounted to a “ de facto lifting of the moratorium ” .
He feared that other nations would seek similar deals , leading to a worldwide revival of legal whaling .
But Alvaro de Soto , a Peruvian diplomat who chairs the working group , called the package “ eminently practical ” .
He added : “ If it is followed it will require compromise , possibly painful , by all concerned , which we profoundly hope they will be willing to make . ”

A large - scale study released this week showed that the herb gingko biloba has no effect in preventing dementia or Alzheimer ’s disease .
But alternative medicine aficionados may find hope in a new research touting the bennies of another “ herb ” in preserving memory .
Scientists from Ohio State University report that marijuana , contrary to the conventional wisdom , may help ward off Alzheimer ’s and keep recall sharp .
Their findings , released today at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington D.C. : chemical components of marijuana reduce inflammation and stimulate the production of new brain cells , thereby enhancing memory .
The team suggested that a drug could be formulated that would resemble tetrahydroannibol , or THC , the psychoactive ingredient in pot sans making the user high .
But the research may ultimately drive those who fear impending dementia to roll their own solution to the problem .
Study co-author Gary Wenk , a professor of psychology , had already devised a preliminary version of a THC - like synthetic drug that improves memory in lab animals .
His team at the meeting said that it works by activating at least three receptors in the brain targeted by THC — proteins on the surface of nerve cells that then trigger cellular processes resulting in reduced inflammation and production of new brain cells that can boost recall .
Understanding how the compounds work may pave the way for a pharmaceutical company to prepare its own med for human clinical trials .
The researchers ducked the obvious question of whether it might be simpler , faster and cheaper to simply light up a joint .
“ Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer ’s disease if the disease is in their family ? ”
Wenk said in a statement .
“ We ’re not saying that , but it might actually work . ”

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone .
Glasgow - based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed .
The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court .
Picsel claims
Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626 , titled " Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing . "
The patent describes using an approximate , intermediary rendering of what 's displayed on a device while scrolling , zooming , or during other major screen transitions .
For example , if a user zooms into a particular object on a device 's web browser , the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom .
Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent , which the USPTO approved on March 7 , 2006 .
The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent ' 626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch , although the initial complaint does n't provide evidence for this claim .
Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide .
Its website lists companies like Fujitsu , NEC , Toshiba , Sharp , Panasonic , Palm , HP , Motorola , and Nokia as licensing partners .
It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in - house - not collected from other inventors .
The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products , unspecified damages , that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded , and attorneys fees .
A copy of the lawsuit is available here . ®
Year President 's Salary1 1789 $ 25,000 1873 $ 50,000 1909 $ 75,000 1949 $ 100,000 1969 $ 200,000 2001 $ 400,000
Why Does the President Have a Salary ?
On top of their pay , the President of the United States is given separate non-taxable funds for travel and entertainment , and upon leaving their position they are given a pension and office space .
The spouses of deceased presidents also receive pensions .
Factoring in all of those other benefits , and the power that comes with the position , why do the taxpayers pay the president directly ?
The reason is largely ideological .
The rationale , as described in foundational documents like the Federalist Papers , is that the president 's salary reinforces their status as an employee of and servant to the general public .
A president who is not beholden to the people for his livelihood is more likely to act on their own interests .
Later generations may further argue that the salary would be a necessity for any poorer citizens .
In some states like New Hampshire , where representatives receive a salary of $ 200 , it is financially impossible for many to hold public office .
Who Controls Congressional Salaries ?
There is no automatic process to adjust government salaries for inflation .
Any increase must be passed as a bill through Congress .
This poses a relatively firm restraint on the growth of executive pay in the United States .
The president 's salary has only been increased five times in U.S. history .
The most recent occurred under President Clinton , although it did n't take effect until George W. Bush took office .
Congress also votes on their own salaries .
What , then , keeps Congress from fast tracking the federal budget into their pockets ?
Traditionally , aside from moral compunctions , the external barrier has been the threat of being voted out of office .
This was codified in an Amendment first proposed in the 1700s and passed in 1992 .
It reads
No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect , until an election of Representatives shall have intervened .
Or , in plain speech , Congressional pay increases wo n't kick in until after the next election cycle , and so anyone who votes to raise their pay has to answer to the voters first .
Here are the salaries of the other members of government .
The salaries listed below are annual as of 2015 .
Position Salary Vice President $ 230,7002 Senator $ 174,000 Representative $ 174,000 Majority and Minority Leaders $ 193,400 Speaker of the House $ 223,500 Chief Justice , U.S. Supreme Court $ 255,500 Assoc. Justice , U.S. Supreme Court $ 244,400 1 .
Plus $ 50,000 non-taxable expense allowance to assist in defraying expenses relating to or resulting from the discharge of his official duties .

Waging Peace
An American Jewish Woman Finds Occupation Unacceptable
POLITICAL ACTIVIST and author Anna Baltzer spoke to a full house at the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation Conference on Oct. 25 at the National Presbyterian Church in Washington , DC — and it was obvious from the start that she struck a chord with her audience .
Baltzer has toured the United States spreading the word about what she saw during her eight months in the West Bank , as well as promoting her book which documents that journey , Witness in Palestine : a Jewish American Woman in the Occupied Territories ( available from the AET Book Club ) .
She went to Palestine to see for herself the conditions for the Palestinians living under Israeli occupation , Baltzer explained .
What she found was very different from what she had learned growing up a Jew in America .
“ I did n’t want to believe it , ” she said .
“ I wanted to believe that Israel was being virtuous and the Arabs in the area were the ones preventing peace . ”
However , she discovered , this was not the truth .
Baltzer emphasized that there is a clear difference between a Jewish Zionist and a non-Zionist Jew .
“ Do not associate Israel ’s occupation with Judaism , ” she said with full conviction .
“ Do n’t confuse Israel ’s actions with Jewish justice . ”
Social justice is a cornerstone of the Jewish faith , she reminded her listeners .
“ To speak out is not anti-Semitic ; it is in line with Jewish social justice , ” she said .
She then asked the crowd to imagine Washington , DC under a full military occupation , as the West Bank is today .
Imagine well - kept highways for the use of Jews only , while Muslims and Christians are forced to travel over other , neglected roads , or hundreds of roadblocks set up everywhere , between neighborhoods , preventing Muslims and Christians from having any semblance of a normal life — earning a living , receiving an education , enjoying a social or spiritual life .
“ Everything is affected when you ca n’t move , ” she noted .
Baltzer then discussed the other side of the story .
In a part of the world where a Palestinian farmer whose family has lived on his land for thousands of years is forbidden to reach that piece of land , Israel grants her , as a Jew , full freedom of movement .
She then pointed to a photo of an Israeli billboard beside a West Bank road urging Israelis to move to the illegal settlement of Ariel , which now has a population of more than 18,000 .
The Hebrew slogan , she told her audience , translated as “ Now More Than Ever . ”
The ad went on to promise each Jewish person who settled in Ariel 100,000 Israeli shekels ( $ 25,000 ) .
The majority of Jews moving to these settlements were not doing so to push the Palestinians off their land , Baltzer explained , but were searching for a good deal , and a housing subsidy from the Israeli government — courtesy of U.S. taxpayers .
“ The Israeli government should be held accountable , not the fanatics , ” she argued .
“ Ideological settlers are in the minority . ”
Noting that the Israeli government is always talking about its security , Baltzer asked why , if Israel is so worried about the state and its people ’s security , it is encouraging and even paying its citizens to move onto the enemy ’s land where they are not very safe ?
The American government is giving Israel more than $ 10 billion a year , Baltzer reminded her audience .
This means that , as Americans , they are assisting Israel in these violations and that every American has a direct responsibility to know how his or her taxes dollars are being spent .
“ People say ” ˜I do n’t want to get involved , it ’s too controversial , ’ ” she said with some disgust .
“ You know what ?
If you are paying taxes , you are already involved . ”
Baltzer said she thinks the U.S. media are the reason the American public is so uninformed about the issue .
To prove her point , she showed the August 2004 cover of an international edition of Newsweek , which a friend bought in Germany , with the headline : “ The Plight of the Palestinians . ”
She then showed the cover of that week ’s U.S. edition , purchased in Chicago , in which the cover story about Palestinians is nowhere to be found .
She did n’t want her audience to feel bad about the situation , Baltzer said .
Instead , she hoped to encourage them to act and , through their action , change the situation .
Baltzer ’s presentation is available on DVD .

Economic analysis indicates that countries that host the Olympic Games typically suffer from economic decline and currency depreciation in the months following its conclusion .
The " so - called ‘ Valley Effect ’ is mainly caused by a dramatic increase in investment in the pre-Olympics stage , accompanied by a boom in consumption and revenues , [ but ] investment and consumption shrink in the post - Olympic stage . "
On the surface , China fits this mould , as it spent upwards of $ 40 Billion building venues and upgrading infrastructure in preparation for the Games .
At the same time , most economists agreed that the Chinese economy was both more robust and more diverse than previous hosts , and could even receive an economic boost from the Games , as a result of increased media exposure and tourism .
The first bump in the road came in the form of a tainted products scandal , which led to the recall of dozens of items , including toys , medicines , and most recently , dairy products .
Then came the credit crisis , which exploded in the US and quickly spread to the rest of the world .
While the implications for China are not entirely clear ( for reasons that will be discussed below ) , it seems almost certain that the economy will take a hit .
In which case , it probably wo n’t be possible to disentangle the ( negative ) economic impact associated with the Olympics from the general economic downturn , but I do n’t imagine this is of much concern to investors , anyway .
Given the rising prominence of China within the framework of the global economy , analysts are watching with baited breath to see if and how China can avoid a dreaded economic downturn .
Falling Exports
The structure of China ’s economy is such that exports ( and investment in fixed assets to produce those exports ) represent the most important component of GDP - as much as 40 % , according to one estimate .
Unfortunately , as a result of the worldwide economic downturn , global private consumption is " expected to rise by 2 - 4 per cent this year .
That compares with an 11 per cent jump in 2007 , and contrasts sharply with the boom in personal spending this decade . "
The effect on the Chinese economy has been , and will continue to be devastating .
In November , overall exports fell for the first time in seven years , and declined by a whopping 6.1 % with its most important trade partner , the US .
One analyst noted : " Many analysts had anticipated that the monthly trade figures would show China ’s export machine slowing along with the global economy , but few had expected it to slip into reverse . "
The decline of exports has already begun to ripple down through the economy .
By no coincidence , Chinese industrial output is also growing at the slowest pace in seven years .
In fact , " with five back - to - back purchasing index readings signaling contraction , ‘ the manufacturing sector , which accounts for 43 percent of the Chinese economy , is close to technical recession . "
Meanwhile , China ’s codependent trade partner , Hong Kong , has witnessed its benchmark purchasing managers ’ index fall to the lowest level since the 2003 SARS outbreak .
Factory Closures
" A sharp deceleration in industrial activity is being amplified by stock build up …many steel factories and other factories may just as well close down because they have enough inventories to provide customers without producing anything . "
In other words , the next link in the economic chain , the factories themselves , is beginning to buckle .
The numbers are staggering ; China ’s Pearl River Delta manufacturing base has already seen 7,000 factories close in the first nine months of 2008 .
As if the economic recession was n’t punishment enough , Chinese factories must cope with an increasingly harsh business environment , since " raw materials cost more , labor and environmental laws have grown stricter , exporters are getting fewer tax breaks , and a string of product recalls have raised questions about Chinese quality . "
Economists estimate that altogether , 100,000 factories will close in China in 2008 .
The actual number could be even higher , due to the unreliability of Chinese statistics and the opacity of Chinese bankruptcy laws .
Factories that remain open will be forced to consolidate their operations with those of rival companies , and / or retool in response to a decline in business .
In short , millions of workers are becoming redundant .
The official employment statistics show that 6.7 million workers have already lost their jobs .
Given that the economic boom of the last decade drove over 130 million migrant workers to cities in search of work , the level of joblessness could climb quickly .
At this point , it seems that only Chinese government economists are delusional enough to believe the economy will continue to expand by the 10 % + rate that has characterized its growth for the last 30 years .
Private - sector economists are much less optimistic ; Goldman Sachs , for example , forecasts 2009 GDP growth of only 6 % .
In the words of one economist : " It is not a recession , but it will feel like one to the average citizen and will feel like a depression to the 100 million or so migrant workers , many of whom are out of a job and stranded far from home . "
Slowing Inflation
Price stability represents perhaps the sole bright spot in this morass of bad news .
Thanks to precipitous declines in oil and energy prices , as well as fruitful initiatives aimed at boosting domestic food production , consumer inflation has retreated from dangerous highs .
According to a Reuters poll , " The consumer price index , is expected to have risen 3.0 percent from a year earlier , a marked reduction from a near 12 - year high in February of 8.7 percent . "
The decline in producer prices has been equally dramatic .
Economists caution , however , that this is a double - edged sword : " Gargantuan consumer of commodities that it is , China benefits from material costs deflation in a way that slower growing developed economies do n’t .
But deflation in China would become a problem …[ since ] consumers who expect prices to carry on falling are more likely to keep hold of their cash . "
Weakened Financial Sector
The collapse in real estate prices that is at the heart of the global credit crisis has not spared China .
National statistics are difficult to come by , but anecdotal reports paint an unambiguous picture .
Shenzhen , previously the country ’s hottest property market , has witnessed sharp declines in prices , with developers offering deep discounts on new projects .
In Beijing , " the number of residential properties sold during the [ October ] weeklong national - day holiday … was down by 72 % compared with the holiday in 2007 . "
Publicly - traded shares of Chinese real estate companies have declined proportionately , due to bleak projections for the immediate future .
The government has been slow to react , unsure whether it should appease aspiring homeowners , or tread cautiously in order to minimize the detrimental impact of a decline in construction on economic growth .
Ultimately , " 18 cities , including Hangzhou and Shanghai , have introduced measures to prop up the market .
These include cuts in transaction taxes and even subsidies for homebuyers . "
Unfortunately , counters one analyst , " The government ’s latest real estate policies aimed at boosting home purchases wo n’t change peoples ’ expectations that property prices will fall further . "
A prolonged period of declines in prices for real estate and other assets would n’t take long to find its way into the country ’s still fragile financial sector .
Only a few years ago , the Central government attempted to head off an inevitable crisis as a result of non-performing loans , by injecting hundreds of billions of dollars directly into banks with the most unstable balance sheets .
Unfortunately , the last few years have witnessed a flurry of new politically - motivated ( and probably unprofitable ) lending activity , which could become painfully exposed as a result of the slowing economy and then exacerbated by new loans that will be required to fund the government ’s recently announced stimulus plan ( to be discussed below ) .
One analyst warns : " Chinese banks are likely counting large amounts of questionable loans as good assets on their books .
No one knows the extent of the problems in these financial institutions , but the central government ’s statistics showing single - digit nonperforming - loan ratios have a too - good - to - be - true quality to them . "
This pessimistic outlook is shared by another analyst , who estimates the NPL ratio at 20 - 40 % of GDP .
Sagging Stock Market
All of the bad news ( and then some ) has already been priced into Chinese share prices , which have retreated sharply after rising 500 % over a two - year period .
Despite a whopping 50 % decline in 2008 alone and valuations that some analyst would consider attractive , it could be a long time before prices recover .
The government ’s response has been contradictory : on the one hand , it has offered incentives to investors ( in the form of lower margin rates and taxes ) as well as attempting to prop up the market by purchasing shares directly .
On the other hand , it is requiring companies to pay out higher proportions of net income to shareholders in the form of dividends , which could come at the expense of new factories and spending on R&D .
Despite the grim outlook , one analyst remains optimistic that " just as the big fall in our [ US ] share market was led by the Shanghai index so the current rise has also been led by Shanghai . "
Will the Chinese RMB Appreciate ?
The Chinese RMB remains the wild card in an environment where virtually all prices and indicators are trending downward .
In a related article , I noted that in late 2008 , " investors had made significant bets that China would reverse its official policy of RMB appreciation .
Futures prices indicated that investors collectively expected the currency to depreciate over 7 % against the Dollar over the next year , as part of a comprehensive Chinese policy to boost the faltering economy .
Since then , however , the RMB recorded its biggest one - day rise since the currency peg was abandoned three years ago , and investors subsequently scaled back their bets .
While it ’s unclear what caused the sudden change in sentiment , there are a few factors which probably contributed .
First is Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s recent visit to China , in which he encouraged China to continue to permit the the Yuan to appreciate .
In addition , high - ranking Chinese economic policy - makers have indicated that market forces will increasingly determine the valuation of the Yuan .
Finally , there is the recent election of Barack Obama , a long - standing critic of what he believes to be the undervalued RMB . "
The issue of China ’s currency has important macroeconomic implications because of the pile of foreign exchange reserves maintained by its Central Bank .
These reserves , currently estimated at $ 1.9 Trillion , recently fell for the first time in seven years .
Despite the insistence of some economists that the nature of China ’s economy is such that it will continue to purchase US government bonds , statistics and common sense suggest that this is very much in doubt , due to lower Chinese tax revenues and plans for higher domestic spending ;
" All the key drivers of China ’s Treasury purchases are disappearing ; there ’s a waning appetite for dollars and a waning appetite for Treasuries . "
This will affect the US by making it more difficult for the Obama administration to finance its own economic stimulus plans , as well as increasing long - term interest rates at every level of borrowing , from institutions down to individual homeowners .
Government Stimulus and Economic Restructuring
Naturally , the government of China is not sitting by idly as the economy flounders .
It recently " announced a four trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) stimulus package , the largest in the country ’s history ….
the two - year spending initiative will inject funds into ten sectors , including health care , education , low - income housing , environmental protection , schemes to promote technological innovation , and transport and other infrastructure projects . "
This will be supplemented by tax cuts and monetary policy initiatives , as well as specific plans ( discussed above ) aimed at combating sagging property and equity markets .
In addition , local governments will chip in 20 Trillion yuan of their own to fund smaller - scale projects .
While skeptics note that the true amount will probably be substantially less ( since some of plan will no doubt overlap with spending already earmarked in the budget ) , the consensus opinion is that it is a most welcome measure .
The only concern , remarkably , is whether it will be enough to stimulate an economy that is increasingly sprawling and complex .
Accordingly , both the Premier of China as well as independent analysts have suggested that another stimulus plan could be unveiled as soon as early 2009 .
The stimulus plan must be implemented as part of a broader structural change in China ’s economy , whereby growth comes not from exports but from domestic consumption .
China ’s citizens are among the notorious savers in the world , due both to cultural factors and to a gradual elimination of state social programs , such that education , health care , and retirement costs are increasingly born by individuals .
Fortunately , " there is significant room for a more rapid expansion of consumption ; China ’s household consumption - to - GDP ratio ( 35.4 percent in 2007 ) is one of the lowest in the world , the country ’s fiscal situation is strong and the economy is only lightly leveraged . "
The only thing preventing domestic Chinese companies from devoting more attention to the domestic Chinese market is ironically the government , itself .
The official economic strategy remains focused around exports , which are promoted through import substitution , tax incentives , and a cheap currency .
If anything , the government has become more steadfast in recent months , halting the appreciation of the RMB and increasing tax rebates for export - oriented companies .
If not for its obstinacy and sheer misguidedness , the Chinese government is well poised to implement such a shift .
" Previous prudence has left plenty of room for a stimulus : the budget surplus stands at 1 - 2 % of GDP ( depending on how you measure it ) and total public - sector debt at less than 20 % of GDP , one of the smallest of any large economy . "
In addition , the absence of democracy means the government can act swiftly and efficiently when carrying out policy , without having to worry about normal checks and balances that would inhibit such a process in an industrialized country .
Finally , China ’s growing middle class has proven not only willing , but eager to become more avid consumers , as retail sales continue to rise by a steady clip despite the economic downturn .
In short , while the next couple years will probably see diminished growth , responsible planning could mitigate the painful transition by rewarding China in the period that follows .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s Central Council of Jews welcomed the Vatican ’s decision to order a traditionalist bishop who denies the Holocaust to recant on Wednesday , saying it could lead to a resumption of ties with the Catholic Church .
Charlotte Knobloch , president of the Council of Jews , said the Vatican ’s move was a positive signal and a reaction to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s demand for clarification after Pope Benedict sparked outrage over his rehabilitation of the bishop .
“ It is a first step which could lead to a resumption of dialogue with the Catholic Church , ” said Knobloch in a statement which struck a conciliatory tone after she said last week she was breaking off ties with the Catholic church .
She had been angered by the German pope ’s rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson , who denies the extent of the Holocaust in which Nazis killed 6 million Jews , and that of three other members of the ultra-traditional Society of Saint Pius X ( SSPX ) .
Knobloch also welcomed the Vatican ’s statement earlier that SSPX must accept all the teachings of the Second Vatican Council , which urged respect for Judaism and other religions .
“ That would mean the brotherhood would have to publicly retract their statements that Jewish citizens are murders of God , and to firmly condemn every form of Holocaust denial , ” Knobloch said .

Contrary to the TV sitcom where the wife experiencing strong labor pains screams at her husband to stay away from her , women rarely give birth alone .
There are typically doctors , nurses and husbands in hospital delivery rooms , and sometimes even other relatives and friends .
Midwives often are called on to help with births at home .
Assisted birth has likely been around for millennia , possibly dating as far back as 5 million years ago when our ancestors first began walking upright , according to University of Delaware paleoanthropologist Karen Rosenberg .
She says that social assistance during childbirth is just one aspect of our evolutionary heritage that makes us distinctive as humans .
Rosenberg , who is a professor and chairperson of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Delaware , presented a talk on natural selection and childbirth on Feb. 13 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago .
It was part of the symposium “ The Invisible Woman in Evolution : Natural Cycle and Life - Cycle Events , ” which Rosenberg co-organized . *
“ Humans need helpers in childbirth because it is difficult and potentially dangerous , ” Rosenberg says .
“ While it 's not so risky today -- maternal mortality is low -- as recently as two generations ago , it was not uncommon to hear of women dying in childbirth . ”
Through fossil records and comparisons of humans with other primates , Rosenberg says that anthropologists can now show how the uniquely human traits of bipedalism , large brains , infant helplessness and social assistance all came together , resulting in the challenging and somewhat dangerous manner in which humans give birth .

When our ancestors evolved to begin walking on two legs , Rosenberg says , this upright posture created a wide but short opening in the pelvis in which the baby must travel , requiring a new form of birth so that the baby could find its way through a now tight birth canal .
According to Rosenberg , the average pelvic opening in women today is 13 centimeters at its largest diameter and 10 centimeters at its smallest .
The average infant head is 10 centimeters from front to back , and the shoulders are 12 centimeters across .
And today the birth canal is a twisty tunnel subjecting the infant to a series of complex twists and turns on its way out .
“ Until recently , there was a sexism in the study of evolution , ” Rosenberg says .
“ Researchers focused on men and the tools they used in hunting , and these things were more difficult to connect to reproductive success and hence to natural selection , ” she notes .
“ With childbirth , as well as many of the other things that happen to women -- pregnancy , nursing , menopause -- it 's really easy to see how natural selection works , ” Rosenberg notes .
Childbirth is just one of a series of examples throughout a woman 's life cycle , in which enlisting the help of other women significantly improves reproductive outcomes , according to Rosenberg .

“ Women take up the slack for other women when they are pregnant and nursing so that they have the energy to devote to their infants .
Cooperative childcare is something in which women help each other out .
Often , but not always , these helpers are post - reproductive women who have fewer of those responsibilities of their own , but may be helping out their daughters .
All of this puts a great selective premium on a kind of social intelligence that many scientists think partly accounts for the increase in brain size that happened over the last two million years , ” she notes .
How will women and childbirth continue to evolve ?
Will the birth canal grow narrower , or wider ?
Will childbirth become more painful , or easier ?
Will more helpers be needed in future births ?
It 's really anybody 's guess .
“ Evolution does n't have a direction , ” Rosenberg says .
“ Knowing where we 've been does n't give us any help in where we 're going .
But it does help us understand what makes us human , as well as how we 're connected to the natural world . ”
She says she began focusing on the evolution of women and childbirth around the time she had her first child , although she does n't think there was a connection between the two .
Interestingly , her brother is an obstetrician although she and he have never conducted research together .

CondéNet , the online arm of publisher Condé Nast has today laid off staff across the board , with Wired.com taking a big hit .
According to reports , 25 % of Wired.com ’s San Francisco staff have been laid off , with the majority of layoffs coming from tech roles .
10 % of the editorial staff have been cut .
According to Valleywag , also gone is Kourosh Karimkhany , the VP of corporate development for CondéNet and a man responsible for the acquisitions of Reddit and Ars Technica .
Peter Kafka at AllThingsD has an official statement from the company :
Visibility for 2009 is very limited and we are adjusting all costs to prepare for slower revenue growth .
The adjustments are across the board and include staff restructuring and some reduction .
Despite the current environment , CondéNet will end the year slightly up over 2007 .
These moves will put the company in a stronger position to handle a challenging year ahead and for the business to benefit when the economy and the ad market start to rebound .
The cuts do n’t come as any surprise , with Condé Nast announcing a 5 % cut across the board ( online and offline ) November 1 .
Update : more from CNet
UPDATE : the question has arisen about “ occupied ” aka “ manned ” weather stations in Antarctica ( Stevenson Screens etc ) versus the Automated Weather Stations .
This picture on a postage stamp from Australia , celebrating the Australian Antarctic Territory in 1997 , may help settle the issue .
Note the Stevenson Screen near the “ living pod ” on the right .
Here is the larger photo of the first day of issue card , the Stevenson Screen is also just visible above the snowbank in the lower right .
Rather close to human habitation I ’d say .
Looks like its in the middle of an AHI ( Antarctic Heat Island ) .
Here ’s another picture of a Stevenson Screen close to a building in Antarctica , from the British Antarctic Survey :
Location : Fossil Bluff , Alexander Island
Season : 1994/1995

It seems that folks are all “ wild about Harry ” over at Climate Audit , with the revelations occurring there , and no good kerfluffle would be complete without some pictures of the weather stations in question .
It seems a weather station used in the Steig Antarctic study , aka “ Harry ” , got buried under snow and also got confused with another station , Gill , in the dataset .
As Steve McIntyre writes :
Gill is located on the Ross Ice Shelf at 79.92S 178.59W 25 M and is completely unrelated to Harry .
The 2005 inspection report observes :
2 February 2005 – Site visited .
Site was difficult to locate by air ; was finally found by scanning the horizon with binoculars .
Station moved 3.8 nautical miles from the previous GPS position .
The lower delta temperature sensor was buried .63 meters in the snow .
The boom sensor was raised to 3.84 m above the surface from 1.57 m above the surface .
Station was found in good working condition .
I did n’t see any discussion in Steig et al on allowing for the effect of burying sensors in the snow on data homogeneity .
The difference between “ old ” Harry and “ new ” Harry can now be explained .
“ Old ” Harry was actually “ Gill ” , but , at least , even if mis-identified , it was only one series .
“ New ” Harry is a splice of Harry into Gill – when Harry met Gill , the two became one , as it were .
Considered by itself , Gill has a slightly negative trend from 1987 to 2002 .
The big trend in “ New Harry ” arises entirely from the impact of splicing the two data sets together .
It ’s a mess .
So not only is there a splice error , but the data itself may have been biased by snow burial .
Why is the snow burying important ?
Well , as anyone skilled in cold weather survival can tell you , snow makes an excellent insulator and an excellent reflector .
Snow ’s trapped air insulative properties is why building a snow cave to survive in is a good idea .
So is it any wonder then that a snowdrift buried temperature sensor , or a temperature sensor being lowered to near the surface by rising snow , would not read the temperature of the free near surface atmosphere accurately ?
As I ’ve always said , getting accurate weather station data is all about siting and how the sensors are affected by microclimate issues .
Pictures help tell the story .
Here ’s “ Harry ” prior to being dug out in 2006 and after :
Harry AWS , 2006 – Upon Arrival – Click to enlarge .
Harry AWS , 2006 – After digging out – Click to enlarge .
You can see “ Harry ’s Facebook Page ” here at the University of Wisconsin
It seems digging out weather stations is a regular pastime in Antarctica , so data issues with snow burial of AWS sensors may be more than just about “ Harry ” .
It seems Theresa ( Harry ’s nearby sister ) and Halley VI also have been dug out and the process documented .
With this being such a regular occurrence , and easily found within a few minutes of Googling by me , you ’d think somebody with Steig et al or the Nature peer reviewers would have looked into this and the effect on the data that Steve McIntyre has so eloquently pointed out .
Here ’s more on the snow burial issue from Antarctic bloggers :

From Polartrec
Theresa was placed at this location partly to
study the air flow in the region .
Looking out the window of the plane we can
definitely see the air flowing !!!
Jim estimates the wind at about 25 miles per
hour .
Wind blown snow at Theresa
With the temperature around 0 F the wind chill
was about 20 below , it is obvious this is going to be quite a chore .
Starting to dig out Theresa
The weather station has not been working , so
George needs to figure out what is wrong with it and then fix it .
The station is
almost buried in the snow so we will also need to remove all of the electronics ,
add a tower section and then raise and bolt all of the electronics and sensors
back in place .
George unhooking the cables .
After refueling the plane , with the fuel in
the 55 gallon drums , Jim and Louie helped dig down to the electronics boxes that
were completely buried plus they built us a wind break that made huge difference
in helping us not be so cold .
After about 4 hours we are almost through .
As I am
hanging onto the top of the raised tower in the wind , one bunny boot wedged onto
the tower bracing , the other boot wrapped around the tower , one elbow gripping
the tower , my chin trying to hold the wind sensor in place and both bare numb
hands trying to thread a nut onto the spinning wind sensor I really appreciate
the difficulty of what is normally Jonathan ’s job .
After checking to make sure
Theresa is transmitting weather data we board the plane and head to Briana our
second station .
Notice the difference between this
picture and the first one of Theresa .

More movement
It ’s been another flat - out week .
The vehicle team have dug up and moved the Drewery building , which was getting do buried snow was almost up the windows .
Team
Met have been on the move too – all the remaining instruments are now bolted securely to the Laws roof , so we headed up the the Halley VI building site to relocate the weather station .
Jules starts digging out the weather station Only 15 km away , the Halley VI site looks a lot like Halley V . It ’s flat , white and snowy .
Very snowy .
The weather station had about 1.5 m built up around it !
Jules and Simon recovering the solar panel
In the hole !
The weather station was a survey reference point for the build project so we had to find a suitable replacement .
Could this be Antarctica ’s first pole - dancing venue ?
Penguin Party memories …
After an hour or so sweating it our with shovels , the weather station popped out and was loaded onto the sledge .
Like the reference point , the station ’s new location had to be precise as vehicles are banned from the upwind section of the site to keep that area ultra-clean for future snow - chemistry experiments .
Weather station on the move Driving on a compass bearing and GPS track , we found the new site just under a kilometre away .
The final setup
UPDATE : here ’s another buried station story from Bob ’s Adventures in cold climes .
Apparently this station is used as a reference for some sort of borehole project .
My main task for today was to get a start on raising my weather station .
I ’d installed it 2 years ago , and with the high accumulation at Summit , it ’s getting buried .
The electronics are all in a box under the snow , and the only things visible at the surface were the anemometer for measuring wind speed and direction , the thermistor for measuring air temperature , and the solar panel to keep the batteries charged .
The buried weather station .
The flat green bit is the solar panel , which was about 1.5 meters off the surface when I installed the station .
Can you guess why I would mount it facing down ?
In the morning I downloaded all the data from the station , and checked to see that it was all in order .
Then it was time for digging .
I ’d carefully made a diagram when I inastalled the station , so I knew exactly where to dig .
A couple of hours later I ’d found my box !
At the bottom of the pit with the datalogger electronics .
I brought everything up to the surface , and then was about to fill in the pit , when I realized at least one more scientist at Summit might want to make measurements in it ; the pit ’s already dug !
So tomorrow I ’ll help Lora with some conductivity measurements , then fill in the pit , re-bury the box just beneath the surface , and it ’ll be ready to go for another 2 years !
And there ’s more … .
The Australians seem to have AWS problems as well .
From the Australian Antarctic Division : On Monday two groups headed out , with Largy and Denis going up to the skiway to check on the condition of the equipment stored there for the winter and beginning preparations for the coming summer flying season .
Bill , Brian and Ian went up to the Lanyon Junction Automatic Weather Station ( AWS ) to check its condition and retrieve some of the sensors in preparation for the annual servicing of the various remote units .

This used to be an anemometer Photo : Ian P .
And the University of Maine , participating in USITASE , has the same troubles , they write :
We reached our first major destination at the end of today ’s travel , the site of the Nico weather station .
There are several automatic weather stations spread out over the surface of Antarctica .
These stations measure things like temperature , wind speed and wind direction and then relay this data back to scientists via satellite .
Anything left on the surface of the snow will eventually be drifted in and buried by blowing snow .
This particular weather station ( NICO ) has not been seen in several years .
They tried to locate it via airplane a few years ago and were unsuccessful .
Our task was to find the weather station , record its position with GPS , and mark the location with flags so that in the near future , the weather station can be raised and serviced .
We arrived at the coordinates of the station around 10 pm .
Our initial scans of the horizon were not productive , so Matthew and John took the lead tractor ( with our crevasse - detecting radar ) out to survey a grid near our stopping point .
The radar should detect a large metal object like a weather station , but the survey was also unsuccessful .
After a fine pasta and tomato sauce dinner , John went outside for an evening constitutional .
He saw a shiny object out in the distance – further inspection with a pair of binoculars determined that it was the top of the NICO weather station !
Several of us marched out to the station , which was actually about a half mile distant , marked the location with bright orange flags and recorded the position via GPS for future reference .
Only the top foot or two of the station was still visible .
John was in exactly the right place at the right time to see a reflection from this object while we were near the kitchen module , and so allowed us to complete our first task successfully .
Tomorrow , we drive on .
This regular burial and digging out of stations brings the whole network of AWS stations to be used as sensitive climate measurement stations into question .

Push Your Web Design Into The Future With CSS3

There are exciting new features in the pipeline for Cascading Style Sheets that will allow for an explosion of creativity in Web design .
These features include CSS styling rules that are being released with the upcoming CSS3 specification
Realistically , you wo n’t be able to use these on your everyday client projects for another few years , but for design blogs and websites aimed at the Web design community , these features can help you push the boundaries of modern Web design today , adding that extra spice to your design and helping the industry move forward .
Also consider the following related articles :
Here are five techniques snatched from the future that you can put into practice in your website designs today .
1. Border Radius
Probably the most common CSS3 feature currently being used is border - radius .
Standard HTML block elements are square - shaped with 90 - degree corners .
The CSS3 styling rule allows rounded corners to be set .
- moz - border - radius : 20 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 20 px ; border - radius : 20 px ;
Border - radius can also be used to target individual corners , although the syntax for - moz - and - webkit - is slightly different :
-moz - border - radius - topleft : 20 px ; - moz-border- radius - topright : 20 px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomleft : 10 px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomright : 10 px ; - webkit-border-top-right- radius : 20 px ; - webkit-border-top-left-radius : 20 px ; - webkit-border-bottom-left-radius : 10 px ; - webkit-border-bottom - right - radius : 10 px ;
Supported in Firefox , Safari and Chrome .
As used by : Twitter .

2. Border Image
Border - image , as the name suggests , allows an image file to be used as the border of an object .
The image is first created in relation to each side of an object , where each side of the image corresponds to a side of the HTML object .
This is then implemented with the following syntax :
border : 5 px solid #cccccc ; - webkit- border-image : url(/images/border-image.png ) 5 repeat ; - moz- border- image : url(/images/border-image.png ) 5 repeat ; border - image : url(/images/border-image.png ) 5 repeat ;
The {border : 5 px} attribute specifies the overall width of the border , and then each border - image rule targets the image file and tells the browser how much of the image to use to fill up that 5 px border area .
Border images can also be specified on a per-side basis , allowing for separate images to be used on each of the four sides as well as the four corners :
border - bottom - right - image border - bottom - image border - bottom - left - image border - left - image border - top - left - image border - top - image border - top - right - image border - right - image
Supported in Firefox 3.1 , Safari and Chrome .

3. Box Shadow and Text Shadow
Drop shadows : do n’t you just love them ?!
They can so easily make or break a design .
Now , with CSS3 , you do n’t even need Photoshop !
The usage we ’ve seen so far has really added to the design , a good example being this year ’s 24 Ways website .
- webkit- box - shadow : 10 px 10 px 25 px #ccc ; - moz-box - shadow : 10 px 10 px 25 px #ccc ; box - shadow : 10 px 10 px 25 px # ccc ;
The first two attributes determine the offset of the shadow in relation to the element , in this case , 10 pixels on the x and y axis .
The third attribute sets the level of blurriness of the shadow .
And finally , the shadow color is set .
Also , the text - shadow attribute is available for use on textual content :
text - shadow : 2px 2px 5 px #ccc ;
Supported in Firefox 3.1 , Safari , Chrome ( box - shadow only ) and Opera ( text - shadow only ) .
As used by : 24 Ways .

4. Easy Transparency with RGBA and Opacity
The use of PNG files in Web design has made transparency a key design feature .
Now , an alpha value or opacity rule can be specified directly in the CSS .
rgba( 200 , 54 , 54 , 0.5 ) ; /* example : */ background : rgba( 200 , 54 , 54 , 0.5 ) ; /* or */ color : rgba( 200 , 54 , 54 , 0.5 ) ;
The first three numbers refer to the red , green and blue color channels , and the final value refers to the alpha channel that produces the transparency effect .
Alternatively , with the opacity rule , the color can be specified as usual , with the opacity value set as a separate rule :
color : #000 ; opacity : 0.5 ;
Supported in Firefox , Safari , Chrome , Opera ( opacity ) and IE7 ( opacity , with fixes ) .
As used by : 24 Ways ( RGBA ) .

5. Custom Web Fonts with @ Font - Face
There has always been a set of safe fonts that can be used on the Web , as you know : Arial , Helvetica , Verdana , Georgia , Comic Sans ( ahem … ) , etc .
Now the @font - face CSS3 rule allows fonts to be called from an online directory and used to display text in a whole new light .
This does bring up issues of copyright , so there are only a handful of specific fonts that can be used for @font - face embedding .
The styling is put into practice like so :
@font - face { font - family : ' Anivers ' ; src : url ('/images/Anivers.otf ' ) format ( ' opentype ' ) ; }
The rest of the font family , containing secondary options , is then called as usual :
h1 { font - family : ‘ Anivers ’ , Helvetica , Sans - Serif ;
Supported in Firefox 3.1 , Safari , Opera 10 and IE7 ( with lots of fixes : if you are brave enough , you can make font - face work in IE ( thanks for heads up , Jon Tan ) )
As used by : TapTapTap .

Although CSS3 is still under development , the rules listed here are supported by some browsers right now .
Safari in particular has extensive support for these new features .
Unfortunately , despite being a top- quality browser , Safari has a relatively low number of users , so it is probably not worthwhile adding extra features solely for this group of users .
But with Apple ’s Mac computers making their way into everyday life , Safari ’s usage is likely to continually increase .
Firefox , on the other hand , now has a considerably large user base .
What ’s more , the soon - to - be- released Firefox 3.1 has added support for a range of CSS3 features .
Assuming that most users of Firefox will update their browsers , there will soon be a large group of users with support for these new styling rules .
Google Chrome was released this year .
Based on the WebKit engine , this browser has much of the same support as Safari .
While Safari makes up a good proportion of Mac users , Chrome has burst onto the scene , making up a decent proportion of Windows users .
Percentage - wise , the W3 ’s browser statistics indicate that , as of November 2008 , 44.2 % of W3School ’s users across the Web were browsing with Firefox , 3.1 % with Chrome and 2.7 % with Safari .
That means almost 50 % of all Internet users should be able to view these features .
Within the Web design community in particular , which is much more conscious of browser choice , the range of users with CSS3 support is much higher , at 73.6 % ( according to the stats at Blog. SpoonGraphics ) .
6 . The downside
Your website may now have a range of fancy new design features , but there are a few negatives to take into consideration :
Internet Explorer : 46 % of Internet users wo n’t see these features , so do n’t use them as a crucial part of the design of your website .
Make sure that secondary options are in place , such as a standard border in place of border - image and a normal font in place of @font - face .
Please notice that Internet Explorer supports @font - face with EOT ( more details ) since v4 ( thanks for heads up , Jon Tan ) .

Invalid style sheets :
These CSS3 features have not been released as a final specification .
They are currently implemented with tags that target different browsers .
This can invalidate your style sheet .

Extra CSS markup :
Following the last point , having to add a different tag for each browser to specify the same rule , as well as include the standard rule for the final CSS specification , adds a lot of extra code to your CSS markup .

Potentially horrific usage : Just as is done with traditional Photoshop filters , the use of these new styling features could result in some eye - wrenching designs .

England 's 12 largest cities would be given the chance to elect their own equivalent of Boris Johnson under Tory plans to introduce more directly elected mayors .
Under the plans , voters in Manchester , Birmingham , Leeds , Sheffield and Bristol would be among those given a guaranteed referendum on handing authority to a powerful city supremo modelled on the Mayor of London .
Bradford , Wakefield , Coventry , Leicester , Nottingham , Liverpool and Newcastle upon
Tyne will also be able to vote to choose a mayoral system .
Voters will also be given the power to trigger a referendum on any local policy .
The Tories plan to launch a " big bang " series of simultaneous referendums in all 12 cities in order to build national momentum for the change to directly elected mayors .
If the exercise is successful , other cities will be polled on moving to a mayoral system .

Although the take - up of mayors has been patchy , the Conservatives argue that handing local authorities to a single public figure can galvanise leadership and boost interest in local affairs .
There are currently 12 elected mayors in towns and cities across England , but many of the biggest cities have fought shy of the idea , with councils preferring to retain a cabinet system of local government .
Party strategists point to Mr Johnson 's success in becoming the first British elected politician to have a personal mandate of more than 1 million votes .
Under the plans , to be unveiled by David Cameron today , the current network of mayors would be dramatically expanded to cover the country 's major centres of population .
Conservatives argue that the current system makes it too easy for vested interests to block the move towards a mayoral system .
At present local authorities have the power to propose a move to a mayoral system , while voters can only trigger a ballot on change if 5 per cent of residents sign a petition calling for change .
A policy document to be launched today says : " In our biggest cities there is a strong case for new powers being placed in the hands of a single accountable individual , an elected mayor who can provide the city with strong leadership .
" Individual leadership of these councils can benefit local citizens by improving the clarity of municipal decision - making and enhancing the prestige of their city . "

Grant Shapps , the Tories ' housing spokesman , said : " Boris has been a big hit since coming to power .
Lots of people underestimated him , but he has proved to be a decisive mayor and already taken action that has proved popular in the capital .
Local people should be given a greater say in appointing those who make the decisions which have an impact on how life works locally and directly elected mayors are a good way of doing that . "
The party policy paper , called Control Shift , will also reform the laws on local referendums to allow voters to trigger a ballot if 5 per cent of residents sign a petition .
At present local councils can choose to hold a ballot on any issue , but there is no way of residents forcing a poll .
Mr Cameron will also propose scrapping the Government 's new Infrastructure Planning Commission which was established last year to oversee planning decisions on major projects such as airports and power stations .
Mr Shapps said : " We believe we can speed up the planning system without creating another expensive quango that does not have proper democratic accountability . "
Mayoral hits and misses
* LONDON
Mayoral elections in the capital have caught its voters ' imagination , helped by the charisma of Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson .
Turnout in each of the contests to date has increased , reaching 45 per cent last year .
The Mayor of London handles a budget of £ 3bn .
*HARTLEPOOL
It was widely seen as a joke when Hartlepool United 's mascot , H'Angus the monkey – aka Stuart Drummond – campaigned in 2002 on a platform of free bananas for schoolchildren .
But he won , was re-elected on a landslide four years later and is due to stand again for a third term .
* DONCASTER
Martin Winter , who is in his second term as Mayor of the South Yorkshire town , last year lost a vote of confidence as police investigated alleged corruption at the council .
The former rugby league professional , who is governing as an independent , refused to stand down and said he will stand again .
* STOKE-ON -TRENT
The city was one of the first to choose a directly elected mayor , with theindependent Mike Wolfe narrowly winning the post in 2002 .
But it soon tired of the experiment and its residents voted last year to abolish the post and return to a system of council leader and cabinet .
Aujourd ’hui , Nicolas Sarkozy a lancé le comité chargé d’élaborer une « stratégie nationale de la recherche et de l’innovation » .
Je viens d’écouter en intégralité sur le site de l’Elysée son discours , assez bref .
Je vous le recommande , c’est encore mieux que l’écrit .
Son discours a sonné une violente charge - en voici un extrait vidéo - contre le système de recherche « infantilisant et paralysant » .
Et annoncé la « transformation du Cnrs » en autant d’Agences de moyens ( distribuant des crédits mais n’employant pas de chercheurs ) que d’Instituts disciplinaires .
Il a menacé de cesser les augmentations de moyens financiers si ces réformes n’étaient pas mises en application .
Tout en reconnaissant « je sais que ce que l’on vient de décider provoquera des réactions » .
A son habitude , l’hyperprésident n’a pas fait dans la nuance .
Le système actuel serait un héritage de 1945 , tout juste adapté en 1960 et figé depuis les années 1980 .
Ce système serait « une organisation désastreuse qui multiplie les structures et gaspille les moyens » .
Ce qui aurait éjecté la France du peloton de tête de la science mondiale .
Nos « bons résultats en mathématiques , physique ou sciences de l’ingénieur » seraient « l ’arbre qui cache la foret » , « alibi des conservateurs de droite et de gauche » .
Et empêcherait une bonne valorisation économique de sa recherche publique .
Une telle description , apocalyptique , si elle était véridique , justifierait la solution sarkozyste de la tabula rasa .
Ne rien garder du système actuel .
La violence du propos ne doit pas étonner .
Depuis 1981 , à chaque fois que la droite est revenue au pouvoir , elle s’est plantée sur la recherche .
Avec un mélange parfois détonnant de coupes dans les dépenses publiques , d’incapacité à mobiliser les entreprises privées , d’attaques idéologiques parfois idiotes contre les scientifiques ... le tout sans finalement toucher aux structures , sans s’attaquer aux problèmes de fond liés à la massification de l’enseignement supérieur , sans réagir aux conséquences des privatisations dans des secteurs industriels décisifs où le public avait financé l’innovation , sans régler l’énorme problème de la coupure entre la formation des ingénieurs ( dans les Grandes Ecoles ) et la recherche ...
Bref , un échec total .
Echec qui a culminé avec la période Chirac , avec des ministres ectoplasmiques ( Elisabeth Dufourcq , une des juppettes ) et l’ancienne astronaute Claudie Haigneré qui a dû affronter la pire fronde antigouvernementale née dans les labos depuis 1968 .
Quant à la gauche , passé l’effort de 1981 , elle a faibli lors de son retour aux affaires en 1997 .
D’abord parce que l’effort public n’a pas été renouvelé , concentré sur le seul rattrapage des besoins en enseignants pour des universités où se ruaient les étudiants .
Ensuite par incapacité à faire évoluer le pilotage d’ensemble du système - périmètres des organismes de recherche , planification des grands équipements , Europe - à un rythme suffisant pour faire face aux nouveaux défi .
Sans parler d’un presque abandon de l ’idée de 1981 : utiliser la recherche et l’innovation technologique de manière volontariste pour attaquer les problèmes sociaux , économiques , de formation et des relations Nord / Sud .
( Je passe sur les erreurs dûes à la personnalités d’Allègre , la principale étant ... qu’il n’a pas eu le courage de lancer des vraies réformes de structures sur le statut des personnels et les organismes de recherche ) .
Avec Sarkozy , c’est une autre période qui s’ouvre .
Avec une droite qui a compris qu’elle a besoin de la science et de la technologie pour atteindre ses objectifs généraux .
Qu’elle ne peut pas se passer d’une politique scientifique - pour elle cela signifie « faire des choix » entre ce qu’il faut financer et ce qu’il faut abandonner .
Qu’elle ne peut pas couper à une certaine augmentation des dépenses publiques pour l’enseignement supérieur et la recherche ( publique ... et privée ) ... même si les chiffres mirobolants annoncés et ré-annoncés par Valérie Pécresse et le Président méritent une analyse critique .. voir aussi là , et là .
Mais aussi qu’elle ne se pliera pas au système existant , honni en raison du poids qu’il donne aux chercheurs eux - même dans la gestion d’une partie ( oh , une partie bien minoritaire en réalité ... ) de l’effort public de recherche .
La droite veut du pilotage , politique , elle veut abattre les « forteresses » que se seraient constituées les chercheurs en profitant du laxisme de la gauche avec en ligne de mire principale le Cnrs et l’Inserm qu’elle veut transformer en Agences de moyens .
S’il tient parole , c’est dès 2009 que cette menace sera mise à exécution .
Que deviendront les chercheurs de ces organismes , recrutés par des concours ouverts sur le monde et attractifs ?
Mystère et boule de gomme .
Comment assurer qu’une vision nationale , cohérente , susceptible de coordonner l’effort français dans le cadre de projet internationaux sur le climat , l’Espace , la génétique , subsistera sur le long terme puisque chacun sait que le ministère en est incapable ?
Que deviendra la recherche fondamentale du Commissariat à l’énergie atomique ?
Le simple énoncé de ces questions suggère que , soit Sarkozy va mettre un foutoir dingue dans la recherche publique ... soit que le calendrier annoncé est tout simplement de la blague .
Le discours de Sarkozy , malgré ses aspects populistes , rudimentaires quant à l’argumentation ( et dire qu’il s’adressait à un public entièrement composé d’universitaires , scientifiques , chefs d’entreprises , qu’est - ce que cela aurait donné en meeting électoral !!! ) , montre bien le risque d’une telle stratégie pour la France .
A trop vouloir accuser le système actuel de tous les maux , on oublie de se demander comment une réforme intelligente en conserverait les bons côtés ( il en existe sinon comment expliquer que la France est présente , de manière honorable , dans pratiquement toutes les grandes expériences scientifiques mondiales , que sa part des publications scientifiques reste à bon niveau ( avec 4,7 % , elle retrouve son niveau de 1981 après l’avoir dépassé grâce aux efforts des années 1980 - 1990 ) , que plusieurs de ses entreprises industrielles phares sont de haute technologie et entretiennent d’excellentes relations avec la recherche publique ?
Tout n’est pas faux dans le discours de Sarkozy .
Et notamment la revendication d’une « politique scientifique » fondée sur un débat public .
De ce point de vue , la réponse simpliste de certains syndicalistes - il faut tenir le front de la connaissance dans sa continuité - ne suffit pas .
A l’évidence , la France ne peut pas tout faire .
L’ennui , c’est l’incapacité à sortir d’un débat très idéologique où tout le monde fait semblant de ne pas voir les différences entre les centaines de millions exigés par des prototypes industriels et les quelques dizaines de milliers d’euros d’une exploration préliminaire .
Oui , construire ou pas un réacteur nucléaire expérimental est un choix .
Non , ne pas financer largement les multiples idées à 30 000 euros des équipes formées par un chercheur , un thésard et un ingénieur , n’est pas un choix , c’est juste une connerie ... ou alors il ne fallait pas recruter le chercheur en cause , après un bac plus 10 , des publications , une évaluation positive et un concours hypersélectif .
Le problème , c’est que Sarkozy , lorsqu’il parle de choix , parle de ce dernier élément tout autant que des télescopes spatiaux , d’ITER , de Soleil ( le synchrotron d’Orsay ) ou des navires de l’Ifremer .
Obama ’s Treasury Secretary Forgot to Pay Taxes
Here we go again , another Obama cabinet nominee wrapped up in a controversy .
I will go through the list one more time .
Hillary Clinton ’s appointment to Secretary of State is unconstitutional .
Rahm Emanuel had 21 conversations with Blagojevich about Obama ’s senate seat that was up for sale .
Bill Richardson resigned his cabinet nomination in disgrace becaus he is involved in his own pay to play scheme .
The list seems to grow every day and here is the latest controversy surrounding a Barack Obama cabinet nominee .
President - elect Obama ’s nominee for Treasury Secretary , Timothy Geithner , has not one , but two little problems .
He forgot to pay taxes , and he hired an illegal immigrant .
While I am sure Obama does n’t have any problem with Geithner hiring an illegal alien , after all he is for amnesty for illegals , he surely must have a problem with Geithner not paying taxes .
After all the one thing that we know about Obama is that he loves taxes .
In what has to be an embarrassing turn of events for the president - elect Timothy Geithner ’s confirmation hearing was put on hold .
Timothy Geithner did n’t pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for several years while he worked for the International Monetary Fund , and he employed an immigrant housekeeper who briefly lacked proper work papers .
Those issues , and a series of other tax matters , caused the postponement Tuesday of Mr. Geithner ’s confirmation hearing as Treasury secretary .
One has to wonder between Bill Richardson and Timothy Geithner if Barack Obama is properly vetting his appointments .
Is he even looking into these people that he entrusting the future of our country to or is cronyism the deciding factor in his appointments ?
Barack Obama has shown a stunning lack of judgement in several of his cabinet appointments , including a man with no experience heading the CIA and also a television doctor as Surgeon General , and this is coming from a man who ran on his judgement .
This is just the beginning .
After eleven days in office , Newsweek puts Obama in Vietnam John Byrne
Published : Saturday January 31 , 2009
Print This Email This Coming to newsstands Monday : 1965 .
That 's the year then - President Lyndon Johnson officially expanded America 's involvement in Vietnam , expanding the number of US troops from 3,500 in March to 200,000 by December .
Newsweek invites the comparison with a bold cover , titled , " OBAMA'S VIETNAM , " going to press less than two weeks after Obama takes office .
Johnson , like Obama , inherited a troubled US conflict from his predecessor .
" A wave of reports , official and unofficial , from American and foreign ( including Afghan ) diplomats and soldiers , present and former , all seem to agree : the situation in Afghanistan is bad and getting worse , " the magazine 's Evan Thomas and John Barry write , in a news story that accompanies an opinion piece by Fahreed Zakaria .
" Some four decades ago , American presidents became accustomed to hearing gloomy reports like that from Vietnam , although the public pronouncements were usually rosier .
John F. Kennedy worried to his dying day about getting stuck in a land war in Asia ; LBJ was haunted by nightmares about " Uncle Ho . "
In the military , now as then , there are a growing number of doubters .
But the default switch for senior officers in the U.S. military is " can do , sir ! " and that seems to be the light blinking now .
In Afghanistan , as in Vietnam , when in doubt , escalate .
There are now about 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
The outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration appear to agree that the number should be twice that a year or so from now . "
Johnson escalated the Vietnam conflict after a purported attack on the USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin in August 1964 .
A declassified NSA intercept , however , revealed that there was no attack at all .
In the following year , America 's involvement soared .
Newsweek 's authors disparage liberals , to whom " all American interventions after Vietnam have been potential ' quagmires , ' " and after saying " Vietnam analogies can be tiresome , " go on to compare Afghanistan to Vietnam -- in detail .
" Vietnam analogies can be tiresome , " they write .
" To critics , especially those on the left , all American interventions after Vietnam have been potential " quagmires . "
But sometimes clichés come true , and , especially lately , it seems that the war in Afghanistan is shaping up in all - too - familiar ways . "
And yet , the authors are also careful to draw the disconnects between Vietnam and the now - poppy state of Afghanistan ( though not nearly as careful as the magazine 's editors , who do n't even place a question mark after their headline ) .
" Even 60,000 troops is a long way from the half million American soldiers sent to Vietnam at the war 's peak ; the 642 U.S. deaths sustained so far pale in comparison to the 58,000 lost in Vietnam , " Thomas and Barry add .
" Still , consider this : that 's a higher death toll than after the first nine years of U.S. involvement in Vietnam .
And what is troubling is that no one in the outgoing or incoming administration has been able to say what the additional troops are for , except as a kind of tourniquet to staunch the bleeding while someone comes up with a strategy that has a chance of working .
The most uncomfortable question is whether any strategy will work at this point . "
If anything is for certain , it 's that Obama 's media honeymoon is over .

Fnk have always had us in doubt of their ability to produce something that was n’t just a little kitsch , until we heard ‘ Want U ’ that is .
Even when they signed to one of our favourite UK labels Moshi Moshi way back 2005 / 6 , we just thought it was all a little uneasy and faux , a probable flash in the pan if we ’re honest .
‘ Want U ’ on the other hand is a absolutely great .
Great beat , excellent lyrics – good job .

The central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan was effectively knocked offline for more than a week by a Russian cybermilitia that continues to flood the country 's internet providers with crippling data attacks , a security expert said .
The attacks , which began on January 18 , bear the signature of pro-Russian nationalists believed to have launched similar cyber assaults on the republic of Georgia in August , said Don Jackson , a researcher with Atlanta - based security provider SecureWorks .
The attacks on Kyrgyzstan were so potent that most net traffic in and out of the country was completely blocked during the first seven days .
Over the past 48 hours , ISP have managed to mitigate some of the damage by relocating the servers of their biggest customers to different IP address ranges and employing a technique known as source filtering , which is designed to block harmful traffic while still allowing friendly packets through .
Some media organizations and government opposition groups in the country of 5.3 million have not been so fortunate .
" If you 're still one of those online media sites or you 're still one of the targets by domain names , it 's going to be hit or miss , " Jackson told The Register .
" A lot of the web services are still unavailable . "
Representatives from Kyrgyzstan Domain Registration Service and a service known as www.ns.kg did n't respond to emailed requests for comment .
The two services carry about 80 percent of the country 's traffic , Jackson said .
The attacks are the latest example of geopolitical disputes spilling into cyberspace , a trend that 's been growing in the past few years .
Web and email traffic in Estonia came to a standstill in May of 2007 after civil unrest over that country 's removal of a Soviet - era memorial was accompanied by attacks on the Baltic nation 's internet infrastructure .
Attacks on websites belonging to the Georgian government , on Radio Free Europe and cable television network CNN by Chinese hackers follow a similar pattern .
So - called distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks , which flood a victim with so much malicious data it is unable to respond to legitimate requests , are n't the only weapon in the arsenal of politically motivated hackers .
The Israeli Defense Force recently paid a Texas company that specializes in search engine optimization to halt the online backlash generated by its military action in Gaza .
Researchers from Arbor Networks , which monitors worldwide internet traffic for attacks and other anomalies , said they were n't seeing any malicious traffic directed toward Kyrgyzstan .
Arbor 's Jose Nazario said that was most likely because of a " visibility issue " resulting from the company " not tracking the right botnets . "
The culprits in the attacks on Kyrgyzstan are most likely a group of technically capable Russian citizens recruited by Russian officials , Jackson said .
The vast majority of the drones that are bombarding the Kyrgyz targets are located in Russia .
The geographic concentration makes source blocking a more effective countermeasure than when the bots are scattered throughout the world .
Jackson speculated the attacks are designed to silence opponents of Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , who are demanding the leader reverse his plans to close an airbase to the US military in its war in Afghanistan .
The Russian government wants the base closed , Jackson said . ®
Someone is about to lose a penis .
Someone is about to lose a penis .
Check this video out to see the flatworms ' penis fence '
Banana slugs about to have sex .
First they measure up each other 's sizes because if the male 's penis is bigger than the female , she 'll let him know by biting it off .

An argonaut displaying his many tentacles .
The hectotylus is the third tentacle inside the large sac ;
It 's fully mature .
Perverted animals are doing things that are freakier , nastier and arguably more painful than any man has ever performed with their penis .
In fact , if you try to even remotely pull off some of these sexual acts on someone you ’d not only be sent to jail but you ’d also provide a good reason for reinstalling of capital punishment .
Yet , the super - power that these penises possess is fascinating and would make any male wonder “ Why ca n’t my penis do that ?
” Let ’s start off with the genitals that pop -off and kill .
This is a sexual feature of animals such as honeybees and wasp spiders that is actually quite useful , where the male genitals pop off after having sex with a female .
The part that was snapped off is also left inside the female .
Because the queen bee or spider female is sought after by so many horny males , the detached penises are left inside to plug up the female ;
Thereby preventing females from having sex with other males .
Popped genitals are the best way to make sure a girl stays faithful in the animal world .
Unlike spiders though , when the male bee detaches his genitals he ends up dead .
But death is a small price to pay for true loyalty , right fellas ?
If snapping off your penis is n’t your idea of a super - power , then may I suggest using it as a sword against your enemies ?
That ’s at least how the flatworm does it with his sharp stabbing penises .
Yes , flatworms actually duel with other flatworms with their genitals , except their penis resembles two swords ( because one penis - sword is never enough ) .
And as the flatworms sword fight each other with their cocks , the loser of the battle suffers the most embarrassing defeat of all macho male warriors : Pregnancy .
I only wish this was a fatality move in Mortal Kombat .
The loser becomes pregnant because flatworms are actually hermaphrodites who , along with their male genitals , also get to have female organs as well .
And once the flatworm loses the cock - fight he / she gets stabbed by the champion ’s penis which releases sperm into the loser ’s body , thereby impregnating the female genitals of the flatworm .
Imagine if Marcutio became impregnated after getting stabbed by Tybalt ?
Now , there ’s a fight scene within a love story .
But superpower goes beyond violence , it also requires special abilities .
And extension is one feature that is sought by superhero wannabes .
How big do animals wish their penises grew ?
How about as big as themselves ?
The banana slug , not only looks like a penis but its penis looks like him too !
The slug ’s flexible and moist outer - membrane allows for such stretching .
They ’re also hermaphrodite , so their “ vaginas ” are just as wide .
If you thought that was large , imagine a penis that was 50 times larger than your body !
Such are the bragging rights of barnacles , those practically immobile Ron Jeremy ’s of the sea .
Barnacles need sex too , and they wo n’t let immobility get in the way of pleasuring their penises , even if the girl is 50 barnacles away .
Most importantly , I ’d like to present to you the penis - pod , which was a personal fantasy of mine when I was a teenager .
See , sometimes the teenage brain and the penis come into disagreement .
Like I wanted to watch T.V or pay attention in class but my penis was too impatient .
“ If only it had legs to go off and satisfy itself and leave me to finish my provincial exam , ” I would wish to myself .
And this is where the Argonaut would have solved such problems .
The Argonaut has a special tentacle that is used as a pod , it ’s called the hectocotylus .
When the Argonaut meets a female , the hectocotylus detaches from the Argonaut to become a lone swimming penis .
No pick up lines , no dinner , and no fancy mating rituals ;
She either wants it or rejects it .
So just swim over to her , Mr. Penis , and do your thing … I have work to do .
That ’s a super - power that both the penis and the male brain require , if man wishes to reach his full potential .
Hackers are distracting motorists by hacking electronic road signs in some states as electronic road message boards meant to warn motorists of possible trouble are increasingly being hacked .
Pranksters are putting up words that may endanger and distract drivers from heeding legitimate hazards down the road saying ' zombies ' or ' raptors ahead . '
Just days earlier , a sign read , NAZI ZOMBIES !
RUN !!! and ZOMBIES IN AREA !
RUN flashed on electronic sign boards at a busy Austin intersection , just west of the University of Texas campus .
Last Monday , the electronic message on a sign in Carmel 's construction zone at Indiana 's Hamilton County , warned drivers of RAPTORS AHEAD ... CAUTION .
Another recent prank yesterday appeared when hackers changed a road sign along southbound Interstate 255 near this St. Louis that read , DAILY LANE CLOSURES DUE TO ZOMBIES .
How exactly pranksters did these remains unclear ; highway safety officials are not amused .
We do n't want ( drivers ) being distracted by a funny sign , appealed by Joe Gasaway an Illinois Department of Transportation supervisory field engineer .

Iceland 's senior minister resigns as government becomes first global political casualty of the credit crunch
Iceland 's Minister of Commerce Bjorgvin Sigurdsson has resigned , two days after the prime minister announced his own departure due to pressures from the island nation 's economic collapse .
Mr Sigurdsson , a member of Iceland 's junior Social Democrat coalition party , made the announcment at a news conference this morning .
' I have decided to do this to take responsibility , ' he said .
Prime Minister Geir Haarde shocked the country on Friday when he said he would not seek re-election and called for a general election on May 9 .
Crunch victims : Bjorgvin Sigurdsson ( left ) has joined Prime Minister Geir Haarde , and resigned in response to the economic crisis and increasing dissent
The government of Iceland became the first in the world to be effectively brought down by the credit crunch .
It came after several nights of rioting over the financial crisis .
A poll would not normally be held until 2011 .
Mr Haarde also revealed that he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumour of the oesophagus and would not seek re-election .
' I have decided not to seek re-election as leader of the Independence Party at its upcoming national congress , ' he told a news conference .
The global financial crisis hit Iceland , which has a population 320,000 , in October , triggering a collapse in its currency and financial system under the weight of billions of dollars of foreign debts incurred by its banks .
Protesters clash with police in Reykjavik during a demonstration against the Icelandic government 's handling of the country 's financial crisis
The economy is set to shrink 10 percent this year and unemployment is surging .
Critics wanted Mr Haarde , the central bank governor and other senior officials to resign .
Some senior figures in his party have also said they favour an early election , but Mr Haarde had up to now vowed to defy plunging popularity and stay on .
Protests had been held weekly since the crisis broke last year , but since Tuesday have been held every night .
On Thursday , police used teargas on demonstrators for the first time since protests against the North Atlantic island 's entry into the NATO alliance in 1949 .
Special forces had to rescue Mr Haarde from his car after he was surrounded by an furious mob hurling eggs and cans outside the government offices , in Reykjavik .
Riot police huddle together as projectiles are thrown at the Parliament building behind them in downtown Reykjavik
The seething crowd spattered the building with paint and yoghurt , yelling and banging pans , hurling fireworks and flares at the windows and even lighting a fire in front of the main doors .
' There were a couple of hundred ( protesters ) when they had to use the gas , ' police spokesman Gunnar Sigurdsson said .
' It went on for two hours or so .
There were no arrests .
Some injuries , but not serious . '
Latvia , Bulgaria and other European countries hit hard by the global economic meltdown have also seen unrest .
Protesters carry a placard of Iceland 's Justice Minister Bjorn Bjarnason and a sign reading ' death power ' during demonstrations
Do n't expect new roads or rails to start spreading across Los Angeles County now that Measure R has passed ; transportation officials say the first projects on a long list are still several years from opening .
Early work is likely to include an extension of the Expo Line from Culver City to Santa Monica , an extension of the Gold Line from Pasadena to Azusa and placement of a busway or light - rail line along Crenshaw Boulevard in South Los Angeles , planners say .
But approval of a half - cent sales tax delivered a more immediate victory to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who came into office more than three years ago pledging to finally start the city 's so - called Subway to the Sea .
Now , money to begin such a subterranean route -- probably along the Wilshire corridor -- is assured by the Measure R plan .
" The commuters of L.A. were fed up with traffic and gas prices , and they responded by making an historic investment that will change the face of transportation in the region forever , " Villaraigosa said .

Immune senescence , or a reduction in immune responses , occurs along with many other organ system declines observed in human aging .
Immune senescence is characterized by a reduction of naïve T and B lymphocytes and an increase in T and B memory cells .
This population shift of lymphocytes causes a reduced response to infection and vaccination as well as an increase in inflammatory cytokines that can contribute to many age - related diseases .
Calorie restriction ( CR ) diets have been shown to increase the health and lifespan of many model animals .
Specifically , in short lived rodent models , these beneficial effects have improved immune system function by enhancing immune competence , inhibiting age - related dysregulation of cytokine secretion , and by preventing the accumulation of senescent T cells through increasing apoptosis .
In a paper previously published by Messaoudi et al .
the researchers found that CR diets in long - lived Rhesus monkeys ( RM ) increased the number and function of naïve and memory T - cells , thus delaying the immune senescence seen in aging immune systems and reproducing the results seen in short - lived model organisms .
In their most recently published study , Messaoudi et al. analyzed the effect of the age - of - onset of CR diets on T - cell homeostasis and function in RM to ascertain the importance of timing the initiation of CR diets throughout the lifespan of RM .
In this study , RM began a CR diet as juveniles or in advanced age .
In both cases , a CR diet started before or after adulthood negatively impacted immune function .
Optimal window of caloric restriction onset limits its beneficial impact on T - cell senescence in primates .
We have recently shown in non-human primates that caloric restriction ( CR ) initiated during adulthood can delay T - cell aging and preserve naïve CD8 and CD4 T cells into advanced age .
An important question is whether CR can be initiated at any time in life , and whether age at the time of onset would modulate the beneficial effects of CR .
In the current study , we evaluated the impact of CR started before puberty or during advanced age on T - cell senescence and compared it to the effects of CR started in early adulthood .
Our data demonstrate that the beneficial effects of adult - onset CR on T - cell aging were lost by both early and late CR onset .
In fact , some of our results suggest that inappropriate initiation of CR may be harmful to the maintenance of T - cell function .
This suggests that there may be an optimal window during adulthood where CR can delay immune senescence and improve correlates of immunity in primates .
The peripheral blood of the juvenile CR cohort had the same number of circulating lymphocytes but there was a significant decrease in naïve T cells , and a significant increase in memory T - cells .
Additionally , the researchers noted in addition to the decrease in T - cell diversity , an increase in T - cells secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines , and a loss of proliferative potential of T - cells suggesting that early onset of CR diets negatively impacts T - cell aging in male RM .
These phenotypes were not seen in the female juvenile CR cohort .
The authors state that this could be due to the fact that the females were 5 years younger on average than the males at the time of peripheral blood sampling .
Alternatively , the authors suggest that there may be sex specific effects of CR diets in these animals .
But since they did not observe any sex specific differences in their previous study of adolescent CR , the authors conclude that it is more likely that sex differences observed are due to the age discrepancy at the time of the data collection .
It will be informative to assess these females in another 5 years to determine if their phenotype mimics the phenotype observed in the males presented here .
In the old age CR cohort , there was no decrease in the population diversity in the circulating T - cells and no difference in numbers of T - cells secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines .
However there was an overall reduction in white blood cells , specifically neutrophils , but it is unclear if this phenotype has a detrimental or beneficial effect .
Old age CR also resulted in a decreased proliferation potential in T - cells indicating a negative impact of advanced age CR on RM .
This study highlights that appropriate timing of calorie restriction diet onset is critical to observing the beneficial effects on immune senescence .
These data also reveal the importance of proper caloric intake during development for healthy immune function .
As we improve our understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms by which CR improves health and lifespan we will be better able to treat age - related diseases .
Additionally , these non-human primate studies will be exciting to follow as they may prove to be the most relevant animal model to enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms behind CR diets in humans .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Treasury Department overpaid for the assets it purchased as part of the $ 700 billion financial sector bailout , according to testimony of a bailout oversight official before Congress on Thursday .
At a Senate Banking Committee hearing , Elizabeth Warren , head of the Congressional Oversight Panel , testified that the more than $ 254 billion in assets that the government purchased in 2008 are worth just $ 176 billion - $ 78 billion less than what Treasury paid for them .
Warren said the shortfall happened on the date of the transaction , and is not representative of the market 's movements since then .
She noted that Treasury has failed to delineate a clear reason for such an overpayment .
" At various points Treasury has articulated policy objectives which could result in a program involved in paying substantially more for investments than they appear to have been worth at the time of the transaction , " said Warren .
" The American people want to know what 's going on and they deserve answers . "
Warren 's panel will release its full report on the shortfall Friday .
She said the panel arrived at the figures after it hired an independent valuation firm and finance experts to analyze publicly available data on the banks receiving bailout funds .
The study follows a separate report released last month , in which the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Treasury has lost $ 64 billion on its investments in the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
But Warren said the experts hired by her panel valued each transaction using multiple methods , and arrived at the conclusion that the CBO 's estimates were too low .
Warren said Treasury failed to price in risk for its capital purchase program , buying assets that would likely decrease in value .
" It 's as if I said I 'd pay $ 1 million for 10 paintings , but one was a Picasso , one was a Rembrandt and the others were not , " Warren argued .
Concerns about accountability
The committee heard from the heads of the three key TARP oversight bodies : Warren ; Neil Barofsky , special inspector general ; and Gene Dodaro , acting comptroller general of the Government Accountability Office .
All three said Treasury needs to implement a more transparent asset management strategy to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted .
" They need to ... articulate a clear strategy , otherwise they are spending billions of dollars on an ad hoc basis , " said Warren .
Committee members and oversight officials expressed concern that banks in receipt of bailout funds are not required to account for how they use the money .
Lawmakers especially expressed outrage regarding bailed - out banks ' purchases of planes and luxury hotel rooms .
" Too many banks are given a free pass ; too many TARP recipients use these funds for everything but lending , " said Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , committee chairman .
" The public is outraged by this behavior with good cause . "
Barofsky recommended Treasury address the public 's concerns in a report that he submitted to Congress on Thursday .
The report said Treasury must tighten regulation of the bailout and implement a better investment strategy and new fraud prevention standards .
In testimony , Barofsky said Treasury must make known " what the recipients have done with the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested . "
So far , the Treasury has injected into 360 banks more than $ 195 billion of the $ 250 billion allocated for capital injections .
It has also sent another $ 20 billion each to Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) in emergency funding , $ 40 billion to American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , and $ 21 billion to General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Chrysler and GMAC .
In exchange , Treasury has collected preferred shares or warrants , and amassed a large portfolio of investments .
Treasury ' not candid '
Dodd and ranking member Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , both said they were worried that Treasury did not have a coherent and consistent plan .
Treasury , before the bill was passed , told Congress that it would buy up toxic mortgage - backed securities from banks ' asset portfolios .
Soon after the bailout bill was enacted , Treasury said it would instead inject capital into healthy banks , but few would argue that all the banks receiving funds qualify as " healthy . "
Shelby asked Warren if she felt Treasury had purposefully misled Congress .
" It suggests the Secretary 's [ Paulson 's ] description of the program was not entirely candid , " Warren responded .
" They did not do what they said they were doing .
They announced one program and implemented another . "
Many lawmakers voted to halt the release of the second half of the bailout funds , though the motion eventually failed and Treasury received the second $ 350 billion .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President Obama hinted that they may detail a revised bank bailout as soon as this week .
The plans are likely to include a program that would relieve banks of troubled mortgage assets , and may also feature promises for additional capital infusions or an offer to guarantee the value of some bank holdings .
The oversight group representatives said they had met with Geithner and were encouraged by early indications that the new secretary would take up many of the recommendations they had made to the previous administration .
The American strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani marks " an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict in the Middle East with global significance " outgoing British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn claims .
Soleimani led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ' Quds Force .
He and an Iraqi militia leader were killed in a drone strike Thursday near Baghdad 's airport .
Corbyn , who was routed in recent British elections , called on the UK government to " urge restraint on the part of both Iran and the US , and stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the United States . "
In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson , Corbyn demanded a briefing of the Privy Council , the top advisory body to Queen Elizabeth II , about the Soleimani killing .
Corbyn asked whether the Trump administration consulted with the British government before the strike and what advice was given .
He also asked about precautions being taken to secure British nationals in the face of possible Iranian attacks .
Johnson called for restraint following the killing , but stated " we will not lament [ Soleimani 's ] death " because of the thousands of innocent people and Western military personnel he had killed .
Corbyn has been strongly pro-Iran for more than a decade .
Between 2009 and 2012 Corbyn accepted nearly $ 6,600 for appearances on the state - run Press TV outlet .
He appeared on the channel even after the British government banned it .
He also has had a soft spot for Iran 's terrorist proxies that Soleimani supported including Hizballah , Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) .
Corbyn notoriously called Hizballah his " friends " during a 2009 parliamentary meeting , and his Labour Party argued last February that no clear evidence existed to designate it as a terrorist group .
Hamas backed Corbyn 's election campaign , and an individual closely tied to the group running a pro-Corbyn website from Gaza , the Jerusalem Post reported .
In 2014 , Corbyn attended a wreath - laying ceremony with PFLP leader - in - exile Maher al - Taher in Tunisia .
" It seems his default position is to side with terrorists , with people like Hamas and Hezbollah , rather than side with our own agencies and military .
That is historically what he has done , " Labour Party House of Lords member Alan West said in November .
Labour will elect a new leader in April .

A top - level Hamas delegation is attending the Kuala Lumpur Summit , a gathering of Islamist leaders in Malaysia .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad also are attending .
The conference gives Hamas an opportunity to argue for the Palestinian cause , said Muslem Amran , the terrorist group 's representative in Malaysia .
A photo posted on Twitter shows Hamas leaders including political bureau member Mousa Abu Marzook and includes his colleagues Khalil Al - Hayya , Izzt Al - Rashiq and Husam Badran posing for a photo with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad .
Ironically , Mahathir complained that Muslim countries are associated with terrorism .
" For far too long we have been associated with bad governance , endemic corruption and a breeding place for terrorism , " Mahathir wrote .
" We can keep on shouting that such labels , especially being breeders of terrorism as callous anti-Islam propaganda .
We know that it is really true but our weakness and disunity have given credence to this propaganda . "
A Hamas communique notes that the terrorist group 's delegation attended at Mahathir 's invitation .
Relations between Hamas and Malaysia have tightened since Mahathir became prime minister in 2018 .
Mohamad has a history of anti-Semitic statements .
" I am glad to be labeled anti-Semitic [...]
How can I be otherwise , when the Jews who so often talk of the horrors they suffered during the Holocaust show the same Nazi cruelty and hard - heartedness towards not just their enemies but even towards their allies should any try to stop the senseless killing of their Palestinian enemies , " the Times of Israel reported Mahathir wrote on his blog in 2012 .
Malaysia has been a focal point for Hamas operations in Southeast Asia .
Hamas raised millions in Malaysia , and the country has allowed Hamas terrorists to train on its soil .
Pakistan boycotted the meeting following consultation with Saudi Arabia , which objected to what it saw as an effort by Turkey , Qatar and Malaysia to replace the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) .
Egypt and Saudi Arabia also boycotted the summit .
Hamas ' involvement in the multi-day conference reaffirms its firm place within the Turkish - Qatari axis and serves as a reminder of Malaysia 's support for the terrorist group .

Libya's Muslim Brotherhood - controlled Government of National Accord ( GNA ) wants Turkey to send military advisers to the country .
The United States and the United Nations recognize the GNA as Libya 's legitimate government .
The Turkish advisers would supplement Turkish forces already in Libya to fight against anti-Islamist Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar , who is backed by the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , and Russian mercenaries belonging to the Wagner group .
This Russian company first became prominent during the 2014 seizure of Crimea by Vladimir Putin .
Turkey has used drones in Libya against Haftar 's forces over the past year .
Turkey 's Islamist SADAT Defense Consulting , a group that has trained al - Qaida and ISIS - linked jihadists in Syria , in cooperation with Turkey 's MIT intelligence agency , may increase its involvement in Libya .
SADAT also trained and equipped Hamas fighters , according to Israeli investigators .
" SADAT has already [ been ] involved in Libya before in training , expertise , facilitating of arms and logistical supplies etc .
The new engagement means an escalation of what they have already been doing , " said Turkish journalist Abdullah Bozkurt , who has followed SADAT 's activities in Libya and elsewhere .
" Since the Turkish military was transformed with the purge of almost all pro-NATO officers and the posts are filled with Islamists and neo-nationalists since 2016 , there is no military check on Sadat and Erdoğan government 's ambitions to empower jihadists in Libya .
" SADAT would tap into huge resources of the Turkish military to fulfill Erdoğan 's dream of securing an [ Islamist - controlled ] ... Libyan government . "
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hopes to gain a share of Libya 's oil production , with Haftar now controlling the oil fields , according to the Turkish news site Boldmedya.com .
Russia has a similar interest in Libyan oil .
Wagner , the mercenary group , has a history of defending Russian oil interests , Libya analyst Jalel Harchaoui of the Dutch Clingendael Institute told the Investigative Project on Terrorism .
This was true in Syria .
Wagner has been directly involved in combat in Libya .
" Erdoğan used SADAT and the Turkish intelligence to introduce Libyan jihadists to Syrian theater early in the conflict in 2011 .
Now a reverse engineering is going on with jihadists picked up from Syria and deployed in Libya with the help of the Turkish government , " Bozkurt said .
Chances of Turkish and Russian mercenaries clashing in combat are remote because Erdogan needs to maintain good relations with Putin , Bozkurt and Harchaoui said .
Erdogan created trouble in the Eastern Mediterranean by threatening Greece and Cyprus over rights to explore for oil and gas in Cypriot waters , which has caused some experts to fear armed conflict between NATO members Greece and Turkey .
He signed an agreement last month with the GNA to extend Turkey 's maritime boundary to link up with Libya 's and promised military assistance .
SADAT opposes NATO , and its founder , Brig .
Gen. Adnan Tanriverdi , is Erdogan 's military adviser and longtime friend .
He advocates the establishment of a pan-Muslim army instead of NATO .
" It is also SADAT that decides on promotions in ranks of the Turkish military , " Bozkurt said .
" I would say the U.S. and Europe must be concerned a lot about SADAT 's encroachment against transatlantic alliance . "

An organized effort to silence a speech at Vassar College by Israeli activist Hen Mazzig last week " crossed the line into anti-Semitism " and could lead to disciplinary action , President Elizabeth H. Bradley said in a statement Monday .
Members of Vassar 's Students for Justice in Palestine ( SJP ) chapter broke their promise to keep their protest against Mazzig 's talk peaceful , she wrote When Mazzig tried to speak , he was shouted down by chants , including , " From the river to the sea , Palestine will be free . "
That chant , Bradley wrote , " crossed the line into anti-Semitism " because it " can be understood to be calling for the eradication of the State of Israel and is highly intimidating to Israelis and Jews , and directed it to an Israeli speaker discussing his perspective on Indigenous Jews . "
But SJP members defended their attempt to silence Mazzig , in part because he " attacked Linda Sarsour and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar , as well as other supporters of BDS , specifically targeting SJPs across the country with insults and false information . "
Sarsour and Omar each have records of anti-Semitism , from Sarsour 's blood libel blaming Jews for police shootings of unarmed black people in America , to Omar 's series of statements invoking anti-Semitic canards about Jewish power , loyalty and money .
Protesters ' chants stopped after a while and Mazzig was able to complete his talk , the Vassar SJP chapter said .
" Although we do not believe that Zionism should have a platform , especially not one funded by our student government , we did not prevent anyone from attending the talk or stop [ Hen ] Mazzig from speaking . "
But on the day of the speech , SJP said its commitment to a boycott of all things related to Israel meant it had to " refuse to offer space for even more racism and imperialism on this campus .
None of us will be free until Palestine is free , and challenging Zionism wherever it emerges on campus is one of the best ways to show our solidarity . "
Vassar 's SJP is no stranger to controversy .
In 2016 , the chapter sold t- shirts featuring convicted Palestinian terrorist Leila Khaled with the phrase " resistance is not terrorism . "
In 2014 , the group posted a Nazi cartoon on its Tumblr page .
The Algemeiner rated Vassar College the second worst college for Jewish students to attend due to its anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activity .
President Bradley 's strong statement acknowledging the inherent anti-Semitism in SJP 's message is a refreshing and welcome response .

The New York Times edited a reference which accurately described the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) as a terrorist group from a Nov. 12 story , the Committee for Accuracy In Middle East Reporting and Analysis ( CAMERA ) found .
This story appeared following an Israeli attack in Gaza that killed PIJ leader Baha Abu al - Ata .
" The group is listed as a terrorist organization by many countries , and is supported by Iran , " the first draft of the Times story said .
Inexplicably , that reference disappeared later in the day .
A reference to PIJ 's " harder line toward Israel " appeared in its place , CAMERA wrote .
After U.S. special forces killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi in a raid last month , CAMERA noted , the newspaper had no qualms describing Abu Bakr as a " terrorist " who led a " terrorist group " that committed " acts of terror . "
The United States , Canada , European Union ( EU ) , Australia and others have designated PIJ as a Foreign Terrorist Organization .
U.S. law defines terrorism as " the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . "
PIJ targets civilians just like ISIS .
It has been responsible for mass casualty bombings of Israeli markets , buses and shopping malls over the years in addition to its frequent rocket attacks aimed at killing civilians .
ISIS and PIJ are guilty of similar crimes , so why the decision to suddenly obscure the fact PIJ is a terrorist organization that targets civilians ?

Hamas , a terrorist group which diverts resources meant to improve life in Gaza to prepare future attacks on Israeli civilians , has endorsed the invasion of northeastern Syria that Turkey calls " Operation Peace Spring . "
" The movement understands Turkey 's right to protect its borders , defend itself and remove threats to its national security against the futility of the Zionist Mossad in the region , which seeks to undermine Arab and Islamic national security , " Hamas said in a statement .
Turkish artillery rained down death on civilians in Qamishli near the Turkish border two weeks ago .
Turkish planes and artillery also dropped white phosphorus incendiary munitions near the town of Ras al - Ain .
Images showed children who were severely burned in the attacks .
Turkish - backed jihadists participating in Turkey 's invasion also looted Kurdish and Syrian homes .
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri reaffirmed the terrorist group 's support for Turkey 's offensive in an interview Monday with Turkey 's Anadolu News Agency .
" We support Turkey 's right to protect its security and its limitation .
Turkey the government , we trust that they respect the brother of Syria 's territorial integrity , " he said .
But the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) never threatened Turkey .
It tried to avoid antagonizing Erdogan , and in August it even pulled its forces away from the Syrian - Turkish border .
It launched no rockets or artillery on positions inside Turkey before the unprovoked invasion .
This cautious behavior stands in contrast with Hamas , which fires rockets at civilian communities in southern Israel and invests heavily in building tunnels to use in terrorist attacks .
When Israel defends itself from Hamas attacks the group complains about how Israel kills Palestinian civilians .
" Israeli occupation forces wounded 50 Palestinian civilians , including 8 paramedics and a journalist , as they brutally attacked yesterday 's # GreatReturnMarch protests east of # Gaza # IsraeliCrimes , " Hamas wrote in a June 29 tweet .
The violence was sparked by Hamas - orchestrated riots at the border between Israel and Gaza .
Similar confrontations have taken place for more than a year .
Hamas officials acknowledge that the vast majority of casualties are not civilians , but Hamas members .
U.S. and Israeli authorities say that Turkey provides refuge , along with military and financial assistance to Hamas .
The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions last month on Hamas leaders and ISIS facilitators living in Turkey , including Zaher Jabarin , who manages tens of millions of dollars in Hamas money while living from Turkey .
It also targeted the Turkey - based Redin Exchange as " a key part of the infrastructure used to transfer money " to Hamas .
Redin transferred $ 10 million in March to the Izz ad - Din al - Qassam Brigades , Hamas ' military wing .
Hamas fighters have been equipped and trained by the Turkish private military company SADAT , which also reportedly trained jihadists belonging to the Free Syrian Army who have joined the Turkish invasion and ISIS .
This support for Erdogan 's assault on Syrian civilians reveals Hamas ' talk about human rights is nothing but a farce .

An American Islamist delegation that included a supporter of Jamaat - e - Islami Pakistan , a group that directly supports Kashmiri terrorists , met last week with a senior State Department official , the Pakistani news website Dawn.com reported .
Leaders of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations ( USCMO ) met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Pakistan Affairs Ervin Massinga , a Sept. 6 tweet from the State Department 's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs shows .
The delegation included Zahid Bukhari , executive director of the Islamic Circle of North America ( ICNA ) 's Council for Social Justice ; Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) ; Osama Abu Irshaid , executive director of American Muslims for Palestine ( AMP ) ; and USCMO Secretary General Oussama Jammal .
India 's decision last month to end the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir 's special status has heightened tensions with Pakistan .
Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency has helped foment terrorist activity in the region for decades .
Pakistan and India fought a series of wars over the territory since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 .
U.S. Islamists rallied behind Pakistan since India announced the change in Kashmir 's status .
AMP , a rabidly anti-Israel group , tried to compare the Jammu and Kashmir issue to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
" Revoking Article 370 has turned India from administrator to fully - fledged colonizer , following , in many ways , Israel 's methods , " AMP wrote .
CAIR and its chapters also protested India 's decision .
State Department officials told the USCMO delegation that the U.S. hopes to see direct talks between India and Pakistan .
Multiple posts on Bukhari's Facebook page show his support for Jamaat - e - Islami Pakistan .
Hizb ul - Mujahideen , a terrorist group that has waged a jihadist struggle against India in Kashmir since 1989 , has a close relationship with Jamaat - e - Islami Pakistan .
The Canadian Revenue Agency called this group the armed wing of Jamaat - e - Islami Pakistan .
Hizb ul - Mujahideen was founded by a Jamaat - e - Islami member and evidence suggests a close financial relationship with the terrorist group .
Jamaat -e - Islami death squads killed thousands of civilians during Bangladesh 's 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan .
A Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal convicted former Islamic Circle of North America ( ICNA ) Secretary General Ashrafuzzaman Khan in 2013 on 11 counts of kidnapping and murder of 18 intellectuals in the War of Independence .
ICNA has historic ties to Jamaat - e - Islami , which aims to create an Islamic society .
ICNA 's 1994 Charter and By - Laws , which bears Bukhari 's imprint , states that Islam should be " sincerely and exclusively implemented in all aspects of human life " through " democratic , legal and peaceful means . "
Bukhari has offered a similar vision .
" We are to prove our claim that Islam is the only answer and the only solution for all socioeconomic , political and cultural problems , " Bukhari said in the July 1992 issue of ICNA 's monthly periodical The Message International .

The Washington Post is out Monday with something that looks like good news .
Three board members at the national Women 's March who were involved in a series of anti-Semitic incidents are out .
A diverse group of 16 people , including three Jews , will replace them .
But some of those new board members raise additional questions about the March , and seem to reinforce the previous concern that it is not a welcoming place for women who support the state of Israel .
For example , Zahra Billoo is one of the new March leaders .
The Post quoted her talking about the challenge the March faces " being able to harness our biggest strength and turn that energy into action " before the 2020 election Billoo said .
But Billoo , who runs the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) San Francisco office , matches – perhaps even surpasses – outgoing board member Linda Sarsour 's hatred for Israel and those who support it .
Billoo at least is candid enough to admit she does n't think the Jewish state should exist ( she has not mentioned other countries she wishes would disappear ) .
She repeatedly has compared Israeli soldiers to ISIS terrorists .
Being pro-Israel , she has written , is tantamount to being " pro-terror , pro-violence , pro-land theft , and pro-apartheid . "
Criticizing Israeli leaders , or government policies , is not anti-Semitic .
But rejecting even the idea of the state 's existence , is .
It 's a view shared by the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , France and at least 25 other nations .
Much of the Women 's March troubles stemmed from the inability of outgoing leaders Sarsour , Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland to condemn the Nation of Islam 's anti-Semitic leader Louis Farrakhan .
As a result , the movement lost key donors and sponsors prior to January 's national march .
Over the years , Billoo has touted Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam .
She featured an Nation of Islam video on her blog in 2010 .
Seven months earlier , she felt compelled to share with her Twitter followers that she was " watching [ Nation of Islam leader Louis ] Farrakhan church speech , while at the gym . "
Touting Billoo's appointment to the board while Sarsour leaves would be like a company saying , " Harvey Weinstein has left our board .
Here 's our new member , Jeffrey Epstein . "

Hizballah used its al - Manar television network Monday to broadcast footage that it claims shows a missile strike targeting an Israeli military vehicle a day earlier .
The attack followed a series of reported Israeli strikes targeting Iranian and Hizballah infrastructure in Syria and Lebanon .
Sharing the footage allows Hizballah to save face among its supporters and signal its resolve to far more powerful Israeli military .
But beyond propaganda and deterrence efforts , Hizballah exploits its global media empire to strengthen a " resistance society " in Lebanon and cultivate to new bases of support throughout the world , according to a new Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center report .
Hizballah 's media domain is just one component of the terror group 's infrastructure , along with its military wing , global terrorist apparatus , and vast network of social institutions spread across Lebanese society .
Iran funds most of Al - Manar 's budget , which runs into the tens of millions of dollars .
While it generates little advertising revenue , it is considered the most vital outlet in Hizballah 's extensive media empire .
Hizballah broadcasts propaganda around the world in four languages , primarily targeting the Lebanese population , followed by the Arab and Muslim world .
But target audiences in the West are not immune .
Hizballah outlets operate in English and French speaking countries and even some Latin America states .
Some countries ' efforts to bar the channel have been circumvented as Hizballah now relies on Russian and Indonesian satellite services to continue its broadcasts worldwide .
Coverage primarily promotes Hizballah 's terrorist and militant activities , and glorifies its " shahids " ( martyrs ) .
But the channel also devotes considerable coverage to promoting Iranian propaganda and the Islamic Revolution 's radical ideology .
The broadcasts emphasize Hizballah 's devotion to the Islamic Republic , further proving that the terror group maintains its ultimate allegiance to Iran – not Lebanese society .
The Treasury Department in 2006 added Al - Manar and Radio Nour to its list of sanctioned Hizballah affiliates .
Yet the media outlets continue to operate freely , including in Ramallah with the Palestinian Authority 's tacit approval .
The remainder of Hizballah 's media outlets and key media figures remain off the U.S. sanctions list .
Hizballah 's media is instrumental in Iran 's efforts to promote the Islamic Revolution 's radical ideology and cultivate a terror network throughout the Middle East and the world .
" Such an extensive media empire in the possession of a terrorist organization is unprecedented among terrorist organizations operating around the world , " the Meir Amit report states .
The network of media outlets is led by Hajj Muhammad Affif , who also serves as Hizballah chief Hassan Nasrallah 's media adviser .
Hizballah also runs several newspapers , websites , and social media accounts .
It even engages in violent incitement against the United States through affiliated accounts on Twitter .
Click to here read the full Meir Amit report .
It is part of a wider research project devoted to exposing Hizballah 's vast social networks and institutions meant to strength the terror group 's stranglehold over Lebanese society and Shi'ite populations worldwide .

Hizballah established educational and athletic networks , including the " Sports Mobilization , " to indoctrinate young people to embrace the terrorist organization 's radical ideology , a recent Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center report finds .
Since its founding in 1982 , Hizballah has invested significant resources in developing institutions to recruit and cultivate future terrorists .
As part a broader vision to create a " Society of Resistance , " Hizballah 's efforts target youth from kindergarten through post - secondary schools .
This includes " The Imam al - Mahdi Scouts Association , " Hizballah 's official youth movement , which is devoted to brainwashing young Lebanese Shi'a as loyal disciples of the Islamic Republic of Iran 's revolutionary ideology .
The Scouts Association has branches throughout Shi'a areas across Lebanon with tens of thousands of members nationwide .
" Hizballah perceives sports as a means of inculcating its values in the youth and attracting it to its ranks , based on the connection between sports and the jihadi- military sphere , " the report said , citing Sports Mobilization chief Jihad Atiya 's 2015 interview with Hizballah 's Al - Manar Channel .
Photos of Islamic Republic founder Ruhollah Khomeini and current leader Ali Khamenei are often displayed during youth award ceremonies .
Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) similarly spreads the regime 's radical ideology by producing computer games , books , documentaries , and children 's videos .
The sporting programs teach athletic skills from a young age to develop effective future terrorists and fighters .
These skills include martial arts , weightlifting , swimming , and sports shooting .
Hizballah emphasizes soccer , given the sport 's immense popularity in Lebanese society .
According to the Meir Amit report , roughly half of all athletic competitions are hosted on symbolic dates for the terrorist organization , including " Shahid ( martyr's ) Day . "
Sports teams and facilities are named after Hizballah operatives killed during militant operations .
Children are encouraged to follow in their footsteps .
This phenomenon is similar to Hamas and the Palestinian Authority 's ( PA ) use of educational facilities and athletic activities to incite violence against Israel and encourage children to become terrorists .
This year , PA - affiliated institutions , including Fatah 's student movement , organized several sporting events named in honor of terrorists .
Similar events were held in Hamas - run Gaza .
Hizballah's Sports Mobilization keeps a low - profile with no official online or social media presence .
But throughout the course of its study , the Meir Amit Center was able to uncover 400 Hizballah - run sports events since 2011 .
Lebanon 's minister of Youth and Sports , Muhammad Fneish , is not featured on a U.S. sanctions list targeting Hizballah operatives despite the fact that he is a known Hizballah figure , the report points out .
The government ministry also sponsors Hizballah 's athletic programming .

I do to .
No one else I know has this problem . :(
Easiest way is to get rid of this is a bikini wax .
Yes , men get bikini waxes .
It 'll hurt like hell , because men's anuses do n't experience alot of trauma like womens .
you can also get a bikini wax formula at the local drug store .
You can also get a nose - ear hair trimmer and get to work .
This 'll keep the length down but it 's not going to rip out the roots .
Use a lighter and burn off those hairs , just be careful .
Do not exact interest from your countryman either in money or in kind , but out of fear of God let him live with you .
You are to lend him neither money at interest nor food at a profit .
" When , then , your countryman becomes so impoverished beside you that he sells you his services , do not make him work as a slave .
Rather , let him be like a hired servant or like your tenant , working with you until the jubilee year , when he , together with his children , shall be released from your service and return to his kindred and to the property of his ancestors .
Leviticus 25:36 - 42
Jubilee is an ancient Hebrew tradition in which every fifty years society is " reset . "
Debts were forgiven , slaves were freed , property restored to those it was taken from .
It 's even in the Lord 's Prayer , " Forgive us our debts ... "
Rome adopted this tradition , as long experience had shown them that the practice of lending money at interest inherently destabilized society .
Rome instituted numerous limits and occasional outright bans on the practice of usury out of fear that soaring debt would drive their people to rebellion .
When Christianity became Rome 's official religion , many Hebrew practices were abandoned , including the Jubilee .
Without that occasional push of the reset button , Rome 's debts piled up until Rome fell .
Then , in 1300 , Pope Boniface VIII issued a Bull entitled Antiquorum fida relation which called for a Jubilee - like " Great Forgiving " ; to erase all accumulated debts .
Needless to say this was a popular idea with everyone ( except the lenders ) who gladly undertook the required pilgrimage to Rome to have their debts erased by Holy Edict .
Debt forgiveness is still a common practice .
Much third world debt ( some of it owed to the US ) has been forgiven by the World Bank .
Japan forgave 17 nations that owed it money in the 1980s .
Congress regularly forgives Israel for loans over and above outright gifts made by the US Government .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger forgave Enron $ 9 billion in debt .
And of course , the bailouts represent a form of debt forgiveness for corporations in that their debts have been shifted onto the backs of US taxpayers .
Which brings me to my point .
Where is the Jubilee for the American people ?
While common sense and morality says that we should honor those debts we willingly undertake ourselves , what of the debts created for us without our permission by a government which has been so reckless in their borrowing ?
The debt - burden of the US Government upon the people is so great that even the President cannot find anyone for his staff who is not in arrears on their taxes .
The TV networks surge with commercials for tax resolution services .
So , time for a jubilee .
Just wipe it all out .
It does n't exist any more .
Now , many ( the lenders ) will scream that this harms the lenders who in good faith loaned money to the US Government .
But stop and think for a moment .
The vast majority fo that money borrowed by the government did not come out of anyone 's pockets .
It was printed up , out of thin air , by the Federal reserve .
I am not kidding you ; that is where the Federal reserve gets the money they loan to the government at interest .
They just print it up , or type the numbers into a computer somewhere .
It is imaginary money .
So is the interest owed on that imaginary money .
Yet We The People , ordered to repay that debt , are not allowed to print the money up as we need it .
We must work , provide physical labor , in exchange for that paper money demanded bny the government and the bankers .
And it is foolish to think that forgiving the national debt would harm the Federal Reserve since they have already made back in interest payments way more than they have loaned to the US Government .
All we are talking about is deciding that they have made enough off of us , without our permission , and it is time to stop .
Rome lasted as a Republic for about 500 years .
The Rome of the emperors lasted another 400 years and the eastern empire another 500 years after that .
In contrast the United States has lasted 233 years and is on the verge of collapse .
Maybe it is time to acknowledge that the idea of a periodic wiping out of all debts of the people is n't a bad idea .
The US Government has run up trillions of dollars in debts without our permission , then snears at us when we cannot keep up with the payments .
It is time for the American people , from whom the US Gvernment and Wall Street have taken so much , to demand their own bailout .
We did not create that estimated $ 40 trillion in governmnent debt ; it was created for us without our permission .
The lenders created the money loaded to the government out of nothing .
They lose nothing by wiping out that debt .
In the long run , with a revitalized debt - free economy the banks stand to earn more profits then by wresting the last few crumbs of food from our children 's mouths .
I present this not as a suggestion , but as a warning .
Because the present course this nation is on of robbing the poor to give to the rich has only one possible outcome .
The swimsuit issue accounts for 11 % of " Sports " Illustrated 's annual revenue , an SI honcho said on Bloomberg last night .
We assume he meant ad revenue , although it 's possible he was referring to the whole kit and kaboodle .
If we assume 50 yearly issues , each issue represents about 2 % of available annual ad inventory .
Which means the swimsuit issue is 5X as profitable as the sports the magazine covers in the other 49 issues .
May we suggest a change of editorial focus for these trying times ?
Meanwhile , do n't go looking for your copy in Walmart .
Some distributor is demanding an extra 7 cents a copy , and Time Inc. is telling it to pound sand .

My son in law today saw about 20 army guys with full combat gear walking down the street in Hayden , Idaho .
He took pictures and asked them what they were doing .
‘ They said they were just training .
One of the troopers was carrying a saw or squad automatic weapon .
Is this just training or is it getting the people used to seeing troops patroling the streets .
My son in law lives about a mile from the reserve unit at the airport .
my son in law was kind of surprised to see those guys .
I ” ve lived in the Hayden area most of my life and never saw any patrols .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- As George W. Bush spends his final days in office , a national poll suggests that two - thirds of Americans see his presidency as a failure .
President Bush gives his farewell address to the nation on Thursday at the White House .
Sixty - eight percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday said that Bush 's eight years in the White House were a failure , with 44 percent saying this was because of his personal shortcomings and 22 percent blaming the failure on circumstances beyond his control .
Thirty - one percent said they consider Bush 's presidency a success .
Half of those polled say the United States could be better off today if Al Gore had been elected president in 2000 rather than Bush , with 27 percent saying the country would be worse off if Gore had won .
Twenty - two percent say things would be about the same .
" Due to the Florida recount , Bush had the misfortune of coming into office under controversial circumstances , " CNN polling director Keating Holland said .
" A lot of Americans apparently remember those circumstances and now wish things had gone a little differently . "
Only 3 percent of those questioned say Bush was one of the greatest presidents in the nation 's history .
Forty - six percent rate him a poor president .
" That 's three times higher than the number who gave a failing grade to his father or Ronald Reagan when they left office , and it's 27 points higher than Bill Clinton in 2001 , " Holland said .
Thirty - one percent approve of Bush 's performance in the White House , his final approval rating as president .
" The good news for Bush : That 31 percent figure is 7 points higher than it was in November , a typical ' nostalgia bump ' that most outgoing presidents get , " Holland added .
" The bad news is that except for the rating Richard Nixon has when he resigned , that 's the lowest approval rating an outgoing president has received in the six decades of scientific public opinion polling . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted from January 12 to 15 , with 1,245 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for some questions and 4.5 percentage points for others .

Michael Phelps will not face criminal charges after a photo of him apparently smoking marijuana from a pipe sparked an investigation in South Carolina .
Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said Monday that he did n't have enough physical evidence to press charges against the 23 - year - old swimmer after the November party near the University of South Carolina in Columbia .
" We had a photo and him saying he was sorry for inappropriate behavior , " Lott said at a news conference .
" He never said , ' I smoked marijuana . '
We did n't have physical evidence . "
Lott defended the investigation , calling Phelps " an American hero … but even with his star status , he is still obligated to obey the laws of our state . "
In a statement Monday , Phelps said he would move forward in his training , " having put this whole thing behind me . "
" I 'm glad this matter is put to rest , " Phelps ' statement said .
" But there are also some important lessons that I 've learned .
For me , it 's all about recognizing that I used bad judgment and it's a mistake I wo n't make again .
For young people especially — be careful about the decisions you make .
One bad decision can really hurt you and the people you care about . "
The sheriff said the investigation began Feb .
2 . Two days later , officers found the marijuana pipe thought to be used in the photo .
They found it in a car .
" The bong never made it to eBay , " Lott said , referring to newspaper reports that the pipe had been posted on the online auction site .
Lott said the person who took the photo of Phelps at the party sold it for $ 100,000 .
He would not identify the photographer or say how he knew the amount .
The sheriff 's office said eight people were arrested during the investigation .
Seven have been charged with simple possession of marijuana , which carries a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail or a $ 575 fine .
Another person was arrested for driving under suspension .
Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian says he represents three clients charged with marijuana possession during the probe .
" I think it 's a wise decision , " Harpootlian said of the sheriff 's announcement he would not charge Phelps .
" I hope that the attitude towards Michael Phelps will carry over to my clients .
Everybody needs to move on with their lives . "
He praised Lott 's commitment to law enforcement but added , " I think the process they went through , the two weeks of investigating all this , was not appropriate , but you 're going to stumble occasionally .
…
We really think Leon Lott does a great job . "
USA Swimming suspended Phelps from competing for three months .
Kellogg Co. was the only sponsor to drop Phelps during the fallout .
Government propagandists , their hired private contractors and useful idiots are creating “ downvote bots ” or scripts to bury stories which question the government .
Anyone who has posted news items questioning the government ’s version of 9/11 , the government ’s unquestioning support for Israel , or a host of other topics has probably noticed that all of their recent stories get downvoted virtually simultaneously , which defies the laws of probability .
One free , simple scripting program to create automatic downvotes of certain topics or news posters is called “ Greasemonkey ” , which is commonly used on large social news sites such as Reddit .
For example , there are some 2,480 hits for the google search site : reddit.com greasemonkey downvote .
This is some 2,480 times that Reddit users are publicly admitting to using greasemonkey ( see also this ) .
( Article continues below )
Propaganda agents obviously are n’t going to publicly brag about what they are doing , and you can bet that their use of downvote bots is much greater .
Moreover , they probably have more sophisticated software than Greasemonkey .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As one example of a publicly - available downvote bot , this script automatically downvotes any stories on 9/11 , Gaza , torture , Guantanamo and a host of other topics , downvotes certain posters , and engages in other forms of cyber warfare .
I call on programmers to figure out a way to fight this cyberwarfare propaganda .
Note : Greasemonkey has valid uses as well , such as blocking pop-up ads .

You heard me right .
That ’s what they actually call these bacon - wrapped goodies .
Atomic Buffalo Turds .
Amazing , huh ?
I promise you , they are delicious .
Felix Friend ’s foodie roommate
Tim introduced me to the glorious smoky , crispy , cream cheesy goodness of the Atomic Buffalo Turd at their New Year ’s Eve party in NY .
It ’s an instant classic .
Tim roasted his jalapenos and allowed them to cool a bit prior to stuffing them with a sausage cream cheese filling .
The pre-roast ensures that the pepper will be fully cooked and gives a nice mellow flavor to it .
He got his smokiness from the smoker he has installed outside on the patio of their ridiculous LES apartment .
I know , so jealous on so many levels .
If you ’re like me though , and have to make do without the luxury of a personal smoker , you could probably do well with a sprinkling of smoked salt .
Be sure to use some quality Bacon on these babies .
You ’ll taste the difference .
My go - to is Niman Ranch Applewood Smoked Bacon .
Mmmmm baaaconnnn .
There are lots of different variations on this recipe .
A few worth browsing through are featured on White Trash BBQ and Jason ’s BBQ Adventures .
There are no hard and fast rules to making atomic turds .
Except to just make lots of them .

Union Army Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman – the man responsible for laying much of my family ’s homeland to waste in the final year of the American Civil War – once said , “ War is all hell . ”
He was right :
There is no way to bring war to the enemy that does not mirror what we might imagine hell to be .
Nevertheless , there are indeed justifications for this hell - on - earth we call “ war . ”
Though some will deny it , the very security and prosperity we Americans enjoy today is an absolute extension of our own battlefield victories and success in war since 1775 .
And so the idea of approaching war half - heartedly or without the same willing commitment to destroying the enemy as is his toward us , is both foolish and destructive .
Which is why I tip my hat to Israel in its hard - hitting military offensive against the Iranian - supported terrorist group Hamas in Gaza , and pray for both Israel ’s ultimate , decisive victory and a speedy end to the conflict for the sake of the innocents .
But make no mistake , Israel has a right – in fact an obligation to its people – to fight madmen who deliberately target civilian populations ( with no military value whatsoever ) with rockets , mortars , and suicide bombers .
Former CIA operations officer Clare M. Lopez , vice president of the Intelligence Summit and a professor at the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies , agrees .
In a conversation over the holidays , Lopez says , “ This action signals Israel 's recovery [ since the 2006 war with Hizballah in Lebanon ] , renewed determination to demonstrate its refusal to give up , and dedication to its own survival . ”
Thank God : because Israel must never surrender to forces which would have no qualms about driving every non-Muslim man , woman , and child into the sea .
Nor should we .
And that means delivering “ hell ” in its myriad manifestations to the enemy on all asymmetric fronts : including military , political , and media ( through the aggressive prosecution of the broader war of ideas ) .
The enemy is certainly fighting us on all fronts , and he is cleverly forcing Israel and the West onto ground , which – for the good guys – is impossible to attack from or defend .
As Middle East expert Dr. Walid Phares , director of the Future of Terrorism Project at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , points out , “ It is clear that the Gaza war – triggered at the request of Tehran in the framework of an ongoing regional strategy pursued by the Khomeinist regime at least since 2005 – is aimed at collapsing both the democratic and peace processes from Afghanistan , Iraq , and Lebanon , to the Palestinian territories . "
Every move is calculated and carefully orchestrated .
" There is an ominous , strategic goal behind Iran 's ordering Hamas to engage Israel and flare up the Gaza battlefield , " Phares tells me .
“ It is to force Israel into a precarious situation internationally wherein Israel would not be able to launch a preemptive strike against Iran 's nuclear sites .
For – as the strategists in Tehran project – when Israel is fighting in the Gaza slums , there would be such international pressure that it would seem unthinkable for the Israelis to also strike at Iran . "
So do we have the stomach for this kind of war ?
Israel must : With Jihadist armies like Hamas in Gaza ( Israel ’s “ critical southwestern front ” according to Phares ) and Hizballah in Lebanon ( the “ northern front ” ) surrounding them , and state - sponsors of terrorism like Iran ( easily within ballistic missile range ) threatening to wipe the Jewish state off the earth , Israel has no choice .
According to Lopez , “ Israel draws the especial enmity of the Muslim world for its temerity to even exist as a Jewish state [ despite the fact that Jews dwelled in those lands centuries before Mohammed was even born , and that birth was in Mecca , not Palestine nor anywhere else in what would become greater Israel ] , but also because it is an outpost of Western - style liberal tolerant pluralist democracy .
There is no other state like it in the entire Middle East that embodies the values of Athens and Rome , as well as Jerusalem .
This , too , is an affront to the objectives of the Islamic Jihad , which scorns individual liberty , tolerance for diversity , religious freedom , gender equality , and above all , equality between Muslims and non-Muslims . ”
But then we have the gutless , ill - informed white - flaggers on Capitol Hill who were willing to surrender to the Jihadists in Iraq even when we had them on the ropes a few years back ( That crowd on the Hill continues to damn our operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan with faint praise . ) .
And what the Lebanese government , the U.S. , and the greater international community have allowed Hizballah to become since the 2006 war – and to a greater degree since that terrorist group ’s murderous rampage across Lebanon in May 2008 – is nothing less than a travesty .
Forget the diplomacy of gentlemen :
It does n’t work with Jihadists – celebrating bombers who deliberately target kids on playgrounds and families in restaurants – who only pretend to negotiate and come to terms in order to buy time for Jihad .
“ But we continue to dither , and the new American leaders are fooling themselves when they say that vigorous diplomacy can induce the mullahs to retreat , ” writes international terrorism expert Michael Ledeen at PajamasMedia .
“ It wo n’t happen , any more than the Israelis got the terrorists to retreat from all - out war against the Jews when the Oslo Agreement was signed , or when Rabin shook hands with Arafat .
It only delayed the days of reckoning , at the cost of many lives , mostly of innocents , on both sides . ”
So , yes , “ war is hell , ” potentially more hellish today than at any time in history , which is why we must never lose when fighting an enemy who will never quit .
Israel and the West has no choice but to fight the terrorists , aggressively , unapologetically , with an absolute commitment to win on every front .
And that fight must be on our time - schedule … never the enemy’s .
For 30 years I have been travelling to unfree places , from East Germany to Burma , and writing about them in the belief that I was coming from one of the freest countries in the world .
I wanted people in those places to enjoy more of what we had .
In the last few years , I have woken up - late in the day , but better late than never - to the way in which individual liberty , privacy and human rights have been sliced away in Britain , like salami , under New Labour governments that profess to find in liberty the central theme of British history .
" Oh , these powers will almost never be used , " they say every time .
" Ordinary people have nothing to fear .
It affects just 0.1 % . "
But a hundred times 0.1 % is 10 % .
The East Germans are now more free than we are , at least in terms of law and administrative practice in such areas as surveillance and data collection .
Thirty years ago , they had the Stasi .
Today , Britain has such broadly drawn and elastic surveillance laws that Poole borough council could exploit them to spend two weeks spying on a family wrongly accused of lying on a school application form .
The official spies reportedly made copious notes on the movements of the mother and her three children , whom they referred to as " targets " , and watched the family go home at night to establish where they were sleeping .
And this is supposed to be modern Britain ?
Let 's be clear : though the Stasi headline is irresistible , such Stasi - nark methods do not yet make a Stasi state .
The political context is very different .
We do n't live in a one - party dictatorship .
But nor is this just " an isolated case " , as ministers always protest .
Almost every week brings some new revelation of the way in which our government has taken a further small slice of our liberty , always in the name of another real or alleged good : national security , safety from crime , community cohesion , efficiency ( ha ha ) , or our " special relationship " with the United States .
Liberty comes last .
As Dominic Raab writes in his excellent book The Assault on Liberty , this government " has hyperactively produced more Home Office legislation than all the other governments in our history combined , accumulating a vast arsenal of new legal powers and creating more than three thousand additional criminal offences " .
At a press conference today , the organisers of next week 's Convention on Modern Liberty - whose moving spirits include the columnist Henry Porter and the democratic activist Anthony Barnett - will present a first attempt to catalogue the liberties we have lost , in a list compiled by the University College London Student Human Rights Programme .
Other free countries , including the US , have overreacted to the threat of terrorism , violating their own basic constitutional principles and legal standards .
The peculiarity of Britain is that we have nibbled away individual liberty on so many different fronts .
We have been complicit in American - led torture of our own people ; at the same time we have eroded free speech in ways unthinkable in the US ; and we have become what Privacy International calls " an endemic surveillance society " .
Yes , fighting terrorism requires some restrictions .
Yes , you can make a crime reduction case for some CCTV .
But we have more CCTV , a larger DNA database and a more ambitious ( and unworkable ) National Identity Register scheme , as well as more police powers and more email snooping than any comparable liberal democracy .
On top of which we have a bureaucracy so centralised and incompetent in managing this mass of data that it lost two computer discs containing the child benefit details of 25 million people .
What 's more , the certain loss of liberty will often not result in the alleged gain in security or efficiency .
So , for example , Gordon Brown and his ministers went on pressing for 42 days ' detention without trial , despite the fact that two former heads of the country 's security service , the director of public prosecutions , the former lord chancellor , attorney general and lord chief justice - in short , almost everyone in a position to know - said it was wrong , unnecessary and counterproductive .
How can a government of intelligent and often liberal - minded persons behave so illiberally , arrogantly and stupidly ?
What screw have they got loose ?
What nerve is missing ?
Fortunately , the fightback has begun .
It has been led by three groups : judges and lawyers ( witness the excellent article by the former senior law lord , Thomas Bingham , on these pages on Tuesday ) ; unelected peers ( witness , most recently , an outstanding House of Lords report on surveillance ) ; and a rainbow coalition of journalists , academics , writers , artists , thinktankers , civil society activists and citizens , of left and right , young and old , some of whom have now joined together to launch the Convention on Modern Liberty .
Notably absent from this list is the one group who should be on the frontline when it comes to the defence of British liberties : our elected representatives .
This is not just a New Labour failing .
With a few notable exceptions , such as David Davis , most of our MPs have been complaisant and pusillanimous beyond belief as our liberties have been chipped away .
So , for example , last week the home secretary pathetically and idiotically banned the Dutch MP Geert Wilders from entering the UK to show his noxious and offensive anti-Islam film at the invitation of members of the House of Lords .
Result : a curtailment of free speech that gives Wilders more free publicity than he could otherwise have dreamed of .
And how does the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne react ?
Oh , that 's all right , he says , because the film is really offensive .
Well , d'oh .
Call yourself a liberal ?
John Stuart Mill would be turning in his grave .
And I shall need some convincing that the Conservative frontbench are going to be any better .
I 'm not sure I fully understand all the reasons for this cravenness , but here 's one .
A couple of years ago I asked a very senior New Labour politician if his government had not got the balance between security and liberty wrong .
" Well " , he replied , " one thing I can tell you is that if you ask the British people they will always choose more security . "
And this is where the ball comes back to us .
Since our leaders are now mainly followers - following the latest opinion poll , focus group or newspaper campaign - it 's up to us , the people , to change their view of what " the people " want .
That 's why it 's so important for as many of us as possible to turn out across the country for next week 's Convention on Modern Liberty , to send an unmistakable message to the government and parliament of a country which is still a long way from being Burma or the old East Germany .
And then we need to go on lobbying our MPs , in every manner known to man , woman and child , until that message penetrates their thick and supine skulls .
To be honest , I still cannot quite believe this is happening to my country .
It feels like a bad dream .
But it is happening , and we must stop it .
Now .

Overview
To help entertain shoppers in these tough economic times , these Japanese engineers decided to use lasers , fog machines , spotlights , and lots of computers to put on a high - tech show .
Geithner acknowledged deep skepticism has developed over the fairness and efficiency of a $ 700 - billion bank bailout program approved by Congress in October .
He said leaders of some financial institutions that have received money had squandered the good faith that is needed to make the bank rescue effective .
" The spectacle of huge amounts of taxpayer money being provided to the same institutions that helped cause the crisis , with limited transparency and oversight , added to public distrust , " Geithner said .
The revamped approach to the government 's financial rescue war chest would use $ 100 billion to cover risks the Fed would take in expanding a $ 200 billion program supporting consumer and small business lending to a $ 1 trillion program that also supports an array of mortgage - related assets .
Markets appeared caught off balance by some of the measures that Geithner offered .
" Just a day ago , they were talking about good bank and bad bank .
Now they come up with something completely new , " said Robert Brusca , chief economist for Fact and Opinion Economics in New York .
" I 'm not sure how this public / private thing will work . "
President Obama told a news conference on Monday that cleaning up banks ' balance sheets was a priority and did n't rule out the possibility that it will take more money than the $ 700 billion Congress already has approved to complete the job .
" We do n't know yet whether we 're going to need additional money or how much additional money we 'll need until we see how successful we are at restoring a level of confidence in the marketplace , " Obama said .
The financial - rescue plan contains a number of measures meant to ease the credit crunch , including a public - private initiative to take bad assets off of banks ' balance sheets , mortgage loan and foreclosure relief and a new consumer lending initiative .
For Investors
Although the concept of creating a " bad bank " to house these assets was considered earlier in the plan 's development , it now instead envisions creating a fund to facilitate the asset sales and purchases .
The fund for toxic assets is one of for major components , of the plan .
Other components include the creation of a new consumer - oriented initiative " to kick start the secondary lending market , " funds for loan modification and foreclosure prevention and a " capital buffer " for banks so they can continue lending to consumers and business . "
Here 's a breakdown on the costs :
The consumer lending facility will " leverage up to $ 1 trillion dollars " and is intended to " bring down borrowing costs for responsible borrowers and help get credit flowing again . "
The housing measures will provide as much as $ 50 billion in funding , which follows through on an earlier pledge of the Obama administration .
The summary does not provide a sum for the toxic asset fund or so - called buffer capital for banks .
The bank capital provision also calls for a " stress test " among " uniform standards to help clean up and strengthen banks . "
Thus far , the TARP has provided aid to firms through capital injections , for which the government received preferred stock and warrants in return .
The government also recently started using insurance and guarantees to back certain toxic assets held by firms .
Known as a ring fence concept , the model has been used on Citigroup and Bank of America .
It is unclear where the ring fencefigures into the new plan .
The Treasury plan also includes measures to " increase transparency and accountability to protect taxpayers . "
Chief among them are restrictions on stock dividends and repurchases as well as acquisitions " to provide assurance that all taxpayer money will go to promote lending until that money is paid back . "
Also included are previously - announced restrictions on executive pay , and new tighter reporting requirements for banks receiving government aid .
House Democrats have been pushing for stronger lending conditions — as well a crackdown on executive pay — in the wake of criticism of former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's administration of the TARP .
That was seen as both too lenient on and too generous to financial firms , which critics allege were hoarding capital instead of lending it .
The new Treasury plan will " require banks to show how government assistance will expand lending and how they intend to use taxpayer dollars , which is similar in the tone and design of the House Democrat 's proposal .
At this point , it is unclear where the additional funding for TARP programs would come from and whether additional authorization or legislation from Congress would be necessary .
In his nationally televised press confernce Monday night , President Obama did not address that issue .
" We do n't know yet whether we 're going to need additional money or how much additional money we 'll need until we see how successful we are at restoring a level of confidence in the marketplace , " Obama said .
CNBC Slideshows :
Congressional Democrats , however , have made it clear that future funding depends on the success of the new initiatives .
" There has to be some sort of sales job to the people before we go out on the limb and appropriate new money , ” said a senior Congressional staffer before the presentation Monday evening .
“ Any new money will be largely leveraged on how they do with this money . ”

Incorporate these into your way of life to greatly reduce the chances of fraud knocks on your door .
> Never give out your social security number unless it ’s absolutely necessary for what you need to do .
Even if you have to give it out , make sure you know for sure who you are giving it to .
Being comfortable with them is not enough .
Know the other party and what they do , how they will use that number and where their privacy policy is located .
Do n’t carry your social security card anywhere .
Get a paper shredder so no one can piece together important information ( at the very least , rip up the documents yourself ) .
Protect those PIN numbers – Cover the number pad when you are entering pins at the ATM machine and never tell anyone about them .
Also , never use something like 1234 as your pin please .
Pay a little more for an unlisted number – Again , fewer telemarketers mean fewer chances that you can become a target .
Try to separate your personal information as much as possible – Do n’t write your SSN on your checks or keeping your driver licenses with your SSN card .
If something is lost , at least the crooks only have one piece of information and not everything about you .
Do n’t Trust Anyone Over the Phone – Never give anything out over the phone .
It ’s just too dangerous .
Do not keep any sensitive information in your car – Credit cards , statements , checks are a nono .
Buy a safe – Better yet , get a safety deposit box at the bank where you can put important documents .
Educate Others –
If everyone teaches others about protections , there will be fewer identity thefts and fewer people who will try to do this because it ’s not as lucrative .
Be Alert –
Think about how your identity can be stolen whenever you are dealing with your own sensitive information .
Be Clam and Patient – Do n’t do something with checks , credit cards , SSN numbers , etc when you are in a rush .
Blank Spaces – Always draw a line on blank spaces :
On credit card receipts , always write your amount with a $ symbol followed immediately with the numbers .
On checks , always draw a line after you write the amount in English ( or in numbers ) .
Credit Report and Monitoring
Sign up with a credit monitoring company .
Freezing Your Credit –
You can call the credit report agencies to freeze your credit so no one can ever apply for a credit card or get a loan under your name until you unfreeze it .
It will cost money but the peace of mind might be worth it .
Get free credit reports so you can check them ( remember that if you do n’t cancel your membership , they will charge you a monthly fee )
Knows Your Credit Cards
Always know how many credit cards you have .
While most people believe that cutting up used credit cards and not canceling them is better for your credit score , you run the danger of having others make fake cards as you lose track of how many accounts you have opened .
Credit Card Receipts –
Never leave them behind even if it does n’t have the full credit card number .
Gas stations , restaurants are the two places I see receipts all the time .
Routinely check your credit card statement to make sure you really made all the purchases the transaction history shows .
Instead of signing the back of the credit card , write “ Check ID ” .
If your credit card company offers it , opt for the card that has your photo on it .
If possible , choose to self pay so fewer people touch your card .
And when you self pay , look for signs that the machine has been tampered with and avoid the ones that seem compromised .
Create a list of phone numbers and credit cards that you have ( it ’s not absolutely crucial that you record the full credit card numbers on it but if you do , remember to keep it in a secure place ) .
In case your wallet is stolen , you can quickly call all card companies to cancel those cards .
One Off Credit Card Numbers – Some credit card companies will generate a “ one - time - use ” number for you to use online .
Seriously consider using these .
Computers and the Internet
Only make online purchases through trusted websites .
Stuff like the Trust-e symbol , better business bureau stamp is a must .
If possible , pay through services like Paypal or Visa checkout .
This way , you are n’t giving a potentially compromised merchant your credit card information .
And even if you have to type in your credit card information , never opt for convenience and save the information on their website .
Install anti-virus or anti-spyware on your computer and never open links through an email unless you are absolutely sure that it ’s safe .
For now , you can also use a Mac instead ( until macs get popular enough that crooks start targeting it as well )
Monitor all your accounts online – Check your accounts regularly now that it ’s so convenient to monitor them online .
Make sure there ’s nothing suspicious going on .
Never save your passwords just for the convenience .
Typing it out does n’t take that much time .
Also , the more complicated it is , the better .
Remember to also use capitals , letters , symbols and letters .
Change your passwords regularly .
Security tokens – Some banks are starting to offer those security tokens that change numbers every few seconds as an added security over your password when logging onto your online account .
Take advantage if yours offer one .
Do n’t log onto accounts using public computers –
You do n’t need the possible hassle of forgetting to log out .
Secure Your Mail and Mailboxes
Cover your checks when you mail them so sensitive information is facing inwards .
Better yet , get non -see - through envelopes so no one knows what ’s inside .
Limit the number of credit cards you own .
You do n’t need an army of credit to buy your groceries .
Never leave bills in your mailbox for the mailman .
Deliver it to the post office .
When you move , contact all credit card , creditors , and IRS immediately of the address change .
Go to opt - out prescreen and take yourself off the mailing list that credit card companies use to send out those “ pre-approved junk mail ” .
Sign up for electronic delivery of your bills –
No more mail , no more possible lost mail .
If you do n’t opt for electronic bills , make sure you are getting all your bills .
A missing bill should sound off an alarm .
Consider a P.O. box for your mail if the mailbox in your neighbor is n’t safe enough .
Take your mail as soon as your mailman delivers it .
If you pay attention , you will realize that he / she comes around the same time every business day .
These are n’t so hard to implement right ?
If you do all of the above , you will greatly reduce the chances of becoming an identity fraud victim .
Start now and practice fraud prevention .
However , he maintained that the US had concluded the risk posed to its security by abandoning the search was not great .
He said they had believed " it would be very difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we could n't find them . "
CommBank is blaming Merrill , Merrill is blaming CommBank .
One thing is certain ; the bank 's abortive $ 2 billion share placement , which fell apart on Tuesday night , was more redolent of a tinpot minerals explorer than a major bank .
The Commonwealth Bank was forced to can its $ 2 billion placement after an emergency board meeting at 7 am today .
UBS stepped quickly into the void and got the issue away late morning although the high drama over the canned placement dragged on through the day .
Institutional investors had jacked up on Tuesday night when they learned via the official CBA announcement at 7.15 pm that the bank was admitting to a deteriorating loan book .
Merrill Lynch , the broker organising the placement , had already raised the $ 2 billion after a phone - around that began late morning .
The money was in the bag but news of the bad loan position was still unknown .
Analysts subsequently downgraded CBA by 10 % on the revelations .
“ I mean , if you had a bus driver who went 100 miles an hour on an icy road , you ’d think he was crazy , ” he adds .
“ But if his boss said , ‘ It ’s our policy to drive faster as the roads get icier , ’ you would n’t be surprised if the boss ended up in jail . ”
By historical standards , this is not Wall Street ’s worst bout of infamy , though it might come pretty close .
Last week , President Obama branded Wall Street bankers “ shameful ” for giving themselves nearly $ 20 billion in bonuses , even though the average bonus , $ 112,000 , was down by 36.7 percent from the prior year .
That criticism is n’t quite the buggy whippings that Franklin Delano Roosevelt routinely gave “ unscrupulous money changers . ”
And the recent rallies in front of the New York Stock Exchange  with chants of “ You bought it , you broke it ”  are downright peaceful compared to the 1920 bombing of J.P. Morgan ’s offices , which killed more than 30 people .
Still , if your business card bears the name of an investment bank  or did before you were laid off  odds are good you ’ve endured some very awkward moments of late .
Stephen Chen , a former vice president in equity research at Bear Stearns , heard a lot of sarcastic comments when he went home to the Bronx for Christmas , where his family of 36 gather each year .
When the story of another bank closing was broadcast on a TV , a cousin muttered , “ Good riddance . ”
“ A lot of my family are small - businessmen who own restaurants and Laundromats , ” Mr. Chen said .
“ They just see Wall Street as overpaid and they do n’t have a very clear idea of what it does .
I try to explain that there ’s this intimate connection between Main Street and Wall Street , that banks were created to provide liquidity for small businesses , so they can expand . ”
His relatives listen , but seem unconvinced , Mr. Chen said .
“ It ’s kind of tiring having the same conversation over and over again . ”
The irony is that despite public perceptions , the outcry over Wall Street greed is happening just as the firms are getting stingy .
At JPMorgan , Ms. Chau said , management clamped down on office supplies to the point where employees now need to ask a secretary for the key to the supply room for pens .

This happened a couple of years ago , but I was just reminded of it again recently ( and it did n't receive the attention it deserves ) .
The story of the Guiding Hand Social Club and the Valentine Operative offers one scenario of how advanced griefing functions : it zeroes in on trust and community .
EVE
Online is one of those lesser - known massively - multiplayer online role - playing games that scurries in the shadow of World of Warcraft .
It 's a science fiction game , wherein you fly around the galaxy fighting pirates and shipping goods , tricking out your successive generations of starships .
The game itself is free , with a 30 - day free trial ( like nearly all other MMORPGs , ongoing play requires a subscription ) .
The game developers update the universe on a regular basis , and the tens of thousands of players seem to enjoy the game quite a bit .
( Incidentally , EVE has an on - staff economist to help them shape the game world , adding to its complexity . )
There 's one other bit of information about EVE that 's important to know : you can ( and probably will ) fight other players .
It 's not a safe universe out there .
The Guiding Hand Social Club ( GHSC ) is a " corporation " in EVE -- a player organization that , in another game , would be called a " guild . "
GHSC bills itself as a group of mercenaries , willing and able to go after other corporations , stealing ships and cargo , for a ( hefty ) fee .
In 2004 , GHSC was hired ( by a still - anonymous client ) to attack the corporation Ubiqua Seraph and kill its leader , Mirial .
But GHSC took the contract a bit further than expected -- after ten months of infiltration , a galaxy - wide coordinated attack netted billions in in - game money ( worth approximately $ 16,500 in real - world money at the time ) , stole dozens of ships and other hardware , and destroyed Ubiqua Seraph 's " Navy Apocalypse " flagship .
GHSC operative Arenis Xemdal pulled the trigger on Mirial , after having risen in Ubiqua Seraph 's ranks and reportedly developing a relationship with the target CEO .
" Arenis Xemdal is what we call a Valentine Operative . " [ GHSC leader ] Shogaatsu explains .
" Essentially his job is to seduce and entice an objective into a state of trust and confidence .
As such , we 'd call Mirial 's relationship to him moments before the strike ... ' endeared ' . "
The entire story is worth reading , and if you 're particularly fascinated , the GHSC announcement of the strike remains on the EVE message boards .
All in all , it 's a remarkable story of coordinated treachery , malicious intent , and griefing severe enough to drive people out of the game .
But what does this have to do with the real world ?
It 's tempting to look at the GHSC strike in financial terms , focusing on the loss of money .
But to me , the monetary theft aspect was secondary ; the real point of the action was to make the target , and her comrades , miserable .
In this , GHSC was eminently successful :
They claim this was a " kill contract " to destroy the player Mirial .....
While they did destroy her Navy Apoc and pod her .... they went beyond that .
They stole everything from UQS Billions of isk [ the EVE currency ] that dozens of players have spent over a year building up .. seriusly [ sic ] hurting many players feelings and causing emotional stress outside the game ...
( I 'm not gonna die over it ... but my mind should n't be taken up by game thoughts like this has caused )
Why is this different than past Corp thefts ?????
THEY BRAGGED ABOUT IT ......
( Emphasis mine . )
People who do n't spend time in immersive digital worlds may not realize just how emotionally intense they can be .
These are often games , yes , but they are built to enable visceral reactions akin to those arising from real - world experiences : danger , exultation , fear , anger , humiliation and sometimes even " endearment . "
And the more that 3D immersive worlds blend with the physical world , the more intense these emotional cues will be .
In the comments to yesterday 's post , my friend J. Eric Townsend argues that there 's little real difference between griefing and " hacking " ( in the commonplace sense ) -- viruses and malware written not to steal , but simply to be perversely destructive .
I see his point .
Like most griefers , the " skr1pt k1dd13s " and virus - makers so prominent in the early days of the web had little motivation other than attacking other computer user for the fun of it .
But there is a difference , and it's a big one .
While hacking and malware can destroy data and one 's sense of security , griefing goes after trust and social cohesion .
The teammate who shoots me instead of the opposing team is n't just attacking my datastream , he 's attacking me .
The prevalence of malware on the Internet seems environmental , like some kind of biohazard -- the origin of a virus or scam may be useful for the digital epidemiologists , but what I care most about is making sure my immunities are up to date .
There are no such protections from griefing , because its presence depends on the social behavior we value in the participatory web .
You can eliminate griefing by eliminating social interaction ; it becomes necessary to destroy the town in order to save it .
And here we have the dilemma of the blended era .
The appeal of social technologies , immersive technologies , is their extraordinary capacity to link us together , to build resilient and complex communities out of little more than thought and light .
But those same luminous pathways enable malice of startling power .
We built the metaverse and social web as ancillary networks , parallel to ( but less meaningful than ) our physical world communities .
That pairing has quickly reversed itself , however , and the digital links have become -- for a rapidly growing number of us -- the primary social bond .
But the norms and ethics of online life have n't evolved as rapidly , leaving us in a moment of transition : we are enraptured with the power of connection and painfully surprised by it at the same time .
Chris Lewis
Lewis ' career was never dull but he also failed to achieve as much as many had expected .
The first signs that all was not well came in the West Indies in 1993 - 94 , when Lewis decided to shave his head on arrival .
Nothing wrong there , except that he then opted to practice without a sun hat .
Inevitably , he succumbed to the Caribbean sun .
" Chris Lewis baldly went where no other cricketer has gone before , " noted the Sun , " and the prat without a hat spent two days in bed with sunstroke .
Just as you would expect , the ideal covering for an all - rounder suffering from sunstroke , as diagnosed by our own doctor , is … a bowler . "
Quite .
Arthur Dolphin
During a game against Middlesex at Lord's , Yorkshire wicketkeeper Dolphin fell off a chair in the dressing room as he reached for his clothes and broke his wrist , missing the remainder of the summer .
It was a bad month for Yorkshiremen .
A team - mate of Dolphin's in that game , Abe Waddington , had been giving Arthur Morton of Derbyshire a ride on his new motorcycle one evening during a match between the two counties when they crashed .
Waddington escaped unharmed and resumed the next day .
Morton broke ribs and was out for eight weeks , his absence not helping as Derbyshire were bowled out for 23 .
Matthew Hayden
Sidelined after breaking a finger at the start of the 2006 - 07 season , Hayden decided to keep fit by going for a leisurely jog .
Unfortunately , while running he was set on by a local dog and had to be taken to hospital with a 5 cm gash in his ankle .
" It was a vicious attack , " he said .
" I was just out for a leisurely run .
You are always a bit shocked by that sort of thing , but I was more disappointed than anything .
It just has n't been my week . "
Ted Dexter
In normal circumstances , being run down by a car would invoke sympathy .
Not in Dexter 's case , however , because the car was his own .
When his Jaguar ran out of petrol on the Great West Road in Brentford in June 1965 , Dexter decided to push it to the nearest garage .
Unfortunately , he lost control and it ended up pinning him to a factory gate , breaking his right leg .
" The hero lay there with blood pouring out of his leg while other drivers rushed by " is how Matthew Engel described the incident .
Ian Greig
Clearly , Greig was not meant to be a housebreaker .
On arriving home after the first day of Sussex 's Championship match against Kent in June 1983 , he snapped his key in the lock .
Taking what seemed like the easy option , he then scaled the side of the house to try to climb in through an open window , fell 18 feet and broke an ankle .
Four years later , while being X - rayed after being hit on the hand in his third match as Surrey captain , he stood up , banged his head on the machine and had to have two stitches .
Trevor Franklin
One of the most serious of all the accidents here , Franklin was mown down by a motorised luggage trolley at London 's Gatwick airport at the end of New Zealand 's tour in 1986 ( during which he broke a thumb ) and suffered multiple fractures of his leg .
He was out of the game for 18 months , and when he did return he was handicapped by never being able to run at full speed again .
Despite this , and being what Wisden described as " unspectacular but effective " , he made a hundred in the Lord 's Test four years later .
However , when he faced England in 1991 - 92 , he had his forearm broken by David Lawrence .
Jimmy Adams
After 19 hours of negotiations at a London hotel , the 1998 - 99 West Indies tour of South Africa finally got the go - ahead - at one stage the whole thing looked like being scrapped following a dispute over payments .
On the flight to Johannesburg , Adams managed to slice through the tendons of his right hand while cutting some far - from - fresh bread .
" There was an announcement seeking the services of a doctor , " Dr Ali Bacher , a mediator during the crisis , said .
" I answered the call to find Adams lying unconscious with blood pouring out of his hand .
A young doctor appeared .
She stitched the wound up while I assisted .
I gave up being a doctor in 1979 . "
Adams missed the tour , as well as the post - meal coffee .
A similar fate befell Mark Boucher in Australia in 2000 when he sliced through his hand rather than meat , forcing Andrew Hall to keep wicket .
Don Topley
Journeyman cricketers supplement their income with a variety of jobs in the off season .
In Topley 's case that meant working as a postman .
However , shortly before the start of a new season he tried to post a letter through a door but the spring - loaded letterbox snapped back on his fingers , sending him off to the local Accident and Emergency department .
Bruce French
Proof that when you are having an off day , nothing goes your way .
In Lahore during England 's wretched 1987 - 88 tour of Pakistan , French was minding his own business in the nets when he was hit on the head by a throw from a spectator returning a stray ball .
He was taken to hospital , where he was struck by a car outside the main entrance .
He had his wound stitched without incident , only to crack his head on a low - hanging light fitting as he got up to leave .
Derek Pringle
As he sorted out complimentary tickets for the 1982 Headingley Test , Pringle leaned back on his chair , which collapsed , dumping him on the floor and leaving him with shooting pains between the shoulder blades .
The myth soon arose that he had injured himself writing letters , something he attributed to Bernard Thomas .
" The Machiavellian little man told the press I 'd done my back in writing a letter - presumably his attempt to toughen me up with some cod psychology . "
Chris Old
Old was a fine quick bowler who would undoubtedly have achieved more but for his tendency to acquire injuries on the eve of matches .
He once pulled out of a Test match when he sneezed and damaged a rib .
Frank Keating once wrote of him : " Ask that engaging hypochondriac how he is keeping and the answer , as ever , takes a full half - hour . "
It was reported that the first bowling machine installed at Lord 's was nicknamed Chris Old ... because it kept breaking down so often .
Today we 'll be learning how to create a vector light bulb icon with the free , open source vector program Inkscape .
We 'll be following a Tango style of design for this project .
Read on to learn more about the Tango Desktop Project and to learn how to create this icon .
Republished Tutorial Every few weeks , we revisit some of our reader 's favorite posts from throughout the history of the site .
This tutorial was first published in February of 2009 .
Final Image Preview
Below is the final image we will be working towards .

Tango Desktop Project
The Tango Desktop Project is a set of guidelines that icon creators can use to make a consistent appearance in their icons .
It 's most famously displayed in Linux distributions , but you might also notice it in standalone applications , such as GIMP .
Below , is a sample of the official Tango icons .
We 'll be replicating this look .
Step 1
Create a new 48 px by 48 px canvas .
By default Inkscape has a few undesirable settings for creating icons .
Go to the Document Properties dialog window and select the Snap tab .
Uncheck the box next to Enable snapping .
Throughout this tutorial you 'll need to occasionally use a grid to align the shapes to the canvas .
To enable the Grid select the menu item View > Grid ( # ) .
I used a grey background in this tutorial to make things show up more .
Step 2
Now create a small circle near the top of the canvas and center it .
It does n't have to be perfect , you can adjust it later .
Note how it fits nicely between the grid lines .
Convert the circle to a path by selecting it then going to Path > Object to Path ( Shift + Ctrl + C ) .
Step 3
Next we 'll create the bottom part of the glass bulb that slopes into the metal socket .
It may be beneficial to use a reference image for this next step .
Below is a generic light bulb image from sxc.hu .
To create the curved bottom path , select the Bezier Curves tool ( Shift + F6 ) and trace or create a path similar to the one pictured below by adjusting the various nodes .
Step 4
Combine the circle created earlier and the new path by holding down Shift and clicking on the objects individually .
Next , click the menu item Path > Combine ( Ctrl + K ) .
The two objects are now combined into one and should look the same as the image below while in Edit Paths mode ( F2 ) .
Pay attention to the two yellow diamonds selected above .
We 're going to make intersections in the circle near these two points .
Make the intersections by double - clicking above the two yellow diamonds on the border of the circle .
Two new nodes should appear where you double - clicked .
Select the square node at the very bottom of the circle and press the Delete key .
The path will be changed slightly and the two yellow squares we made earlier should turn into diamonds .
Select these two diamond nodes and remove the path connecting them using the Split Paths tool in your toolbar .
The result is a light bulb shape with two gaps in the middle .
Combine the almost - circle with the bottom path by selecting one end of the circle along with one end of the bottom path .
Clicking Join selected endnodes in the Edit nodes toolbar and the two points should fuse together .
Do the same for the opposite side .
Step 5
Now it 's time to add a little color .
I used a custom color palette as shown below ( .pl included in the VECTORTUTS PLUS source files ) .
It 's also shown below .
Select the light bulb shape and bring up the Fill and Stroke window ( Shift + Ctrl + F ) .
Select Stroke paint and then linear gradient .
A simple black to transparent gradient should show up as the border of the bulb .
We 're going to change these colors .
Select Edit ... and change the two stop colors .
I used 729 fcfff as my first and 3465 a4ff as my second , darker color .
Change the direction of the gradient path by going into Edit Paths mode ( F2 ) and dragging the square point of the gradient line to the upper left hand corner of the light bulb .
Then drag the circle end to the lower right hand corner .
This is to create a consistent light source in the icon .
Next up is the Fill .
Keep the Fill and Stroke window open and click the Fill tab and select Radial gradient .
I used ffffff56 as my inner color and 729 fcfe3 for my outer color .
You may notice both color are slightly transparent .
This is to give the illusion that the light bulb is made of a translucent material .
Step 6
Select the outline , copy it ( Ctrl + C ) and paste it onto the same location ( Ctrl + Alt + V ) .
This is going to be the trademark inner highlight found in most Tango - styled icons .
Delete the fill of the copied outline and change the stroke to pure white .
This will make it more recognizable .
Adjust the white stroke so it fits snugly on the inside of the blue outline .
Remember to keep the shape and 1px border .
It will probably be necessary to manual move the nodes around to achieve a perfect fit .
Bring up the Fill and Strokes dialog again and in the Stroke tab select a linear gradient .
The white to transparent gradient colors that appear by default will work fine ; so there 's no need to change them .
We do want to change the angle of the gradient though , because our light source is in the upper left - hand corner of the image .
If the light source is in the upper left corner , the brightest spot on the object should also be in the upper left corner .
Adjust the overall opacity of the white outline to 75 % .
Step 7
Time to create the filament .
Draw two lines near the middle of the bulb with the Bezier Curves tool .
Angle them towards the middle creating a V shape , then give each a gradient stroke .
I used 9927 aff to ffffffff .
The lighter color is on top because this is where the filament is burning and giving off bright light .
Refer to the reference bulb earlier in the post and you 'll notice the actual filament is the material between these two wires .
Since a 48 px by 48 px icon does n't need too much detail we can simulate a coil by making a wavy line .
So once again select the Bezier curves tool and draw four points between the V lines created earlier .
Then drag the lines connecting each point downwards so we have three shallow bowls connected together .
Make a new three - sided rectangle in the bottom part of the bulb with the Bezier Curves tool .
The rectangle only needs a top , left , and right side ; leave the bottom open .
Then drag the middle of the top segment upwards to make a small arc .
This object will be a small piece of glass inside the bulb that the filament is wired into .
Open the Fill and Strokes dialog and give the new path a stroke color of d0 bfacff .
Then select the Fill tab and give it a Linear Gradient going from ffffffff to ffffff00 ( white to white - transparent ) .
Change the repeat drop - down menu to Reflected .
Reflected means the gradient is displayed twice .
Once on the left side of the square end , and reflected on the right .
I positioned the square point near the middle to look like there is a reflection in the glass .
Also , change the overall Opacity to about 50 % .
Step 8
Select the original blue outline we drew for the light bulb in Step 1 .
It should be the bottom layer of your image .
Copy ( Ctrl + C ) and Paste it into place ( Ctrl + Alt + V ) .
Remove the stroke .
Then give it a fill of ffc803 ff .
This is going to be a nice yellow glow resembling the color incandescent lights give off .
Lower the overall opacity of the object to 26 % and lower it to the bottom of the image by pressing the End key .
Now to finish things up .
Glass objects always reflect at least a small amount of light ; spherical objects often have hot spots where a concentrated portion of light is being reflected off of .
Create a circle , or more accurately an oval .
Make the width slightly smaller than the length .
Now rotate the oval by selecting it , and while having it selected click on it again .
The arrows around the perimeter should change to rotational arrows .
Click and hold one of the arrows in the corner and rotate the oval about 45° clockwise .
Position the oval in the top left corner where the light source is the strongest .
Then lower the Opacity to 37 % .
Step 9
The final part of the light bulb is the metal connector that screws into a light socket .
Create a rectangle connected to the bottom of the glass light bulb we just created .
Then convert the shape to a path by going to the menu item Path > Object to Path ( Shift + Ctrl + C ) .
This makes the shape editable .
Drag the top of the rectangle upwards to resemble an upside down bowl and the bottom of the rectangle downwards .
We 're going for a 3D cylinder look .
Add two more equidistant nodes on the left side of the cylinder by double - clicking where you want the nodes placed .
Do the same for the right side , only place them between the nodes on the right starting from the top .
By mentally connecting the dots from left to right it should resemble a zig - zag pattern .
I added an overlay to help visualize the pattern .
We 're doing this to create the screw shape of the light bulb .
Arrange the nodes by moving and extruding them till they resemble the image below .
Give the screw shape a Stroke color of d59600 ff .
Copy and Paste into place ( Ctrl + Alt + V ) a new screw .
Remove the stroke from the new screw shape and add a linear gradient Fill with the colors ffd 543ff and ffeca9ff .
Remember to change the Repeat to Reflected to get the shine near the middle of the screw .
The new screw with the fill should be slightly smaller than the screw below it .
Resize the newly created Fill object till the border of the object behind it is completely visible , similar to the process in Step 5 .
We 're doing this to make the corners of the border appear sharper .
Now move the two screw objects to the bottom of the image by selecting them both and pressing the End key .
Next draw the wedges / teeth / edges of the screw .
This is a very subtle effect and we do n't need a big object to do this .
Select the Bezier Curves tool and make an object similar to the one below .
The fill color is d59600ff .
Duplicate the object and move it down beneath the original .
Now to add a few final touches .
Make two connected points with the Bezier Curves tool in the shape of a bowl .
Fill it with the color d0 bfacff and a stroke of 5a5249 ff and lower it to the bottom of the image with the End key .
Draw an oval at the very bottom of the image .
Make it about six times as wide as tall .
Open the Fill and Strokes window and Fill it with black ( 000000ff ) .

I suspect that nobody 's really surprised that Circuit City has finally bitten the dust .
The fading electronics chain had been in a death spiral for quite some time , and all the cost - cutting in the world could n't save it in the end .
While a dreadful economy contributed to its downfall , Circuit City 's real problem was getting stuck with bad management that ultimately drove the company out of business .
Let 's backtrack a bit .
Back in March 2007 , Circuit City fired more than 3,400 experienced sales people and other staffers simply because they were making too much money .
Management then hired inexperienced , lower - paid workers to take their place .
Bad move .
Really bad move .
This short - sighted decision may have looked good to then - CEO Philip Schoonover , who collected a cool multi-million bonus that year for his cost - cutting brilliance , but I 'm convinced that it drove shoppers elsewhere .
It certainly did in my case .
( An aside : The Wall Street Journal named Schoonover the worst CEO of 2008 for his managerial bungling . )
Over the past 18 months , my visits to Circuit City stores in my area were n't a lot of fun , and ultimately I vowed never to shop there again .
One time , a few months after the layoffs , I went to a nearby Circuit City to buy a laptop case that had had been featured prominently in the store 's newspaper ad that week .
But the case was n't on display and the clueless sales dudes -- who were busy doing something online -- had no idea whether the item was in stock .
They were n't too keen on checking the back room or phoning nearby Circuit City stores to check on their stock either .
" Uh , you could buy it online , I guess , " one of the slackers finally told me .
Which I did -- from another retailer .
Another time I went to a different Circuit City during the 2007 holiday season .
The store was woefully understaffed .
Only one register was open , and a long line of irate customers trying to buy stuff snaked around the store .
The computer system was down too , but nobody working that day seemed too concerned .
These are anecdotal incidents , I know .
But I suspect they were n't uncommon .
In my case , they made me not want to shop at Circuit City anymore .
The employees were n't rude , mind you , just indifferent .
They did n't understand Customer Service 101 , and that 's management 's fault .
The unfortunate result is that 34,000 Circuit City employees will soon be out of work .

Mormons face flak for backing Prop. 8 PROPOSITION 8 Church making big push to ban gay marriages

Christine Alonso's body trembled and her lips quivered as she walked up and spoke to a few of the 50 protesters in front of the Mormon Temple in Oakland on Sunday .
" Do n't think they 're all against you , " said Alonso , 27 , explaining that she was Mormon and that despite her religious leaders ' support of a ballot measure banning same - sex marriage , she was actively opposed .
As she walked away , she said , " I 'm afraid that a gay or lesbian friend might hear that I'm Mormon and think that I want to tear their marriage apart . "
Alonso 's solitary act came as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and its members are increasingly under fire for their support of Proposition 8 , which would take away the right of gays and lesbians to marry .
In addition to increased protests , online campaigns seek to identify and embarrass Mormons who support the ballot measure .
The church largely stays out of politics .
But in this case , the Salt Lake City - based church has sent letters , held video conferences and in church meetings asked for volunteers to support the campaign .
In response , some church members have poured in their savings and undertaken what may be an unprecedented grassroots mobilization for the effort .
Prop. 8 is on pace to be the costliest race in the nation , except for the billion - dollar presidential election .
The Yes on 8 campaign estimates that up to 40 percent of its donations come from Mormons .
Some others estimate that Mormons account for over 70 percent of donations from individuals .
All of California 's Catholic bishops have all come out in favor of the measure .
So have many evangelical Christians and Orthodox Jews .
Yet it is Mormons , who account for 2 percent of the state population , who are catching the most heat .
" We seem to be the symbol of the Yes on 8 campaign , " said Rand King , 60 , a Walnut Creek resident who is Mormon and who was watching Sunday 's protest from inside the temple 's gates .
Prop. 8 opponents are increasingly narrowing their focus on Mormons , harnessing technology and open - records laws in their efforts .
One Web site run by a Prop. 8 opponent , Mormonsfor8.com , identifies the name and hometown of every Mormon donor .
On the Daily Kos , the nation 's most popular liberal blog , there is a campaign to use that information to look into the lives of Mormons who financially support Prop .
8 .
It has led some Mormons to question why other religious groups in the coalition are n't being targeted .
" I do n't think it 's politically expedient to point the finger at the Catholic Church , " said Dave Christensen , 52 , a Mormon and Alamo resident who donated $ 30,000 to the Yes on 8 campaign .
" You do n't get the mileage criticizing a church that has more clout . "
Nadine Hansen , who runs Mormonsfor8.com , said the church decided to enter politics and can't excuse itself for the ramifications .
" Any group that gets involved in the political arena has to be treated like a political action committee , " said Hansen , 61 , a Mormon who lives in Cedar City , Utah , and has stopped going to church .
" You can't get involved in politics and say , ' Treat me as a church . '
" Hansen said she focused on Mormons because she is one .
She said Mormons have contacted her to shut the site , saying it was being used by the Daily Kos campaign in a witch hunt .
" I did n't think there were any witches on the list , so I was n't worried , " said Hansen , whose site is " neutral " on its views , though she is opposed because she views it as " divisive . "
The person who initiated the Daily Kos campaign to look into the lives of Mormon donors is Dante Atkins , an elected delegate to the state Democratic convention who said he 's the vice president of the Los Angeles County Young Democrats .
Atkins said his goal was to " embarrass the opposition by pointing out and publicizing any contributors they may have . "
He said focusing on Mormons made sense .
" If one religious group is putting close to the majority of the money and the effort into passing this proposition , it is fair to single them out . "
The Mormon church has n't taken the same level of interest in Arizona or Florida , which also have constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage .
But California is a bellwether , said LDS spokesman Mike Otterson .
" If same - gender marriage is approved in California ... other states will follow suit . "
Several Bay Area Mormons said they would support the right of gay and lesbian unions to have all the rights of married couples .
But the word marriage was sacred , pivotal to their concept of families , who can be " eternally united " in the afterlife .
A key church document - " The Family : A Proclamation to the World " - says that " marriage between man and a woman is essential to His eternal plan . "
They also believe that children are entitled to be raised by a father and a mother .
Those words speak for Michele Sundstrom , 47 , of San Jose , who has been married for 18 years and has five children .
She and her husband gave $ 30,000 to the Yes on 8 campaign and put a sign on their home .
But in response , two women parked an SUV in front of their home , with the words " Bigots live here " painted on the windshield .
Sundstrom believes such responses must come from deep places of pain - and that gays and lesbians are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals , just not the word marriage .
Any animosity toward gays or lesbians is wrong , she said .
" There must be such deep , deep , deep hurt ; otherwise there could n't be so much opposition , " she said .
" They 've lived with this .
I guess we 're getting a taste of where they live . "
I ’m no economist , but the economy ’s not looking too good .
GDP is down , consumer spending is down , housing prices are way down .
This Paul Krugman guy is saying that we could be headed for another “ depression , ” a period characterized by high unemployment and pushcarts .
Most people see this as bad news .
I , however , prefer to look for the positive .
I 'm an optimist .
Here 's why I 'm looking forward to the Great Depression Part II : Work - I 'm what you might charitably call under -employed .
Right now , it 's a little embarrassing , what with only 7 % unemployment and all .
If this were the Great Depression , on the other hand , I ’d be considered quite the busy man .
“ Time is money boys , ” I ’d say , exiting the coffee bean , “ Gotta put in my 4 hours ! ”
Even if I lost my crappy part - time job , I 'd be waiting in a bread line or scrounging for lumps of coal along with 25 % of my fellow man .
What is now a sign of laziness and stupidity can soon be passed off as a common malady , a sign of the times .
Dating - Modern dating can be quite expensive .
A fancy dinner , a movie at the Arclight , drinks afterward ... you 're looking at at least a couple hundred bucks .
But it 's not just the money , it 's the effort that goes into planning a date .
It can be quite a strain on my already limited creative energy .
But during a depression , the bar gets lowered exponentially .
Take your lady to Quiznos and you look like Bill Gates .
Splitting a can of ham is an acceptable dinner option .
Bring over a broken wooden crate you found by a dumpster , start a fire , and let the love - making begin .
Clothes -
Have you seen pictures of those poor men waiting in bread lines in the ’ 30’s ?
So chic .
Here ’s how fashion works in a depression : everyone gets one set of torn , grease - stained clothes , plus a pair of long johns that you sleep in .
It ’s basically the grunge era all over again , minus the Soundgarden concert shirts and Courtney Love ( thank god ) .
Music -
Who among us does n’t like songs about hobos ?
In a case that could cast suspicion on lawn ornaments everywhere , authorities say they have busted a drug ring that used concrete donkey statues to smuggle $ 1.5 million worth of marijuana into the Los Angeles area .
At least 15 people have been arrested in connection with the scheme to ship 1,800 pounds of pot in 200 concrete burros , which were discovered last month in a shipping container at the Port of Long Beach .
The donkey shipment was believed to have originated in Mexico and had been sent to a fictitious business in Fontana .
U.S. customs officials acting on a tip discovered the contraband and alerted nearly a dozen agencies that make up the Los Angeles Border Enforcement Security Task Force .
Marijuana was found hidden inside the hollow lawn statues , which are 3 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds , Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said .

Authorities tracked the shipment of dope - laden donkeys to Fontana and Sun Valley and made the arrests Tuesday night , Kice said .
The bulk of the shipment was seized in Fontana but agents found a portion of the donkey shipment in Sun Valley , stacked against a backyard fence next to a pen of live goats .
Agents detained 15 suspects , Kice said .
Of those , 14 were held on immigration violations and the remaining suspect was held on an outstanding criminal warrant .

Kim Kardashian Gives up Super Bowl to Workout
We were surprised to find out thatwill be missing Super Bowl XLIII , but the actress knows that work comes before play .
She jetted off to L.A. right away this morning after participating in a pregame event to finish her latest project .
Kim has been working very hard to maintain her shapely figure , and now she want to show the world how they too can do the same .
Filming a workout video , Kim told People magazine she was up for a " grueling day . "
" First of all , there 's a three - hour rehearsal where I have to do the exercises over and over .
Then I have to actually shoot the DVD .
So I 'll be working out for hours on Sunday while my friends are having fun . "
As for why Kardashian decided to join the ranks of fitness video gurus , she wanted girls not to just have to see " skinny " girls workout , she wanted them to have a more realistic approach to getting into shape .

A Message from Angelina Jolie - UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador .
" We can not close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering .
I honestly want to help .
I do n't believe I feel differently from other people .
I think we all want justice and equality , a chance for a life with meaning .
All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us .... "

This is easily the most fascinating story of a rescue mission there ever was .
It shows how far leadership and daring can go .
I came across this by watching the wonderful documentary “ The Endurance : Shackletons Legendary Antarctic Expedition “ .
If you can get the DVD , watch it , it ’s worth it .
This post can only give you a rough description of the adventure and I hope it will inspire you to find out more , or , if you are familiar with the story already , to revisit .
A special “ Thank You ” goes to commenter 5thstate , who reminded me of the plan to write this post when he mentioned Shackleton ’s book in his reply to today ’s open thread .
I took the info from wikipedia , which is , as far as my judgement goes , quite correct here .
Sir Ernest Shackleton ( 1874 – 1924 ) started his career at sea at the age of 16 in the Merchant Navy .
He never had much use for school and mostly felt bored there .
His first experiences with the Antarctic were on board of the Discovery during the expedition from 1901 to 1903 .
The expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott broke the record of the highest latitude , getting closest to the South Pole at latitude 82°17 ′ .
Some conflict that seems to have arisen among Scott and Shackleton promted the latter to try and outdo Scott .
On the Nimrod he set out to get closer to the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole and he established a new record only 112 miles from the South Pole .
The expedition lasted from 1907 to 1909 .
In 1912 it was clear that Amundsen had won the race for the South Pole ahead of Scott ’s Terra Nova Expedition and so Shackleton needed another challenge .
Like crossing the Antarctic continent from the Wedell Sea to Ross Island .
The Imperial Transatlantic Expedition 1914 – 1917 was born .
The Endurance , Shackleton ’s
Ship set out on December 5th 1914 and was frozen in the pack ice on January 19 , 1915 , never to take up sailing again .
The men camped on the ice for months and on November 21st 1915 the ice had destroyed the Endurance .
The ship sank .
In April 1916 the ice floe on which the men camped broke in two and the men could not stay on the ice any longer .
They took their lifeboats on a journey to relative safety .
Deception Island was their initial destination , but
The boats were still in the pack , dependent upon leads of water opening up , and progress was perilous and erratic .
Frequently the boats were tied to floes , or dragged up on to them , while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve .
Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations , and on 12 April rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay , at the very tip of Graham Land .
However , conditions in the boats , in temperatures sometimes as low as - 20 °F ( −30 °C ) , with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater , were wearing the men down , physically and mentally .
Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island , the nearest of the possible refuges , was now the only practical option .
( Source : Wikipedia )
Elephant Island was reached after five days at sea under the aforementioned conditions .
The island was uninhabited , however , and it was soon clear that no rescue was possible from there .
Shackleton and five other men set off for the 800 miles journey to South Georgia on April 24th .
They encountered hurricane conditions in what was n’t more than a cleverly patched up 22.5 ft lifeboat , the James Caird .
No sunlight , nor starlight to guide them in the prevailing weather conditions .
After 14 days they sighted South Georgia .
But the whaling station where they hoped to find help was on the other side of the island .
The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast .
To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island , or a land crossing through its unexplored interior .
The condition of the James Caird , and the physical state of the party , particularly Vincent and McNish , meant that only the second of these options was viable .
So a land journey through the rough country of South Georgia lay ahead of the exhausted men .
Without a map , the route they chose was largely conjectural .
By dawn they had ascended to 3,000 feet ( 910 m ) and could see the northern coast .
They were above Possession Bay , which meant that they were too far to the west and would need to move eastward to reach Stromness , their target whaling station .
This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men .
At the close of that first day , needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall , they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge .
There was no question of rest — they travelled on by moonlight , moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge .
Early next morning , seeing Husvik Harbour below them , they knew that they were on the right path .
At seven o’clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from the whaling station , “ the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914 ” .
After a difficult descent , which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall , they at last reached safety .
From there Shackleton eventually found a boat to sail to Elephant Island , where he landed on August 30th 1916 and found all of his men alive to bring them back home .
An incredible story .

For all of you variable star fans , there ’s a new kid on the block – Dwarf Nova QZ Virginis .
It was originally discovered by T. Meshkova on Moscow photographic plates in 1944 and had a magnitude range of 12.9 to as little as 14.5
But what is it ?
Try a cataclysmic variable star – one that our good friends down under caught just for Universe Today readers !
According to recently released AAVSO Special Notice # 144 , dwarf nova QZ Vir ( once known as T Leo ) is currently in outburst , and it appears that this outburst is a supermaximum .
Says M. Templeton , “ The most recent visual estimate of QZ Vir puts the star at visual magnitude 10.2 ( JD 2454857.6201 ; W. Kriebel , Walkenstetten , Germany ) .
Time series photometry by W. Stein ( New Mexico , United States ) on 2009 Jan 25 indicates the presence of superhumps in the light curve .
Observations by P. Schmeer ( Saarburecken - Bischmisheim , Germany ) , E. Morelle ( Lauwin - Planque , France ) , ASAS - 3 ( Pojmanski 2002 , AcA52 , 397 ) and R. Stubbings ( Tetoora Road , Vic. , Australia ) published on VSNET .
( T. Kato ; vsnet - alert 10980 ) suggest QZ Vir may have had a short precursor outburst lasting 2 - 3 days and fading immediately before the rise to supermaximum .
All observations , including both visual estimates and CCD time - series photometry , are strongly encouraged at this time . ”
Of course , it did n’t take a lot of encouragement – only some clear skies to get astrophotographer and serious researcher Joe Brimacombe of Southern Galactic to set his telescope towards QZ Virginis and image for us .
All we needed to do was provide the following coordinates :
RA : 11 38 26.80 , Dec : +03 22 07.0
As you can see , learning proper stellar coordinates is essential to practicing astronomy .
Without them , a stellar field is simply a stellar field as it would be next to impossible to distinguish one background star from the next .
While some of us understand what these strange sets of numbers mean – maybe some of our readers do n’t .
Let ’s take just a moment out from our busy days and learn , shall we ?
RA stands for Right Ascension .
It is the celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude .
RA ’s zero point is the Prime Meridian , located in the constellation of Aries where the Sun crosses the celestial equator at the March equinox .
Each set of numbers is then measured eastward in three sets – hours , minutes , and seconds , with 24 hours being equivalent to a full circle .
Declination , or “ Dec ” is comparable to latitude , projected onto the celestial sphere , and is measured in degrees north and south of the celestial equator .
Points north of the celestial equator have positive declinations , while those to the south have negative declinations .
These are also measured in three sets of numbers – degrees , minutes , and seconds of arc .
Now that you know , how do you use them ?
Chances are , if you have a telescope that has an equatorial mount , you already have the tools in your hands – called “ setting circles ” .
These same sets of numbers are waiting right on your telescope for you to set them !
Once your telescope is accurately polar aligned , you just use the setting circles to dial in these numbers and you ’ll be right in the approximate area .
For those with electronic setting circles , it ’s just a matter of inputting the correct coordinates and comparing star fields .
Once the general area is found , you simply need to understand how big the field your eyepiece gives and compare it to a star chart – like this one supplied by the AAVSO for QZ Vir .
Make note of your observations and compare the suspect nova to other stars of known magnitude nearby .
When you ’re done – do n’t keep your observations to yourself !
Please report all observations to the AAVSO using the name “ QZ Vir ” and contribute !
Our thanks to the American Association of Variable Star Observers ( AAVSO ) for providing us with information – and our special thanks to Dr. Joseph Brimacombe of Southern Galactic for providing us with a telescope and a look !
[ UPDATE BELOW ]
At at a time when any decent baker should have been selling racially harmonious black and white cookies by the truckload , one Greenwich Village bakery popular with celebrities and shows like Sex and the City has outraged neighbors by selling a " Drunken Negro Face " cookie in , um , " honor " of President Obama .
[ Video below . ]
A shocked customer tells My Fox NY that Ted Kefalinos , proprietor of Lafayette French Pastry , asked her , " Would you like some drunken negro heads to go with your coffee ?
They 're in honor of our new president .
He 's following in the same path of Abraham Lincoln ; he will get his . "
Later , her friend stopped by the bakery and said Kefalinos corrected her about the name of the cookies — they 're actually drunken " N - word " cookies .
She says the backwards baker then repeated the dark suggestion that , like Lincoln , President Obama " will get what 's coming to him . "
Go Secret Service , go !
And it gets worse when Fox 's Arnold Diaz goes into the store with a camera and microphone to confront Kefalinos , who suddenly makes Joe the Plumber look like a Rhodes scholar .
" I called them Drunken Negro Heads .
What 's the problem with that ? "
Kefalinos asks the newscaster with a smirk .
" On Inauguration Day I thought it would be cool to change the name to Obama Heads .
I just changed it for the day . "
We suppose Burning Cross Bananas Foster was too complicated to mass - produce .
Kefalinos denies intimating that Obama would be assassinated , and insists that the cookie is " not unflattering .
I think it 's a fun face ...
And anyone who says anything else should be ashamed of themselves . "
Besides , nobody got upset about the " Dead Geese Bread " he sold after the recent Hudson River plane crash .
( We 're NOT making that up . )
Also , Kefalinos insists he can't be racist because , for one thing , " my brother - in - law , he 's Cuban . "
Below , behold the breathtaking train wreck of racist ignorance .
UPDATE : We just spoke with Kefalinos on the phone and he remains utterly oblivious , telling us , " This whole thing was blown out of proportion . "
He says he 's sold out of the " Drunken Negro Cakes " and does n't plan to make anymore , despite the fact that many customers have been requesting them ( he claims ) .
When asked whether he understands that most African - Americans find the word " negro " offensive , Kefalinos explains , " It 's a French word .
It comes from the French . "
Community Board 2 was quick to call for a boycott of Lafayette French Pastry , to which Kefalinos responds , " I 'm sorry they feel that way because I was trying to do a nice thing . "
Not seeming to grasp in any way the degree of outrage he 's sparked , he added , " I did it and that 's the end of it and it's over . "
UPDATE 1/24 : Now Ted Kefalinos apologizes : " Seriously , from the bottom of my heart , it was an innocent design I created .
It was nothing more than just a piece of art . "
Palestinian pupils attend a class set up outside their destroyed school in Rafah , southern Gaza strip , January 2009 .
( Wissam Nassar / MaanImages )
And the children want to help their parents .
In Rafah , the morning of 18 January , when it appeared there would be at least a lull in the bombing , I watched children heap pieces of wood on plastic tarps and then haul their piles toward their homes .
The little ones seemed proud to be helping their parents recover from the bombing .
I ’d seen just this happy resilience among Iraqi children , after the 2003 “ Shock and Awe ” bombing , as they found bricks for their parents to use for a makeshift shelter in a bombed military base .
Children who survive bombing are eager to rebuild .
They do n’t know how jeopardized their lives are , how ready adults are to bomb them again .
In Rafah , that morning , an older man stood next to me , watching the children at work .
“ You see , ” he said , looking upward as an Israeli military surveillance drone flew past , “ if I pick up a piece of wood , if they see me carrying just a piece of wood , they might mistake it for a weapon , and I will be a target .
So these children collect the wood . ”
While the high - tech drone collected information , “ intelligence ” that helps determine targets for more bombing , toddlers collected wood .
Their parents , whose homes were partially destroyed , needed the wood for warmth at night and for cooking .
Because of the Israeli blockade against Gaza , there was n’t any gas .
With the border crossing at Rafah now sealed again , people who want to obtain food , fuel , water , construction supplies and goods needed for everyday life will have to increasingly rely on the damaged tunnel industry to import these items from the Egyptian side of the border .
Israel ’s government says that Hamas could use the tunnels to import weapons , and weapons could kill innocent civilians , so the Israeli military has no choice but to bomb the neighborhood built up along the border , as they have been doing .
Suppose that the US weapon makers had to use a tunnel to deliver weapons to Israel .
The US would have to build a mighty big tunnel to accommodate the weapons that Boeing , Raytheon , Lockheed Martin and Caterpillar have supplied to Israel .
The size of such a tunnel would be an eighth wonder of the world , a Grand Canyon of a tunnel , an engineering feat of the ages .
Think of what would have to come through .
Imagine Boeing ’s shipments to Israel traveling through an enormous underground tunnel , large enough to accommodate the wingspans of planes , sturdy enough to allow passage of trucks laden with missiles .
According to the UK’s Indymedia Corporate Watch , 2009 , Boeing has sent Israel 18 AH - 64D Apache Longbow fighter helicopters , 63 Boeing F - 15 Eagle fighter planes , 102 Boeing F - 16 fighter planes , 42 Boeing AH - 64 Apache fighter helicopters , F - 16 Peace Marble II and III Aircraft , four Boeing 777s , and Arrow II interceptors , plus Israel Aircraft Industries - developed Arrow missiles , and Boeing AGM - 114 D Longbow Hellfire missiles .
In September of last year , the US government approved the sale of 1,000 Boeing GBU - 9 small diameter bombs to Israel , in a deal valued at up to $ 77 million .
Now that Israel has dropped so many of those bombs on Gaza , Boeing shareholders can count on more sales , more profits , if Israel buys new bombs from them .
Perhaps there are more massacres in store .
It would be important to maintain the tunnel carefully .
Raytheon , one of the largest US arms manufacturers , with annual revenues of around $ 20 billion , is one of Israel ’s main suppliers of weapons .
In September last year , the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the sale of Raytheon kits to upgrade Israel ’s Patriot missile system at a cost of $ 164 million .
Raytheon would also use the tunnel to bring in Bunker Buster bombs as well as Tomahawk and Patriot missiles .
Lockheed Martin is the world ’s largest defense contractor by revenue , with reported sales in 2008 of $ 42.7 billion .
Lockheed Martin ’s products include the Hellfire precision - guided missile system , which has reportedly been used in the recent Gaza attacks .
Israel also possesses 350 F - 16 jets , some purchased from Lockheed Martin .
Think of them coming through the largest tunnel in the world .
Maybe Caterpillar Inc. could help build such a tunnel .
Caterpillar Inc. , the world ’s largest manufacturer of construction ( and destruction ) equipment , with more than $ 30 billion in assets , holds Israel ’s sole contract for the production of the D9 military bulldozer , specifically designed for use in invasions of built - up areas .
The US government buys Caterpillar bulldozers and sends them to the Israeli army as part of its annual foreign military assistance package .
Such sales are governed by the US Arms Export Control Act , which limits the use of US military aid to “ internal security ” and “ legitimate self defense ” and prohibits its use against civilians .
Israel topples family houses with these bulldozers to make room for settlements .
All too often , they topple them on the families inside .
American peace activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death standing between one of these bulldozers and a Palestinian doctor ’s house in 2003 .
In truth , there ’s no actual tunnel bringing US - manufactured weapons to Israel .
But the transfers of weapons and the US complicity in Israel ’s war crimes are completely invisible to many American people .
The US is the primary source of Israel ’s arsenal .
For more than 30 years , Israel has been the largest recipient of US foreign assistance and since 1985 Israel has received about 3 billion dollars each year in military and economic aid from the US ( “ US and Israel Up in Arms , ” Frida Berrigan , Foreign Policy in Focus , 17 January 2009 )
So many Americans can’t even see this flood of weapons , and what it means , for us , for Gaza ’s and Israel ’s children , for the world ’s children .
And so , people in Gaza have a right to ask us , how do you manage ?
How do you keep going ?
How can you sit back and watch while your taxes pay to massacre us ?
If it would be wrong to send rifles and bullets and primitive rockets into Gaza , weapons that could kill innocent Israelis , then is n’t it also wrong to send Israelis the massive arsenal that has been used against us , killing more than 400 of our children in the past six weeks , maiming and wounding thousands more ?
But , standing over the tunnels in Rafah that morning under a sunny Gaza sky , hearing the constant droning buzz of mechanical spies waiting to call in an aerial bombardment , no one asked me , an American , those hard questions .
The man standing next to me pointed to a small shed where he and others had built a fire in an ash can .
They wanted me to come inside , warm up , and receive a cup of tea .

On the heels of Audiovox 's announcement of an automotive version of the MediaFlo TV service for cell phones , AT&T has revealed plans for its own robust , satellite - based in - car TV service .
AT&T Cruisecast , slated to launch this spring , promises 22 channels of satellite TV at launch and 20 more of satellite radio - but will cost serious money : $ 1299 for the system , and $ 28 a month for the satellite TV service ( developed in conjunction with satellite industry veteran RaySat ) .
A final channel lineup is still being developed , but AT&T says it will include lots of family - friendly entertainment , including Disney Channel , Disney XD , Discovery Kids , Animal Planet , Nickelodeon , Cartoon Network Mobile , USA , COMEDY CENTRAL , MSNBC , CNN Mobile Live and CNBC .
The system requires installation of a 3 - pound , 11.3 - by - 10.3 - by - 4.3 - inch antenna on the roof of your vehicle .
AT&T describes this as " not particularly noticeable , " but I 'd take that observation with a grain of salt :
Check out the rooftop image , above .
AT&T says its technology addresses shortcomings of other in - car entertainment systems .
For example , the company says , its breakthrough buffering technology keeps the show going even when you 're under a tunnel or other line - of - site obstacle .
Avis and Budget car rental services have announced plans to make the Cruisecast service available in rental cars at some locations for $ 9 a day or $ 63 a week .
This story , " AT&T To Launch In - Car Satellite TV Service " was originally published by PCWorld .
A major credit card processor , Heartland Payment Systems , revealed this week that hackers have compromised its computer network and gained access to the system it uses to process 100 million payment card transactions per month for 175,000 merchants .
That number , if verified , would make this one of the largest data breaches on record and could even surpass TJ Maxx ’s embarrassing mishap in 2007 .
Heartland ’s problems began late last year when the company was alerted by Visa and MasterCard of suspicious activity surrounding processed card transactions .
The company then began an investigation , which lead to the data - stealing malware planted by thieves , apparently around November .
No personally identifiable information has been stolen but , according to Heartland , but the magnetic information stored on the back of credit cards was indeed compromised and could be used to duplicate a card .
The company said it immediately took a number of steps to secure its systems and created a website – www.2008breach.com – to provide information about the incident .
In addition , Heartland assured cardholders that they would not be held responsible for any unauthorized , fraudulent charges made by third parties .

[ digg - reddit - me ] From Michael Isikoff ’s profile of Thomas Tamm in Newsweek :
Tamm ’s story is in part a cautionary tale about the perils that can face all whistleblowers , especially those involved in national - security programs .
Some Americans will view him as a hero who ( like Daniel Ellsberg and perhaps Mark Felt , the FBI official since identified as Deep Throat ) risked his career and livelihood to expose wrongdoing at the highest levels of government .
Others — including some of his former colleagues — will deride Tamm as a renegade who took the law into his own hands and violated solemn obligations to protect the nation ’s secrets .
“ You ca n’t have runoffs deciding they ’re going to be the white knight and running to the press , ” says Frances Fragos Townsend , who once headed the unit where Tamm worked and later served as President Bush ’s chief counterterrorism adviser .
Townsend made clear that she had no knowledge of Tamm ’s particular case , but added : “ There are legal processes in place [ for whistle - blowers ’ complaints ] .
This is one where I ’m a hawk .
It offends me , and I find it incredibly dangerous . ”
As Hilzoy points out , Townsend was one of the people responsible for making sure that the whistle - blower process worked for Tamm :
Saying that whistleblowers ought to work within the system without adding “ if the system is in fact functional ” is odd in itself .
But saying that when you are one of the people who could have helped to make it functional amounts to saying : well , I and my colleagues have failed to do our jobs , but never mind that : we should expect whistle - blowers to work within the system , even if our own failure means that they have no reason to believe that doing so will actually accomplish anything other than the destruction of their careers .
In a CNN appearance attacking Scott McClellan when he released his book , Townsend seemed to make the exact opposite point of Hilzoy – suggesting that career destruction is the price you must pay :
You know , if there ’s policy issue that you think violates your personal values or your integrity and ethics , you do have an option .
You can voice it and if you lose , you leave .
Which is probably why Townsend was relieved to have been deliberately marginalized on sensitive national security issues by Vice President Cheney and his staff while she served as a counter - terrorism adviser .
( Her very appointment was also opposed by Scooter Libby and was apparently somehow tied in to the Valerie Plame leaking . )
The great irony is the clear double standard applied by people like Frances Fragos Townsend to condemn only those who politically opposed them for acting as renegades who take the law into their own hands thereby violating solemn obligations to protect the nation and its values while giving other a free pass .
Yes – Thomas Tamm , a lone individual with few powers , unable to affect what he believed to be flagrant law - breaking ( and what later events have proved to be at minimum felony crimes ) , took it upon himself to protect the Rule of Law , thus breaking one law to uphold the many .
And yes – George W. Bush , the most powerful man in the world , unwilling to concede that his powers had limits when he feared bad things would happen , broke many laws and ordered many more laws to be broken , to such a degree that he challenged the very concept of limits on the executive itself , corrupting the entire system that was designed to check his powers .
Both men broke the law to protect America .
One man corrupted the system designed to check him ; the other took on that corrupted system .
Yet Townsend – and many like her – argue that the petty criminal who broke the law ( for the common good ) should be prosecuted while the master criminals who broke many laws ( for the common good ) should not be .
This demonstrably creates two classes under the law – those above it and those subject to it .
John Adams described the definition of a republic as “ a government of laws and not of men . ”
Thomas Paine declared in Common Sense that “ in absolute governments the king is law , [ while ] in free countries the law ought to be king ; and there ought to be no other . ”
It is this fundamental American principle which Frances Fragos Townsend and other Bush administration apologists attack when they insist that only the dissenters and the powerless be punished for breaking the law .

A three year old girl is lucky to be alive after she was stung by a deadly box jellyfish at a remote beach in Milingimbi in the Northern Territory , Australia .
The youngster was reportedly playing in the shallows when she stepped on the adult jellyfish , which injected her with venom .
She collapsed and her family rushed her to a nearby local health clinic where doctors and nurses worked desperately to revive her .
The Arnhem Land community of Milingimbi is about 440 km east of Darwin and visiting community GP Dr. Paul Spillane says the girl was " lucky to survive " and was saved because there were experienced nursing and medical staff in the health centre at the time who were able to resuscitate her before she was evacuated to Gove District Hospital .
Dr. Paul Spillane says she was very lucky that the health centre was so close to the beach as had it been any further away she may not have lived .
Dr. Spillane says children are worst affected by the creature 's venom and he has warned families to avoid swimming in the sea during stinger season which is from October to May .
Dr. Spillane says during the stinger season parents need to realise a day on the beach can quickly turn into a life - or - death situation and the best strategy is prevention and avoiding the water altogether .
Since first reported in 1883 , box jellyfish have been responsible for at least 64 deaths in Australia - the last fatality was also a Northern Territory child , a six - year - old boy , who was also playing the shallows near the Milikapiti barge landing at Snake Bay on Melville Island in November last year which was the first stinger fatality in the Territory in more than a decade - the previous death was a three - year - old girl at a remote community in February 1996 .
As many as 30 deaths have been recorded from jellyfish stings in the Territory and ten have been children .
The Department of Health and Families says first aid is essential , victims must be got out of the water and the stung area immediately doused with vinegar and if the person is seriously ill , CPR may need to be carried out .
Box Jellyfish ( Chironex Fleckeri ) are pale blue and transparent and bell or cubed shaped with four distinct sides - they can measure up to 20 cm along each side of the cube or bell and have as many as 15 tentacles on each corner which can be 3 metres in length with up to 5,000 stinging cells .
The box jellyfish swims along at speeds of up 4 knots in a jet - like motion and appears along the shore in calm waters when the tide is rising - they are often found near the mouths of rivers , estuaries and creeks following the rain and feed on small fish and crustaceans .
The box jellyfish season starts with the onset of the wet across the top of northern Australia , usually around October and lasts until April - further south along the northern Queensland or northern Western Australia coast the season is usually from November to March and prevents swimming in the sea unless the beaches have protective stinger nets or a purpose designed stinger suit is worn ; fortunately the Great Barrier Reef is free of box jellyfish through all the seasons .
The venomous sting causes such excruciating pain that victims go into shock and can drown before reaching the shore and unless treated immediately , a victim has virtually no chance of surviving .
In treating the sting methylated spirit or alcohol must not be used as only domestic vinegars poured liberally over the tentacles inactivate the stinging cells allowing the tentacles to be removed .
Where antivenom is unavailable , pressure - immobilisation may be used on limbs after the stinging cells have been inactivated and artificial respiration and cardiac massage may be needed until medical assistance is available .
Barry Cooper should know better than anyone that you do n’t mess with the police .
He was once a cop and a dirty one at that .
But for the past three years , this former narcotics officer has been irritating the hell out of law enforcement , and he ’s been steadily raising the stakes , damn the consequences .
This is the story of how Barry and NeverGetBusted set up a fake marijuana grow room to film police illegally raiding the trap house .
The stunt was conducted to bring attention to Yolanda Madden , a mother of two sentenced to 8 years in prison after police planted methamphetamine in her car .
Below , you can read the story as published in the Texas Observer or you can listen to the same story as told by National Public Radio , " This American Life . "

Gone Rogue :
Ex narc frees drug war prisoners
Police admired Barry Cooper when he lied to put drug dealers in prison .
Then he flipped the game on them .
It began in 2007 when Cooper gained some notoriety for releasing a self - produced DVD series called Never Get Busted Again .
In it , Cooper shows pot smokers ways to outsmart the cops and their drug dogs .
He says that if you have marijuana in the car , it ’s a good idea to also bring along a cat since that will distract even a drug dog .
Got cops knocking on your door ?
Cooper says it ’s best to lock it shut , and then tell them through a closed window that you wo n’t let them in without a warrant .
The Never Get Busted DVDs to have a low - budget charm , especially when Cooper uses footage taken from his own patrol - car camera to illustrate a point .
Back then , in the mid-’90s , Cooper had short - cropped hair .
Cop mustache .
He liked to lean into suspects and intimidate them until they did what he wanted .
On his DVDs , Cooper will freeze the patrol - car video to point out the ways he got people to confess they were carrying drugs or money .
( “ Do n’t ever touch your face when you are talking to a cop .
It ’s a sign that you ’re lying . ” )
Cooper dropped out of college at age 20 to join the police force in the small East Texas town of Gladewater , where he trained his own drug dog and started making big busts on the highway .
Cooper was talented enough at seizing drugs that he was eventually hired by the Permian Basin Drug Task Force , a West Texas unit that became notorious for using unscrupulous tactics and was eventually shut down by the FBI in 1998 .
To Cooper , being on the task force was a great assignment ; he learned all the ways to bend the law to rack up arrests and chase down suspects .
Cooper was young , and he says the thing he loved most about being a cop was the adrenaline rush .
One of his favorite things was to pull people over on the highway and then , just for kicks , incite a chase .
“ They taught us at the academy that once we found drugs on someone , we should handcuff them immediately , ” he says .
“ Instead , I would look at the suspect and say , ‘ That ’s some crack cocaine I found in your pocket .
That ’s a felony , you ’re going to prison for life . ’
And I would just turn around and walk to my patrol car to fill out my paperwork , giving the suspect time to run , and they often did .
And then the foot chase would be on and the fight would ensue .
And that would get my adrenaline fix . ”
Some of Cooper ’s former colleagues have become notorious .
Cooper says one mentor was Barry Washington , who is named in a class - action lawsuit that ’s been filed against the city of Tenaha , Texas .
He ’s accused of stopping dozens of black and Latino motorists , taking their cash and valuables and telling them to keep driving or face arrest .
It ’s an extreme version of asset seizure , a Texas law that allows police to take property they suspect was acquired illegally without charging anyone for a crime .
In Tenaha , the city took more than $ 3 million in assets , and the DA is accused of giving $ 10,000 to Washington as a kickback for making the arrests , which is illegal .
Cooper says Washington taught him all kinds of tricks to invent probable cause , like how to train a drug dog to false alert , as an excuse to search a vehicle .

If we move to Anaheim , we 'll prob .
have to look elsewhere for shrubs
by Jeremy Hooper
Anaheim , California 's Marina Landscape Inc. gave $ 15,000 in support of Proposition 8 .
But not happy with simply taking away our marriages , their company 's staff is now sending us odd bits of rage in which they seem to connect Rick Warren with Prop 8 with Obama .
With full awareness that we are doing so , here now are this staffer 's thoughts , followed by our own :
Okay , first off :
We never called for Rick Warren 's invite to be rescinded .
We knew that was an impossibility .
And in fact , we would n't have even been comfortable with it being taken away once it had been granted .
All we wanted was to make our voices heard loud and clear so that the Obama team would understand why this was such a big matter of concern to certain people .
We believe it worked .
Twist and turn words ?
Spread lies ?
We will not even dignify that silliness .
We especially will not dignify that silliness when it comes from a forceful supporter of Proposition 8 , a campaign that fed on lies like a particularly malnourished vampire feeds on blood .
Thirdly :
The people have spoken on what ?
That they want Barack Obama , who we think is the most LGBT - friendly president in history , to be our commander - in - chief ?
That they want Barack Obama , Proposition 8 opponent , to served as their president ?
That they want Barack Obama , whose administration just posted a promising list of LGBT - related goals , to be this nation 's leader ?
Well guess what ?
We speak with them !
Loudly and proudly !
And we can't wait to see where this bright new hunk of hope takes our national conversation .
Rick Warren 's invocation was a jarring disconnect of this inauguration day .
Juxtaposed against the backdrop of true inclusivity , his words range hollow .
Compared with Rev. Lowery , whose heartfelt speech came across as pure and soulful , Warren 's prose made him seem like a pretender to the inclusive throne .
We know what lies behind his calls for peace and acceptance , because we 've heard his real thoughts pour directly from his mouth .
We know that in his worldview , we gays should not even act on our truths .
And we know that if we do , then our relationships are likely to be compared to pedophilia and incest .
But we were n't the only ones who saw this .
Because of the outcry about his forcefully anti-gay comments , much of America watched it through a different lens .
In doing so , they were forced to ask themselves :
Do I have a place at Rick Warren 's table , or will I be among the next group to have my entire existence undermined by his odd brand of " inclusivity " ?
Marina Landscape Inc
Your thoughts
Actually ( and I know folks shy away from thinking of these things as having winners and losers ) I think the lgbt community won this one .
Other than a silly and bad cover up of Warren 's comments about incest and pedophilia from Fox News ( via Mike Huckabee of all people ) , when news casters talked about the Warren situation , I noticed how they framed it as us being angry at Warren specifically because of his debasement of lgbt relationships instead of the connotation that he is a victim of persecution because of his support of Proposition 8 .

Nice Response .
Hopefully you sent this reply to the person who sent you that email .
He or she should learn to research before rattling off nonsense .

Just curious ... why are you concerned whether or not the person who sent you the email is aware that you are posting the email on your blog .
Also , why do you hide their identity
i.e. the email address .
I am not trying to make any waves .... I am just curious .
Thanks !

Our friends at Marina are correct - the Obama administration has indeed spoken .
They have spoken out in full support of LGBT rights .
Here 's the Obama agenda for LGBT rights that was posted this afternoon to whitehouse.gov : * Expand Hate Crimes Statutes
* Fight Workplace Discrimination
* Support Full Civil Unions and Federal Rights
* Oppose a Constitutional Ban on Same - Sex Marriage
* Repeal Do n't Ask - Do n't Tell
* Expand Adoption Rights ( ensure adoption rights for LGBT )
* Promote AIDS Prevention
* Empower Women to Prevent HIV / AIDS

My blog is n't a huge as Jeremy 's but I have not put out email addresses either ( and in posts having nothing to do with Proposition 8 ) .
It 's a simple matter of courtesy .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Jan 20 , 2009 7:45:51 PM
The withholding of contact info for the mailer is appropriate .
I keeps them from a deluge of angry hate mail .
So this is typical and curteous .
Also , I would like to add , posting this person 's contact info would have been seen as yet another way the bigger than christianty gay conspiracy is persecuiting the few believers that are left in the world .

I find it ironic that the company considers itself an " equal opportunity employer " on their website .
I know if I were working there , I 'd feel like I was in a hostile workplace .

Over at Pharyngula , PZ Myers has this to say : " I reserve the right to publicly post , with full identifying information about the source , any email sent to me that contains threats of violence . "
But this one did n't have any threats , so perhaps you were right to mask the full address .
( Note also that from addresses on e-mails are easily faked .
I can do it myself very simply with an Apache webserver running php. )

Dame Stella Rimington , the former head of MI5 , has accused the Government of exploiting public fear of terrorism to restrict civil liberties .
Her comments came on the same day as a report published by international jurists suggested that Britain and America have led other countries in " actively undermining " the rule of law and " threatening civil liberties " in the guise of fighting terrorism .
In an interview with the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia , Dame Stella said that a series of increasingly draconian policies have led British citizens to " live in fear and under a police state " .

The 73 - year - old said : " Since I have retired I feel more at liberty to be against certain decisions of the Government , especially the attempt to pass laws which interfere with people 's privacy .
" It would be better that the Government recognised that there are risks , rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties , precisely one of the objects of terrorism : that we live in fear and under a police state . "
Dame Stella , who became the first female head of MI5 in 1992 and held the position until 1996 , has long been a vocal critic of the Government 's plans to introduce ID cards and lengthen the amount of time terror suspects are held without charge to 42 days .
In the interview yesterday , she also criticised the United States .
She said : " The US has gone too far with Guantanamo and the tortures .
MI5 does not do that .
Furthermore it has achieved the opposite effect : there are more and more suicide terrorists finding a greater justification . "
The former MI5 chief chose to air her views on the same day as a three - year study called for urgent measures to stop the erosion of individual freedom by states and the abandoning of draconian measures brought on with the " War on Terror " .
The International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) said the legal framework which broadly existed in democratic countries before 9/11 was " sufficiently robust to meet current threats " .
Instead , a series of security measures were brought in , many of which were illegal and counter - productive , instilling anger and resentment expressed through violent protests .

One worrying development , says the report , was that liberal democracies such as the UK and US have been at the forefront of advocating the new aggressive policies and that has given totalitarian regimes the excuse to bring in their own repressive laws .
The ICJ panel , which included Mary Robinson , the former Irish president and United Nations Human Rights Commissioner and Arthur Chaskelson , the former president of the South African constitutional court , gathered their evidence from 40 countries .
They took testimony from government officials , ministers , and people in prison for alleged terrorist offences .
The actions of the US has immense influence on the behaviour of other countries , the study maintained , and the jurists called on President Barack Obama to repeal policies which came with the " war on terror paradigm " and were inconsistent with international human rights law .
" In particular , it should renounce the use of torture and other proscribed interrogation techniques , extraordinary renditions , and secret and prolonged detention without charge or trial " .
The report stated : " The framework of international law is being undermined ... the US and UK have led that undermining . "
The jurists examined cases which included " individuals abducted and held in secret prisons , where they have been tortured and ill - treated ; terrorist suspects held incommunicado for extended periods before being charged and before they have access to lawyers ; a culture of secrecy ( in which ) suspects are being placed beyond the basic protections afforded by ... international humanitarian laws " .
The ICJ " received evidence that intelligence services ... effectively enjoy impunity for human rights violations .
In addition ... state secrecy or public interest immunity have been used to foreclose civil suits and hence remedies to the victims of such abuses . "
Mr Chaskelson , chairman of the panel , said : " ... we have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive ... counter - terrorism measures ... "
A Home Office spokesman said : " We recognise clearly our obligations to protect the public from terrorist atrocities while upholding our firm commitment to human rights and civil liberties .
Our policies strike that balance . "
' War on terror '
The mistakes repeated
* Giving evidence to the panel , Sir Ken Macdonald , Britain 's Director of Public Prosecutions said : " There is no such thing as a ' war on terror ' ...
The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war .
It is the prevention of crime , enforcement of our laws ... "
The report also says the " war on terror " is repeating the mistakes made by the British in Northern Ireland .
It states : " Sometimes the parallels are almost surreal .
Witnesses talked of the failed detention policies in Northern Ireland as having led to ' hundreds of young men in working - class nationalist communities joining the IRA and creating one of the most efficient insurgency forces in the world ...'
One must wonder , 30 years later , what impact the sight of the treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay or Abu Ghraib is having on young Muslims in Britain and elsewhere . "
Hemingway spent 20 years of his life living in Cuba
Cuba has opened up electronic access to thousands of documents belonging to the writer Ernest Hemingway , who wrote some of his greatest works on the island .
The archive includes photographs , letters and manuscripts , as well as an unpublished epilogue to Hemingway 's novel , For Whom the Bell Tolls .
The items had been stored in the cellar of the writer 's Cuban home for decades .
Curators say the files offer an insight into Hemingway 's life on the island , where he lived for 20 years .
" We are talking about 3,194 pages of documents , close to 2,000 plus of documents , some already digitalised , " said Ada Rosa Alfonso Rosales , director of the Museo Ernest Hemingway in Havana .
" For practically the first time , this is being made available to students and researchers , " she said .
Another 1,000 documents are still to be scanned and added to the archive , Ms Alfonso said .
The archive includes coded messages which Hemingway sent while using his yacht to search for German submarines operating off the island .
Academics and researchers will be able to request electronic copies of the items from Cuba 's Heritage Council .
Ms Alfono said the archive would " shed light on the Cuban period of Hemingway , which was very important and not well known by his biographers " .
The project is a joint operation with Heritage Council and the US Social Science Research Council as part of a 2002 agreement to preserve the original material .
CDs and microfilms of the documents have also been sent to the John F Kennedy library in Boston and could eventually be made available online , said Ms Alfonso .
Well , kids , it looks like the Asus Eee PC 1000HE has started making the rounds and so far the reviews have been rather favorable .
PC
Review was so taken by the machine , in fact , that they declared it the " best one yet ... dethron[ing ] the MSI Wind as the leader of the pack . "
Their enthusiasm is stoked by the fact that the machine 's been designed around its new six - cell battery ( making for something less bulky than , say , the 10 - inch Aspire One or the NC10 - 14GB ) .
Also in the win column are the obvious design improvements over its predecessor , and its hard to beat $ 400 street price .
That said , it is a netbook : the new Intel Atom N280 processor offers " no real performance benefits " over the N270 , the features are pretty standard for a machine of its class ( 160 GB HDD , three USB ports , a webcam , VGA out , 4 - in - 1 card reader and the usual ethernet and WiFi connectivity ) and testing failed to find " any performance differences between the 1000HE and systems like the Wind , the Aspire One ( 10 - inch ) , and the HP 2140 . "
Also according to the magazine , the new software - based overclocking feature is no great shakes .
Laptop Magazine feels pretty much the same way , loving the new keyboard , the new battery , and the fact the easy - access panel ( for HDD and RAM upgrades and the like ) is still intact .
On the other hand , they point out that the thing 's a little heavy ( 3.2 pounds ) -- but what do you expect from a machine that boasts over 7 hours battery life ?
Notebook Review singles the thing out for its design : " Build quality , " it says " is very good with strong , durable plastics used throughout the body , " and the new keyboard and gloss black paint " really adds another level of class and style to this netbook . "
But do n't take our word for it -- hit the read links for the full reviews , and be sure to check out the gallery below .
CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus , supported by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , tried to convince President Barack Obama that he had to back down from his campaign pledge to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months at an Oval Office meeting Jan. 21 .
But Obama informed Gates , Petraeus , and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm .
Mike Mullen that he was n’t convinced and that he wanted Gates and the military leaders to come back quickly with a detailed 16 - month plan , according to two sources who have talked with participants in the meeting .
Obama ’s decision to override Petraeus ’ recommendation has not ended the conflict between the president and senior military officers over troop withdrawal , however .
There are indications that Petraeus and his allies in the military and the Pentagon , including Gen.
Ray Odierno , now the top commander in Iraq , have already begun to try to pressure Obama to change his withdrawal policy .
A network of senior military officers is also reported to be preparing to support Petraeus and Odierno by mobilizing public opinion against Obama ’s decision .
Petraeus was visibly unhappy when he left the Oval Office , according to one of the sources .
A White House staffer present at the meeting was quoted by the source as saying , " Petraeus made the mistake of thinking he was still dealing with George Bush instead of with Barack Obama . "
Petraeus , Gates , and Odierno had hoped to sell Obama on a plan that they formulated in the final months of the Bush administration that aimed at getting around a key provision of the U.S. - Iraqi withdrawal agreement signed envisioned re-categorizing large numbers of combat troops as support troops .
That subterfuge was by the United States last November while ostensibly allowing Obama to deliver on his campaign promise .
Gates and Mullen had discussed the relabeling scheme with Obama as part of the Petraeus - Odierno plan for withdrawal they had presented to him in mid-December , according to a Dec. 18 New York Times story .
Obama decided against making any public reference to his order to the military to draft a detailed 16 - month combat troop withdrawal policy , apparently so that he can announce his decision only after consulting with his field commanders and the Pentagon .
The first clear indication of the intention of Petraeus , Odierno , and their allies to try to get Obama to amend his decision came on Jan. 29 when the New York Times published an interview with Odierno , ostensibly based on the premise that Obama had indicated that he was " open to alternatives . "
The Times reported that Odierno had " developed a plan that would move slower than Mr. Obama ’s campaign timetable " and had suggested in an interview " it might take the rest of the year to determine exactly when United States forces could be drawn down significantly . "
The opening argument by the Petraeus - Odierno faction against Obama ’s withdrawal policy was revealed the evening of the Jan. 21 meeting when retired Army Gen.
Jack Keane , one of the authors of the Bush troop surge policy and a close political ally and mentor of Gen.
Petraeus , appeared on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to comment on Obama ’s pledge on Iraq combat troop withdrawal .
Keane , who had certainly been briefed by Petraeus on the outcome of the Oval Office meeting , argued that implementing such a withdrawal of combat troops would " increase the risk rather dramatically over the 16 months . "
He asserted that it would jeopardize the " stable political situation in Iraq " and called that risk " not acceptable . "
The assertion that Obama ’s withdrawal policy threatens the gains allegedly won by the Bush surge and Petraeus ’ strategy in Iraq will apparently be the theme of the campaign that military opponents are now planning .
Keane , the Army vice - chief of staff from 1999 to 2003 , has ties to a network of active and retired four - star Army generals , and since Obama ’s Jan. 21 order on the 16 - month withdrawal plan , some of the retired four - star generals in that network have begun discussing a campaign to blame Obama ’s troop withdrawal from Iraq for the ultimate collapse of the political " stability " that they expect to follow U.S. withdrawal , according to a military source familiar with the network ’s plans .
The source says the network , which includes senior active duty officers in the Pentagon , will begin making the argument to journalists covering the Pentagon that Obama ’s withdrawal policy risks an eventual collapse in Iraq .
That would raise the political cost to Obama of sticking to his withdrawal policy .
If Obama does not change the policy , according to the source , they hope to have planted the seeds of a future political narrative blaming his withdrawal policy for the " collapse " they expect in an Iraq without U.S. troops .
That line seems likely to appeal to reporters covering the Iraq troop withdrawal issue .
Ever since Obama ’s inauguration , media coverage of the issue has treated Obama ’ s 16 - month withdrawal proposal as a concession to antiwar sentiment which will have to be adjusted to the " realities " as defined by the advice to Obama from Gates , Petraeus , and Odierno .
Ever since he began working on the troop surge , Keane has been the central figure manipulating policy in order to keep as many U.S. troops in Iraq as possible .
It was Keane who got Vice President Dick Cheney to push for Petraeus as top commander in Iraq in late 2006 when the existing commander , Gen. George W. Casey , did not support the troop surge .
It was Keane who protected Petraeus ’ interests in ensuring the maximum number of troops in Iraq against the efforts by other military leaders to accelerate troop withdrawal in 2007 and 2008 .
As Bob Woodward reported in The War Within , Keane persuaded President George W. Bush to override the concerns of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the stress of prolonged U.S. occupation of Iraq on the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as well its impact on the worsening situation in Afghanistan .
Bush agreed in September 2007 to guarantee that Petraeus would have as many troops as he needed for as long as wanted , according to Woodward ’s account .
Keane had also prevailed on Gates in April 2008 to make Petraeus the new commander of CENTCOM .
Keane argued that keeping Petraeus in the field was the best insurance against a Democratic administration reversing the Bush policy toward Iraq .
Keane had operated on the assumption that a Democratic president would probably not take the political risk of rejecting Petraeus ’ recommendation on the pace of troop withdrawal from Iraq .
Woodward quotes Keane as telling Gates , " Let ’s assume we have a Democratic administration and they want to pull this thing out quickly , and now they have to deal with General Petraeus and General Odierno .
There will be a price to be paid to override them . "
Obama told Petraeus in Baghdad last July that , if elected , he would regard the overall health of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and the situation in Afghanistan as more important than Petraeus ’ obvious interest in maximizing U.S. troop strength in Iraq , according to Time magazine ’s Joe Klein .
But judging from Petraeus ’ shock at Obama ’s Jan. 21 decision , he had not taken Obama ’s previous rejection of his arguments seriously .
That miscalculation suggests that Petraeus had begun to accept Keane ’s assertion that a newly elected Democratic president would not dare to override his policy recommendation on troops in Iraq .

Dear Phish and Red Light Management ,
This morning , 10/18/08 , thousands of Phish phans got shut out of tickets by ticketmaster .
Please sign a deal to simulcast at theaters and / or other arenas , your March 6th comeback performance or the whole Hampton run .
There are a lot of folks that have supported you guys for many years and should be a part of this landmark show .
Just because they could n't enter a security check faster than others should n't mean that they can't enjoy these shows .
I believe this would not only benefit the phans but would also help the city of Hampton by not having thousands of ticketless phans descending upon Hampton that weekend .

In 2008 the credit crisis spread around the world like a virus .
We saw individuals , companies and small countries go to the wall .
Will 2009 be the year when U.S. creditors refuse to expose themselves to an ever increasing risk of default in order to protect their own economies ?
There are growing signs of hesitation and fear on behalf of those who would lend Uncle Sam the funds to finance yet another “ stimulus ” plan .
No small wonder as the U.S. is flat broke and up to it 's eyes in unpaid debt as it is .
With inflationary fears added to the mix as trillions of dollars emerge in to the U.S. economy over 2009 and trillions already thrown in to the bottomless pit of the financial sector , China and Japan are getting nervous .
Japan 's utter panic was summed up by Akio Mikuni , President of the ratings company Mikuni & Co. when he suggested that “ Japan should write - off its holdings of Treasuries because the U.S. government will struggle to finance increasing debt levels needed to dig the economy out of recession ” .
For good measure ..
” The dollar may lose as much as 40 percent of its value to 50 yen or 60 yen from the current spot rate of 90.40 today in Tokyo unless Japan takes drastic measures to help bail out the U.S. economy ”
China 's Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan announced that it will allow the yuan to be used for settlement between Guangdong Province and the Yangtze River Delta and exporters in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province in southwestern China will be allowed to use the yuan to settle trade payments with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations .
His tongue in cheek explanation ?
“ The US dollar is unlikely to be stable next year and later .
And the likelihood of the United States issuing more money in the near future adds to the depreciation risk in US - dollar - denominated assets and trade settlements . ”

A previous report describing China 's proposed 7 fold increase in Gold reserves is also indicative of its gradual pullback from the doomed dollar .
Gold has been slowly rising as investors , previously struck rigid with fear , are now taking a breath and looking at real value .
The old adage of Gold being a safe haven is coming back in to play and no amount of gold price manipulation on the exchange is going to change that .
With China 's announcement of its intention to build up it 's reserves to 4000 Tons , we can expect other Treasury Note holders to be thinking along the same lines .
This can only lead to a bullish gold market and a collapsing market for Treasuries .
Treasury Note doomsayers are a growing community amongst which we can count former Bank of England policymaker , Willem Buiter , who summed up his position thus
“ Even the most hard - nosed , Guantanomo Bay - indifferent potential foreign investor in the US must recognise that its financial system has collapsed ”
And Barrons is announcing a coming Treasury Bubble Pop ..
“ Treasuries offer little or no margin of safety if the economy unexpectedly strengthens in 2009 , or the dollar weakens significantly , or inflation shows signs of reaccelerating . ”
Forbes is predicting China 's future diversification of it's reserves as Treasury Bills become more of a liability ..
“ Washington 's issuance of mountains of debt to bail out the U.S. economy will only make T - bills less rewarding , putting the dollar 's future strength in question .
Various economists are saying it will be in China 's interest to diversify in the near future . ”
We can discount the unexpected strengthening of the economy in 2009 , but inflation has to rise once those trillions are in the playing field and the dollar will be toast .
Bonds , yielding next to nothing , do n't exactly present an attractive investment opportunity .
The only reason Treasuries have been so attractive up to now was that they were presumed to be a safer harbor than equities , commodities or cash .
No amount of “ stimulus ” plans can fool all the people all the time .
After the initial massacre , investors are taking a moment of reflection and taking a more long term approach .
We are now in an era of survival and protectionism rules the day .
This afternoon in Maricopa County , Ariz. , more than 200 Latino immigrants were chained , dressed in prison stripes and forced to march down a public street from a county jail to a detainment camp in a desert industrial zone outside Phoenix .
Along the way they were filmed by television news crews and guarded by at least 50 Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ( MCSO ) deputies , wearing body armor and combat fatigues , armed with shotguns and automatic rifles .
At least two canine units were present ; a Sheriff ’s Department helicopter hovered overhead .
The massive show of force was pure stagecraft for a blatant and dehumanizing publicity stunt orchestrated by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
The MCSO gave no indication that any of the immigrant prisoners were particularly violent or presented a grave danger to the public .
According to a MCSO press release , 220 immigrants were transferred to a “ Tent City ” surrounded by electrified fencing .
“ This is a population of criminals more adept perhaps at escape , ” Arpaio stated in the press release .
“ But this is a fence they wo n’t want to scale because they risk receiving a shock – literally . ”
The press release further detailed how the immigrants will be treated like any other prisoners , “ with two exceptions . ”
First , “ Arpaio wants them to be instructed in American immigration laws , as a way to help them understand that the violation of these laws has serious consequences not only to them but to society as a whole . ”
Second , immigrants who violate jail rules will be put on a desert chain gang .
“ This chain gang will work to clean the areas [ of the nearby desert ] which have been impacted by human trafficking trade , ” the release stated .
Humiliating prisoners by putting them on parade began in Imperial Rome .
In modern times it ’s been widely denounced as a barbarous practice .
In March 2003 , after the Iraqi government paraded five captured U.S. soldiers in front of television cameras , then U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld protested that it was a violation of the Geneva Convention .
The Phoenix New Times pointed out that Arpaio ’s immigrant parade was scheduled for the same day that MCSO Captain Joel Fox was scheduled to appear in court to appeal a $ 315,000 fine levied against him for channeling an illegal $ 105,000 campaign donation to the Republican Party in the name of a shadowy entity called the “ Sheriff ’s Command Association . ”
“ Which event do you think average news consumers will remember on Thursday – an administrative hearing concerning a convoluted tale of campaign finance laws , or the image of 200 Mexicans in stripes marching in chains down a public street ? ” asked the New Times .
“ Yeah , we thought so , too . ”
Arpaio is lionized by Minutemen vigilantes and other nativist extremists for his controversial “ 287 ( g ) ” arrangement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which empowers the MCSO , a local agency , to enforce federal immigration law .
Many Latinos taken into custody in recent months by MCSO 287 ( g ) squads have been pulled over for minor traffic violations , such as a broken headlight or an improper lane change , and then arrested when they ’re unable to produce proof of citizenship or a valid visa .
The operations , several of which have been concentrated in predominately Latino neighborhoods and conducted in some cases by MCSO officers wearing black ski masks , have drawn widespread accusations of racial profiling .
Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox , an outspoken critic of Arpaio ’s immigrant - bashing antics , told the Associated Press that today ’s parade was “ one of the most inhumane things I ’ve ever heard . ”
“ [ Arpaio ’s ] trying to justify this as a ‘ budget savings , ’ and I ’m just appalled .
It ’s just another publicity stunt , ” Wilcox said .
“ I do n’t think you can segregate people that way , and we ’re going to get all kinds of violations against us . ”
The Defense Secretary has made himself perfectly clear :
The military already has plenty of $ 340 million stealth fighter jets .
But military and industrial supporters of the F - 22 Raptor keep pushing to buy more and more of the ultra- advanced aircraft .
Their latest tactic involves rebranding the plane as a jobs program , and launching an online " grass - roots " campaign to keep the F - 22's production lines open .
Hang around WashingtonPost.com and other DC - oriented websites for long enough , and you 'll see banner ads like this one :
Clicking on the ad takes you to PreserveRaptorJobs.com , a one - page site that urges visitors to write President Obama in support of the jet .
" Keeping the production line of this model aerospace program open is not another bailout ; rather , it simply requires that the new administration release funds already authorized by Congress to continue a successful program , " the site insists .
Maybe .
But there 's certainly more at stake than just a single fighter program , due to end in two years after
183 planes .
Inside the Beltway and across the blogosphere , there 's a furious debate over whether or not to treat weapons systems as economic stimulus – and throw more money at them , in the name of jobs .
If the
Raptor becomes part of the economic recovery , there 's a decent chance all sorts of other ships , planes , and fighting vehicle programs will get cash infusions , too .
The PreserveRaptorJobs.com site does n't mention who is behind the letter - writing campaign .
But Raptor - maker Lockheed Martin features a prominent link to the effort on its F - 22 page .
And a quick search reveals that the pro-fighter site sits on the servers of DC - area public relations firm Democracy Data & Communications .
The company specializes in ginning up " grass - roots " campaigns for Fortune 500 conglomerates – and increasing donations to their political action committees .
According to SourceWatch , the firm has also built and hosted sites for Microsoft , Fannie Mae , Ford Motor Company , and others .
In 2005 , Democracy Data & Communications CEO B.R. McConnon was brought before the Senate 's Indian Affairs Committee , during an investigation into tribal lobbying .
Also testifying that day was convicted influence - peddler Jack Abramoff .
McConnon and his firm did not immediately return calls , requesting comments for this story .

By Khalid Amayreh Journalist — Occupied Palestine
Editor ’s note :
The rise of the rightwing in Israel through the recent Knesset elections that was preceded by the bloody war on Gaza , that left more than 1,300 dead most of them are women and children , has aroused a lot of criticism among Palestinians .
Khalid Amayreh opines about the rise of Lieberman .
“ The ‘ main surprise ’ of the recent Israeli elections Avigdor Lieberman is a man who really has much in common with Adolph Hitler . ”
In the early 1930s , many in Germany saw the Nazis as the wave for the future .
Thousands of new members joined the Nazi party , giving absolute allegiance to the Fuhrer , Adolph Hitler .
In the spring of 1932 , with six million unemployed , chaos in Berlin , starvation and ruin as well as the threat of Marxism , and a very uncertain future , the masses turned to Hitler by the millions .
In the German presidential elections , which took place on March 13 , 1932 , Hitler received over 11 million votes or 30 percent of the total .
His opponent , President Hindenburg , received more than 18 million votes or 49 percent .
With Hindenburg failing to get the absolute majority he needed , Hitler seized the opportunity and immediately embarked on a frantic campaign , arousing national feelings and promising something for everyone .
In the Third Reich , he said , every German girl would find a husband .
Eventually , on a dark , rainy Sunday , April 10 , 1932 , the people voted , giving Hitler nearly 13.5 million votes , or 36 percent of the total , with Hindenburg receiving 19.3 million votes .
After some political changes , in January 1933 , Hitler took the reins of the German republic , being appointed as Chancellor .
We all know the rest of the story .
Now , a similar story is being worked out in Israel , with Nazi - minded Israeli leaders , triumphing in the recent elections which came at the heel of a genocidal blitzkrieg that destroyed the bulk of the Gaza Strip and killed and maimed thousands of innocent Palestinians , including hundreds of children .
Towards Full - fledged Fascism
The outcome of the elections , which took place on February 10 , proves beyond doubt that the Israeli Jewish society is drifting toward full - fledged fascism .
True , Zionism has always been inherently fascist since it embodies racism in its ugliest forms .
However , the new breed of Zionist leaders are quite unapologetic about their genocidal propensities .
Take for example , Avigdor Lieberman , the “ main surprise , ” of the recent elections .
This is a man who really has much in common with Adolph Hitler .
He is ambitious , calculating , and very manipulative .
He is also racist to the core , anti-democratic , and especially genocidal in his views and political thoughts .
He combines the ruthlessness of Joseph Stalin and the jingoism of the Nazi Fuhrer .
During the recent murderous onslaught on Gaza , Lieberman proposed dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza .
He was not speaking facetiously ; he says what he means and he means what he says .
Lieberman ’s other ideas include flooding Egypt by bombing the Aswan Dam , blanket - bombing Palestinian population centers , throwing thousands of Palestinian prisoners into the Dead Sea , and destroying Tehran with nuclear bombs .
Now Lieberman , whose manifestly fascist party has become the third largest in Israel , is the rising star of Israeli politics very much as Adolph Hitler was the rising star of German politics in the late 1920s and 1930s .
And as German political leaders sought to endear themselves to Hitler , most Israeli politicians on the right and left ( the Israeli left is actually more right - wing than the most right - wing party in the Western world ) are now currying favor with Lieberman and imploring him to join them in a coalition government .
But Lieberman ’s ambitions go far beyond becoming merely an important component of the Israeli political system .
His eyes are focused on one thing : Becoming leader of Israel .
Not the Black Sheep of Israeli Politics
Despite his repulsive notoriety , Lieberman is not really the black sheep of Israeli politics .
In fact , Lieberman , notwithstanding his Nazi propensity , the former Moldovan immigrant may be considered “ moderate ” when compared against a plethora of other fascist parties in Israel such as Ichud Leumi ( National Union ) , Habayit Hayehudi ( the Jewish Home ) which advocates or stops short of advocating biblical - style genocidal annihilation of all Palestinians “ because God says so . ”
However , Lieberman ’s pubic appeal and ability to arouse the rabble makes him far more dangerous than any other political party in Israel .
He is a man who is capable of leading Israelis to the same destination that Adolph Hitler took Germans to nearly 80 years ago .
But , unlike the Germans , many of whom did not really know where they were being led to , most Israelis seem quite aware that fascism , or more correctly , Jewish Nazism , represents the modus operandi in Israel today .
On Thursday , February 12 , the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz quoted Rabi Dr. Michael Ben-Ari as saying that the outcome of the Israeli elections proved that Israelis in general accepted the racist views of Rabbi Meir Kahane .
“ Rabbi Kahane made long inroads and I think the Israeli public in these elections gave an unequivocal answer as to where it is turning , ” Ben - Ari said in an interview with Galli Tzahal , the Israeli Army Radio .
Kahane advocated the genocidal ethnic cleansing of non-Jews in Israel - Palestine .
He put his evil ideas into a book entitled “ They Must Go . ”
Ben -Ari , a self - confessed Kahane disciple , had declared that Palestinians in Israel - Palestine should be expelled to places like Venezuela and Turkey .
He declared that he would want to be Interior Security Minister , presumably in order to ethnically cleanse non-Jews in Israel .
“ Someone has to create order with regard to a few matters !!.
And I would n’t object to filling those shoes . ”
Committing the Unthinkable
The gloomy portents coming from Israel these days must be taken seriously , or else humanity would allow the repetition of the events that led to the massive atrocities of the Second World War .
The criminal , psychotic , and megalomaniac political class in Israel is simply capable of committing the unthinkable .
They are armed to the teeth , nearly immune from external pressure , and firmly confide
nt that the Jewish lobby or lobbies is in tight control of America from California to New York and that all America ’s leaders , from Nancy Pelosi to Barack Obama are deep in the Jewish pockets .
Hence , the world must not allow this menacing bellicosity to go unchecked .
I know that some of those languishing under the influence of Zionist hasbara , especially in Europe and North America , may dismiss my warnings as far - fetched or highly exaggerated .
Well , those I want to ask a simple question :
Who would have thought in 1933 that Hitler would ever do what he did ?
Claim :
An early experiment in subliminal advertising at a movie theater substantially increased sales of popcorn and Coke .
FALSE
Origins : Public awareness of what we now term
“ subliminal advertising ” began with the 1957 publication of Vance Packard ’s book , The Hidden Persuaders .
Although Packard did not use the term “ subliminal advertising , ” he did describe many of the new “ motivational research ” marketing techniques being employed to sell products in the burgeoning post - war American market .
Advertisements that focused on consumers ’ hopes , fears , guilt , and sexuality were designed to persuade them to buy products they ’d never realized they needed .
Marketers who could reach into the hearts and minds of American consumers soon found consumers ’ wallets to be within easy grasp as well .
It was James Vicary who coined the term “ subliminal advertising . ”
Vicary had conducted a variety of unusual studies of female shopping habits , discovering ( among other things ) that women ’s eye - blink rates dropped significantly in supermarkets , that “ psychological spring ” lasts more than twice as long as “ psychological winter , ” and that “ the experience of a woman baking a cake could be likened to a woman giving birth . ”
Vicary ’s studies were largely forgettable , save for one experiment he conducted at a Ft. Lee , New Jersey movie theater during the summer of 1957 .
Vicary placed a tachistoscope in the theater ’s projection booth , and all throughout the playing of the film Picnic , he flashed a couple of different messages on the screen every five seconds .
The messages each displayed for only 1/3000th of a second at a time , far below the viewers ’ threshold of conscious perceptibility .
The result of displaying these imperceptible suggestions — “ Drink Coca - Cola ” and “ Hungry ? Eat Popcorn ” — was an amazing 18.1 % increase in Coca - Cola sales , and a whopping 57.8 % jump in popcorn purchases .
Thus was demonstrated the awesome power of “ subliminal advertising ” to coerce unwary buyers into making purchases they would not otherwise have
considered .
Or so goes the legend that has retained its potency for more than forty years , which includes the belief the Federal Communications Commission banned “ subliminal advertising ” from radio and television airwaves in 1974 , despite that fact that no studies had shown it to be effective , and even though its alleged efficacy was based on a fraud .
You see , Vicary lied about the results of his experiment .
When he was challenged to repeat the test by the president of the Psychological Corporation , Dr. Henry Link , Vicary ’s duplication of his original experiment produced no significant increase in popcorn or Coca - Cola sales .
Eventually Vicary confessed that he had falsified the data from his first experiments , and some critics have since expressed doubts that he actually conducted his infamous Ft. Lee experiment at all .
As usual , the media ( and thereby the public ) paid attention only to the sensational original story , and the scant coverage given to Vicary ’s later confession was ignored or quickly forgotten .
Radio and television stations began airing subliminal commercials , leading to two congressional bills to ban the practice being introduced in 1958 and 1959 ( both of which died before being voted upon ) .
In 1973 , Dr. Wilson B. Key picked up where Vicary left off , publishing Subliminal Seduction , an indictment of modern advertisements filled with hidden messages and secret symbols — messages and symbols that only Dr. Key could discern ( including the notorious example of the word “ S - E - X ” spelled out in the ice cubes pictured in a liquor advertisement ) .
The old “ subliminal advertising ” controversy was stirred up again by Dr. Key ’s book , leading to the 24 January 1974 announcement by the FCC that subliminal techniques , “ whether effective or not , ” were “ contrary to the public interest , ” and that any station employing them risked losing its broadcast license .
For neither the first nor the last time , a great deal of time and money and effort was expended on “ protecting ” the public from something that posed no danger to them .
As numerous studies over the last few decades have demonstrated , subliminal advertising does n’t work ; in fact , it never worked , and the whole premise was based on a lie from the very beginning .
James
Vicary ’s legacy was to ensure that a great many people will never be convinced otherwise , however .
Sightings :
The “ subliminal cut spurs popcorn sales ” is explicitly mentioned in a 1973 Columbo movie ( “ Double Exposure “ ) , and the acceptance of its principle as fact forms the basis of the episode .

Spending in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on environmental projects being debated in Congress right now already includes $ 100 billion in ‘ green stimulus . ’
But because of the stated preference for so - called ‘ shovel - ready ‘ infrastructure projects , long - term infrastructure projects like mass transit and a smart grid may suffer .
[ social_buttons ]
The bill already includes spending for incentives for clean energy ; the retrofitting of public buildings and public housing ; low and moderate - income home weatherization ; clean water and environmental restoration projects .
But mass transit and smart grids require the kind of planning and long - term investment not encapsulated by that tidy new buzzword , ‘ shovel - ready . ’
As it is currently written , the plan includes $ 11 billion smart grid technology that helps consumers reduce their electric bills and the demands on their local power supply by encouraging them to use less energy during peak hours .
Basically , building a smart - grid infrastructure would allow us to capitalize on an often overlooked source of new energy ; a source of energy that is cleaner than solar , wind and geothermal .
It has been said before , the cheapest source of new energy is the energy not used ( or what Amory Lovins calls “ negawatts “ ) .
Almost a third of the money in the stimulus package is tagged for efficiency measures , including about $ 10 billion to weatherize and retrofit houses to cut electricity bills for low - income Americans , almost $ 8 billion to reduce energy consumption in federal and military buildings , and some $ 7 billion in efficiency grants for state governments to dole out .
These projects are considered ‘ shovel - ready , ’ as are road projects and other upgrades , but the scale is still small .
If we can be efficient on a micro-scale , why ca n’t we be efficient on a macro one ?
“ They ’re well intentioned , and they know their infrastructure sucks , so they ’re trying to do immediate reactive management to what is a very deep , endemic problem , ” said Robert Bea , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California , Berkeley .
At issue is that 90 - day restriction stipulated by Congress , a window that was slashed in half from its original 180 - day time frame .
Grid-related projects in the stimulus package that are n’t so shove - ready include $ 8 billion to help fund construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines , bringing renewable energy from their rural sources to urban areas , where they are needed most .
“ These initiatives are a win -win for a strong economy and a healthier environment , ” said Melinda Pierce , Sierra Club ’s National Campaigns Deputy Director , in a statement .
“ They will create good jobs for people here in America and reduce our dependence on dirtier energy sources like oil and coal by promoting the shift to wind and solar power and high energy performance , low carbon cars and buildings . ”
Although some traditional electric meter companies are crying foul over standards language in the Senate stimulus package , companies like GE are embracing the push for a smart grid .
As President Obama and congressional leaders work to reconcile the two different stimulus plans and get something passed quickly , many hope the ‘ shovel - ready ’ stipulations do not prevent real infrastructure from getting passed .
“ Unfortunately the approach is a quick fix , and it ’s what we ’ve been doing for decades .
It ’s a patch - and - play approach to solving our infrastructure needs , ” says Pat Natale , executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers .

Study has always been a nightmare for every student
No one wants to skip his favorite TV shows , cricket match , and hangout with friends partying and all like this stuff which is usually forbidden by the parents .
It is also natural for them to behave like this because they are just kids
but my dear this world is not for kids .
It ’s full of tough guys who want to win the world with their hard wok and confidence so the rule here is " survival of the fittest "
and my dear you have to survive .
DON T YOU ?
So i am giving you some tips to make study simple and easy .
All I need from you is your WILL POWER ( the greatest power on earth ) .
So are you ready ..... OK
Tip no 1 .
Change your thinking about yourself
Think you are the best and you can do it .
All you have to do is to change your views about yourself
Remember
" WINNERS DON'T DO DIFFERENT THINGS , THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY . "
i will tell you this different way but i need your confidence to get started so be confident
confident like a winner
Tip no 2 .
Learn time management
You have limited time .
So you have to be very perfect in your time management
Always make time bound plan for your study , say you have to complete math ’s chapter in 1 day and English in 2 days .
Try to do it like that and if you fail to complete the first task in the allotted time do n't extend it .
Just leave it and proceed to the next task .
Divide the remaining time up to the exams in 2 phases .
give 80 % of the total time to phase 1 and rest 20 % to phase .
At the end of the phase 1 your preparations should be totally complete as you are ready for the final exams any time after that .
Next 20 % should be given for revisions , mock tests , exam rehearsals etc
Tip no 3 .
Three phase study ...
Gain more in less time
Read it with full concentration as it ’s a bit complicated .
Phase 1
Open the book
read all content of the topic with understanding try to make a story out of it , relevant or irrelevant does n’t matter but it should help you to remember the topic
for example Mr. blood eats in red and white plates ( blood has 3 types of cells , rbc , wbc and platelets .. anything like that .
its just your creativity .
take your time to make some story out of the topic .
After reading close the book try to remember the topic as much as you can
and if possible do it by speaking loudly .
It finishes your phase 1
now you can proceed to another topic ( better if another subject ) in the same manner .
Initially try to cover 5 - 6 topics in a day than you can increase gradually .
Also do n’t forget to write your story / summary part some where .
( May be in your secret note book )
Phase 2
After 5 - 6 days try to recollect what you read that day .
Remember that story .
Write all the important points about that topic .
Do n’t worry if you remember only a few points .
Now take a marker ( should be of light color only ) and read the topic again ( faster this time ) .
Mark all the points which you think are important .
After reading close the book and try to write all the important points it ends phase 2 .
Repeat this procedure for other topics in the same way
Phase 3
5 - 6 days after the phase 2 sit again , remember again and write again .
Open the book take another marker ( darker this time ) but now read only the marked portion ( faster again ) and mark the most important keywords among the already marked portion with the darker marker .
It completes phase 3
Now make a routine .
open the book every week or fortnight take a look at all the marked portion and this way you will save a lot of time and cover a lot of portion
But remember my dear our goal is not to cut time for study it ’s for saving time for more study
Because we have " limited time and unlimited course " to cover
Tip no 4 secret note book
Always maintain a note book
I call it daily revision book .
Do n’t make separate note books for different subjects , but make separate sections in the same one
Now , the content part .
Do n’t write too much .
Try to be as concise as possible and a good method is to write story part ( remember tip no 3 ) or the summary of the topic in your own words .
Write all the related key words or key points about it .
About the keywords make some easy mnemonic or formula to remember it .
Our prime objective of this note book is rapid revision of the syllabus in a very short time .
Mind you if you are taking more than 1 /2 hour to revise any topic through this note book it needs editing .
Daily and quick revision should be the goal .
Because if you want better results there is only 1 short cut .
More and more quick revisions .
So make a habit of revising more in less time and soon it will give you the desired results .

The people complaining that Wells Fargo ought not have a corporate function in Las Vegas because it benefited from the " bail out " are wrong .
There are at least three reasons .
First , Wells Fargo never needed the " bail out . "
Everybody knows that Hank Paulson very forcefully twisted the arms of even the strongest banks to take the TARP funds , because he did not want the acceptance of government capital to stigmatize the banks that needed it .
Second , Glenn Reynolds is right :
But it sounds like this is actually a reward for salespeople .
If you ’re hurting for cash , you probably want to reward salespeople who do a good job .
Or am I missing something here ?
You need to do that whether or not you are hurting for cash .
Third , Vegas is actually a very cheap place to host a big meeting , sales or otherwise .
It is possible for large groups to negotiate the price on lodging down to the cost of a night at Holiday Inn Express in Akron , and there are a huge number of flights from just about every other big city in the country , which makes the airfare quite competitive .
All in , Vegas is a significantly less expensive to convene a national business meeting than big cities .
Wells Fargo has , in fact , directly accused the Associated Press of misleading its readers .
Good for them .

This systems seems really good .
You cast your vote using a computer , but the computer prints out a paper document .
This prevents the ambiguity that inevitably occurs when users directly fill out paper ballots , such as when a voter fills in one circle by mistake and then puts an X through it .
The resulting paper ballot shows the choices the voter made and includes a bar code for optical scanning .
The software is entirely open source .
It uses off - the - shelf , inexpensive components .
By the way , open source paper ballots is the leading idea in the Tech Policy section of Change.org ’s contest .

Feb. 3 , 2009  -- President Obama acknowledged that it has been an embarrassing day for his administration , taking responsibility for three of his high - level nominees ' withdrawing their names because of tax troubles .
" Anytime one of your nominees pulls out , that 's an issue and , you know , as I 've said publicly , you know , ultimately , I take responsibility for the situation that we 're in , " Obama said in an interview today in the Oval Office with ABC News ' Charles Gibson , referring to Tom Daschle .
" I think that all of these were honest mistakes , but ultimately , there 's no excuse for them . "
When asked by Gibson if it has been an embarrassing day for the White House , Obama said : " I think it has . "
Daschle , Obama 's choice for secretary of Health and Human Services , withdrew his nomination because of a failure to pay $ 140,000 in income taxes , while the president 's chief enforcement officer also stepped aside today for similar reasons .
Obama said this sends the wrong message about responsibility .
" We do n't have two sets of rules here , " he said .
" The most important thing , from my perspective , is making sure that the American people understand we do n't have two sets of rules here , that everybody has responsibilities .
In this situation , I take responsibility for it . "
Obama told Gibson he 's angry that news of his tax - troubled appointees has taken the focus away from the goal of passing the economic stimulus bill and putting Americans back to work .
" We can't afford glitches , because right now , what I should be spending time talking to you about is how we 're going to put 3 [ million ] to 4 million people back to work , " Obama said .
" This is a self - induced injury that I 'm angry about , and we 're going to make sure we get it fixed . "
Despite these challenges , the new president said that he is " surprisingly comfortable in the job . "
" I think I 've got a great staff , " Obama said .
" We 've got a great team .
The challenges are big ... not just an immediate economic crisis but a long - term budget issue in terms of the amount of debt that we 're accumulating .
Trying to square all those circles is a challenge .
But one thing that I 'm absolutely convinced about is that you want to be president when you 've got big problems .
If things are going to go smoothly , then this is just another nice home office . "
Obama Says Economy In ' Desperate Straits '
Obama , who has been meeting with congressional leaders to rally bipartisan support for the economic stimulus bill , said that swiftly passing the $ 819 billion bill was " the right thing to do " to create jobs and bring relief to working families .
" We 've got provisions to help states who are seeing record numbers of people unemployed , providing them unemployment insurance , food stamps , making sure that they do n't lose their health care , " Obama said .
" The economy is in desperate straits .
What I wo n't do is adopt the same economic theories that helped land us in the worst economy since the Great Depression . "
Republicans have criticized the bill , calling for more tax cuts , mortgage relief and more investment in infrastructure instead of in provisions they say are not stimulative but social policy .
The president defended the spending and scope of the bill .
" The overwhelming bulk of the package is sound ... most of the programs that have been criticized as part of this package amount to less than 1 percent of the overall package .
And it makes for good copy , but here 's the thing ; we can't afford to play the usual politics at a time when the economy continues to worsen . "
The $ 819 billion package that passed in the House last week did not receive a single Republican vote .
Obama said he remains determined to reconcile the House and Senate bills quickly .
" I 'm less concerned about bipartisanship for bipartisanship 's sake , " Obama told Gibson .
" I 'm interested in solving the problem for the American people as quickly as possible .
And I think that we have an obligation to make sure this money is spent wisely .
I want this thing to move through the Senate .
I want the House and the Senate bills to be reconciled . "

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Is your driver ’s license a total waste of wallet space , not to mention an annoying reminder of your worst hair day ever ?
Why not convert it into a working debit card and save money at the pump at the same time ?
If you live in one of 24 states that attach a magnetic stripe to their driver ’s licenses , you can easily transform yours into a debit card — and save three cents or more per gallon at the gas pump in the process — by registering it at Rollbackprice.com .
The nifty card trick is the brainchild of National Payment Card , a 5 - year - old debit payment middleman ( “ intermediate service provider ” ) based in Coconut Creek , Fla .
Bypassing the card networks and their fees
NPC figured out a way to bypass the increasingly costly national bank - owned credit / debit card networks ( Honor , Star , Interlink and others ) and offer debit card processing through the direct deposit Automated Clearing House ( ACH ) network to gas stations and convenience stores at a fraction of the cost .
According to the National Association of Convenience Stores ( NACS ) , credit and debit card fees among its members rose from 4.8 percent of gross profit in 2002 to 7.6 percent in 2006 .
The total cost of convenience store card fees in 2006 , $ 6.6 billion , far exceeded the industry ’s total profits of $ 4.8 billion , meaning the credit card industry made more from the stores than the store owners themselves .
There are 24 states where a driver ’s license can be turned into a debit card
Alabama , Arkansas , Arizona , California , Colorado , Florida , Iowa , Kansas , Louisiana , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Mississippi , Montana , New Hampshire , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Texas , Vermont , Virginia and Wisconsin all allow driver ’s licenses to be turned into a debit card .
“ Because we charge a flat - rate fee of 17 cents as opposed to a percentage - based fee ; instead of paying 10 cents a gallon for credit card fees , with us the merchant pays 1.7 cents , ” says Joe Randazza , NACS president and CEO .
The gas station - convenience store industry was one of the few markets price - sensitive enough that a few pennies per gallon savings would serve as sufficient incentive for consumers , especially when gas topped $ 4 nationally .
“ We change consumer behavior by rolling the price at the pump back three cents immediately , ” Randazza explains .
” The merchant is then able to use the money they would normally be paying Visa or MasterCard to fund the ( consumer ’s ) reward . ”
Randazza says consumers can save anywhere from three to 12 cents a gallon by using their driver ’s license as a debit card , depending on the station .
But the real driving force behind the NPC business model is the savings realized by merchants who have seen their margins shrink drastically in the past few years , due in large part to higher interchange fees for card transactions .
By taking a low flat fee instead of a percentage , NPC and its merchants come out ahead .
“ We picked a vertical market — the gas station - convenience store industry — with 115,000 transactions on a daily basis at 140,000 locations , ” Randazza says .
“ We do n’t care about the size of the basket , we care about the shopping frequency . ”
How it works
NPC ’s secure online driver ’s license registration links your personal identifiers ( name , address , phone , e-mail address , birth date and driver ’s license number ) to your checking account with a four - digit PIN of your choosing .
Once registered , your license and PIN work just like a debit card at participating merchants , initiating an ACH e-check funds transfer from your checking account to complete your purchase .
The license is used only as an access device to verify your identity ; no financial information is stored on or taken from the mag stripe .
Nor are the issuing states involved in any way ; their licenses are being used merely to verify identification , just as if you were writing a check .
As for security , the potential for fraud is low because no consumer financial information is actually stored on the driver ’s license itself .
The NPC system limits weekly withdrawals to $ 300 and automatically disallows a purchase after three failed PIN entries .
Should fraud occur , the consumer ’s liability would be limited to $ 50 , standard for debit cards .
Randazza says piggybacking on the functionality of state - issued mag - stripe driver ’s licenses enabled his company to overcome one of the biggest hurdles to new payment providers .
“ How can you put another card into consumers ’ pockets ? ” he says .
“ That has always been difficult .
Gas companies failed .
Discover failed .
Diners Club failed . ”
There are limits to the license program .
Only convenience stores and gas stations that process via the NPC network will accept your driver ’s license as a debit card ; a list of participating vendors is available on the Rollback Price site .
Grocery , drug stores next in line
But NPC is about to take its end - around run to a new level as it rolls out its national program , which turns loyalty and membership cards into instant debit cards for use nationwide .
In addition to gas stations and convenience stores , the company plans to expand into supermarkets and drug stores in the future , two more vertical markets with tight margins and high daily transaction counts .
“ We started marketing the system in 2006 , and it has only been in the last six months that we have had the ability to gain access to an open network , ” says Randazza .
“ Now we ’re on the debit rail , so now our card is able to be accepted at any place a debit card is accepted .
We are now a national program and it is about to take off like gangbusters .
We will be an ‘ overnight success ’ after four years . ”
Yesterday I published a blind analysis of the so called " Clickjacking protection " included in IE8 RC1 .
" Blind " because , hype aside , there was no technical documentation available , even if the feature was targeted to web developers who -- in order to protect their users -- should modify the way their pages are served .
After a while , Microsoft 's David Ross sent me an email confirming that my wild guesses about IE8's approach , its scope and its limitations were indeed correct .
The only information obviously missing from my " prophetic " description was the real name of the " X - I - Do - Not - Want - To - Be - Framed - Across - Domains " HTTP header to be sent before the sensible pages , and today this little mystery has been finally unveiled by Eric Lawrence on the IE Blog :
Web developers can send a HTTP response header named X - FRAME - OPTIONS with HTML pages to restrict how the page may be framed .
If the X - FRAME - OPTIONS value contains the token DENY , IE8 will prevent the page from rendering if it will be contained within a frame .
If the value contains the token SAMEORIGIN , IE will block rendering only if the origin of the top level - browsing - context is different than the origin of the content containing the X - FRAME - OPTIONS directive .
For instance , if http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains a DENY directive , that page will not render in a subframe , no matter where the parent frame is located .
In contrast , if the X - FRAME - OPTIONS directive contains the SAMEORIGIN token , the page may be framed by any page from the exact http://shop.example.com origin .
As I had anticipated , IE8's " clickjacking protection " is just an alternate scriptless way to perform frame busting , a well known and simple technique to prevent a page from being " framed " in another page and therefore becoming an easy UI Redressing target .
Microsoft had to follow its own special path because the traditional JavaScript implementation can be easily circumvented on IE , e.g. by loading the targeted page inside an < IFRAME SECURITY=restricted > element .
But the other major browsers are equally " protected " ( if we can call " browser protection " something relying on the good will and education of web authors ) by " standard " frame busting .
Therefore , slogans like " the first browser to counter this type of threat " ( James Pratt , Microsoft senior product manager ) were marketspeak at its best .
Furthermore , this approach is useless against Clickjacking in its original " historical " meaning , i.e. those attacks involving Flash applets and other kinds of plugin embeddings which led Robert " RSnake " Hansen and Jeremiah Grossman to invent the successful buzzword .
However in my post I had also written that having such a scriptless alternative as a cross - browser option would be nice :
I do believe that a declarative approach to control subdocument requests is an excellent idea : otherwise I would n't have included the SUB pseudo - method in ABE Rules Specification ( pdf ) .
Moreover , as soon as I 've got some less blurry info ( David Ross , I know you 're listening , why do n't you drop me a line ? ) , I 'll be happy to immediately implement a compatible feature in NoScript and lobby Mozilla for inclusion in Firefox 3.1 .
David kindly answered
I think this would be fantastic and itâ€™s a great place to start building some bridges .
I agree , in facts I 've filed an enhancement request for Firefox , and I 'm already working to release a NoScript development build featuring X - FRAME - OPTIONS support : that 's relatively easy , since I can hook in the work I 'm already doing for the ABE module .
( Update 2009 - 29- 01 : I just released NoScript 1.8.9.9 development build , featuring full experimental X - FRAME - OPTIONS compatibility support ) .
It 's worth noticing , though , that this is just a cross - browser compatibility effort : neither Firefox nor NoScript really need this feature .
Traditional JavaScript - based frame busting works fine in Firefox , giving it the same degree of ( modest ) " protection " as IE8 .
NoScript users , on the other hand , are already fully protected , because ClearClick is the one and only countermeasure which works against any type of Clickjacking ( frame or embed based ) , no matter if web sites cooperate or not .
Speaking of NoScript , I 've got a small but important correction to the otherwise excellent article Robert McMillan wrote for PC World ( IDG News ) yesterday :
Because clickjacking requires scripting , the attack does n't work when NoScript is enabled .
This statement is wrong twice :
Clickjacking does not require scripting : JavaScript might make the attacker 's life easier , but it 's not indispensable to throw an attack .
NoScript does not need scripting to be disabled in order to protect its users against Clickjacking : its exclusive ClearClick anti-Clickjacking technology works independently from script blocking .
That 's why NoScript can be recommended to anyone , even to grandma who 's not inclined to block JavaScript : albeit I do not encourage using NoScript 's " Allow Scripts Globally " command because the default deny policy is your best first - line defense , many additional protection features such as Anti-XSS filters and ClearClick still remain active even when JavaScript is enabled , providing the safest web experience available in any browser .
If I would have told you even a year ago that we would be seeing the Southern California median home price at $ 285,000 many of you would have laughed and rightfully so .
Yet we now know this will be the worst recession since World War II , 10 major indicators now tell us this .
Even the most ardent and loyal bubble believers probably had a hard time envisioning a correction like the one we are experiencing .
I know .
I was one of them .
As I look back at some of my articles , it was n’t that I did n’t see a steep correction occurring but the current velocity of the decline has taken my breath away like reaching the apex of a rollercoaster only to freefall .
So what pushed California over the edge in 2008 ?
After all , many of the factors hitting the market today were present in 2007 .
Why this year ?
It is hard to put your finger on simply one cause for this correction .
I ’ll give you a few that really accelerated the decline :
( a) Toxic mortgages like option ARMs took away the leverage borrowers once had .
( b) California tipped into a more deep recession than the overall national economy .
( c) The bubble simply collapsed on its own weight .
(d) Mortgage resets and price declines provided no exit for over leveraged borrowers .
(e) Consumer psychology shifted .
With fears of the economy and more people having their religious bubble moment , the urgent desire to buy is now gone .
( f) Stockpiles of foreclosed and REO homes .
These combined with the awful global news combined to make a perfect storm .
As people are focusing on more macro issues , I decided to do a quick check in Los Angeles county to see what is happening in specific niche markets .
Would you believe it that 3 zip codes now have prices in the five - figure range ?
Or what about 15 zip codes with prices under $ 200,000 ?
Let us first take a look at the list :
81 percent decline !
Okay , this is a small obscure area way off in the mountains with approximately 3,000 people but seeing a 81 percent decline is stunning .
But look at Palmdale and Lancaster .
These areas have been absolutely hammered .
Many of the home sales in these areas were to commuters looking for the pleasure of homeownership during the bubble heyday yet many of these buyers never had the ability to purchase in metro L.A. or surrounding cities .
Many brave souls decided to sacrifice a mind - numbing commute for the ability of owning a home .
I look at these price declines and it only makes me reflect at the power of mania in epic bubbles .
Logic is thrown out the window .
I still believe that we wo n’t see a housing bottom until 2011 although given the current speed and velocity of the price correction , we may actually see trough prices in 2010 yet they will carry over into 2011 .
I ’m baffled by people putting a bottom on 2010 thinking it will somehow bounce like a basketball after it reaches that price .
It wo n’t .
I think we ’ll be looking at prices moving sideways essentially like Japan given that we are emulating virtually every policy move they did which led up to their lost decade (s ) .
You may argue that many of these areas are unique .
Yet in the list we also have a zip code in Long Beach , a few in Los Angeles , and Hawaiian Gardens .
For anyone that truly understands Los Angeles , the difference in one or two numbers in a zip code is a world of a difference .
Los Angeles County is the most populated county in the state with nearly 10,000,000 people .
In this giant metropolis we have 88 cities and 270 zip codes .
Cities like Los Angeles and Long Beach have multiple zip codes given their geographic size and large populations .
Another interesting data point that I found looking at the 270 zip codes is this startling fact :
15 zip codes have now witnessed 50 + % declines
Many more zip codes have already breached the 50 percent decline from their peak but on a year over basis , are down 40 percent .
You may be thinking that this is only hitting more lower priced areas .
That is not the case .
This bubble is an equal opportunity price destroyer :
How appropriate that Calabasas , home to uber - toxic - mortgage poster child Countrywide is now seeing a 50 percent decline .
Let us now look at 3 homes in the five - figure zip codes to see what we can get when we go bottom fishing .
Today we salute you five - figure priced homes in L.A. County with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Lake Hughes –
The bubble will find you even in the mountains
L.A. County has some random zip codes and areas that many people would n’t suspect as part of the county .
Lake Hughes is one of those .
Located up in the Angeles National Forest , this is a very different world from the concrete jungle that is Los Angeles .
This is a very small community and how prices got to where they did is beyond me .
How far is Lake Hughes from L.A. ?
67 miles in L.A. traffic is like 300 miles anywhere else in the country .
You might as well purchase a helicopter to commute .
I doubt you ’d be community from here anyways .
The above home is currently a foreclosure with 1 bedroom on 964 square foot of land .
The current asking price is $ 97,500 .
Yes , five - figure homes in L.A. County are here and we ’re only at the end of 2008 .
Palmdale – Party like its 1996
The Lake Hughes property is more of an anomaly but here we get into our more bread and butter Real Homes of Genius .
This home is a 3 bedroom and 2 baths home sitting on a rather large 1,595 square feet .
It has a gigantic lot size of 22,000 square feet .
I thought they were n’t making anymore land in L.A. County ?
This home can be all yours for the wonderful price of $ 39,900 .
That ’s right .
For the price of a new car you can call this place , home .
Now before you go running off to buy this place let us dig up some sales history here :
09/30/2008 : $ 101,530 *
01/06/1997 : $ 71,000
06/24/1996 : $ 40,000
Party like its 1996 !
We ’ve rolled back prices to the bottom of the previous Southern California housing bubble !
Looks like the bank took this place back in September of 2008 when someone decided to jump on the mortgage equity withdrawal train .
Party is over folks .
Lancaster – Nothing says happy holidays like boards on the window
Before you start feeling sorry for these homes , you need to dig into the details and you ’ll realize people were digging into their homes like ATM machines .
This Lancaster home has 3 beds and 2 baths and is situated on 1,572 square feet .
Big homes for bargain prices .
The current list price of $ 61,750 may seem cheap , but I found a dozen more in this area in the $ 40 and $ 50 thousand range .
Prices now matter and people are paying close attention .
I love how the ad tells us this is a “ contractors special ” since the windows are boarded up and the grass is yellow like the blistering Lancaster sun in the summer .
If you run the numbers , this place is selling for $ 39 a square foot !
At the peak you were lucky to find faux granite countertop for this price .
I love how the ad also tells us this place is “ centrally located ” – centrally located to what is the logical follow - up question .
Let us look at some price history :
Sale History
10/24/2008 : $ 101,156
04/23/1997 : $ 46,000
07/18/1996 : $ 42,630
Someone got busy either refinancing or pulling equity out .
Given the last price , I would think it was an equity withdrawal situation .
If you look at many homes in Palmdale and Lancaster you ’ll see a similar pattern .
Some foreclosed homes will have a sale price of say $ 30,000 in 1999 then you ’ll see a foreclosure noticed posted , the home is for sale at $ 40,000 yet the price at which the lender took it back was at $ 110,000 .
With so much economic news being thrown around , it is easy to sometimes forget what caused the bubble .
Look at these homes and you ’ll completely understand why things are unfolding as they are .
Today we salute you L.A. County five - figure homes with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

It is my great pleasure to see this little essay in print .
Written and presented more than five years ago , it was welcomed at the time by scholars with a background in Austrian economics .
However , it was not understood and was rejected by those who did not have this background .
In order to reach a broader audience , a short essay would simply not do .
I therefore decided not to publish Deflation and Liberty and started to work on The Ethics of Money Production , a book - length presentation of the argument , which has just become available from the Mises Institute .
In the present crisis , the citizens of the United States have to make an important choice .
They can support a policy designed to perpetuate our current fiat - money system and the sorry state of banking and of financial markets that it logically entails .
Or they can support a policy designed to reintroduce a free market in money and finance .
This latter policy requires the government to keep its hands off .
It should not produce money , nor should it appoint a special agency to produce money .
It should not force the citizens to use fiat money by imposing legal - tender laws .
It should not regulate banking and should not regulate the financial markets .
It should not try to fix the interest rate , the prices of financial titles , or commodity prices .
Clearly , these measures are radical by present - day standards , and they are not likely to find sufficient support .
But they lack support out of ignorance and fear .
We are told by virtually all the experts on money and finance — the central bankers and most university professors — that the crisis hits us despite the best efforts of the Fed ; that money , banking , and financial markets are not meant to be free , because they end up in disarray despite the massive presence of the government as a financial agent , as a regulator , and as money producer ; that our monetary system provides us with great benefits that we would be foolish not to preserve .
Those same experts therefore urge us to give the government an even greater presence in the financial markets , to increase its regulatory powers , and to encourage even more money production to be used for bailouts .
However , all of these contentions are wrong , as economists have demonstrated again and again since the times of Adam Smith and David Ricardo .
A paper - money system is not beneficial from an overall point of view .
It does not create real resources on which our welfare depends .
It merely distributes the existing resources in a different manner ; some people gain , others lose .
It is a system that makes banks and financial markets vulnerable , because it induces them to economize on the essential safety valves of business : cash and equity .
Why hold any substantial cash balances if the central bank stands ready to lend you any amount that might be needed , at a moment 's notice ?
Why use your own money if you can finance your investments with cheap credit from the printing press ?
To raise these questions is to answer them .
The crisis did not hit us despite the presence of our monetary and financial authorities .
It hit us because of them .
Then there is the fear factor .
If we follow a hands - off policy , the majority of experts tell us , the banking industry , the financial markets , and much of the rest of the economy will be wiped out in a bottomless deflationary spiral .
The present essay argues that this is a half - truth .
It is true that without further government intervention there would be a deflationary spiral .
It is not true that this spiral would be bottomless and wipe out the economy .
It would not be a mortal threat to the lives and the welfare of the general population .
It destroys essentially those companies and industries that live a parasitical existence at the expense of the rest of the economy , and which owe their existence to our present fiat - money system .
Even in the short run , therefore , deflation reduces our real incomes only within rather narrow limits .
And it will clear the ground for very substantial growth rates in the medium and long run .
We should not be afraid of deflation .
We should love it as much as our liberties .
Jörg Guido Hülsmann Angers , France
I .
The 20th century has been the century of omnipotent government .
In some countries , totalitarian governments have established themselves in one stroke through revolutions — apparently a bad strategy , for none of these governments exists any more .
But in other countries , totalitarianism has not sprung into life full - fledged like Venus from the waves .
In the United States and in virtually all the western European countries , government has grown slowly but steadily , and if unchecked this growth will make it totalitarian one day , even though this day seems to be far removed from our present .
The fact is that in all western countries the growth of government has been faster over the last 100 years than the growth of the economy .
Its most conspicuous manifestations are the welfare state and of the warfare state .
[ 1 ]
Now the growth of the welfare - warfare state would not have been possible without inflation , which for the purposes of our study we can define as the growth of the supply of base money and of financial titles that are redeemable into base money on demand .
[ 2 ]
The production of ever - new quantities of paper dollars and the creation of ever - new credit facilities at the Federal Reserve have provided the liquidity for an even greater expansion of bank - created demand deposits and other money substitutes , which in turn allowed for an unparalleled expansion of public debt .
US public debt is currently ( December 2002 ) at some 6.2 trillion dollars , up from under 2 trillion at the beginning of the 1980s , and less than 1 trillion before the era of the paper dollar set in when President Nixon closed the gold window in the early 1970s .
The link between the paper dollar and the exponential expansion of public debt is well known .
From the point of view of the creditors , the federal government controls the Federal Reserve — the monopoly producer of paper dollars — and it can therefore never go bankrupt .
If necessary , the federal government can have any quantity of dollars printed to pay back its debt .
Buying government bonds is thus backed up with a security that no other debtor can offer .
And the federal government can constantly expand its activities and finance them through additional debt even if there is no prospect at all that these debts will ever be paid back out of tax revenues .
The result is seemingly unchecked growth of those governments that control the production of paper money .
Among the many causes that coincided in bringing about this state of affairs is a certain lack of resistance on the part of professional economists .
In the present essay I will deal with a wrong idea that has prevented many economists and other intellectuals from fighting inflation with the necessary determination .
Most economists backed off from opposing inflation precisely when it was needed most , namely , at the few junctures of history when the inflationary system was about to collapse .
Rather than impartially analyzing the event , they started fearing deflation more than inflation , and thus ended up supporting reflation — which in fact is nothing but further inflation . [ 3 ]
" Among the many causes that coincided in bringing about this state of affairs is a certain lack of resistance on the part of professional economists . "
The United States of America has experienced two such junctures : the years of the Great Depression and the little depression we are facing right now in the wake of the first global stock - market boom .
Today again , the deflationary collapse of our monetary system is a very real possibility .
In November 2002 , officials of the Federal Reserve ( Greenspan , Bernanke ) and of the Bank of England ( Bean ) proclaimed there would be no limit to the amount of money they would print to fend off deflation .
These plans reflect what today is widely regarded as orthodoxy in monetary matters .
Even many critics of the inflationary policies of the past concede that , under present circumstances , some inflation might be beneficial , if it is used to combat deflation .
Some of them point out that there is not yet any deflation , and that therefore there is no need to intensify the use of the printing press .
But on the other hand they agree in principle that if a major deflation set in , there would be a political need for more spending , and that , to finance the increased spending , the governments should incur more debts and that the central banks should print more money . [ 4 ]
Such views have a certain prominence even among Austrian economists .
Ludwig von Mises , Hans Sennholz , Murray Rothbard , and other Austrians are known for their intransigent opposition to inflation .
But only Sennholz did not flinch from praising deflation and depression when it came to abolishing fiat money and putting a sound money system in its place .
By contrast , Mises and Rothbard championed deflation only to the extent it accelerated the readjustment of the economy in a bust that followed a period of inflationary boom .
But they explicitly ( Mises ) and implicitly ( Rothbard ) sought to avoid deflation in all other contexts .
In particular , when it came to monetary reform , both Mises and Rothbard championed schemes to redefine a paper currency 's price of gold to restore convertibility . [ 5 ]
The main weakness of this scheme is that it implies that the reform process be directed by the very institutions and persons whom the reform is supposed to make more or less superfluous .
It is also questionable whether our monetary authorities can legitimately use their gold reserves to salvage their paper money .
In fact , they have come to control these reserves through a confiscatory coup , and it is therefore not at all clear how plans for monetary reform à la Mises and Rothbard can be squared with the libertarian legal or moral principles that Rothbard champions in other works .
" The truth is that deflation has become the scapegoat of the economics profession .
It is not analyzed , but derided . "
But there is also another issue that needs to be addressed : what is actually wrong with deflating the money supply , from an economic point of view ?
This question will be at center stage here , which can fortunately build on Rothbard 's analysis of deflation , which demonstrated in particular the beneficial role that deflation can have in speeding up the readjustment of the productive structure after a financial crisis .
But no economist seems to have been interested in further pursuing the sober analysis of the impact of deflation on the market process , and of its social and political consequences .
The truth is that deflation has become the scapegoat of the economics profession .
It is not analyzed , but derided .
One hundred years of pro-inflation propaganda have created a quasi-total agreement on the issue . [ 6 ]
Wherever we turn , deflation is uniformly presented in bad terms , and each writer hurries to present the fight against deflation as the bare minimum of economic statesmanship .
Economists who otherwise cannot agree on any subject are happy to find common ground in the heartfelt condemnation of deflation .
In their eyes , the case against deflation is so clear that they do not even bother about it .
The libraries of our universities contain hundreds of books splitting hairs about unemployment , business cycles , and so on .
But they rarely feature a monograph on deflation .
Its evilness is beyond dispute . [ 7 ]
Yet this silent accord stands on shaky ground .
A frank and enthusiastic endorsement of deflation is , at any rate in our time , one of the most important requirements to safeguard the future of liberty .
II .
When it comes to matters of money and banking , all practical political issues ultimately hinge on one central question : can one improve or deteriorate the state of an economy by increasing or decreasing the quantity of money ? [ 8 ]
Aristotle said that money was no part of the wealth of a nation because it was simply a medium of exchange in inter-regional trade , and the authority of his opinion thoroughly marked medieval thought on money .
Scholastic scholars therefore spent no time enquiring about the benefits that changes of the money supply could have for the economy .
The relevant issue in their eyes was the legitimacy of debasements , because they saw that this was an important issue of distributive justice . [ 9 ]
And after the birth of economic science in the 18th century , the classical economists too did not deny this essential point .
David Hume , Adam Smith , and Étienne de Condillac observed that money is neither a consumers ' good nor a producers ' good and that , therefore , its quantity is irrelevant for the wealth of a nation . [ 10 ]
This crucial insight would also inspire the intellectual battles of the next four or five generations of economists — men such as Jean - Baptiste Say , David Ricardo , John Stuart Mill , Frédéric Bastiat , and Carl Menger — who constantly made the case for sound money .
As a result , the Western world had much more sound money in the 19th century than in the 20th century .
Large strata of the population paid and were paid in coins made out of precious metals , especially out of gold and silver .
It was money that made these citizens , however humble their social status , sovereign in monetary affairs .
The art of coinage flourished and produced coins that could be authenticated by every market participant .
Some present - day libertarians harbor a romantic picture of these days of the classical gold standard .
And it is true that it was the golden age of monetary institutions in the West , especially when we compare them with our own time , in which the monetary equivalent of alchemy has risen to the status of orthodoxy .
But it is also true that western monetary institutions in the era of the classical gold standard were far from being perfect .
Governments still enjoyed monopoly power in the field of coinage , a remnant of the medieval regalia privileges that prevented the discovery of better coins and coin systems through entrepreneurial competition .
Governments frequently intervened in the production of money through price - control schemes , which they camouflaged with the pompous name of bimetallism .
They actively promoted fractional - reserve banking , which promised ever - new funds for the public treasury .
And they promoted the emergence of central banking through special monopoly charters for a few privileged banks .
The overall result of these laws was to facilitate the introduction of inflationary paper currencies and to drive specie out of circulation .
At the beginning of the 19th century , most of Europe , insofar as it knew monetary exchange at all , used paper currencies . [ 11 ]
And during the remainder of that century , things did not change much .
England alone among the major nations was on the gold standard during the greater part of the 19th century , and banknotes of the Bank of England played a much greater role in monetary exchanges than specie — in fact , the reserve ratio of the Bank seems to have been around 3 percent for most of the time , and occasionally it was even lower . [ 12 ]
In short , the monetary constitutions of the 19th century were not perfect , and neither would the monetary thought of the classical economists satisfy us today . [ 13 ]
David Hume believed that inflation could stimulate production in the short run .
Adam Smith believed that inflation in the form of credit expansion was beneficial if it was backed up with a corresponding amount of real goods , and Jean - Baptiste Say similarly endorsed expansions of the quantity of money that accommodated the needs of commerce .
Smith and Ricardo suggested increasing the wealth of the nation by substituting inherently valueless paper tickets for metallic money .
John Stuart Mill championed the notion that sound money means money of stable value .
These errors in the monetary thought of Hume , Smith , Ricardo , and Mill were of course almost negligible in comparison to their central insight , to repeat , that the wealth of a nation does not depend on changes in the quantity of money .
But eventually a new generation of students , infected with the virus of statism — worship of the state — brushed over that central insight , and thus the errors of the classical economists , rather than their science , triumphed in the 20th century .
Men such as Irving Fisher , Knut Wicksell , Karl Helfferich , Friedrich Bendixen , Gustav Cassel , and especially John Maynard Keynes set out on a relentless campaign against the gold standard .
These champions of inflation conceded the insight of the classical economists that the wealth of a nation did not depend on its money supply , but they argued that this was true only in the long run .
In the short run , the printing press could work wonders .
It could reduce unemployment and stimulate production and economic growth .
Who could reject such a horn of plenty ?
And why ?
Most economists point out the costs of inflation in terms of loss of purchasing power — estimates run as high as a 98 percent reduction of the US dollar 's purchasing power since the Federal Reserve took control of the money supply .
What is less well known are the concomitant effects of the century - long great dollar inflation .
Paper money has produced several great crises , each of which turned out to be more severe than the preceding one .
Moreover , paper money has completely transformed the financial structure of the western economies .
At the beginning of the 20th century , most firms and industrial corporations were financed out of their revenues , and banks and other financial intermediaries played only a subordinate role .
Today , the picture has been reversed , and the most fundamental reason for this reversal is paper money .
Paper money has caused an unprecedented increase of debt on all levels : government , corporate , and individual .
It has financed the growth of the state on all levels , federal , state , and local .
It thus has become the technical foundation for the totalitarian menace of our day .
" Paper money … has become the technical foundation for the totalitarian menace of our day . "
In the light of these long - term consequences of inflation , its alleged short - run benefits lose much of their attractiveness .
But the great irony is that even these short - run benefits in terms of employment and growth are illusory .
Sober reflection shows that there are no systematic short - run benefits of inflation at all .
In other words , whatever benefits might result from inflation are largely the accidental result of inflation hitting a particularly favorable set of circumstances , and we have no reason to assume that these accidental benefits are more likely to occur than accidental harm — quite to the contrary !
The main impact of inflation is to bring about a redistribution of resources .
There are therefore short - run benefits for certain members of society , but these benefits are balanced by short - run losses for other citizens .
The great French economist Frédéric Bastiat made the quite general point that the visible blessings that result from government intervention into the market economy are in fact only one set of consequences that follow from this intervention .
But there is another set of consequences that the government does not like to talk about because they demonstrate the futility of the intervention .
When the government taxes its citizens to give subsidies to a steel producer , the benefits to the steel firm , its employees , and stockholders are patent .
But other interests have suffered from the intervention .
In particular , the taxpayers have less money to patronize other businesses .
And these other businesses and their customers are also harmed by the policy because the steel firm is now able to pay higher wages and higher rents , thus bidding away the factors of production that are also needed in other branches of industry .
And so it is with inflation .
There is absolutely no reason why an increase in the quantity of money should create more rather than less growth .
It is true that the firms who receive money fresh from the printing press are thereby benefited .
But other firms are harmed by the very same fact because they can no longer pay the higher prices for wages and rents that the privileged firm can now pay .
And all other owners of money , whether they are entrepreneurs or workers , are harmed too , because their money now has a lower purchasing power than it would otherwise have had .
" There is absolutely no reason why an increase in the quantity of money should create more rather than less growth . "
Similarly , there is no reason why inflation should ever reduce rather than increase unemployment .
People become unemployed or remain unemployed when they do not wish to work , or if they are forcibly prevented from working for the wage rate an employer is willing to pay .
Inflation does not change this fact .
What inflation does is to reduce the purchasing power of each money unit .
If the workers anticipate these effects , they will ask for higher nominal wages as a compensation for the loss of purchasing power .
In this case , inflation has no effect on unemployment .
Quite to the contrary , it can even have negative effects , namely , if the workers overestimate the inflation - induced reduction of their real wages and thus ask for wage - rate increases that bring about even more unemployment .
Only if they do not know that the quantity of money has been increased to lure them into business at current wage rates will they consent to work rather than remaining unemployed .
All plans to reduce unemployment through inflation therefore boil down to fooling the workers — a childish strategy , to say the least . [ 14 ]
For the same reason , inflation is no remedy for the problem of sticky wages — that is , for the problem of coercive labor unions .
Wages are sticky only to the extent that the workers choose not to work .
But the crucial question is , how long can they afford not to work ?
And the answer to this question is that this period is constrained within the very narrow limits of their savings .
As soon as a worker 's personal savings are exhausted , he willy - nilly starts offering his services even at lower wage rates .
It follows that in a free labor market , wages are sufficiently flexible at any point of time .
Stickiness comes into play only as a result of government intervention , in particular in the form of ( a ) tax - financed unemployment relief and of ( b ) legislation giving the labor unions a monopoly of the labor supply .
" All plans to reduce unemployment through inflation therefore boil down to fooling the workers — a childish strategy , to say the least . "
Since we are not concerned here with questions of labor economics , we can directly turn to the connection between employment and monetary policy .
Does inflation solve the problem of sticky wages ?
The answer is in the negative , and for the same reasons we pointed out above .
Inflation can overcome the problem of sticky wages only to the extent that the paper - money producers can surprise the labor unions .
To the extent that the latter anticipate the moves of the masters of the printing press , inflation will either not reduce unemployment at all , or even increase it further . [ 15 ]
III .
From the standpoint of the commonly shared interests of all members of society , the quantity of money is irrelevant .
Any quantity of money provides all the services that indirect exchange can possibly provide , both in the long run and in the short run .
This fact is the unshakable starting point for any sound reflection on monetary matters .
And it is the most important criterion when it comes to dealing with deflation .
In light of the principle discovered by the classical economists , we can say that deflation is certainly not what it is commonly alleged to be : a curse for all members of society .
Deflation is a monetary phenomenon , and as such it does affect the distribution of wealth among the individuals and various strata of society , as well as the relative importance of the different branches of industry .
But it does not affect the aggregate wealth of society .
Deflation is a drastic reduction of the quantity of money or of money substitutes , and it entails a precipitous decline of money prices .
Such an event , be it ever so dramatic for a great number of individuals , is most certainly not a mortal threat for society as a whole . [ 16 ]
Imagine if all prices were to drop tomorrow by 50 percent .
Would this affect our ability to feed , cloth , shelter , and transport ourselves ?
It would not , because the disappearance of money is not paralleled by a disappearance of the physical structure of production .
In a very dramatic deflation , there is much less money around than there used to be , and thus we cannot sell our products and services at the same money prices as before .
But our tools , our machines , the streets , the cars and trucks , our crops and our food supplies — all this is still in place .
And thus we can go on producing , and even producing profitably , because profit does not depend on the level of money prices at which we sell , but on the difference between the prices at which we sell and the prices at which we buy .
In a deflation , both sets of prices drop , and as a consequence for - profit production can go on .
There is only one fundamental change that deflation brings about .
It radically modifies the structure of ownership .
Firms financed per credits go bankrupt because at the lower level of prices they can no longer pay back the credits they had incurred without anticipating the deflation .
Private households with mortgages and other considerable debts to pay back go bankrupt , because with the decline of money prices their monetary income declines , too , whereas their debts remain at the nominal level .
The very attempt to liquidate assets to pay back debt entails a further reduction of the value of those assets , thus making it even more difficult for them to come even with their creditors .
In the memorable words of Irving Fisher , " The more the debtors pay , the more they owe " ( emphasis in original ) .
Yet from this correct observation , Fisher jumped to the fallacious statement that " the liquidation defeats itself . " [ 17 ]
Let us emphasize again that bankruptcies — irrespective of how many individuals are involved — do not affect the real wealth of the nation , and in particular that they do not prevent the successful continuation of production .
The point is that other people will run the firms and own the houses — people who at the time the deflation set in were out of debt and had cash in hand to buy firms and real estate .
These new owners can run the firms profitably at the much lower level of selling prices because they bought the stock , and will buy other factors of production , at lower prices too .
In short , the true crux of deflation is that it does not hide the redistribution going hand in hand with changes in the quantity of money .
It entails visible misery for many people , to the benefit of equally visible winners .
This starkly contrasts with inflation , which creates anonymous winners at the expense of anonymous losers .
Both deflation and inflation are , from the point of view we have so far espoused , zero - sum games .
But inflation is a secret rip - off and thus the perfect vehicle for the exploitation of a population through its ( false ) elites , whereas deflation means open redistribution through bankruptcy according to the law .
IV .
With these statements we could close our analysis .
We have seen that deflation is not inherently bad , and that it is therefore far from being obvious that a wise monetary policy should seek to prevent it , or dampen its effects , at any price .
Deflation creates a great number of losers , and many of these losers are perfectly innocent people who have just not been wise enough to anticipate the event .
But deflation also creates many winners , and it also punishes many political entrepreneurs who had thrived on their intimate connections to those who control the production of fiat money .
Deflation is certainly not some sort of a reversal of a previous inflation that repairs the harm done in prior redistributions .
It brings about a new round of redistribution that adds to the previous round of inflation - induced redistribution . [ 18 ]
But it would be an error to infer from this fact that a deflation following a foregoing inflation was somehow harmful from an economic point , because it would involve additional redistributions .
The point is that any monetary policy has redistributive effects .
In particular , once a deflation of the supply of money substitutes sets in , the only way to combat this is through inflation of the supply of base money , and this policy too involves redistribution and thus creates winners and losers .
It follows that there is no economic rationale for monetary policy to take up an ardent fight against deflation rather than letting deflation run its course .
Neither policy benefits the nation as a whole , but merely a part of the nation at the expense of other groups .
No civil servant can loyally serve all of his fellow citizens through a hard - nosed stance against deflation .
And neither can he invoke the authority of economic science to buttress such a policy .
But there is also another point of view that merits consideration and which is in fact decisive for our problem .
It results from the fact that , in practice , there are at any point in time two , and only two , fundamental options for monetary policy : the first option is to increase the quantity of paper money ; the second option is not to increase the paper - money supply .
Now the question is how well each of these options harmonizes with the basic principles on which a free society is built .
V .
" There is nothing wrong with increases or decreases of the quantity of money .
The point is that such increases or decreases should not be mistaken to benefit society as a whole . "
How would money be produced in a free society ?
Let us first observe that the fact that the quantity of money is irrelevant for the wealth of a nation must not be confused with the ideal of stabilizing the quantity of money .
The latter ideal is in fact a spurious ideal and does not follow from the aforementioned fact .
There is nothing wrong with increases or decreases of the quantity of money .
The point is that such increases or decreases should not be mistaken to benefit society as a whole .
Right and wrong in monetary policy does not concern the question :
To which end should the quantity of money be modified ?
Rather , it concerns the question , who has the right to modify the quantity of money ?
And in a free society , the obvious answer is , all producers of money have the right to produce more money , and all owners of money have the right to use their property as they see fit .
In a truly free society , the production of money is a matter of private initiative .
Money is produced and sold just as any other commodity or service .
And this means in particular that in a free society the production of money is competitive .
It is a matter of mining precious metals and of minting coins , and both mining and minting are subject to the competition emanating from all other market participants .
In selling his product , the money producer competes with all other people who own money and seek to buy the same goods that he desires .
And in buying factors of production , the money producer competes with the producers of chairs , theater performances , telephones , carpets , cars and so on .
In a free society the production of money is constrained within fairly narrow limits , limits that are determined by the willingness of other members of society to cooperate with our money producer rather than with someone else .
" In a truly free society , the production of money is a matter of private initiative . "
What kind of money would prevail in a free society ?
Theoretical considerations and historical experience all point to the same answer : a free society would use precious metals as money .
Payments would be made in coins made out of gold , silver , platinum , copper , or whatever other substance would combine scarcity with the physical advantages of these metals .
By contrast , paper money has always been fiat money , that is , it has always been imposed by the coercive power of the state .
It is not the money of the free market but the money of a partially enslaved society .
VI .
The production of money in a free society is a matter of free association .
Everybody from the miners to the owners of the mines , to the minters , and up to the customers who buy the minted coins — all benefit from the production of money .
None of them violates the property rights of anybody else , because everybody is free to enter the mining and minting business , and nobody is obliged to buy the product .
Things are completely different once we turn to money production in interventionist regimes , which have prevailed in the West for the better part of the past 150 years .
Here we need to mention in particular two institutional forms of monetary interventionism : ( fraudulent ) fractional - reserve banking and fiat money .
The common characteristic of both these institutions is that they violate the principle of free association .
They enable the producers of paper money and of money titles to expand their production through the violation of other people 's property rights .
Banking is fraudulent whenever bankers sell uncovered or only partially covered money substitutes that they present as fully covered titles for money .
These bankers sell more money substitutes than they could have sold if they had taken care to keep a 100 percent reserve for each substitute they issued . [ 19 ]
The producer of fiat money ( in our days , typically , paper money ) sells a product that cannot withstand the competition of free - market moneys such as gold and silver coins , and which the market participants only use because the use of all other moneys is severely restricted or even outlawed .
The most eloquent illustration of this fact is that paper money in all countries has been protected through legal - tender laws .
Paper money is inherently fiat money ; it cannot thrive but when it is imposed by the state . [ 20 ]
In both cases , the production of money is excessive because it is no longer constrained by the informed and voluntary association of the buying public .
In a free market , paper money could not sustain the competition of the far superior metal moneys .
The production of any quantity of paper money is therefore excessive by the standards of a free society .
Similarly , fractional - reserve banking produces excessive quantities of money substitutes , at any rate in those cases in which the customers are not informed that they are offered fractional - reserve bank deposits , rather than genuine money titles .
" If there is any truth to the socialist caricature of capitalism — an economic system that exploits the poor to the benefit of the rich — then this caricature holds true for a capitalist system strangulated by inflation . "
This excessive production of money and money titles is inflation by the Rothbardian definition , which we have adapted in the present study to the case of paper money .
Inflation is an unjustifiable redistribution of income in favor of those who receive the new money and money titles first , and to the detriment of those who receive them last .
In practice the redistribution always works out in favor of the fiat - money producers themselves ( whom we misleadingly call central banks ) and of their partners in the banking sector and at the stock exchange .
And of course inflation works out to the advantage of governments and their closest allies in the business world .
Inflation is the vehicle through which these individuals and groups enrich themselves , unjustifiably , at the expense of the citizenry at large .
If there is any truth to the socialist caricature of capitalism — an economic system that exploits the poor to the benefit of the rich — then this caricature holds true for a capitalist system strangulated by inflation .
The relentless influx of paper money makes the wealthy and powerful richer and more powerful than they would be if they depended exclusively on the voluntary support of their fellow citizens .
And because it shields the political and economic establishment of the country from the competition emanating from the rest of society , inflation puts a brake on social mobility .
The rich stay rich ( longer ) and the poor stay poor ( longer ) than they would in a free society . [ 21 ]
The famous economist Josef Schumpeter once presented inflation as the harbinger of innovation .
As he saw it , inflationary issues of banknotes would serve to finance upstart entrepreneurs who had great ideas but lacked capital . [ 22 ]
Now , even if we abstract from the questionable ethical character of this proposal , which boils down to subsidizing any self - appointed innovator at the involuntary expense of all other members of society , we must say that , in light of practical experience , Schumpeter 's scheme is wishful thinking .
Credit expansion financed through printing money is in practice the very opposite of a way to combat the economic establishment .
It is the preferred means of survival for an establishment that cannot , or can no longer , sustain the competition of its competitors .
" The relentless influx of paper money makes the wealthy and powerful richer and more powerful than they would be if they depended exclusively on the voluntary support of their fellow citizens . "
It would not be uncharitable to characterize inflation as a large - scale rip - off , in favor of the politically well - connected few , and to the detriment of the politically destitute masses .
It always goes in hand with the concentration of political power in the hands of those who are privileged to own a banking license and of those who control the production of the monopoly paper money .
It promotes endless debts , puts society at the mercy of monetary authorities such as central banks , and to that extent entails moral corruption of society . [ 23 ]
VII .
Inflation in the form of fractional - reserve banking and fiat money is ultimately a self - defeating practice .
It bears in itself the seeds of its own destruction and , as we shall see , deflation is the essential vehicle of this destruction .
We can distinguish three scenarios of the halt of inflationary processes : [ 24 ]
First , there can be a liquidity crisis of the fractional - reserve banking system that ends up in a bank run , that is , in a sharp decline of the demand for money substitutes .
The concomitant drastic reduction of the money supply entails a corresponding decrease of money prices , which negatively affects all market participants who have financed their operations through debt .
The lower nominal selling receipts after the run do not suffice to pay back the debts contracted at the higher nominal price level of the past .
This in turn jeopardizes the positions of many creditors , who when they do not get their money back cannot pay back their creditors .
Thus the liquidity crisis of our fractional - reserve banks entails a general financial meltdown .
Rock bottom is reached , in a commodity money system , when all money substitutes have vanished and the market participants have turned to using the money commodity itself or use competing currencies , for example , other commodities or foreign paper moneys .
After the deflation has cleaned up the economic landscape , fractional - reserve banking and other forms of financial intermediation will play a less significant role in the economy .
Firms and individuals will , at the margin , turn to financing whatever purchases they make through personal savings .
In short , financial decision making will be even more conservative and more decentralized than before .
This first scenario was very common in the 19th century and up to the Great Depression , which , according to Irving Fisher and the early Chicago School , was all about debt - deflation entailed by a liquidity crisis of fractional - reserve banking .
The scenario became less important after the introduction of deposit insurance , which for all practical purposes established 100 percent reserve banking in the United States [ 25 ]
It could have some relevance , however , in explaining the more recent financial crises in Russia , Brazil , Argentina , and certain Asian countries , in particular if the currencies of these countries at the time of the crisis could be interpreted as money substitutes for US dollars .
Second , there can be intertemporal misallocations of resources when fraudulent fractional - reserve banks increase the money supply and thereby depress market interest rates below their equilibrium level .
Then entrepreneurs invest too many of the available resources high up in the physical production chain , and not enough resources in the lower stages of the structure of production .
The result becomes visible after some time , when a great number of firms must file bankruptcy .
This in turn jeopardizes their creditors , in particular fractional - reserve banks , and leads to the chain of events we described above .
The difference between the second and the first scenario is in the causation of the bank run .
In the former , the bank run starts more or less by accident , when one major market participant — out of negligence or due to unforeseeable contingencies — fails and pulls down a house of cards .
By contrast , in the scenario we are now considering , the bank run is the necessary consequence of a previous misallocation of resources that resulted from a fraudulent increase of the money supply .
The question is whether this scenario applied to any historical crisis is controversial .
Many Austrian economists believe the description fits the Great Depression and several other economic crises of the past .
At any rate , it is certainly a conceivable scenario , and it also involves a heavy dose of money - substitute deflation .
Hence , in this scenario , too , inflation ends up in a deflationary meltdown of the old ways of finance .
The share of banking and financial intermediation in overall economic activity will be reduced , and financial decision making will be even more conservative and decentralized than it is anyway .
Both foregoing scenarios involve a sudden decline of the demand for money substitutes , which entail a rapid physical disappearance of these substitutes from circulation , as market participants switch to using base money .
By contrast , in the case of paper money , it is very unlikely that there will ever be a rapid deflation in our definition — a reduction of the money supply .
The reason is that paper money is protected through legal - tender laws and other legislation .
That leaves barter as the only legal alternative to using paper money , and barter is so much less beneficial than monetary exchange that market participants typically prefer using even very inflationary moneys rather than turning to barter .
In all known cases , it was only under extreme duress — when the purchasing power of their paper money holdings dwindled within hours , so that indirect exchange became impracticable — that the market participants finally ignored the laws and started using moneys other than the legal tender .
The foregoing three scenarios probably cover most historical cases in which inflation has been brought to an end .
If we tie this up with our comparative analysis of free and compulsory production of money and money substitutes , we come to the conclusion that deflation is not a mere redistribution game that benefits some individuals and groups at the expense of other individuals and groups .
Rather , deflation appears as a great harbinger of liberty .
It stops inflation and destroys the institutions that produce inflation .
It abolishes the advantage that inflation - based debt finance enjoys , at the margin , over savings - based equity finance .
And it therefore decentralizes financial decision making and makes banks , firms , and individuals more prudent and self - reliant than they would have been under inflation .
Most importantly , deflation eradicates the rechanneling of incomes that result from the monopoly privileges of central banks .
It thus destroys the economic basis of the false elites and obliges them to become true elites rather quickly , or abdicate and make way for new entrepreneurs and other social leaders .
" Deflation appears as a great harbinger of liberty .
It stops inflation and destroys the institutions that produce inflation . "
It is highly significant that the authors of the 1931 Macmillan Report , which analyzed the worldwide financial crisis of the time , recognized and emphasized that deflation was foremost a political problem .
They clearly saw that deflation brings down the politico - economic establishment , which thrives on inflation and debts , and that it therefore brings about some circulation of the elites .
The late Lord Keynes and his coauthors — among them several leaders of the London banking industry , and of the British cooperative and labor - union movements — were of course convinced that their country could not do without them . [ 26 ]
Deflation puts a brake — at the very least a temporary brake — on the further concentration and consolidation of power in the hands of the federal government and in particular in the executive branch .
It dampens the growth of the welfare state , if it does not lead to its outright implosion .
In short , deflation is at least potentially a great liberating force .
It not only brings the inflated monetary system back to rock bottom , it brings the entire society back in touch with the real world , because it destroys the economic basis of the social engineers , spin doctors , and brain washers . [ 27 ]
In light of these considerations , deflation is not merely one fundamental policy option next to the fundamental alternative of reflation .
Rather , if our purpose is to maintain and — where necessary — to restore , a free society , then deflation is the only acceptable monetary policy .
" Deflation … brings the entire society back in touch with the real world , because it destroys the economic basis of the social engineers , spin doctors , and brain washers . "
The case of Japan might serve as a warning counter - example .
The severe Japanese recession of the early 1990s was both an economic and a political threat to the establishment .
In Japan , the process of consolidation and centralization of power started right after World War II , when the economic experts within the US occupation forces imposed Keynesian and socialist policies on their former enemy .
By the late 1980s , the process had advanced to such an extent that it was politically impossible to allow deflation to cleanse the economy and politics .
The Japanese governments of the 1990s sought to fix the economic crisis through increasingly heavy doses of inflation .
But the only result of this policy was to give a zombie life to the hopelessly bureaucratic and bankrupt conglomerates that control Japanese industry , banking , and politics . [ 28 ]
After almost fifteen years of mindless inflation , Japan 's economic crisis has turned into a fundamental political crisis that sooner or later will bring the country to the verge of revolution .
This is also what will happen to the West , if citizens let their governments have a free hand in monetary affairs .
VIII .
" There is absolutely no reason to be concerned about the economic effects of deflation — unless one equates the welfare of the nation with the welfare of its false elites . "
In conclusion let us restate the main points : Deflation is far from being inherently bad .
Quite to the contrary , it fulfills the very important social function of cleansing the economy and the body politic from all sorts of parasites that have thrived on the previous inflation .
The dangers of deflation are chimerical , but its charms are very real .
There is absolutely no reason to be concerned about the economic effects of deflation — unless one equates the welfare of the nation with the welfare of its false elites .
In contrast , there are many reasons to be concerned about both the economic and political consequences of the only alternative to deflation , namely , reflation — which is of course nothing but inflation pure and simple .
The purpose of this essay is not to appeal to the reason of our monetary authorities .
There is absolutely no hope that the Federal Reserve or any other fiat money producer of the world will change their policies any time soon .
But it is time that the friends of liberty change their minds on the crucial issue of deflation .
False thinking on this point has given our governments undue leeway , of which they have made ample and bad use .
Ultimately we need to take control over the money supply out of the hands of our governments and make the production of money again subject to the principle of free association .
The first step to endorsing and promoting this strategy is to realize that governments do not — indeed cannot — fulfill any positive role whatever through the control of our money .
By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse
One of the most difficult problems in mathematics has finally been solved .
It is called the Shimura - Taniyama - Weil ( STW ) conjecture , and it has baffled and defeated some of the greatest minds in maths over the last 40 years .
Now an international team is claiming victory .
" This is one of the crowning achievements of mathematics in the 20th Century , " said number theorist Professor Henri Darmon of McGill University in Canada .
The STW conjecture links two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics : the theory of numbers and the theory of shapes or , as mathematicians prefer to call them , elliptic curves and modular forms .
For decades , mathematicians have studied these subjects realising that there are deep connections between them but without ever being able to pin down the exact relationship .
Andrew Wiles used the STW conjecture to provide the proof for the famous mathematical puzzle Fermat 's Last Theorem .
But before Wiles cracked the theorem in 1993 , nobody even knew where to begin to tackle the STW conjecture .
In fact , Fermat 's Last Theorem is only a particular part of the more profound STW conjecture .
In technical terms , Andrew Wiles , a professor at Princeton , proved the STW conjecture for what are called semi-stable elliptic curves .
Final proof
It is the full proof of STW that will now be published in the December issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society .
And the work , perhaps not surprisingly , has come from three former Wiles students : Brian Conrad and Richard Taylor of Harvard University and Fred Diamond of Brandeis University .
The team also included Christopher Breuil of the University of Paris .
Only front - line mathematicians will really understand the STW conjecture .
But you could say " there exists a modular form of weight two and level N which is an Eigenform under the Hecke series and has a Fourier series " .
The brilliant but ill - fated Japanese mathematician Yukata Taniyama was the first person to propose some of the ideas behind the STW conjecture in 1955 .
A few years later , at the age of 31 , he committed suicide .
Others extended his revolutionary work .
The conjecture goes deeper than just bridging the world of numbers with that of shapes .
It is also part of what is known as the Langlands Program , a vast mathematical vision formulated by Robert Langlands .
This is an attempt to unite whole areas of mathematics .
The US National Science Foundation sponsored the STW work .
Its assistant director for mathematical sciences , Philippe Tondeur , said : " This is a breakthrough for mathematics .
This proof will have far - reaching consequences because of the abundance of new mathematical tools developed in the process . "
