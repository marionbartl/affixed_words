Film cameras slice fluid seconds of time into individual pieces , allowing scientists and laypeople new insights into events happening in high speed .
Case in point :
In the late 1870s , people did n’t know whether a horse trotting ever had all four of its feet simultaneously in the air .
An enterprising photographer , Eadweard Muybridge , captured a series of snapshots — a filmstrip — of a horse trotting and definitively settled the question in the affirmative .
You can see the horse in - motion and check out the geeky tech from this magazine piece on high speed photography .
Fast forward 130 years and we can now split a second into 2,000 of its constituent parts and examine them .
One incredible example is the video of the yellow balloon exploding above .
At that speed , the water appears much more viscous than it is , holding its shape for a few thousandths of a second before gravity pulls it to the ground .
And the march of technology continues as Wired.com ’s Gadget Lab reported in January on a camera that gets a million frames a second .
Of course , watching that film is probably as boring as viewing Andy Warhold ’s " Sleep , " which consists entirely of long takes of a poet just sleeping .
On the other hand , guns are exciting .
So , to see things shooting or being shot in ultra slow motion , I recommend this site .
The cloned sniffer puppies have already shown their potential
The world 's first cloned sniffer dogs have begun training in South Korea .
Seven puppies have been created using cells taken from a labrador considered by customs officials to be their best sniffer dog .
The puppies were born last year after the country 's customs service paid a biotechnology company to reproduce a Canadian Labrador Retriever .
Their handlers say they are already showing the same high level of skill as the original dog .
Only about 30 % of naturally - born sniffer dogs make the grade , but South Korean scientists believe that could rise to 90 % using the cloning method .
The puppies were born to three surrogate mothers after scientists used the nuclei of somatic cells from a sniffer dog called Chase .
The state - funded project cost about 300 m won ( $ 300,000 ; £ 150,000 ) .
A spokesman for South Korean customs said the pups have passed the first round of tests for behavioural patterns and genetic qualities and will report for duty in June after completing a second round of training .

That ’s Hillary snuggling up to Richard Mellon Scaife yesterday .
You remember him .
The super - rich leader of the vast right - wing conspiracy that Hillary complained about .
He funded the Arkansas Project , which was set up to destroy Bill Clinton .
You ’ve heard of Paula Jones , Vince Foster ’s “ murder ” ( as the far - right calls it ) , Troopergate , and Whitewater ?
Mellon Scaife is responsible for it all .
And now Hillary is getting all cozy with him over an editorial board meeting at his wacky far - right paper ( but it ’s okay to fire whats - his - name at MSNBC , he was mean to Chelsea ) .
Anything to destroy Obama .
Josh Marshall has far more .
Election Fraud in Pennsylvania ?

" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , D.C .
The Pennsylvania primary could lock up the Democratic nomination process once and for all .
The campaign that Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean asked to be finished by July 1 could be over this Tuesday .
Regardless of your candidate or party , you 're probably like the vast majority of citizens who insist on fair elections that are open to the public for examination .
Citizens want to know that the candidate taking office is the same candidate who won a majority or a plurality of the votes .
A 2006 Zogby poll of 1018 registered voters nationwide found that 92 % believed that they , as citizens , have the right to witness vote counting for the election of their paid public servants .
That will not be the case in Pennsylvania any more than it was the case in Florida , Ohio , California , South Carolina , and most other primary states .
Almost all states bar any real inspection of vote counting , the process that determines the election result .
Even if they did allow you to watch the count , all you would see is a whirring third - rate computer system run by a private company that wo n't allow anyone to take a comprehensive look inside .
Post election audits are either absent or randomly selected by the people who run the election .
Recounts require an exceptionally close election , less than a 1 % difference typically .
And citizen recounts after the election , where paper records exist , are barred by law in Florida and Virginia and barred almost everywhere else by bureaucratic fiat .
Even if you got to examine each and every ballot , the chain of custody of those paper records will likely be compromised at several key points .
Ballots collected by unaccountable individuals , driven around in the trunks of cars , unsupervised , plus other election board customs , mean you can't track the chain of custody of ballots from collection at precincts to delivery at counting locations .
Post - election storage oftentimes reflects little concern for real security .
If you can't track the chain of custody , you can't know if the ballots recounted or examined are the original voted ballots , if ballots have been replaced , altered , etc .
We elect people who pass laws that are enforced by bureaucrats who then tell us to take a hike when we want to closely examine an election .
" The results are what we say they are , " say the keepers of the vote , our so - called public servants .
" Move along , there 's nothing to see here " is the prevailing attitude toward inquiring citizens .
Potential Election Fraud in Pennsylvania
When you build any system that conducts " mission critical business , " like electing a president , you need to create enough safeguards to make sure that the process is secure .
How secure is the voting process in Pennsylvania ?
Almost 90 percent of Pennsylvanians will vote using touch screen voting machines that have no paper record of votes cast .
Once you touch the screen , the machine can count your vote any way it 's programmed .
It can even give you a receipt indicating you voted for Smith and count your vote for Jones .
These touch screens total their own votes , invisibly and without any outside checks .
We can't watch and even if we could , we would n't know what to look for .
Our election boards routinely sign contracts agreeing that the computer programs that count our votes are the trade secrets of the e-voting machine companies , no peeking .
The companies even " refuse to promise that their products will work . "

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - As U.S. gasoline prices hit records on almost a daily basis , an increasing number of motorists are following a radical driving technique designed to eke out every last mile from a tank of fuel .

Known as ‘ hypermiling , ’ the method can double gas mileage , even in gas - guzzling vehicles that would normally get less than 20 mpg .
Promoted on a growing number of Web sites , hypermiling includes pumping up tires to the maximum rating on their sidewalls , which may be higher than levels recommended in car manuals ; using engine oil of a low viscosity , and the controversial practice of drafting behind other vehicles on the highway to reduce aerodynamic drag -- a practice begun a few years ago by truck drivers .
The price of gasoline -- which hit a record of nearly $ 3.61 per gallon on Tuesday , according to travel club AAA -- has rapidly emerged as the public ’s biggest economic concern .
Gas prices are a “ serious problem , ” ahead of jobs , and healthcare , according to a poll released on Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation .
The “ advanced ” techniques of hypermiling are in addition to well - known approaches including keeping speed down , accelerating gently , avoiding excessive idling and removing cargo racks to also cut down on aerodynamic drag .
Adherence to hypermiling and other disciplines are designed to boost mileage well in excess of the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration ’s official ratings , which apply to each car model .
COSTS SAVED
Wayne Gerdes , a former nuclear plant operator from Wadsworth , Illinois , and the originator of hypermiling , said he gets 40 - 70 mpg out of his Ford Ranger pickup truck , about doubling its official fuel consumption of 25 mpg .
Gerdes , 47 , estimates that hypermiling has saved him $ 15,000 in fuel since he began the technique after the attacks of September 11 , events that convinced him that U.S. national security was being undermined by its dependence on oil from the Middle East , and motivated him to reduce his own fuel consumption .
“ If every vehicle in the U.S. got 45 miles per gallon , we would not import any oil , ” he said .
Deron Lovaas , vehicles campaign director at environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council , said most hypermiling techniques are “ sensible recommendations ” that could drive down demand and even prices if widely adopted .
“ We should be looking under every rock for potential energy savings , ” he said .
He said he could not recommend drafting behind fast - moving trucks because it could potentially lead to highway accidents .
Hypermiling can even make fuel - sipping gas - electric hybrid cars more efficient .
Chuck Thomas , 50 , a computer programmer from Lewisville , Texas , said he has been getting 71 mpg from his Honda Insight , a hybrid whose EPA rating is 58 mpg , in the two years since he has been hypermiling .
Among Thomas ’ techniques is “ pulse and glide ” in which he accelerates and then coasts with the engine off until around 15 mph when he kicks the engine back on and accelerates again .
“ It ’s the automotive equivalent of skateboarding , ” he said .
OBL : Revenge for Republishing Offensive Cartoons Will Be Severe Bin Laden says reprinting the cartoons is more serious than killing children .
March 19 , 2008  --
A jihadist Web site Wednesday posted a message from Osama bin Laden chiding the European Union for allowing newspapers to republish cartoons insulting the prophet Muhammad .
In his five - minute audio message entitled , " The Response Is What You See , Not What You Hear , " bin Laden accuses Europeans of abandoning the " etiquettes of disputes and morals of fighting . "
Bin Laden says he considers the reprinting of the cartoons a more serious offense than the killing of women and children .
He also adds the revenge for republishing the cartoons " will be more severe . "
Bin Laden concludes his message by saying if there are no checks on the Europeans ' freedom to speak , then there will be no checks on his freedom to act .
This is bin Laden 's first message of 2008 .
We last heard from bin Laden in December 2007 when he warned Sunnis in Iraq against fighting al Qaeda .

Just as dogs preceded humans in making the first risky voyages into space , a new generation of canines has now made an equally path - breaking trip -- from life to death and back again .
In a series of experiments , doctors at the Safar Center for Resuscitation Research at the University of Pittsburgh managed to plunge several dogs into a state of total , clinical death before bringing them back to the land of the living .
The feat , the researchers say , points the way toward a time when human beings will make a similar trip , not as a matter of ghoulish curiosity but as a means of preserving life in the face of otherwise fatal injuries .
The method for making the trip is simple .
The Safar Center team took the dogs , swiftly flushed their bodies of blood and replaced it with a relatively cool saline solution ( approximately 45 to 50 degrees ) laced with oxygen and glucose .
The dogs quickly went into cardiac arrest , and with no demonstrable heartbeat or brain activity , clinically died .
There the dogs remained in what Patrick Kochanek , the director of the Safar Center , and his colleagues prefer to call a state of suspended animation .
After three full hours , the team reversed their steps , withdrawing the saline solution , reintroducing the blood and thereby warming the dogs back to life .
In a flourish worthy of Mary Shelley , they jump - started their patients ' hearts with a gentle electric shock .
While a small minority of the dogs suffered permanent damage , most did not , awakening in full command of their faculties .
Seven years ago I came across this list .
I do n’t recall where it came from but I do know that I could n’t agree with even one of these statements .
In fact , I found the very idea of anyone being able to agree with most of them absurd .
I thought , “ You gotta be kidding me !
Who really goes through life THAT friggin’ happy ? ”
For some reason , I kept the list .
Over the years , I made it a goal to change myself or my life to eventually be able to say all of these statements with complete sincerity and heartfelt gratitude .
I am surprised and pleased to realize I have finally succeeded with most of them .
I still struggle with # 19 sometimes .
And , I ’m not exactly sure if it ’s such a bad thing to need to compete with others ( # 10 ) since competition is a great motivator .
But , other than that , I ’ve pretty much achieved the rest thanks to my new career as a writer .
I ’m lovin’ it !
And , so , I present this list to you in the hopes that maybe it will inspire you , too , to do whatever it takes so that you can , in the not - too - distant future , likewise , enjoy all of these great things , too .
25 STATEMENTS TO HAPPINESS
Most of the time , I have a great time !
I am content with my professional career .
I listen to my inner feelings and let them guide me .
Every day , I laugh and smile a lot .
I rarely become annoyed or angry .
People in general like me and my company .
I do n’t get easily afraid of anything .
I rarely feel stressed out .
I adapt easily to changing circumstances .
I do n’t feel the need to compete with anybody .
My life is a great adventure and so much fun !
I do n’t spend much time worrying .
The world is beautiful and full of opportunities .
I sleep very well at night and wake up refreshed .
I usually focus on the solutions and not the problems .
I feel relaxed most of the time .
I know my abilities and feel confident most of the time .
I feel mostly fine , even when I ’m alone .
I have no regrets over past mistakes .
To me , arguments are a waste of time .
I ’m always open to new ideas and concepts in my life .
I live the way I choose and I let others do that , too .
I do n’t blame or intimidate others to get what I want .
If I ’m not happy about something , I take the initiative to change it .
I like myself the way I am .
I know , I know .
Crazy to be able to be this happy , is n’t it ?
But , I am .
And , you can , too .
Just keep your eyes on the prize .
Do whatever you need to do to get there from here .
And , never , ever give up .
Be awesome !
Be your own hero !

Get ready for the neocons to bang the drums of war this week .
“ Iranian forces were involved in the recent battle for Basra , General David Petraeus , the US commander in Iraq , is expected to tell Congress this week , ” reports the Times Online .
“ Military and intelligence sources believe Iranians were operating at a tactical command level with the Shi’ite militias fighting Iraqi security forces ; some were directing operations on the ground , they think . ”
Of course , Petraeus and the Pentagon have no evidence of this .
But then evidence is not required .
All that is needed is the echo chamber corporate media .
Run a few banner headlines and get the talking heads on Faux to talk about this and you have a ready - made Iranian incursion into Iraq .
It works like a charm , especially for Americans unable to find Iraq or Iran on a map .
“ Petraeus intends to use the evidence of Iranian involvement to argue against any reductions in US forces . ”
In other words , the neocons made up a story in order to avoid the will of the American people , who want the troops to come home .
Petraeus is working hard to prevent a reduction in troop levels from 160,000 to 140,000 by July .
“ It is one thing to withdraw troops when there is purely sectarian fighting but it is another thing if it leaves the Iranians to move in , ” Dr. Daniel Gouré , a “ defense analyst ” at the Lexington Institute in Virginia told Times Online .
Gouré is a neocon connected to the Project for the New American Century and Frank Gaffney ’s Center for Security Policy .
PNAC and Gaffney advocate the so - called “ peace through strength ” credo , that is to say “ peace ” through mass murder .
In Basra , this policy resulted in the murder of more than 300 civilians .
Petraeus and the neocons are worried about the Shia uprising currently underway in Iraq .
It is said Petraeus is “ furious ” at puppet al - Maliki for the bungled move against Moqtada al - Sadr and his Mahdi Army in Basra without consulting the occupiers .
Of course , this is nonsense , as al - Maliki and his installed government are on a short leash and do not move without permission .
In fact , as the corporate media was obliged to report , more “ than 1,000 Iraqi soldiers and policemen either refused to fight or simply abandoned their posts during the inconclusive assault against Shiite militias in Basra , ” as the New York Times put it .
As William H. White of the Concord Bridge Coalition writes , the “ Basra offensive , having failed spectacularly , undermined the Iraqi government ’s already diminished political authority , along with the Shiite Dawa Party faction it represents , and any hope the Nouri al - Maliki government had of weakening the Sadr movement before the scheduled October elections .
So rather than strengthening the US military ’s Shiite flank in Iraq , the failed offensive has weakened it , while concomitantly enhancing the standing of the rival Shiite Mahdi Army faction and its leader Moktada al Sadr , much as Israel ’s attacks on Lebanon failed to weaken the Hezbollah . ”
In order to portray Moktada al - Sadr as an Iranian sock puppet , last week the corporate media reported that he was in Tehran , an accusation denied by the Iranians .
“ Addressing reporters at his weekly press conference , [ government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham ] said those reports were released by the occupation forces to put the blames for current insecurity in Iraq on other sides , ” reports IRNA .
“ Referring to good relations between Iran and Iraq , Elham said by releasing such reports , the occupation forces were trying to harm Tehran - Baghdad cordial ties . ”
In fact , they are paving the way for an attack against Iran .
It is , however , unclear if the neocons will be able to pull off such an attack , promised to go down before decider - commander Bush leaves office .
As a possible indicator something is up , the Mehr News Agency reports that “ around 8,000 Iranian pilgrims were returned home ” from Iraq ’s holy places .
“ As part of the country ’s new security plan even Iraqis are not allowed to enter or exit through the border , ” Deputy Head of Iran ’s Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization Hossein Akbari told the news agency .
“ The Iranian official stated that dispatch of Iranian pilgrims would resume as soon as security is restored to the country . ”
But forget Petraeus .
Consider the words of Lt. General ( ret. ) William E. Odom , who on April 2 testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
In addition to warning about “ the steady violence in the Mosul area , and the tensions in Kirkuk between Kurds , Arabs , and Turkomen , ” Odom said “ it gives me pause to learn that our vice president and some members of the Senate are aligned with al Qaeda on spreading the war to Iran . ”
But of course , as al - Qaeda is a CIA contrivance .
Not that the American people understand this .
Even John McCain was clueless , stating that al - Qaeda had teamed up with the Iranian mullahs to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
Finally , it should be remembered that Iran offered to help the United States unseat the Taliban in Afghanistan .
“ In October 2001 , as the United States was just beginning its military operations in Afghanistan , State Department and NSC officials began meeting secretly with Iranian diplomats in Paris and Geneva , under the sponsorship of Lakhdar Brahimi , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan , ” writes Gareth Porter .
“ It was thanks to the Northern Alliance Afghan troops , which were supported primarily by the Iranians , that the Taliban was driven out of Kabul in mid-November . ”
In response , the neocon “ hardliners presented Iranian policy to Bush and the public as hostile to U.S. aims in Afghanistan and refusing to cooperate with the war on terror – the opposite of what officials directly involved had witnessed . ”
But does the corporate media balance its reporting with this historical fact ?
Of course not .
Instead , we get the standard propaganda out of the Pentagon .
“ U.S. officials … have been building a case against Iran for allegedly trying to destabilize Afghanistan by supplying weapons to the Taliban , an extremist Sunni Muslim and ethnic Pashtun group , ” the Washington Post reported on September 21 , 2007 .
“ Many independent analysts have questioned U.S. allegations that Iran is shipping arms to the Taliban and have suggested the accusations are part of a campaign by the Bush administration to push for military action against Iran .
European officials have said they see no evidence of a large or sustained effort by Iran to supply the Taliban with weapons . ”
It makes no sense for Iran to support a CIA - ISI contrived “ movement ” of Talibs , cooked up in religious schools in Pakistan .
The Taliban was central to Pakistan ’s pan-Islamic vision and the CIA was more than happy to support them , knowing full well such fanaticism would be used down the road .
Now that Petraeus will answer questions in Congress this week , we can expect to hear more Brothers Grimm stories about Iran .
It matters not what the truth is .
Because the neocons are determined to attack Iran and reduce it to the sort of paralyzing chaos now at work in Iraq .
It is part and parcel of the neocon vision – the ultimate destruction of Islamic society , culture , and nation - states .

No Free Lunch Theorems
Broadly speaking , there are two no free lunch theorems .
One for supervised machine learning ( Wolpert 1996 ) and one for search / optimization ( Wolpert and Macready 1997 ) .
For an overview of the ( no ) free lunch and associated theorems , see David Wolpert ’s
What does dinner cost ?
No Free Lunch for Supervised Machine Learning
Hume ( 1739 –1740 ) pointed out that ‘ even after the observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects , we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have had experience ’ .
More recently , and with increasing rigour , Mitchell ( 1980 ) , Schaffer ( 1994 ) and Wolpert ( 1996 ) showed that bias - free learning is futile .
Wolpert ( 1996 ) shows that in a noise - free scenario where the loss function is the misclassification rate , if one is interested in off - training - set error , then there are no a priori distinctions between learning algorithms .
More formally , where
d = training set ;
m = number of elements in training set ;
f = ‘ target ’ input - output relationships ;
h = hypothesis ( the algorithm 's guess for f made in response to d ) ; and
C = off - training - set ‘ loss ’ associated with f and h ( ‘ generalization error ’ )
all algorithms are equivalent , on average , by any of the following measures of risk : E( C|d ) , E( C|m ) , E( C|f , d ) , or E( C|f , m ) .
How well you do is determined by how ‘ aligned ’ your learning algorithm P ( h|d ) is with the actual posterior , P ( f|d ) .
Wolpert 's result , in essence , formalizes Hume , extends him and calls the whole of science into question .
No Free Lunch for Search / Optimization
The no free lunch theorem for search and optimization ( Wolpert and Macready 1997 ) applies to finite spaces and algorithms that do not resample points .
All algorithms that search for an extremum of a cost function perform exactly the same when averaged over all possible cost functions .
So , for any search / optimization algorithm , any elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in performance over another class .

Second moments and higher of algorithms ' generalization error
Coevolution ( Wolpert and Macready 2005 )
Confidence intervals can give a priori distinctions between algorithms
Quotes
" We show that all algorithms that search for an extremum of a cost function perform exactly the same , when averaged over all possible cost functions .
In particular , if algorithm A outperforms algorithm B on some cost functions , then loosely speaking there must exist exactly as many other functions where B outperforms A. Starting from this we analyze a number of the other a priori characteristics of the search problem , like its geometry and its information - theoretic aspects .
This analysis allows us to derive mathematical benchmarks for assessing a particular search algorithm 's performance .
We also investigate minimax aspects of the search problem , the validity of using characteristics of a partial search over a cost function to predict future behavior of the search algorithm on that cost function , and time - varying cost functions .
We conclude with some discussion of the justifiability of biologically - inspired search methods . "
Wolpert and Macready ( 1995 )
" An algorithmicist looks at no free lunch . "
Culberson ( 1996 )
' The " no free lunch " theorems ( Wolpert and Macready ) have sparked heated debate in the computational learning community .
A recent communication , ( Zhu and Rohwer , 1996 ) attempts to demonstrate the ine fficiency of cross-validation on a simple problem .
We elaborate on this result by considering a broader class of cross-validation .
We show that when used more strictly , cross-validation can yield the expected results on simple examples . '
Goutte ( 1997 )
" A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving .
A number of " no free lunch " ( NFL ) theorems are presented that establish that for any algorithm , any elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in performance over another class .
These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem .
Applications of the NFL theorems to information theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented .
Other issues addressed are time - varying optimization problems and a priori " head - to - head " minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms , distinctions that can obtain despite the NFL theorems ' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms . "
Wolpert and Macready ( 1997 )
" Here different scenarios of optimization are presented .
It is argued why the scenario on which the No Free Lunch Theorem is based does not model real life optimization .
For more realistic scenarios it is argued why optimization techniques differ in their efficiency .
For a small example this claim is proved . "
Droste , Jansen and Wegener ( 1998 )
" We show that with a uniform prior on models having the same training error , early stopping at some fixed training error above the training error minimum results in an increase in the expected generalization error . "
Cataltepe , Abu-Mostafa and Magdon - Ismail ( 1999 )
The problem with the no- free - lunch theorems in machine learning is that they are rather complicated and difficult to follow because they are proven under the most general conditions possible ( Wolpert 1992 , 1995 , 1996 ) .
The purpose of this note is to present the idea behind them in a very simple example .
Forster ( 1999 )
" No Free Lunch theorems have shown that learning algorithms cannot be universally good .
We show that No Free Lunch exists for noise prediction as well .
We show that when the noise is additive and the prior over target functions is " uniform " , a prior on the noise distribution cannot be updated , in the Bayesian sense , from any finite data set .
We emphasize the importance of a prior over the target function in order to justify superior performance for learning systems . "
Magdon - Ismail ( 2000 )
' This letter discusses the recent paper " Some technical remarks on the proof of the ' No Free Lunch ' theorem " .
In that paper some technical issues related to the formal proof of the " No Free Lunch " ( NFL ) theorem for search [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] were given .
As a result of a discussion among the authors , this letter explores the issues raised in that paper more thoroughly .
This includes the presentation of a simpler version of the NFL proof , in accord with a suggestion made explicitly in [ 1 ] and implicitly in [ 3 ] .
It also includes the correction of an incorrect claim made in [ 1 ] of a limitation of the NFL theorem .
Finally , some thoughts on future research directions for research into algorithm performance are given . '
Köppen , Wolpert and Macready ( 2001 )
" Wolpert proved NFL assuming uniform problem distributions
- for learning in 1992 and 1994
- for optimization in 1995 ( with Macready ) "
English ( 2001 )
" It is seen that No Free Lunch results are independent from whether or not the set of functions over which a No Free Lunch result holds is compressible . "
Schumacher , Vose and Whitley ( 2001 )
" The No Free Lunch theorem has had considerable impact in the field of optimization research .
A terse definition of this theorem is that no algorithm can outperform any other algorithm when performance is amortized over all functions .
Once that theorem has been proven , the next logical step is to characterize how effective optimization can be under reasonable restrictions .
We operationally define a technique for approaching the question of what makes a function searchable in practice .
This technique involves defining a scalar field over the space of all functions that enables one to make decisive claims concerning the performance of an associated algorithm .
We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by giving such a field and a corresponding algorithm ; the algorithm performs better than random search for small values of this field .
We then show that this algorithm will be effective over many , perhaps most functions of interest to optimization researchers .
We conclude with a discussion about how such regularities are exploited in many popular optimization algorithms . "

" In a recent paper [ 3 ] it was shown that No Free Lunch results [ 5 ] hold for any subset F of the set of all possible functions from a finite set X to a finite set Y iff F is closed under permutation of X .
In this article , we prove that the number of those subsets can be neglected compared to the overall number of possible subsets .
Further , we present some arguments why problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be closed under permutation . "
Igel and Toussaint ( 2001 )
" an Almost No Free Lunch ( ANFL ) theorem shows that for each function which can be optimized efficiently by a search heuristic there can be constructed many related functions where the same heuristic is bad .
As a consequence , search heuristics use some idea how to look for good points and can be successful only for functions “ giving the right hints ” . '
Droste , Jansen and Wegener ( 2002 )
" The classic NFL theorems are invariably cast in terms of single objective optimization problems .
We confirm that the classic NFL theorem holds for general multiobjective fitness spaces , and show how this follows from a ‘ single - objective ’ NFL theorem .
We also show that , given any particular Pareto Front , an NFL theorem holds for the set of all multiobjective problems which have that Pareto Front .
It follows that , given any ‘ shape ’ or class of Pareto fronts , an NFL theorem holds for the set of all multiobjective problems in that class .
These findings have salience in test function design .
Such NFL results are cast in the typical context of absolute performance , assuming a performance metric which returns a value based on the result produced by a single algorithm .
But , in multiobjective search we commonly use comparative metrics , which return performance measures based non-trivially on the results from two ( or more ) algorithms .
Closely related to but extending the observations in the seminal NFL work concerning minimax distinctions between algorithms , we provide a ‘ Free Leftovers ’ theorem for comparative performance of algorithms over permutation functions ; in words : over the space of permutation problems , every algorithm has some companion algorithm (s ) which it outperforms , according to a certain well - behaved metric , when comparative performance is summed over all problems in the space . "
Corne and Knowles ( 2003 )
" The No - Free - Lunch ( NFL ) theorems hold for general multiobjective fitness spaces , in the sense that , over a space of problems which is closed under permutation , any two algorithms will produce the same set of multiobjective samples .
However , there are salient ways in which NFL does not generally hold in multiobjective optimization .
Previously we have shown that a ‘ free lunch ’ can arise when comparative metrics ( rather than absolute metrics ) are used for performance measurement .
Here we show that NFL does not generally apply in multiobjective optimization when absolute performance metrics are used .
This is because multiobjective optimizers usually combine a generator with an archiver .
The generator corresponds to the ‘ algorithm ’ in the NFL sense , but the archiver filters the sample generated by the algorithm in a way that undermines the NFL assumptions .
Essentially , if two multiobjective approaches have different archivers , their average performance may differ .
We prove this , and hence show that we can say , without qualification , that some multiobjective approaches are better than others . "
Corne and Knowles ( 2003 )
" The sharpened No - Free - Lunch - theorem ( NFL - theorem ) states that the performance of all optimization algorithms averaged over any finite set F of functions is equal if and only if F is closed under permutation ( c.u.p . ) and each target function in F is equally likely .
In this paper , we first summarize some consequences of this theorem , which have been proven recently :
The average number of evaluations needed to find a desirable ( e.g. , optimal ) solution can be calculated ; the number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the overall number of possible subsets ; and problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be c.u.p .
Second , as the main result , the NFL - theorem is extended .
Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL - results to hold are given for arbitrary , non-uniform distributions of target functions .
This yields the most general NFL - theorem for optimization presented so far . "
Igel and Toussaint ( 2003 )
" Genetic Algorithms ( GAs ) and Genetic Programming ( GP ) are often considered as seperate but related fields .
Typically , GAs use a fixed length linear representation , whereas GP uses a variable size tree representation .
This paper argues that the differences are unimportant .
Firstly , variable length actually means variable length up to some fixed limit , so can really be considered as fixed length .
Secondly , the representations and genetic operators of GA and GP appear different , however ultimately it is a population of bit strings in the computers memory which is being manipulated whether it is GA or GP which is being run on the computer .
The important difference lies in the interpretation of the representation ; if there is a one to one mapping between the description of an object and the object itself ( as is the case with the representation of numbers ) , or a many to one mapping ( as is the case with the representation of programs ) .
This has ramifications for the validity of the No Free Lunch theorem , which is valid in the first case but not in the second .
It is argued that due to the highly related nature of GAs and GP , that many of the empirical results discovered in one field will apply to the other field , for example maintaining high diversity in a population to improve performance . "
Woodward ( 2003 )
" This paper has three aims .
Firstly , to clarify the poorly understood No Free Lunch Theorem ( NFL ) which states all search algorithms perform equally .
Secondly , search algorithms are often applied to program induction and it is suggested that NFL does not hold due to the universal nature of the mapping between program space and functionality space .
Finally , NFL and combinatorial problems are examined .
When evaluating a candidate solution , it can be discarded without being fully examined .
A stronger version of NFL is established for this class of problems where the goal is to minimize a quantity . "

WASHINGTON - The US Air Force has grounded its entire fleet of F - 15s , the service 's premier fighter aircraft , after one of the planes disintegrated over eastern Missouri during a training mission , raising the possibility of a fatal flaw in the aging fighters ' fuselage that could keep it out of the skies for months .
General T. Michael " Buzz " Moseley , the Air Force chief of staff , ordered the grounding Saturday after initial reports showed that the Missouri Air National Guard fighter plane broke apart Friday in midair during a simulated dogfight .
Although the 688 F - 15s in the Air Force 's arsenal gradually are being replaced by a new generation of aircraft - the F - 22 - they remain the nation 's most sophisticated front - line fighters .
US officials said the F - 15s are used heavily for protecting the continental United States from terrorist attack , as well as for combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Lieutenant General Gary L. North , the Air Force officer in charge of military aircraft in the Middle East , issued a statement yesterday saying he would be able to fill the gap with other fighters and bombers .
But another Air Force official said the F - 15 grounding will have a " significant impact " on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" They will clearly have to work hard to pick up the slack , " the official said .
The health of the F - 15 fleet has long been a concern for Air Force brass , who repeatedly have warned that the two - engine fighter had exceeded its expected life span and was straining under the workload imposed by the counterterrorism duty .
In addition , Moseley repeatedly has raised concerns that the plane is inadequate for increasingly sophisticated air defense systems being developed by potential adversaries such as China and Iran .
" The F - 15s . . . they 're very capable airplanes , " Moseley told a congressional hearing in October .
" But against the new - generation threat systems , they do n't have the advantage that we had when they were designed in the late 1960s and built in the 1970s . "
In May , another Missouri Air National Guard F - 15 crashed in southern Indiana during a similar training exercise .
The pilots in Friday 's crash and the May accident survived .
The F - 15 that crashed Friday was 27 years old .
Of the five versions of the F - 15 used by the Air Force , four versions average 24 to 30 years of age .
The F - 15E , the newest version , is 15 1 / 2 years old , but has been grounded with the other versions because it has a similar airframe .
Air Force leaders frequently have cited the age and growing obsolescence of the F - 15 as the main reason to buy the new , stealthier F - 22 , the most expensive fighter ever made .
Critics of the F - 22 , which was first designed to fight a generation of Soviet MiGs that never materialized , say it is an overpriced Cold War relic , but the Air Force insists it has adapted the plane to meet more modern threats and missions .
Lieutenant General David Deptula , a former F - 15 pilot who is now the Air Force 's head of intelligence , said his son now flies the same F - 15 aircraft that Deptula flew while based in Japan in the late 1970s .
" They have become serious maintenance challenges as they get older , and now I 'd suggest that we may be facing a crisis , " Deptula said .
" We must recapitalize our aging fighter forces - and fast . "
Loren Thompson , a military analyst with the Lexington Institute who has consulted for aircraft manufacturers , said the accident probably was caused by metal fatigue , corrosion , or faulty maintenance .
If maintenance problems turn out to be the culprit , Thompson said , the F - 15 fleet could be returned to flight relatively quickly .
Similarly , corrosion could be fixed by examining other aircraft for similar problems .
If the Missouri crash was the result of metal fatigue , however , it could lead to a much more extended grounding , as it would suggest that time and intense use of the aircraft since the Sept. 11 attacks have caught up with the aging fighter .
" The whole fleet was already flying on flight restrictions due to metal fatigue , " said Thompson , noting that a fleet - wide grounding is extremely rare , especially for a fighter .
" In this case , the planes that are grounded are supposed to be America 's top - of - the line air superiority plane , " Thompson added .
" This is not like grounding some cargo plane .
These are the sinews of our global air dominance . "
Despite fears over the plane 's safety , it remained unclear whether all F - 15s were on the ground or would stay there .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Five men were found guilty on Monday of kidnap and robbery in the country 's biggest ever heist , a daring , 53 million pound raid on a cash depot in Kent .
The robbers , some dressed as policemen and most wearing prosthetic disguises , snatched the record haul after getting past tight security by kidnapping the depot 's manager , his wife and son at gunpoint .
They were also helped by an " inside man " , who not only provided details of the building 's interior layout and security protocols , but also secretly filmed it using a tiny camera hidden on his belt .
Despite the elaborate planning , the gang was rounded up by police within days of the February 2006 raid at the Securitas Depot in Tonbridge , after detectives received a tip - off .
Stuart Royle , 49 , Jetmir Bucpapa , 26 , Lea Rusha , 35 , Ermir Hysenaj , 28 , and Roger Coutts , 30 , were convicted at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to kidnap , conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to possess firearms .
Another defendant , John Fowler , 59 , was cleared of those charges while Keith Borer , 54 , was found not guilty of handling stolen goods .

On 1st October 2006 , the UK enacted a law to make ageism illegal .
This is only for employment but nonetheless , despite privacy concerns , many employment related websites still ask for it or some equivalent field such as " career start " under the guise of data de-duplication .
Today being data privacy day it might be a good time to remind them to get their unique numbers another way .
Anyway , for those sites and application forms that still request it , they claim that it is to ensure compliance with the new legislation .
Funny that , before the legislation you did n't have to supply such information , now some agencies ask for it and cite the legislation as the reason .
Furthermore , as I blogged in 2006 you are now forced to reveal your age for ID purposes when applying for a job .
So that 's the background .
Age when applying for a job should just be recorded for " checking purposes " and to ensure that recruiters are playing fairly .
In that regard , it is no different to race , religion and other profiling characteristics that are illegal ( and immoral ) to discriminate on .
Yet , the rest of society has n't really caught up .
Let 's take a typical news story from today where the people 's ages have no relevance .
The original text :
The text if we removed the profiling information and replaced it with ethnic origin ( these are made up ) Completely irrelevant , pointless and bordering on racist .
Maybe you could have an alternate version using other profiling information such as religionAgain , fairly offensive , pointless and quite irrelevant .
So why do we continue to accept the pointless and irrelevant reporting of the number of birthdays someone has had when it has no relevance to the story ?
It is just as offensive and wrong as other profiling information that it is illegal to discriminate on .

The " Real " Gold Price
Now that gold has climbed above the $ 850 high reached back in January 1980 , many are proclaiming that gold is at a new ‘ record ’ .
That ’s true of course when gold ’s exchange rate to the dollar is viewed in terms of nominal dollars , but nominal dollars provide a distorted picture .
After all , everyone knows that because of inflation a dollar today purchases much less than it did twenty - eight years ago , so clearly , $ 850 today does not have the purchasing power it did back then .
The question therefore arises , what price does gold have to reach in inflation adjusted dollars to equal the purchasing power of eight hundred fifty 1980 - dollars ?
The answer to this question depends upon which Consumer Price Index is used to calculate the inflation adjusted gold price .
The two alternatives are the US government ’s CPI or the CPI provided by John Williams of www.ShadowStats.com.
These two different CPI measures provide very different inflation adjusted gold prices .
So which CPI should we use ?
The ShadowStats CPI eliminates the changes made by the US government since the early 1980s to its own CPI measure .
In other words , the ShadowsStats CPI is the same one the US government used to calculate inflation while Jimmy Carter was president .
The changes made by the government to its CPI were clearly introduced to lessen reported CPI inflation .
A lower inflation rate reduces the cost - of - living increases the US government makes to welfare and Social Security recipients , thereby reducing its budget deficit .
Welfare and Social Security recipients suffer the consequences .
Their purchasing power is reduced because the payments they receive do not keep up with the real rate of inflation .
An example will be useful to illustrate this loss of purchasing power .
Let ’s assume that a recipient received $ 850 per month from the US government in January 1980 .
Using the US government ’s CPI , that recipient is today receiving $ 2,310 .
However , if the US government had not made any changes to the way it calculates CPI , the recipient would today be receiving $ 6,255 .
This difference can be seen in the following chart , which presents the January $ 850 gold price adjusted for inflation using both CPI ’s .
There are a couple of important conclusions from the above chart .
First , gold at its present price of $ 900 today is still very cheap .
In other words , it is a long way from the purchasing power an ounce of gold achieved in January 1980 .
Second , both measures on the above chart show that the dollar is losing purchasing power every month .
So if gold in the future were to reach a $ 6,255 price , the inflation between now and then would require gold to reach an even higher price to equal the purchasing power it had in January 1980 .
Rather than reduce inflation , the US government instead shot the messenger .
By fiddling with the CPI , the US government wants us to believe that inflation is not as bad as it really is , which is the same strategy it has pursued with the other important inflation messenger – gold .
Government interventions to cap the gold price prevent the gold barometer from alerting everyone that inflation is a growing menace .
To conclude , even though gold is trading at a record high in terms of nominal dollars , the real gold price is far below the old January 1980 record when adjusted for inflation .
Gold is still good value , and more importantly , government interventions have kept gold cheap , thus enabling us to buy it at prices far less than would be the case if the government was n’t intervening .
Therefore , continue to spend overvalued dollars to accumulate undervalued gold .

WASHINGTON 
One by one , top executives of American oil companies met privately over the last year with Libya ’s leader , Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi , often in his signature Bedouin tent , as they lined up contracts allowing them to tap into the country ’s oil reserves .
But now , the new allies are working Capitol Hill , trying to weaken a law that threatens those deals .
The Libyan government , once a pariah , and the American oil industry have hired high - profile lobbyists , buttonholed lawmakers and enlisted help from the Bush administration , all in an effort to win an exemption from a law that Congress passed in January that is intended to ensure that victims of terrorist attacks are compensated .
The law allows victims of state - sponsored terrorism to collect court judgments by seizing foreign assets in the United States or money from those governments held by American companies doing business with them .
If Libya loses a half - dozen court cases still pending , $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion could be at stake , according to lawyers ’ estimates .
“ Libya is the first country in history to come out and denounce weapons of mass destruction , ” said Ali S. Aujali , Libya ’s ambassador to the United States .
“ We have worked very closely with the United States in recent years to fight terrorism .
And now to be treated in this way , I feel like we are back to Square One . ”
Bin Laden : Key enabler of “ imperial mobilization "
' Bin Laden ' : Key enabler of “ imperial mobilization ”
( and the first nuclear attack since 1945 , on Iran–Pakistan )
by Zahir Ebrahim

Permission granted to use freely as per copyright notice .
The abominable shared fates that unite Iran ( “ Bush and Iran , again ” , WSJ April 15 , 2008 ) , and Pakistan , from President Bush calling Pakistan “ Terror Central ” in 2007 , to this week , April 13 , 2008 , ' clairvoyantly ' asserting that “ If another September 11 style attack is being planned , it probably is being plotted in Pakistan , and not Afghanistan ” .
And as already noted in its March 29 , 2008 heads - up warning to America by Project HumanbeingsfirstTM
( “ Nuclear attack on Iran appears imminent ! ” ) , when such a “ planned ” attack transpires , it “ will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison ” ( Bush , Feb. 13 , 2008 ) .
That heads - up warning also suggested creating a new peoples institutional barrier against the wanton pursuit of “ imperial mobilization ” that is otherwise almost trivially enabled by any “ new Pearl Harbor ” ( “ How to derail ' imperial mobilization ' ” ) .
Simultaneously , a rational preemptive self - defense strategy to further deter such Machiavellianly orchestrated “ ' defensive ' US military action ” ( Brzezinski , Feb. 1 , 2007 ) was also spelled out for the Pakistani ruling elite by Project Humanbeingsfirst in its December 21 , 2007 wakeup call ( “ Wakeup to the grotesque reality of the ' Grand Chessboard ' ! ” ) .
Neither heads - up warnings are very un-obvious , and both set - ups have been long time in the making , from even before “ Inside Iran 's Secret War for Iraq ” , Time August 15 , 2005 , which followed on the heels of the famous “ all options are on the table ” , to Bush speech , Jan 10 , 2007 , to “ Iran 's secret plan ” , Guardian , May 22 2007 , to Petraeus ' finally holding up the ' smoking gun ' on April 09 , 2008 .
And yet , remarkably , no visible rational self - defense is transpiring .
With the American President 's now exact statements on Pakistan , which seem to be the culmination of systematically built - up statements on both Iran and Pakistan from American military commanders and intelligence chiefs over the past years , it should be obvious to even the biggest dunces in Pakistan that another nuclear terrorist event anywhere in the world , will directly be blamed upon Pakistan ( and Iran ) .
With NATO and American troops already amassed at its borders in significant numbers to take the plunge into Pakistan en flying - route to Tehran at a moments notice from the White House , there will be absolutely no time after crossing the tipping point in America which “ will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison ” .
And yet , it is necessary to emphasize again , no effective self - defense by any victim is transpiring , as beleaguered Iran is left standing alone by the world to become the next meal of “ primacy ” of the ' Hectoring Hegemons ' .
It is evident that the Pakistani leadership is entirely co-opted into systematically suiciding that nation by its prancing about at the “ unbirthday party ” with the “ Mad Hatter ” for the past eight years .
Today it appears entirely natural that the United States should just walk right in to ' save ' the Pakistanis from the ' radical islamists ' .
This was quite unimaginable just a few years ago , but every grotesque bomb blast , every few dozen peoples killed in it , every act of extreme violence , political violence , demonstrations , and uncertainty created by ' loose nukes ' mantras , culminating in the grotesque assassination of Benazir Bhutto , now makes it the most natural next step for the “ truly global superpower ” .
A deliberate orchestration of “ revolutionary times ” in Pakistan to make “ what is inconceivable in normal times possible in revolutionary times ” .
' Why ' is rather obvious once again .
But for those who do not bother to study the “ primacy ” craftsmanship of the ' hectoring hegemons ' , it is about the repartitioning of Pakistan to primarily create an independent and geostrategically significant ' Baluchistan ' nation – much like Kosovo 's orchestrated independence from Serbia – while finally de-nuking Pakistan !
This is only the phase - 1 of the repartition plan through violently induced “ birth pangs of a new Middle East ” , whereby , “ whatever we do we have to be certain that we 're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one . ” ( Rice , July 21 , 2006 )
See for instance , the Bernard Lewis Plan for the New Middle East , or the similar Lieutenant - Colonel Ralph Peters ' map for the New Middle East , in order to understand what “ pushing forward ” looks like in the minds of the ' hectoring hegemons ' .
The key point to note is not the precise new boundary lines , or its merits , but that there should be any new boundary lines forcibly drawn by anyone other than willingly by the peoples who live in these regions !
And today , the superpower is increasingly making higher levels of intrusive demands as a prelude to complete take over , as in Iraq , from allowing its citizen - staff to enter Pakistan at anytime on merely the American driver 's license as identification ( dispensing with visa and passport ) , to the point of now having a military liaison into Pakistan 's Nuclear Command Authority from the American Embassy in Islamabad ( See “ US goes for the jugular in Pakistan ” , The Times of India , April 15 , 2008 ) .
The invasion of both Iran and Pakistan are to be lock - step , as presciently outlined in the December 21 , 2007 Wakeup call to the Pakistani ruling elite , which followed on the heels of an earlier very detailed Open Letter to a Pakistani General by Project Humanbeingsfirst ( see “ Re- Imagining Pakistan 's Defenses ” , November 30 , 2007 ) .
But nothing .
No newsmedia in Pakistan picked any of these warnings to print , nor did any of the famed columnists who fill the pages of Pakistani newspapers dared to comment on it publicly in their own columns .
The United States public too has been so dexterously primed with the multi-faceted mantras crafted of the “ sudden threat or challenge to the public 's sense of domestic well - being ” , that the latest public survey by Gallup Poll released on March 31 , 2008 , shows “ Iran topped the list , with 25 percent naming it when asked which country is the greatest U.S. enemy , ” .
And this “ enemy ” is going to spring Martial law in America , sooner rather than later .
Needless to say , none of the American newsmedia , including both NYT and LAT , have bothered to print any of Project Humanbeingsfirst 's analyses .
It is crucially important to state this now because soon , after the tipping point is crossed , or perhaps after the nuclear Rubicon is crossed , both nations ' newsmedia will come screaming “ eureka ” , ex post facto !
Or perhaps it will be the historians !
In order to continually remind the deftly primed American and Western public that all this is indeed pre-meditated Orwellian orchestration of “ imperial mobilization ” and not just mere happenstance in reaction to chaotically unfolding global events due to GWOT against some super - resourceful ' Islamist pirates ' hiding in the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan 's border regions from whence , the absurdity of the immanent threat to the armed to the teeth superpower is today , April 17 , 2008 , noted as “ Elevated ” , it is educational to revisit Zbigniew Brzezinski and thank him for explaining the imperial insights and superpower aspirations so unabashedly in ' the Grand Chessboard ' .
If only the people in America would read their own ' Mein Kampfs ' and try to appreciate the “ full spectrum ” institutional frameworks of the mighty state under which it is being deployed :
“ It is also a fact that America is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad .
This limits the use of America 's power , especially its capacity for military intimidation .
Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy .
But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion , except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public 's sense of domestic well - being .
The economic self - denial ( that is defense spending ) , and the human sacrifice ( casualties even among professional soldiers ) required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts .
Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization . ”
“ Public opinion polls suggest that only a small minority ( 13 percent ) of Americans favor the proposition that 'as the sole remaining superpower , the US should continue to be the preeminent world leader in solving international problems ' .
...
Moreover , as America becomes an increasingly multicultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat .
....
More generally , cultural change in America may also be uncongenial to the sustained exercise abroad of genuinely imperial power .
That exercise requires a high degree of doctrinal motivation , intellectual commitment , and patriotic gratification .
...
Mass communications have been playing a particularly important role in that regard , generating a strong revulsion against any selective use of force that entails even low levels of casualties . ”
And thus all can see just how effectively “ Mass communications have been playing a particularly important role in that regard ” ; and based on the sociological insights into power and the “ populist ” impediments to its supreme flaunting , just how effectively mass communications have been utilized to co-opt the “ democratic instincts ” of the American public ( see “ Iran , the Associated Press , and Covert - War of ' Imperial Mobilization ' ” ) .
And as this LA Times oped “ Target : Bin Laden ” of April 13 , 2008 , shows , the mainstream American news organizations continue to provide ample space for perpetuating the mythology of Bin Laden as the quintessential boogieman enabler of “ imperial mobilization ” – from 911 to WMD , and now to Pakistan and Iran – while the FBI itself does not put that name on its own most wanted list in that connection , noting :
“ The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden ’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 .
Bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection to 9/11 . ”
( Rex Tomb , Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI , speaking to the Muckraker Report on June 5 , 2006 . )
The courageous Muckraker , as no more than just an ordinary member of the American civil society , then shows the minimum indignation that is expected from any decent conscionable human being irrespective of their indoctrination level and their belief in the “ United we Stand ” with the State at the ' unbirthday party ' :
“ Through the talking heads in the mainstream media , the Bush Administration told the American people that Usama Bin Laden was Public Enemy Number One and responsible for the deaths of nearly 3000 people on September 11 , 2001 .
Yet nearly five years later , the FBI says that it has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 . ”
“ Remember , on June 5 , 2006 , FBI spokesman , Chief of Investigative Publicity Rex Tomb said , “ The FBI has no hard evidence connecting Usama Bin Laden to 9/11 . ”
This should be headline news worldwide .
The challenge to the reader is to find out why it is not .
Why has the U.S. media blindly read the government - provided 9/11 scripts , rather than investigate without passion , prejudice , or bias , the events of September 11 , 2001 ?
Why has the U.S. media blacklisted any guest that might speak of a government sponsored 9/11 cover - up , rather than seeking out those people who have something to say about 9/11 that is contrary to the government ’s account ? ”
To add to the narrative , the New York Times , rather surprisingly , ran a front - page exposé on Sunday , April 20 , 2008 , headlined : “ Behind TV Analysts , Pentagon ’s Hidden Hand ” .
It has to be read in full in order to appreciate its import – after the fact of course , the invasion of Iraq now being fait accompli .
And that is precisely the “ important role ” of not just the “ mass communications ” , but also “ the doctrinal motivations , intellectual commitment ” in pursuing the mantra of ' Bin Laden ' and ' Al Qaeeda ' , for on the heels of a “ catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new pearl harbor ” ( PNAC , page 51 ) , it provides the much needed “ patriotic gratification ” to enable “ imperial mobilization ” in a “ populist democracy ” , as is now evident .
One cannot ignore the fact that the New York Times itself played its own role dutifully at the time pushing the mantra of WMDs in Iraq , which followed upon the heels of the mantra of ' Bin Laden ' doing 9/11 , and continues to do so even today pushing the new mantra of ' loose nukes ' that ' Bin Laden ' and ' Al Qaeeda ' will hijack , and the mantra of ' Iranian WMDs ' , in order to help synthesize public opinion for the new wars on Iran , Pakistan , and Syria .
Ex post facto , even George Bush will write a book detailing his masterful role in constructing the New World Order .
Indeed , Project HumanbeingsfirstTM
' clairvoyantly ' predicts that the scientific study finally published in a peer - reviewed Civil Engineering online Journal only this past week , on how the three WTC towers ( WTC1 , WTC2 , and WTC7 ) collapsed so suddenly at almost free fall speed as if it were controlled demolition , titled “ Fourteen Points of Agreement with official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction ” , ever gains mainstream traction before the tipping point , it will be attempted to be blamed upon ' Bin Laden ' .
It will be asserted by newsmedia , by the Pentagon , the White House , and by the scholars and technicians of ' empire ' , that the only obvious candidate who had the capability to pull off such an outrageous controlled demolition on America , is ' Bin Laden ' and ' Al Qaeeda ' !
When that transpires , I hope that these bastions of ' ubermensch ' intellect will at least have the sense to get the FBI to first update their most wanted poster of Usama Bin Laden !
Its snapshot , taken on April 22 , 2008 , is archived for the disingenuous “ eureka ” moment of posterity similar to the one displayed by the afore - stated Sunday NYT , and by the 2005 Iraq Study group , at : http://tinyurl.com/5swdoq.
It has today become necessary to state blatant obviousness explicitly :
All those pushing the mantras of the Pentagon and the White House , regardless of its ' well argued ' rationales at the time , are active and complicit participants in synthesizing “ doctrinal motivations ” which span the gamut of manufactured consent , to manufactured dissent .
This criminal priming of the “ populist democracy ” now naturally enables “ the first , only , and last truly global superpower ” to be fully “ autocratic abroad ” in its unlimited “ capacity for military intimidation ” .
Please note how Brzezinski concludes the aspirations of the truly global superpower :
“ Geostrategic success in that cause would represent a fitting legacy of America 's role as the first , only , and last truly global superpower . ”
And it is precisely in that overarching “ Geostrategic ... cause ” , that Iran and Pakistan are imminently staged on the nuclear chopping block , while some American city is made expendable to create the new “ catalyzing event ” for “ imperial mobilization ” that “ will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison ” .
All conveniently enabled by the continued Orwellian use of the fiction of ' Bin Laden ' and its various surrogates including ' Al Qaeeda ' .
If these stick - wielding cave - dwelling antediluvians possess such awesome powers as to bring down a superpower to its knees , forcing it to spend 3.1 trillion dollars next year a majority of it on defense , and its peoples to lose all their democratic freedoms and civil liberties , then they are surely more powerful than the USSR !
Or at least , a wonderful ' Ali Baba ' bedtime story .
I used to invent such tales while putting my kids to bed when they were younger , and in my stories , the ' Ali Baba ' was a Herculean Mr. Good - deeds and Mother Teresa rolled into one – flying off to far away places on his magic carpet with his band of 40 ( along with his wife and children who were , only co-incidentally , named after my own ) , and with his awesome powers of Superman , solving all the problems of the world .
But I think the ' empire 's ' rendition of ' Ali Baba ' is more effective for “ imperial mobilization ” .
It is pointless debating and dissecting the ever changing ' leaves of the tree ' in the battlefields of conquests ( as in this battlefield analysis ' Iran should be “ Set Up for an Attack ” ' ) when the matters are plainly manifest in its DNA , and in the illegality , by international law , of “ goosestep [ ping ] the Herrenvolk across international frontiers ” ( see “ The attack of ' Al - Qaeeda ' and Pakistani ' loose nukes ' ” and “ Nuremberg : The grotesquely dancing trumpeting elephant in the newlywed 's bed ! ” ) .
It would do well for the few remaining sane and conscionable peoples in America , its handful of un co-opted media persons , politicians , thinkers , peace activists and others who care about their nation and seek to effectively overturn the hydra of “ full spectrum dominance ” , to stay focussed on the DNA of the ' tree ' : the “ supreme international crime ” that is the alpha and omega of the matter .
It is the prima facie all encompassing harbinger of “ all the evil that follows ” , as defined at Nuremberg , and so must remain the necessary and sufficient first focus for stopping “ imperial mobilization ” by unequivocally charging it as “ the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole ” .
Further analysis of its vagaries in various battlefields of conquest is superfluous when the highest order bit is to stop it before the nuclear Rubicon is crossed .
If the conscionable peoples in the world and their national leaderships cannot even unite in the definition of what is crime , and what is the “ supreme ” crime , and cannot channel their collective energies to a single point of focus on deterring the “ supreme international crime ” , matters are already fait accompli .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki blasted the U.S. State Department for renewing its contract with the Blackwater security firm , saying the company has yet to answer for what he called a " massacre " last year .
Baghdad 's Nusoor Square tries to return to normalcy in September , days after a firefight involving Blackwater .
The Iraqi government was not consulted on the State Department decision , he said .
" No judicial action has been taken and no compensation has been made , " al - Maliki said Sunday .
" Therefore , this extension requires the approval of the Iraqi government , and the government would want to resolve the outstanding issues with this company . "
According to Iraqi officials , Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people -- including women and children -- on September 16 at Baghdad 's Nusoor Square .
Watch why Iraqis fear the firm »
Survivors and victims ' family members allege Blackwater guards started shooting without provocation , but Blackwater said armed insurgents attacked its guards .
An Iraqi probe accused the guards of committing " premeditated murder . "
The FBI also is investigating .
After the shootings , a joint Iraqi- U.S. committee was set up , and Iraqi officials told their American counterparts that the rules for engagement and use of force must be changed , Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said .
New rules were established .
Among them , a State Department security officer now accompanies any convoy manned by contractors , and each vehicle is outfitted with a security camera , the recordings from which are sent to a command center , al - Dabbagh said .
However , al - Maliki said Sunday that the renewal of Blackwater 's contract is n't final " because they committed a massacre against Iraqis and until now this matter has not been resolved . "
The Iraqi government wants Blackwater to fall under the jurisdiction of Iraqi law , al - Dabbagh said .
" Most importantly , the Iraqi investigation concluded that Blackwater committed a crime at Nusoor Square , " al - Dabbagh said , adding that U.S. officials said they will review the State Department contract if any Blackwater personnel are convicted as a result of the FBI investigation .
Blackwater is one of three contractors -- along with Triple Canopy and DynCorp -- working under a " task order " in Iraq to provide security services .
About 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials in Iraq .
Under a provision put in place early during the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq , security contractors have immunity from Iraqi prosecution .
An adviser to al - Maliki , Sadeq al - Rikabi , said the Blackwater contract would be temporary because the U.N. mandate under which the U.S. operates in Iraq will expire at year 's end .
It will be replaced by a bilateral agreement that 's under negotiation .
" No doubt , the role of the U.S. military and contractors will be agreed on " in the new arrangement , al - Rikabi said .
The State Department signed a five - year contract with Blackwater in 2006 .
The deal must be reviewed every year , and is up for renewal next month .
Greg Starr , acting assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , essentially said last week that Blackwater 's contract will be renewed .
Blackwater must follow Iraqi laws , Starr said , and new rules of procedure and supervision have been outlined in a memorandum of understanding .
Starr said he was satisfied with the changes .
The American government , in particular Ryan Crocker , U.S. ambassador to Iraq , will examine the FBI report on its investigation before making decisions on whether to maintain the contract .
However , Starr said , " I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going to find in its investigation .
It 's complex .
I think the U.S. government needs protective services . "
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment , referring all questions to the State Department .

There was no immediate word from the U.S. military .
• Nine Iraqis were killed and 65 others wounded Monday in clashes between U.S. and Iraqi forces and Shiite militiamen in the capital 's Sadr City , an Interior Ministry spokesman said .
Fighting on Sunday , which also involved members of cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia , killed 20 people and wounded 52 more in the Baghdad slum , the Interior Ministry said .

• Al - Sadr has called for a demonstration Wednesday in Baghdad against the U.S. presence in Iraq .
The protest would coincide with the fifth anniversary of the toppling of Saddam Hussein 's regime and with scheduled testimony in Washington from top U.S. officials in Iraq .
• A U.S. soldier was killed by small - arms fire Monday after a roadside bomb detonated near his vehicle during a patrol in eastern Baghdad , the U.S. military said .

Using a virtual pendulum and its real - world counterpart , scientists at the University of Illinois have created the first mixed reality state in a physical system .
Through bidirectional instantaneous coupling , each pendulum " sensed " the other , their motions became correlated , and the two began swinging as one .
" In a mixed reality state there is no clear boundary between the real system and the virtual system , " said U. of I. physicist Alfred Hubler .
" The line blurs between what 's real and what is n't . "
In the experiment , Hubler and graduate student Vadas Gintautas connected a mechanical pendulum to a virtual one that moved under time - tested equations of motion .
The researchers sent data about the real pendulum to the virtual one , and sent information about the virtual pendulum to a motor that influenced motion of the real pendulum .
When the lengths of the two pendulums were dissimilar , they remained in a dual reality state of uncorrelated motion and both soon came to rest .
When the lengths of the pendulums were similar , however , they " suddenly noticed each other , synchronized their motions , and danced together indefinitely , " said Hubler , who also is affiliated with the U. of I. Center for Complex Systems Research .
In this mixed reality state , the real pendulum and the virtual pendulum moved together as one .
While mechanical pendulums have been coupled with springs to create correlated motion in the past , this is the first time a mechanical system has been coupled with a virtual system .
The resulting mixed reality state was made possible by the computational speed of current computer technology .
" Computers are now fast enough that we can detect the position of the real pendulum , compute the dynamics of the virtual pendulum , and compute appropriate feedback to the real pendulum , all in real time , " said Hubler , who will describe the experiment and discuss potential ramifications at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society , to be held in New Orleans , March 10 - 14 .
From flight simulators to video games , virtual worlds are becoming more and more accurate depictions of the real world .
There could come a point , a phase transition , where the boundary between reality and virtual reality disappears , Hubler said .
And that could present problems .
For example , no longer able to determine what is real and what is not , an individual might become defensive in the real world because of a threat perceived in a virtual world .
A better understanding of this potential phase transition is needed , Hubler said .
" As virtual systems continue to improve and better approximate real ones , even weak couplings -- like those between real and virtual pendulums -- could induce sudden transitions to mixed reality states . "

In keeping with this site ’s love of helping out with holiday plans , this is a list on the top 10 most dangerous places in the world – these are all places you might consider not visiting when planning your next holiday .
Some of the items may be a little controversial , but you are , of course , free to ignore our advice and go anyway !
10 Russia
In this crime - ridden , ex-Soviet state , no longer does the government stuff their Armani suits with rubles , but the vandals and gangsters .
The Russian mafia runs amuck , there are more gangsters than police , and a Russian is assassinated every 18 minutes , averaging 84 murders per day in a nation of 143 million .
The nucleus of Russian crime is stationed in the Republic of Chechnya , a region within Russia just north of Georgia .
Prostitution , drug trafficking , and underground restaurants are arbitrarily controlled by the Chechens .
Foreigners are kidnapped more frequently due to the higher ransom allocated .
Crimes towards include but are not limited to : pick pocketing wallets , cell phones , cameras , cash , and physical assaults .
From superpower to Third World country , think tanks are beginning to speculate if communism really was the cure for Russia .

9 Brazil
Advertisement
For anyone traveling to Brazil , it is not a matter of whether you get mugged , it is a matter of when !
Grinding poverty still lives alongside incredible wealth in a country that is riding a wave of economic growth .
But with prosperity , rates of crime have also soared .
Street crime is rampant in parts of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo , and whilst many victims are left unharmed , having a broken bottle put to your throat for your bracelet is not pleasant .
The incidences of “ quicknappings ” has risen in major cities .
This involves being abducted and taken to an ATM to pay your ransom .
If you ca n’t pay , thanks to mobile technology , your family is only a call away .
Along with street crime , organized criminal groups have waged wars against police and public institutions that were unable to be bribed .
Prison riots are brutally suppressed , drugs and narco - terrorism claim civilian casualties and if you survive all that – the piranhas are waiting .
8 South Africa
Any nation described as the ‘ rape capital of the world ’ should be one to take extra special care in .
Although rape had shown a declining trend to 113.7 in 2004 , it increased in 2005 to 118.3 per 100 000 .
Another damning statistic for South Africa is its appallingly high murder rate .
The 2010 World Cup host is consistently in the Top 5 list of countries by homicide rate .
Most crime is confined to poor areas but it has n’t stopped gated communities springing up all over South Africa and armed guards protecting wealthy tourist groups .
Farming in South Africa has become one of the most dangerous professions in the world .
The murder rate for farmers is 313 per 100 000 – about 8 times the national average .
And like anywhere , sex can be very dangerous in South Africa , where more than 10 million people are infected with HIV .
7 Burundi
This small , densely populated and poor nation has giant problems .
A civil war between Hutus and Tutsis tore the nation apart between 1993 and 2006 .
A ceasefire was declared however most provisions have not been implemented .
Mass murder and mayhem compete with environmental problems as the biggest headaches for the people of Burundi .
The list of assassinated leaders is extensive , and control of the nation has changed hands numerous times in the last 50 years .
Crimes committed by roaming gangs and armed children are risks for visitors .
Muggings , carjackings and kidnappings await , so you are advised not to stop the car for souvenirs .
Should you be injured or harmed while in Burundi , you may need to be well trained , as local clinics have almost no resources to assist you .
6 Antarctica
While murder , rape and robbery may not be a big problem in this part of the world , the hostile conditions are .
Antarctica is home to some extreme weather conditions , with the mercury regularly dropping below - 60 degrees Celsius ( - 100 F ) and winds tearing in at more than 100 km / hr .
If exposed to this weather for more than an hour , you will most certainly die .
Antarctica has no hospitals , no food to forage and if you get lost , not a lot of hope .
Stay with the tour groups .
At least there is a McDonald ’s at Scott Base if you manage to find it .
5 Afghanistan
This nation has for hundreds of years , been one of the worlds most strategically important and lusted after territories .
However it remains one of the poorest , undeveloped and unstable .
During the Soviet invasion , the Red Army planted more than 12 million landmines in Afghanistan .
Hundreds of people are killed , shredded , and maimed each year due to these insidious devices .
Following the Soviets came the Taliban , whose control meant women were banned from jobs and universities .
In 2001 , the United States overthrew the Taliban , but banditry , tribal rivalries and drug related violence has left the nation unstable .
Suicide bombings are a constant threat , and nobody in Afghanistan is safe .
The most lethal suicide attack occurred in Baghlan Province in November 2007 , killing more than 70 people .
Did I mention Afghanistan is also the worlds largest supplier of top grade hashish and opium ?
4 Somalia
Somalia is a failed state known for its anarchy , corruption , lack of government , and starvation .
Travelers are warned against entering Somalia , the self - proclaimed “ independent Republic of Somaliland ” or even sailing near the Horn Of Africa .
Pirates patrol these waters armed with AK - 47s and will seize craft and hold crews to ransom .
Inter - clan fighting has claimed thousands of lives in the north of the country , while territorial control in the capital , Mogadishu is carved up between many clans and warlords .
Ethiopia attacked Islamic troops in Somalia in late 2006 , resulting in hundreds of casualties and the internal displacement of thousands .
Heck , if this place is too much for the Marines , what chance do you stand ?
Make sure your insurance is fully up to date .
3 Sudan
Desperation , death and destruction are synonymous with Sudan .
Terrorism is a mainstay of this nation , which has been controlled by Islamic military regimes since its independence .
Some of the worlds most famous killers have earned their stripes in Sudan , finishing with degrees in car - bombing , rocket launching and genocide .
Violence is rife in the Darfur region between government - backed militias , government troops and local insurgent groups .
Sudan has been in open warfare with Chad partly due to the Darfur conflict .
Since 2003 , 230,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from Darfur .
More than two million have died during the 2 civil wars that spanned the last 50 years .
Along with its bleak desert conditions , Sudan is one of the worst places on the planet .
2 Colombia
Kidnapping is the main worry in Colombia .
There were 2338 kidnappings in Colombia in 1998 .
Of the victims , 138 were killed by their captors .
Ranked Fourth in the world for murders with 69.98/100000 in 2006 , the popular targets are mayors , with dozens of them being slain each year .
And of course , who can forget cocaine ?
Colombia supplies 75 % of the worlds supply and thanks to Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel , paramilitary groups have waged war on the government in a bloody conflict with no end in sight .
Even those working in the name of charity are not excluded from the frenzy .
In 2005 , 5 Catholic missionaries were murdered , down from 9 in 1999 .
Colombia ’s beautiful coast and rugged mountains should make it a tourist paradise , instead it is among the most feared destinations you can visit .
1 Iraq
It does n’t matter whether you are George Bush , Pele or Chuck Norris – you are not safe in Iraq .
Despite its rich history and its oil reserves , it is a ruined nation that is wracked with violence , despair and confusion .
Since 2003 , the United States has occupied Iraq which has led to a civil war claiming the lives of more than 650 000 civilians .
Al - Qaeda , Sunni insurgents , Shiite security forces , Kurdish rebels , American soldiers , Turkish troops and criminals are involved in a cycle of violence that unfortunately , will not abate any time soon .
Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) , Explosively Formed Penetrators ( EFPs ) and mines are a constant threat , as are suicide bombers who have slain hundreds .
Kidnappings and random killings are reported with almost mind - numbing frequency .
Since 2003 , 2 million Iraqis have fled to neighboring countries and another 1.9 million in Iraq remain internally displaced .
Depleted uranium used as armor- piercing rounds will poison Iraqi civilians and US servicemen for decades .
Truly , a hell on earth .
+ United States of America
For the average traveller , the USA is fairly safe , but the numbers do not lie .
There are more than 200 million guns in the USA and more than 50 murders a day , 10 times the rate of Germany .
Nearly 5000 people die a year in truck crashes , about 6000 pedestrains die on the streets and 31000 people end their own lives .
The USA now leads all nations in violent crime and leads all nations with incarcerations now standing at 2.3 million .
American citizens also make up the greatest number of criminals serving time in overseas prisons .
Militias , hate groups and other right wing radicals all spread their message of violence and are known to throw around the odd pipe - bomb .
The government is not much better , spending a whopping $ 600 billion a year on defense in order to contain the handful of nations hostile to it .

Explanation : On April 12th , 1961 , Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Alexseyevich Gagarin became the first human in space .
His remotely controlled Vostok 1 spacecraft lofted him to an altitude of 200 miles and carried him once around planet Earth .
Commenting on the first view from space he reported , " The sky is very dark ; the Earth is bluish .
Everything is seen very clearly " .
Alan Shepard , the first US astronaut , would not be launched until almost a month later and then on a comparatively short suborbital flight .
Born on March 9 , 1934 , Gagarin was a military pilot before being chosen for the first group of cosmonauts in 1960 .
As a result of his historic flight he became an international hero and legend .
Killed when his MIG jet crashed during a training flight on March 27 , 1968 , Gagarin was given a hero 's funeral , his ashes interred in the Kremlin Wall .
On yet another April 12th , in 1981 , NASA launched the first space shuttle .

7 Accidental Middle Finger
ValueVision host Eddy Nelson here decides to give the finger to the camera shortly after tipping over the product that he is trying to sell :
If we are to believe the information on this YouTube video , the rude gesture was not meant for the millions ( well , dozens ) of customers watching , but rather for the director , who apparently had scolded him for knocking the ring over .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The same guy who Eddy was flipping off also has the power to switch which camera is live , and so it was some quick thinking on his part to put Eddy on live TV while he was in mid-gesture .
There is a lesson to be learned here , kids .
How They Tried To Save It :
Apparently by licking his lips a bunch and refusing to look at the camera .
The best part about this video is that Eddie is completely aware of how screwed he is from the moment that you hear the crew laugh in the background .
His painful expression the entire time is only accented by his blatant attempt to act like nothing is wrong when he asks the lady , " One left in size seven ? "
As if he is REALLY worried that someone at home is n't going to get their crappy fake gold ring instead of the fact that he 's going to be fired as soon as he steps off camera .
Rove refuses to deny contacting DOJ about Siegelman prosecution RAW STORY
Published : Sunday May 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This ABC's George Stephanopoulos talked with Karl Rove about his role in the prosecution of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Rove repeated the claim that he learned about the prosecution in the newspaper but refused to deny that he had contacted the Justice Department to discuss the prosecution .
Partial Transcript STEPHANOPOULOS :
We 're just about out of time .
As we know and our viewers probably know you were subpoenaed this week by the house Judiciary Committee to give testimony on any involvement you may have had with the prosecution of the former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
He 's claiming there was selective prosecution .
He 's out on bail now even though he was convicted .
He said your fingerprints are all over it .
The House report said -- " in Selma 2007 a Republican attorney for northern Alabama named Jill Simpson wrote an affidavit stating that in November 2002 she heard a prominent Alabama Republican operative named Bill Canary say that Karl Rove had contacted the Justice Department about bringing a prosecution of Don Siegelman .
The question for Mr. Rove is whether he directly or indirectly discussed the possibility of prosecuting Don Siegelman with either the Justice Department or Alabama Republicans . " did you ?
ROVE : Let me say three things , first of all , I think it 's interesting -- everybody who was supposedly on that telephone call that miss simpson talks about says the call never took place .
I 'd say -- STEPHANOPOULOS : Although she produced a cell phone record according to the committee .
ROVE : Well , I would say three things .
First of all , I have -- I learned about Don Siegelman 's prosecution by reading about it in the newspaper .
Second of all , this is really about a Constitutional question of the separation of powers .
Congress , the house judiciary committee wants to be able to call presidential aides on its whim up to testify , violating the separation of powers , executive privilege has been asserted by the White House .
In a similar instance in the senate .
It will probably be asserted quickly in the House .
Third , the White House and -- has agreed , I 'm not -- I 'm not asserting any personal privilege .
The White House has offered , and my lawyers offered several different ways in which if the House wants to find out information about this they can find out information about this .
And they 've refused to avail themselves of those opportunities .
We did n't say , close off any option to do anything else you want to do in the future .
We said if you want to hear about this let 's sit down and talk about this and then you 're entitled to do what you want to do in the future .
This is now tied up in court .
It 's going to be tied up in court and settled in court .
And frankly the house last week doing this is , you know , duplicating what the Senate has done .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But to be clear you did not contact the Justice Department about this case ?
ROVE : I read about -- I 'm going to simply say what i've said before , which is I found out about Don Siegelman 's investigation and indictment by reading it in the newspaper .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But that 's not a denial .
ROVE : I 've -- you know , I read -- I heard about it , read about it , learned about it for the first time by reading about it in the newspaper .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Mr. Rove , thanks very much .

Just when you think Indiana could n't become a bigger national mockery of human rights , Tony Zirkle is willing to step right in there and push us that extra yard further .
A hat tip to Hoosier Access for finding this picture of 2nd district congressional candidate Tony Zirkle honoring Adolph Hitler 's birthday .
( You might remember him as the Republican candidate supporting racial segregation . )
Click the picture to enlarge .
Hoosier Access reports :
On Sunday , Zirkle spoke to a crowd of nearly 60 neo -Nazis / white supremacists gathered in Chicago to commemorate Hitler 's birthday .
The fact that Tony Zirkle , a candidate for United States Congress , would honor a gathering of neo -Nazis who believe one of the most evil men the world has ever known was in fact a great leader , is utterly despicable and beyond the pale .
Tony Zirkle has disgraced himself .
Suddenly Oklahoma City starts to look good again .

BAGHDAD —
The war is over on Sixth Street , where Sahar al - Jawari ’s family lives in a modest brick house .
Dust has filled the shrapnel holes in concrete fences , stagnant water has pooled in the crater left by a roadside bomb , and the ash and the few charred chunks of the Iraqi police car that the bomb blew up are barely visible on the sidewalk .
But Jawari , 33 , has little faith that her life is about to improve .
Every night the wind carries the sounds of gunshots and occasional explosions from other parts of Baghdad , where the war still goes on .
Every day is a struggle to get by in a city that gets only four hours of power and running water a day .
Jawari is divorced and unemployed , but Iraq ’s weak government gives her no financial aid .
Nor does it make her deadbeat ex-husband pay child support to help raise her 12 - year - old daughter , Roula .
“ We have no money , no electricity , no water , no security , no future , nothing , ” Jawari says .
“ Maybe in 50 years it will get better . ”
Many Iraqis in this part of southwestern Baghdad say the same thing .
They have little hope for help from a government that has been unable to deliver even the most basic services , and little faith in the Iraqi security forces , tainted by their past association with sectarian militias and infamous for defecting under fire .
And although American forces have effectively established security in the streets here , every time residents go outside , bomb craters , bullet holes and buildings damaged by explosions remind them of the sectarian violence that raged here less than a year ago .
Sahar and Roula live with Sahar ’s mother , Salimah , and her two nieces , Basmah , 16 , and Thohara , 14 .
The girls ’ mother , Jawari ’s sister , died of kidney disease 12 years ago : Because of the United Nations ’ sanctions and mismanagement by the dictatorial government of Saddam Hussein , Baghdad ’s hospitals did not have the proper medicine to treat her , and the family could not afford to send her abroad for surgery .
The girls ’ father , an engineer , died last year of a heart attack .
“ He could not bear what we are suffering in Iraq , ” Jawari says .
On a recent afternoon , the women and girls gathered in the kitchen to listen to Jawari ’s aunt , Nuriyah , who lives in Denmark and came to Baghdad to visit her family .
Nuriyah immigrated to Denmark 10 years ago .
“ Over there , we live in heaven , ” Nuriyah told them .
“ All the people there are good .
They help everyone , even Iraqis .
They send me a social worker to clean my house once a week .
They give me health insurance .
And every 14 days a nurse comes and gives me my medicine — for asthma , for high sugar content in my blood , for cholesterol and high blood pressure . ”
Jawari shook her head .
“ They take care of them as though they were little children , ” she said .
“ I want to go to Denmark , any place , just to leave Iraq .
What is here for me ? ”
“ That ’s a pretty pessimistic view .
Iraq is going to get better , ” interjected U.S. Army Lt. Rusty Mason , whose platoon was patrolling Sixth Street that day and who stopped by Jawari ’s house .
“ People are giving their lives to improve the life here : American soldiers , other soldiers , ” said Mason .
Four soldiers from his platoon were killed not far from Sixth Street in March when an explosively formed projectile , one of the devices that U.S. forces say are supplied to Iraq ’s sectarian militias by Iran , pierced the armor of their Bradley fighting vehicle .
“ Iraqis are giving their lives . ”
“ We saw nothing good , ” Jawari shot back .
Her family fled the violence that engulfed Sixth Street last summer , when Sunni and Shiite militias battled each other in the streets of this neighborhood , Saidiyah .
The women stayed with relatives in another part of Baghdad , and when they returned , they found their door broken and their computer and television missing .
The government said it would give all returning refugees a one - time payment of approximately $ 900 to help them resettle in their homes .
But in Saidiyah , where almost 400 families have returned since February , only 285 have received the money , said Lt. Col.
Johnnie Johnson , whose 4-64th Armor Battalion of the 4th Brigade , 3rd Infantry Division , patrols the area .
Jawari ’s family was not among them .
The family depends on the government - issued ration cards , which all Baghdad residents receive to buy heavily subsidized rice , flour , oil , sugar and chickpeas .
To pay for electricity , clothes and the rare treats of meat or fried fish — once every month or two — Jawari and her mother have been selling their jewelry .
They also sold a plot of land they had owned in the country .
Even on a diet of rice , eggs and pasta , the family spends between $ 250 and $ 400 a month .
Mason tried words of encouragement .
“ Things will get better , ” he said .
“ The security is already better .
Hopefully , soon the power will get better in all of Iraq . ”
Jawari shrugged .
“ Under Saddam Hussein , that ’s what they used to tell us , too :
This will get better , that will get better , the power will get better .
And — nothing , ” she said , showing Mason the empty palms of her hands .
Then she added , in English , for emphasis : “ Never . ”
Justice Department Increasingly Avoiding Corporate Prosecutions

The Justice Department has put off prosecuting more than fifty companies suspected of wrongdoing over the last three years .
The decline in prosecutions is seen as a deliberate and dramatic shift in policy .
While the news reported in a front - page article in the New York Times surprised many , the Justice Department ’s use of so called “ deferred prosecution agreements ”  is nothing new .
Back in 2005 , a report released by the Corporate Crime Reporter profiled dozens of these cases and warned against their use .
We speak with Russell Mokhiber , editor of the Corporate Crime Reporter .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Why is the Justice Department increasingly avoiding corporate prosecutions ?
In a front - page article yesterday , the New York Times reported that the Justice Department has put off prosecuting more than fifty companies suspected of wrongdoing over the last three years .
The decline in prosecutions is seen as a deliberate and dramatic shift in policy .
Rather than take corporations to court for high - profile cases , the Bush administration has instead relied on what are known as “ deferred prosecution agreements . ” 
These agreements impose fines and appoint an outside monitor to enforce internal changes at the company .
Terms of the deals are often kept secret .
AMY GOODMAN : While yesterday ’s New York Times article may have surprised many , the Justice Department ’s use of prosecution agreements is nothing new .
In fact , back in 2005 , a report released by the Corporate Crime Reporter profiled dozens of these cases and warned against their use .
Russell Mokhiber joins us now , editor of the Corporate Crime Reporter , in Washington , D.C. Explain what they are , Russell .
RUSSELL MOKHIBER : Good morning , Amy .
Good morning , Juan .
As you pointed out , Amy , if you go to our website , corporatecrimereporter.com , and click on the left side , the report on the left side , it will pop up , and there ’s the date : December 2005 , “ The Rise of Deferred and Non Prosecution Agreements . ” 
And just as a prelude here , we sent that report out to all the major media outlets , and the only two to pick it up were Democracy Now ! and Marketplace on NPR .
So it was surprising to me to see this on the front page of the New York Times yesterday , and in today ’s New York Times , an editorial titled “ Going Soft on Corporate Crime , ”  which to me explained why the Times ran it , because they want to try and hook the Bush administration with going soft on corporate crime .
But as you and Juan and your listeners know , this is corporate - occupied territory .
And we have n’t heard a peep out of the Democrats in Congress , not one member of Congress in the Senate or the House saying , “ Let ’s criminally prosecute serious corporate crimes to conviction , ”  because they do n’t want to go back to that .
The key here is they want to get rid of corporate criminal liability .
This is what the corporations want .
So this is what used to happen .
The Justice Department would have evidence of serious corporate crimes .
They would criminally prosecute the company .
They would either get a guilty plea or take the company to trial .
And a jury would find the company either guilty or not guilty .
And there were so many of these that at the end of the last decade , we put out a report called “ The Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the 1990s , ”  and we just went through the ’90s , and we listed all of the corporations , all of the major American companies that had been convicted of crimes , and we ranked them by the amount of the criminal fine , from one to a hundred .
And we cut it off at a hundred .
We ’re not going to be able to do that for this decade .
Why ?
Because what do the corporations fear most ?
They fear adverse publicity .
They do n’t want the kids in the backseat saying , “ Mommy , do n’t go to BP .
They ’re a corporate criminal .
They killed fifteen workers in Texas . ” 
They do n’t want that .
They do n’t want to be labeled corporate criminals .
The second thing they fear is probation .
If a company is convicted of a crime , a judge can put a probation officer in the executive suite , so that if the company wants to dump pollutants into the river , the probation officer will report it back to the judge .
So that ’s the way – you ca n’t throw a corporation in jail , but you can restrict what it does .
So , as a result of that fear of corporate criminal liability , these white - collar crime defense lawyers , in connection with the Justice Department prosecutors , said , “ Hey , we do n’t need this .
We ’ll charge the company with a crime .
We ’ll come to an agreement , a deferred prosecution agreement , ”  which was intended for minor street crimes .
It ’s in the US attorneys ’ manual , intended to unclog the courts from minor street crimes so you can deal with serious corporate crimes .
“ We ’ll elevate these deferred prosecution agreements to major corporate crime cases , and we ’ll settle them .
We ’ll say we ’re charging you with a crime .
You committed a crime .
But we ’re not going to force you to admit .
We ’re not going to force you to plead guilty .
We ’re not going to force you to trial . ” 
And the result has been that there have been very few criminal convictions of major corporations over the last five or six years .
And instead , we ’re getting these deferred and non-prosecution agreements .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And , Russell , this happened after Enron , after WorldCom , after the huge scandals of the early part of the decade .
That ’s when they started deciding to , in the midst of a crime wave , to begin to adopt this type of policy ?
RUSSELL MOKHIBER : Yes , what happened was , Juan , they used the Arthur Andersen case as an excuse to move toward this kind of settlement .
Now , Arthur Andersen was dead in the water .
You ca n’t be an accountant – you ca n’t have public trust as an accountant and be known as Enron ’s auditor .
So it had nothing to do with this criminal prosecution of Arthur Andersen .
It had everything to do with the fact that Andersen was Enron ’s auditor .
So they were gone , but the Justice Department rightfully brought a criminal prosecution .
They , in fact , offered Andersen a deferred prosecution agreement ; Andersen rejected it .
And that was the end of Andersen .
Now , there are only four major accounting firms .
KPMG , by the way , one of the remaining four , was targeted by the Justice Department for a major criminal prosecution for these fraudulent tax shelters – promoting these fraudulent tax shelters , and the US attorney in New York was overruled by the Justice Department .
The Justice Department imposed a deferred prosecution agreement .
Now , the back story on this is , the corporate crime lobby , both Democrats and Republicans , have for years , throughout most of the century , wanted to get rid of corporate criminal liability .
And the Chicago School theorists put it this way : a corporation is not a person .
Or as Jeffrey Parker put it , a corporation has no mind and therefore can commit no crime .
And if a corporation is n’t a person , it should n’t be treated as a person in the criminal justice system .
That ’s their argument .
Well , my argument is , if a corporation is not a person and should n’t be treated as a person in the criminal justice system , then it should n’t have the constitutional rights of a person .
It should be stripped of its rights to free speech , commercial and political speech .
It should be stripped of its rights to a trial by jury .
It should be stripped of its protection against unreasonable searches and seizures .
You ca n’t have it both ways , but they want it both ways .
And this is not , as the New York Times put it in its editorial today , the Bush administration .
I mean , he ’s the corporate crime master - in - chief , but he ’s got all the members of Congress , including Democrats , going along with him .
There ’s no effective opposition , and it ’s a serious problem .
So what happens ?
We have an expanding – the corporations have expanding power , because the countervailing power of the Justice Department has been diminished .
The budgets have been slashed .
The prosecutions have been slashed .
This has been tracked by David Burnham at TRAC at Syracuse University .
And if you ’re not going to criminally prosecute a corporation and bring it to justice , it ’s going to continue to grow in its power , and that ’s what ’s happening here in corporate - occupied territory in Washington , D.C .
AMY GOODMAN : Russell Mokhiber , we ’re going to have to leave it here for now , but we hope to talk to you again , because this obviously is an ongoing issue , with many more of these agreements expected , especially around corporations ’ behavior on the subprime issue .

Keith Olbermann , obvious Obama partisan , is shocked , just shocked Hillary Clinton would suggest “ the inspirational leader ” Obama might be assassinated , as RFK was assassinated before him , the Democrat nomination within his reach .
Olbermann may be shocked , but Clinton ’s remark is simply politics as usual .
Assassination is part of the political mix , especially here in the United States .
Clinton , in her desperation , made a mistake , a faux pas .
She “ misspoke , ” something apparently only politicians are capable of doing .
Now she has backpedaled , apologized .
Here is the reality behind Clinton ’s remark — political crime families , like Cosa Nostra crime families , on occasion kill the competition .
RFK was not killed by a lone Sirhan Sirhan .
Video and photographic evidence reveals that three senior CIA operatives were at the scene of Robert Kennedy ’s assassination .
“ Three of these men have been positively identified as senior officers who worked together in 1963 at JMWAVE , the CIA ’s Miami base for its Secret War on Castro , ” the BBC reported in 2006 .
“ I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard , ” boasted David Morales , Chief of Operations .
But the CIA does not act on its own .
It simply takes orders .
“ Any sober examination of any of the assassinations leads directly to the same master list of agencies , political suspects and covert operatives , from the Kennedy killings to the crimes of Watergate and Iran - Contra , to the present day .
The system that made the RFK murder and cover - up possible is at its zenith today , with the openly criminal , overtly brutal George W. Bush administration , ” writes Larry Chin .
“ The conspiracy and cover - up of all the 1960s ’ assassinations must be understood not as isolated murders , but parts of a long and seamless continuum .
To borrow the words of Peter Dale Scott and Jonathan Marshall , authors of The Iran - Contra Connection , they are merely ‘ the outgrowth of a long tradition of covert US activities , ' ” covert activities directed by presidents , who are of course selected minions of the elite .
Last October , the elite ’s enthusiasm for Hillary was revealed when Lynn Forester de Rothschild , wife of Sir Evelyn Rothschild , said “ Hillary will be good for America , ” that is to say good for Rothschild and the elite .
Lord Rothschild supports John McCain , but then there really is little difference between McCain and Clinton .
As for Obama , he is considered an outsider , never mind he is supported by Zbigniew Brzezinski , the Trilateral Commission , and the Ford Foundation .
Call it a New World Order family feud .
And like the legendary Hatfield - McCoy family feud , people may end up dead .
It would be more accurate to call it a feud between cosche , or Mafia crime families .

The cannabis was hidden to test Narita airport 's sniffer dogs
An unwitting passenger arriving at Japan 's Narita airport has received 142g of cannabis after a customs test went awry , officials say .
A customs officer hid a package of the banned substance in a side pocket of a randomly chosen suitcase in order to test airport security .
Sniffer dogs failed to detect the cannabis and the officer could not remember which bag he had put it in .
Anyone finding the package has been asked to contact customs officials .
" This case was extremely regrettable .
I would like to deeply apologise , " said Narita International Airport 's customs head Manpei Tanaka .
Strict laws
The customs officer conducted the test on a passenger 's bag against regulations .
Normally a training suitcase is used .
" I knew that using passengers ' bags is prohibited , but I did it because I wanted to improve the sniffer dog's ability , " the officer was quoted as saying .
" The dogs have always been able to find it before ...
I became overconfident that it would work , " he said .
Japan has strict laws against drugs and possession of small amounts of cannabis can lead to a prison sentence .
Swayze is working on two films due out later this year American actor Patrick Swayze has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , his agent has confirmed .
However , his doctor said reports that the Dirty Dancing star had only five weeks to live were " absolutely untrue " .
The 55 - year - old is currently undergoing treatment and is continuing with his filming schedule .
Swayze , who also starred in the hit film Ghost , was diagnosed with cancer more than a month ago , the New York Post reported on its website .
How rumours fuelled the story His doctor George Fisher said in a statement : " Patrick has a very limited amount of disease and he appears to be responding well to treatment thus far .
" All of the reports stating the timeframe of his prognosis and his physical side effects are absolutely untrue . "
' Outpouring of support ' Swayze 's agent Annett Wolf added : " Patrick is continuing his normal schedule during this time , which includes working on upcoming projects .
" The outpouring of support and concern he has already received from the public is deeply appreciated by Patrick and his family . "
The actor originally trained as a dancer
It is understood he has been working on two films due for release this year .
In 2006 , Texas - born Swayze made his London West End debut in the musical Guys and Dolls .
Swayze , who is also a trained dancer , started his career on stage and his big break was playing Danny Zuko in a Broadway production of Grease .
He is best known for his roles in the films Ghost and Dirty Dancing but returned to musical theatre in 2003 when he joined the Broadway cast of Chicago .
Dirty Dancing was a surprise hit in 1987 and still has enduring appeal two decades later .
The movie cost £ 2.5 m to make but took over £ 90 m worldwide , and it went on to become the first film ever to sell a million copies on video .
It won critical acclaim , Golden Globes and the soundtrack topped the charts .

Penn sidelined
The knives have been out in Hillaryland for Mark Penn for years , but today they finally cut through .
In a statement , campaign manager Maggie Williams linked the departure to Mark Penn 's meeting last week with the government of Colombia , a private client , but that was just the latest in a long series of distractions triggered by his private work , and his departure also reflects Clinton 's obvious dissatisfaction with elements of her strategy .
Says Williams :
After the events of the last few days , Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as Chief Strategist of the Clinton Campaign ; Mark , and Penn , Schoen and Berland Associates , Inc. will continue to provide polling and advice to the campaign .
Geoff Garin and Howard Wolfson will coordinate the campaign 's strategic message team going forward .

UBS had warned that 2008 would be a tough year .
Swiss financial giant UBS has reported that its writedowns as a result of the sub - prime crisis have more than doubled to about $ 37bn ( £ 18.5 bn ) .
It is the largest writedown by any bank since the credit crunch began .
UBS also announced that its chairman and former chief executive Marcel Ospel would not be seeking re-appointment .
The bank has announced $ 19bn of fresh asset writedowns on top of the $ 18.4bn it wrote off in 2007 , as the value of its assets has plummeted .
UBS added that it was seeking to raise 15bn Swiss francs ( $ 15 bn ; £ 7.5 bn ) in capital by issuing new shares .
Today 's announcement will alarm both UBS shareholders and the markets

Its losses dwarf those declared by US banks such as Citigroup ( $ 21.1 bn ) and Merrill Lynch ( $ 22bn ) .
Widespread damage
The UBS announcements came as it said it expected to post a first - quarter net loss of $ 12.1 bn .
The firm said that the next chapter of the firm 's history would be one of " discipline and determination " .
" There will be other chapters which will not be perfect but none will be like the ones we have just written " .
The US sub - prime problems have hit the balance sheets of banks worldwide and have cost several leading bankers their jobs .
Mr Ospel had previously said that he wanted to stay at the company for another year .
MAIN CREDIT CRUNCH LOSSES UBS : $ 37.4bn Merrill Lynch : $ 22bn Citigroup : $ 21.1bn HSBC : $ 17.2 bn Morgan Stanley : $ 9.4bn Deutsche Bank : $ 7.1 bn Bank of America : $ 5.3 bn Bear Stearns : $ 3.2bn JP Morgan Chase : $ 3.2bn BayernLB $ 3.2bn Barclays : $ 2.6bn IKB : $ 2.6 bn Royal Bank of Scotland : $ 2.6 bn Credit Suisse : $ 2bn Source : Company reports
Timeline : Sub - prime crisis
" I have always stated that I ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " he said .
" We have worked very hard and have been able to address the firm 's most pressing problems , thereby laying the foundation for the long - term success of the bank . "
He will be replaced by Peter Kurer , a 58 - year - old Swiss lawyer who has spent the last seven years as the bank 's main legal adviser .
Mr Ospel said that his successor had considerable experience of the banking sector " and importantly of this bank " .
Difficult year UBS has also unveiled plans to create a new business that would handle US property assets which had become worthless .
It said that it was confident that this would " deal effectively with the firm 's real estate exposures and allow the bank to focus on strengthening its core operations " .
Mr Ospel said that a decision would be made " within weeks " about how many jobs would go at the firm .
UBS management warned that it expected 2008 to be a difficult year for the firm and the industry as a whole .
In 2007 it reported its first annual loss since UBS was created from the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998 .
Sub - prime loans were lent to US homebuyers with low incomes or with patchy credit ratings .
These investments quickly soured as higher interest rates pushed up mortgage payments and triggered a wave of defaults .
As well as resulting in the collapse of Bear Stearns , it has also hit other big Western banks , including Wall Street giants Merrill Lynch , Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase .

More than a year ago , I wrote about the increasing risks of data loss because more and more data fits in smaller and smaller packages .
Today I use a 4 - GB USB memory stick for backup while I am traveling .
I like the convenience , but if I lose the tiny thing I risk all my data .
Encryption is the obvious solution for this problem — I use PGPdisk — but Secustick sounds even better :
It automatically erases itself after a set number of bad password attempts .
The company makes a bunch of other impressive claims :
The product was commissioned , and eventually approved , by the French intelligence service ; it is used by many militaries and banks ; its technology is revolutionary .
Unfortunately , the only impressive aspect of Secustick is its hubris , which was revealed when Tweakers .
net completely broke its security .
There ’s no data self - destruct feature .
The password protection can easily be bypassed .
The data is n’t even encrypted .
As a secure storage device , Secustick is pretty useless .
On the surface , this is just another snake - oil security story .
But there ’s a deeper question :
Why are there so many bad security products out there ?
It ’s not just that designing good security is hard — although it is — and it ’s not just that anyone can design a security product that he himself cannot break .
Why do mediocre security products beat the good ones in the marketplace ?
In 1970 , American economist George Akerlof wrote a paper called “ The Market for ‘ Lemons , ' ” which established asymmetrical information theory .
He eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work , which looks at markets where the seller knows a lot more about the product than the buyer .
Akerlof illustrated his ideas with a used car market .
A used car market includes both good cars and lousy ones ( lemons ) .
The seller knows which is which , but the buyer ca n’t tell the difference — at least until he ’s made his purchase .
I ’ll spare you the math , but what ends up happening is that the buyer bases his purchase price on the value of a used car of average quality .
This means that the best cars do n’t get sold ; their prices are too high .
Which means that the owners of these best cars do n’t put their cars on the market .
And then this starts spiraling .
The removal of the good cars from the market reduces the average price buyers are willing to pay , and then the very good cars no longer sell , and disappear from the market .
And then the good cars , and so on until only the lemons are left .
In a market where the seller has more information about the product than the buyer , bad products can drive the good ones out of the market .
The computer security market has a lot of the same characteristics of Akerlof ’s lemons market .
Take the market for encrypted USB memory sticks .
Several companies make encrypted USB drives — Kingston Technology sent me one in the mail a few days ago — but even I could n’t tell you if Kingston ’s offering is better than Secustick .
Or if it ’s better than any other encrypted USB drives .
They use the same encryption algorithms .
They make the same security claims .
And if I ca n’t tell the difference , most consumers wo n’t be able to either .
Of course , it ’s more expensive to make an actually secure USB drive .
Good security design takes time , and necessarily means limiting functionality .
Good security testing takes even more time , especially if the product is any good .
This means the less - secure product will be cheaper , sooner to market and have more features .
In this market , the more - secure USB drive is going to lose out .
I see this kind of thing happening over and over in computer security .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , there were more than a hundred competing firewall products .
The few that “ won ” were n’t the most secure firewalls ; they were the ones that were easy to set up , easy to use and did n’t annoy users too much .
Because buyers could n’t base their buying decision on the relative security merits , they based them on these other criteria .
The intrusion detection system , or IDS , market evolved the same way , and before that the antivirus market .
The few products that succeeded were n’t the most secure , because buyers could n’t tell the difference .
How do you solve this ?
You need what economists call a “ signal , ” a way for buyers to tell the difference .
Warranties are a common signal .
Alternatively , an independent auto mechanic can tell good cars from lemons , and a buyer can hire his expertise .
The Secustick story demonstrates this .
If there is a consumer advocate group that has the expertise to evaluate different products , then the lemons can be exposed .
Secustick , for one , seems to have been withdrawn from sale .
But security testing is both expensive and slow , and it just is n’t possible for an independent lab to test everything .
Unfortunately , the exposure of Secustick is an exception .
It was a simple product , and easily exposed once someone bothered to look .
A complex software product — a firewall , an IDS — is very hard to test well .
And , of course , by the time you have tested it , the vendor has a new version on the market .
In reality , we have to rely on a variety of mediocre signals to differentiate the good security products from the bad .
Standardization is one signal .
The widely used AES encryption standard has reduced , although not eliminated , the number of lousy encryption algorithms on the market .
Reputation is a more common signal ; we choose security products based on the reputation of the company selling them , the reputation of some security wizard associated with them , magazine reviews , recommendations from colleagues or general buzz in the media .
All these signals have their problems .
Even product reviews , which should be as comprehensive as the Tweakers ’
Secustick review , rarely are .
Many firewall comparison reviews focus on things the reviewers can easily measure , like packets per second , rather than how secure the products are .
In IDS comparisons , you can find the same bogus “ number of signatures ” comparison .
Buyers lap that stuff up ; in the absence of deep understanding , they happily accept shallow data .
With so many mediocre security products on the market , and the difficulty of coming up with a strong quality signal , vendors do n’t have strong incentives to invest in developing good products .
And the vendors that do tend to die a quiet and lonely death .

This essay originally appeared in Wired .
http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/…
Big Brother is n’t what he used to be .
George Orwell extrapolated his totalitarian state from the 1940s .
Today ’s information society looks nothing like Orwell ’s world , and watching and intimidating a population today is n’t anything like what Winston Smith experienced .
Data collection in “ 1984 ” was deliberate ; today ’s is inadvertent .
In the information society , we generate data naturally .
In Orwell ’s world , people were naturally anonymous ; today , we leave digital footprints everywhere .
“ 1984 ” ‘s police state was centralized ; today ’s is decentralized .
Your phone company knows who you talk to , your credit card company knows where you shop and Netflix knows what you watch .
Your ISP can read your email , your cell phone can track your movements and your supermarket can monitor your purchasing patterns .
There ’s no single government entity bringing this together , but there does n’t have to be .
As Neal Stephenson said , the threat is no longer Big Brother , but instead thousands of Little Brothers .
“ 1984 ” ‘s Big Brother was run by the state ; today ’s Big Brother is market driven .
Data brokers like ChoicePoint and credit bureaus like Experian are n’t trying to build a police state ; they ’re just trying to turn a profit .
Of course these companies will take advantage of a national ID ; they ’d be stupid not to .
And the correlations , data mining and precise categorizing they can do is why the U.S. government buys commercial data from them .
“ 1984 ” - style police states required lots of people .
East Germany employed one informant for every 66 citizens .
Today , there ’s no reason to have anyone watch anyone else ; computers can do the work of people .
“ 1984 ” - style police states were expensive .
Today , data storage is constantly getting cheaper .
If some data is too expensive to save today , it ’ll be affordable in a few years .
And finally , the police state of “ 1984 ” was deliberately constructed , while today ’s is naturally emergent .
There ’s no reason to postulate a malicious police force and a government trying to subvert our freedoms .
Computerized processes naturally throw off personalized data ; companies save it for marketing purposes , and even the most well - intentioned law enforcement agency will make use of it .
Of course , Orwell ’s Big Brother had a ruthless efficiency that ’s hard to imagine in a government today .
But that completely misses the point .
A sloppy and inefficient police state is no reason to cheer ; watch the movie “ Brazil ” and see how scary it can be .
You can also see hints of what it might look like in our completely dysfunctional “ no - fly ” list and useless projects to secretly categorize people according to potential terrorist risk .
Police states are inherently inefficient .
There ’s no reason to assume today ’s will be any more effective .
The fear is n’t an Orwellian government deliberately creating the ultimate totalitarian state , although with the U.S. ’s programs of phone - record surveillance , illegal wiretapping , massive data mining , a national ID card no one wants and Patriot Act abuses , one can make that case .
It ’s that we ’re doing it ourselves , as a natural byproduct of the information society .
We ’re building the computer infrastructure that makes it easy for governments , corporations , criminal organizations and even teenage hackers to record everything we do , and — yes — even change our votes .
And we will continue to do so unless we pass laws regulating the creation , use , protection , resale , and disposal of personal data .
It ’s precisely the attitude that trivializes the problem that creates it .

The seven signs of terrorist activity , according to a Michigan State Police training video :
Surveillance

Acquiring supplies
Suspicious people who “ do n’t belong ”
Dry runs / trial runs

A new development from surveillance - camera - happy England : cameras that “ predict ” crimes .
This moves us further along the continuum into thoughtcrimes , but near as I can tell , the system just collects evidence on people it thinks suspicious , just in case .
Assuming the data is erased immediately after , it ’s much less invasive than actually accosting someone for thoughtcrime ; the costs for false alarms is minimal .
I doubt it works nearly as well as the article claims , but that ’s likely to change in 5 to 10 years .
For example , there ’s a lot of research being done in the area of microfacial expressions to detect lying and other thoughts .
This is the sort of technological advance that we need to be talking about in terms of security , privacy , and liberty .

According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center and reported in “ U.S. News and World Report , ” auction fraud and non-delivery of items purchased are far and away the most common Internet crimes .
Identity theft is way down near the bottom .
“ The feds caution that these figures do n’t represent a scientific sample of just how much Net crime is out there .
They note , for example , that the high number of auction fraud complaints is due , in part , to eBay and other big E - commerce outfits offering customers direct links to the IC3 website .
And it ’s tough to measure what may be the Web ’s biggest scourge , child porn , simply by complaints .
Still , the survey is a useful snapshot , even if it tells us what we already know : that the Internet , like the rest of life , is full of bad guys .

In East Belfast , burglars called in a bomb threat .
Residents evacuated their homes , and then the burglars proceeded to rob eight empty houses on the block .
I ’ve written about this sort of thing before : sometimes security procedures themselves can be exploited by attackers .
It was Step 4 of my “ five - step process ” from “ Beyond Fear ” ( pages 14 - 15 ) .
A national ID card makes identity theft more lucrative ; forcing people to remove their laptops at airport security checkpoints makes laptop theft more common .
Moral : you ca n’t just focus on one threat .
You need to look at the broad spectrum of threats , and pay attention to how security against one affects the others .

On the subject of people noticing and reporting suspicious actions , I have been espousing two views that some find contradictory .
One , we are all safer if police , guards , security screeners , and the like ignore traditional profiling and instead pay attention to people acting hinky : not right .
And two , if we encourage people to contact the authorities every time they see something suspicious , we ’re going to waste our time chasing false alarms : foreigners whose customs are different , people who are disliked by someone , and so on .
The key difference is expertise .
People trained to be alert for something hinky will do much better than any profiler , but people who have no idea what to look for will do no better than random .
Here ’s a story that illustrates this :
Last week , a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology was arrested with two illegal assault weapons and 320 rounds of ammunition in his dorm room and car :
“ The discovery of the weapons was made only by chance .
A conference center worker who served in the military was walking past Hackenburg ’s dorm room .
The door was shut , but the worker heard the all - too - familiar racking sound of a weapon , said the center ’s director Bill Gunther . ”
Notice how expertise made the difference .
The “ conference center worker ” had the right knowledge to recognize the sound and to understood that it was out of place in the environment he heard it .
He was n’t primed to be on the lookout for suspicious people and things ; his trained awareness kicked in automatically .
He recognized hinky , and he acted on that recognition .
A random person simply can’t do that ; he wo n’t recognize hinky when he sees it .
He ’ll report imams for praying , a neighbor he ’s pissed at , or people at random .
He ’ll see an English professor recycling paper , and report a Middle - Eastern - looking man leaving a box on sidewalk .
We all have some experience with this .
Each of us has some expertise in some topic , and will occasionally recognize that something is wrong even though we can’t fully explain what or why .
An architect might feel that way about a particular structure ; an artist might feel that way about a particular painting .
I might look at a cryptographic system and intuitively know something is wrong with it , well before I figure out exactly what .
Those are all examples of a subliminal recognition that something is hinky — in our particular domain of expertise .
Good security people have the knowledge , skill , and experience to do that in security situations .
It ’s the difference between a good security person and an amateur .
This is why behavioral assessment profiling is a good idea , while the Terrorist Information and Prevention System ( TIPS ) is n’t .
This is why training truckers to look out for suspicious things on the highways is a good idea , while a vague list of things to watch out for is n’t .
It ’s why an Israeli driver recognized a passenger as a suicide bomber , while an American driver probably would n’t .
This kind of thing is n’t easy to train .
( Much has been written about it , though ; Malcolm Gladwell ’s “ Blink ” discusses this in detail . )
You ca n’t learn it from watching a seven - minute video .
But the more we focus on this — the more we stop wasting our airport security resources on screeners who confiscate rocks and snow globes , and instead focus them on well - trained screeners walking through the airport looking for hinky — the more secure we will be .

The blog post has many more links to the specific things mentioned in the essay :
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/04/…
In March , the Department of Homeland Security released its long - awaited guidance document regarding national implementation of the Real ID program , as part of its post - 9/11 national security initiatives .
It is perhaps quite telling that despite bipartisan opposition , Real ID was buried in a 2005 “ must - pass ” military spending bill and enacted into law without public debate or congressional hearings .
DHS has maintained that the Real ID concept is not a national identification database .
While it ’s true that the system is not a single database per se , this is a semantic dodge ; according to the DHS document , Real ID will be a collaborative data - interchange environment built from a series of interlinking systems operated and administered by the states .
In other words , to the Department of Homeland Security , it ’s not a single database because it ’s not a single system .
But the functionality of a single database remains intact under the guise of a federated data - interchange environment .
The DHS document notes the “ primary benefit of Real ID is to improve the security and lessen the vulnerability of federal buildings , nuclear facilities , and aircraft to terrorist attack . ”
We know now that vulnerable cockpit doors were the primary security weakness contributing to 9/11 , and reinforcing them was a long - overdue protective measure to prevent hijackings .
But this still raises an interesting question :
Are there really so many members of the American public just “ dropping by ” to visit a nuclear facility that it ’s become a primary reason for creating a national identification system ?
Are such visitors actually admitted ?
DHS proposes guidelines for proving one ’s identity and residence when applying for a Real ID card .
Yet while the department concedes it ’s a monumental task to prove one ’s domicile or residence , it leaves it up to the states to determine what documents would be adequate proof of residence–and even suggests that a utility bill or bank statement might be appropriate documentation .
If so , a person could easily generate multiple proof - of - residence documents .
Basing Real ID on such easy - to - forge documents obviates a large portion of what Real ID is supposed to accomplish .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly for Americans , the very last paragraph of the 160 - page Real ID document deserves special attention .
In a nod to states ’ rights advocates , DHS declares that states are free not to participate in the Real ID system if they choose — but any identification card issued by a state that does not meet Real ID criteria is to be clearly labeled as such , to include “ bold lettering ” or a “ unique design ” similar to how many states design driver ’s licenses for those under 21 years of age .
In its own guidance document , the department has proposed branding citizens not possessing a Real ID card in a manner that lets all who see their official state - issued identification know that they ’re “ different , ” and perhaps potentially dangerous , according to standards established by the federal government .
They would become stigmatized , branded , marked , ostracized , segregated .
All in the name of protecting the homeland ; no wonder this provision appears at the very end of the document .
One likely outcome of this DHS - proposed social segregation is that people presenting non-Real ID identification automatically will be presumed suspicious and perhaps subject to additional screening or surveillance to confirm their innocence at a bar , office building , airport , or routine traffic stop .
Such a situation would establish a new form of social segregation–an attempt to separate “ us ” from “ them ” in the age of counterterrorism and the new normal , where one is presumed suspicious until proven more suspicious .
Two other big - picture concerns about Real ID come to mind : Looking at the overall concept of a national identification database , and given existing data security controls in large distributed systems , one wonders how vulnerable this system - of - systems will be to data loss or identity theft resulting from unscrupulous employees , flawed technologies , external compromises or human error–even under the best of security conditions .
And second , there is no clear guidance on the limits of how the Real ID database would be used .
Other homeland security initiatives , such as the Patriot Act , have been used and applied –some say abused –for purposes far removed from anything related to homeland security .
How can we ensure the same will not happen with Real ID ?
As currently proposed , Real ID will fail for several reasons .
From a technical and implementation perspective , there are serious questions about its operational abilities both to protect citizen information and resist attempts at circumvention by adversaries .
Financially , the initial unfunded $ 11 billion cost , forced onto the states by the federal government , is excessive .
And from a sociological perspective , Real ID will increase the potential for expanded personal surveillance and lay the foundation for a new form of class segregation in the name of protecting the homeland .
It ’s time to rethink some of the security decisions made during the emotional aftermath of 9/11 and determine whether they ’re still a good idea for homeland security and America .
After all , if Real ID was such a well - conceived plan , Maine and 22 other states would n’t be challenging it in their legislatures or rejecting the Real ID concept for any number of reasons .
But they are .
And we as citizens should , too .
Let the debate begin .

This fascinating tidbit is from “ Aviation Week and Space Technology ” ( April 9 , 2007 , p. 21 ) , in David Bond ’s “ Washington Outlook ” column ( unfortunately , not online ) .
“ Security and society ’s litigious bent combine to make airlines unsuited for figuring out the best place to put a suspected explosive device discovered during a flight , AirTran Airways tells the FAA ( Federal Aviation Administration ) .
Commenting on a proposed rule that would require , among other things , designation of a ‘ least risk bomb location ’ ( LRBL ) — the place on an aircraft where a bomb would do the least damage if it exploded — AirTran engineering director Rick Shideler says it ’s hard for airlines to get aircraft design information related to such a location because of agreements between manufacturers and the Homeland Security Department .
The carrier got LRBL information for its 717s and 737s from Boeing but ca n’t find out why the locations were chosen , ‘ or even who specifically picked them , ’ because of liability laws . ”
I ’d never heard of an LRBL before , but the FAA has public proposed guidelines on them .
Apparently flight crews are trained to stash suspicious objects there .
But liability seems to be getting in the way of security and common sense here .
It seems reasonable that an airline ’s engineering director should be allowed to understand the technical reasoning behind the choice of LRBL , and maybe even give the manufacturer feedback on it .
When I posted this to my blog , a pilot commented : “ The designation of a ‘ least risk bomb location ’ is nothing new .
All planes have a designated area where potentially dangerous packages should be placed .
Usually it ’s in the back , adjacent to a door .
There are a slew of procedures to be followed if an explosive device is found on board : depressurizing the plane , moving the item to the LRBL , and bracing / smothering it with luggage and other dense materials so that the force of the blast is directed outward , through the door . ”
Probably wo n’t help , but you ’ve got to put the damn thing somewhere .

This is a fantastic story of a major prank pulled off at the Super Bowl this year .
Basically , five people smuggled more than a quarter of a ton of material into Dolphin Stadium in order to display their secret message on TV .
Given all the security , it ’s amazing how easy it was for them to become part of the security perimeter with all that random stuff .
But to those of us who follow this thing , it should n’t be .
His observations are spot on :
1 . Wear a suit .
2. Wear a Bluetooth headset .
3 . Pretend to be talking loudly to someone on the other line .
4. Carry a clipboard .
5 . Be white .
Again , no surprise here .
But it makes you wonder what ’s the point of annoying the hell out of ordinary citizens with security measures ( like pat - down searches ) when the emperor has no clothes .
Someone who crashed the Oscars last year gave similar advice : “ Show up at the theater , dressed as a chef carrying a live lobster , looking really concerned . ”
On a much smaller scale , here ’s someone ’s story of social engineering a bank branch : “ I enter the first branch at approximately 9:00 AM .
Dressed in Dickies coveralls , a baseball cap , work boots and sunglasses I approach the young lady at the front desk .
‘ Hello , ’ I say .
‘ John Doe with XYZ Pest Control , here to perform your pest inspection . ’
I flash her the smile followed by the credentials .
She looks at me for a moment , goes ‘ Uhm okay let me check with the branch manager ’ and picks up the phone .
I stand around twiddling my thumbs and wait while the manager is contacted and confirmation is made .
If all goes according to plan , the fake emails I sent out last week notifying branch managers of our inspection will allow me access .
It does . ”
Social engineering is surprisingly easy .
As I said in “ Beyond Fear ” ( page 144 ) : “ Social engineering will probably always work , because so many people are by nature helpful and so many corporate employees are naturally cheerful and accommodating .
Attacks are rare , and most people asking for information or help are legitimate .
By appealing to the victim ’s natural tendencies , the attacker will usually be able to cozen what she wants . ”
All it takes is a good cover story .

Here ’s a great description of an anti-spam doorbell from 1933 .
A visitor had to deposit a dime into a slot to make the doorbell ring .
If the homeowner appreciated the visit , he would return the dime .
Otherwise , the dime became the cost of disturbing the homeowner .
This kind of system has been proposed for e-mail as well : the sender has to pay the receiver — or someone else in the system — a nominal amount for each e-mail sent .
This money is returned if the e-mail is wanted , and forfeited if it is spam .
The result would be to raise the cost of sending spam to the point where it is uneconomical .
I think it ’s worth comparing the two systems — the doorbell system and the e-mail system — to demonstrate why it wo n’t work for spam .
The doorbell system fails for three reasons : the percentage of annoying visitors is small enough to make the system largely unnecessary , visitors do n’t generally have dimes on them ( presumably fixable if the system becomes ubiquitous ) , and it ’s too easy to successfully bypass the system by knocking ( not true for an apartment building ) .
The anti-spam system does n’t suffer from the first two problems : spam is an enormous percentage of total e-mail , and an automated accounting system makes the financial mechanics easy .
But the anti-spam system is too easy to bypass , and it ’s too easy to hack .
And once you set up a financial system , you ’re simply inviting hacks .
The anti-spam system fails because spammers do n’t have to send e-mail directly — they can take over innocent computers and send it from them .
So it ’s the people whose computers have been hacked into , victims in their own right , who will end up paying for spam .
This risk can be limited by letting people put an upper limit on the money in their accounts , but it is still serious .
And criminals can exploit the system in the other direction , too .
They could hack into innocent computers and have them send “ spam ” to their email addresses , collecting money in the process .
Trying to impose some sort of economic penalty on unwanted e-mail is a good idea , but it wo n’t work unless the endpoints are trusted .
And we ’re nowhere near that trust today .
http://.modernmechanix.com/2007/05/05/…
Personal information protection is an economic problem , not a security problem .
And the problem can be easily explained :
The organizations we trust to protect our personal information do not suffer when information gets exposed .
On the other hand , individuals who suffer when personal information is exposed do n’t have the capability to protect that information .
There are actually two problems here : Personal information is easy to steal , and it ’s valuable once stolen .
We ca n’t solve one problem without solving the other .
The solutions are n’t easy , and you ’re not going to like them .
First , fix the economic problem .
Credit card companies make more money extending easy credit and making it trivial for customers to use their cards than they lose from fraud .
They wo n’t improve their security as long as you ( and not they ) are the one who suffers from identity theft .
It ’s the same for banks and brokerages :
As long as you ’re the one who suffers when your account is hacked , they do n’t have any incentive to fix the problem .
And data brokers like ChoicePoint are worse ; they do n’t suffer if they reveal your information .
You do n’t have a business relationship with them ; you ca n’t even switch to a competitor in disgust .
Credit card security works as well as it does because the 1968 Truth in Lending Law limits consumer liability for fraud to $ 50 .
If the credit card companies could pass fraud losses on to the consumers , they would be spending far less money to stop those losses .
But once Congress forced them to suffer the costs of fraud , they invented all sorts of security measures–real - time transaction verification , expert systems patrolling the transaction database and so on –to prevent fraud .
The lesson is clear :
Make the party in the best position to mitigate the risk responsible for the risk .
What this will do is enable the capitalist innovation engine .
Once it ’s in the financial interest of financial institutions to protect us from identity theft , they will .
Second , stop using personal information to authenticate people .
Watch how credit cards work .
Notice that the store clerk barely looks at your signature , or how you can use credit cards remotely where no one can check your signature .
The credit card industry learned decades ago that authenticating people has only limited value .
Instead , they put most of their effort into authenticating the transaction , and they ’re much more secure because of it .
This wo n’t solve the problem of securing our personal information , but it will greatly reduce the threat .
Once the information is no longer of value , you only have to worry about securing the information from voyeurs rather than the more common–and more financially motivated –fraudsters .
And third , fix the other economic problem : Organizations that expose our personal information are n’t hurt by that exposure .
We need a comprehensive privacy law that gives individuals ownership of their personal information and allows them to take action against organizations that do n’t care for it properly .
“ Passwords ” like credit card numbers and mother ’s maiden name used to work , but we ’ve forever left the world where our privacy comes from the obscurity of our personal information and the difficulty others have in accessing it .
We need to abandon security systems that are based on obscurity and difficulty , and build legal protections to take over where technological advances have left us exposed .

There are security experts who insist penetration testing is essential for network security , and you have no hope of being secure unless you do it regularly .
And there are contrarian security experts who tell you penetration testing is a waste of time ; you might as well throw your money away .
Both of these views are wrong .
The reality of penetration testing is more complicated and nuanced .
Penetration testing is a broad term .
It might mean breaking into a network to demonstrate you can .
It might mean trying to break into a network to document vulnerabilities .
It might involve a remote attack , physical penetration of a data center or social engineering attacks .
It might use commercial or proprietary vulnerability scanning tools , or rely on skilled white - hat hackers .
It might just evaluate software version numbers and patch levels , and make inferences about vulnerabilities .
It ’s going to be expensive , and you ’ll get a thick report when the testing is done .
And that ’s the real problem .
You really do n’t want a thick report documenting all the ways your network is insecure .
You do n’t have the budget to fix them all , so the document will sit around waiting to make someone look bad .
Or , even worse , it ’ll be discovered in a breach lawsuit .
Do you really want an opposing attorney to ask you to explain why you paid to document the security holes in your network , and then did n’t fix them ?
Probably the safest thing you can do with the report , after you read it , is shred it .
Given enough time and money , a pen test will find vulnerabilities ; there ’s no point in proving it .
And if you ’re not going to fix all the uncovered vulnerabilities , there ’s no point uncovering them .
But there is a way to do penetration testing usefully .
For years I ’ve been saying security consists of protection , detection and response–and you need all three to have good security .
Before you can do a good job with any of these , you have to assess your security .
And done right , penetration testing is a key component of a security assessment .
I like to restrict penetration testing to the most commonly exploited critical vulnerabilities , like those found on the SANS Top 20 list .
If you have any of those vulnerabilities , you really need to fix them .
If you think about it , penetration testing is an odd business .
Is there an analogue to it anywhere else in security ?
Sure , militaries run these exercises all the time , but how about in business ?
Do we hire burglars to try to break into our warehouses ?
Do we attempt to commit fraud against ourselves ?
No , we do n’t .
Penetration testing has become big business because systems are so complicated and poorly understood .
We know about burglars and kidnapping and fraud , but we do n’t know about computer criminals .
We do n’t know what ’s dangerous today , and what will be dangerous tomorrow .
So we hire penetration testers in the belief they can explain it .
There are two reasons why you might want to conduct a penetration test .
One , you want to know whether a certain vulnerability is present because you ’re going to fix it if it is .
And two , you need a big , scary report to persuade your boss to spend more money .
If neither is true , I ’m going to save you a lot of money by giving you this free penetration test :
You ’re vulnerable .
Now , go do something useful about it .

Last week , I attended the Infosecurity Europe conference in London .
Like at the RSA Conference in February , the show floor was chockablock full of network , computer and information security companies .
As I often do , I mused about what it means for the IT industry that there are thousands of dedicated security products on the market : some good , more lousy , many difficult even to describe .
Why are n’t IT products and services naturally secure , and what would it mean for the industry if they were ?
I mentioned this in an interview with Silicon.com , and the published article seems to have caused a bit of a stir .
Rather than letting people wonder what I really meant , I thought I should explain .
The primary reason the IT security industry exists is because IT products and services are n’t naturally secure .
If computers were already secure against viruses , there would n’t be any need for antivirus products .
If bad network traffic could n’t be used to attack computers , no one would bother buying a firewall .
If there were no more buffer overflows , no one would have to buy products to protect against their effects .
If the IT products we purchased were secure out of the box , we would n’t have to spend billions every year making them secure .
Aftermarket security is actually a very inefficient way to spend our security dollars ; it may compensate for insecure IT products , but does n’t help improve their security .
Additionally , as long as IT security is a separate industry , there will be companies making money based on insecurity — companies who will lose money if the internet becomes more secure .
Fold security into the underlying products , and the companies marketing those products will have an incentive to invest in security upfront , to avoid having to spend more cash obviating the problems later .
Their profits would rise in step with the overall level of security on the internet .
Initially we ’d still be spending a comparable amount of money per year on security — on secure development practices , on embedded security and so on — but some of that money would be going into improving the quality of the IT products we ’re buying , and would reduce the amount we spend on security in future years .
I know this is a utopian vision that I probably wo n’t see in my lifetime , but the IT services market is pushing us in this direction .
As IT becomes more of a utility , users are going to buy a whole lot more services than products .
And by nature , services are more about results than technologies .
Service customers — whether home users or multinational corporations — care less and less about the specifics of security technologies , and increasingly expect their IT to be integrally secure .
Eight years ago , I formed Counterpane Internet Security on the premise that end users ( big corporate users , in this case ) really do n’t want to have to deal with network security .
They want to fly airplanes , produce pharmaceuticals or do whatever their core business is .
They do n’t want to hire the expertise to monitor their network security , and will gladly farm it out to a company that can do it for them .
We provided an array of services that took day - to - day security out of the hands of our customers : security monitoring , security - device management , incident response .
Security was something our customers purchased , but they purchased results , not details .
Last year , BT bought Counterpane , further embedding network security services into the IT infrastructure .
BT has customers that do n’t want to deal with network management at all ; they just want it to work .
They want the internet to be like the phone network , or the power grid , or the water system ; they want it to be a utility .
For these customers , security is n’t even something they purchase :
It ’s one small part of a larger IT services deal .
It ’s the same reason IBM bought ISS : to be able to have a more integrated solution to sell to customers .
This is where the IT industry is headed , and when it gets there , there ’ll be no point in user conferences like Infosec and RSA .
They wo n’t go away ; they ’ll simply become industry conferences .
If you want to measure progress , look at the demographics of these conferences .
A shift toward infrastructure - geared attendees is a measure of success .
Of course , security products wo n’t disappear — at least , not in my lifetime .
There ’ll still be firewalls , antivirus software and everything else .
There ’ll still be startup companies developing clever and innovative security technologies .
But the end user wo n’t care about them .
They ’ll be embedded within the services sold by large IT outsourcing companies like BT , EDS and IBM , or ISPs like EarthLink and Comcast .
Or they ’ll be a check - box item somewhere in the core switch .
IT security is getting harder — increasing complexity is largely to blame — and the need for aftermarket security products is n’t disappearing anytime soon .
But there ’s no earthly reason why users need to know what an intrusion - detection system with stateful protocol analysis is , or why it ’s helpful in spotting SQL injection attacks .
The whole IT security industry is an accident — an artifact of how the computer industry developed .
As IT fades into the background and becomes just another utility , users will simply expect it to work — and the details of how it works wo n’t matter .

Allow me to introduce myself .
According to the general clucking of the national punditry , my 2004 book – " What 's the Matter With Kansas ? " – is supposed to have persuaded Barack Obama to describe the yeomanry of Pennsylvania as " bitter " people who " cling to guns or religion or . . . anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . "
Mr. Obama 's offense is so grave that the custodians of our national consensus have elevated it to gatehood : " Bittergate . "
In truth , I have no way of knowing whether some passage of mine inspired Mr. Obama 's tactless assertion that the hard - done - by clutch guns and irrationally oppose free - trade deals .
In point of fact , I oppose many of those trade deals myself .
But I know one thing with absolute certainty .
The media flurry kicked up by Mr. Obama 's gaffe powerfully confirms an argument I actually did make :
That as they return again to the culture war , what the soldiers on all sides are doing is talking about class without actually addressing the economic basis of the subject .
Consider , for example , the one fateful charge that the punditry and the other candidates have fastened upon Mr. Obama – " elitism . "
No one means by this term that Mr. Obama is a wealthy person ( he was n't until last year ) , or even that he is an ally of the wealthy ( although he might be that ) .
What they mean is that he has committed a crime of attitude , and revealed his disdain for the common folk .
It is a stereotype you have heard many times before : Besotted with latte - fueled arrogance , the liberal looks down on average people , confident that he is a superior being .
He scoffs at religion because he finds it to be a form of false consciousness .
He believes in regulation because he thinks he knows better than the market .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , a Washington nonprofit organization , said 15 states were considering legislation that would authorize or make it easier for people to carry guns on school or college campuses under certain conditions .
Those states include Alabama , Indiana , Kentucky , Michigan and Virginia , according to the center , but it considers the Arizona proposal particularly egregious because it would not only allow students and faculty to carry such weapons , but staff members as well .
Utah , the organization said , is the only state with a law that expressly allows people with a concealed - weapon permit to carry guns on college campuses .
That law , adopted in 2004 and upheld by Utah ’s Supreme Court in 2006 , arose out of concern that a state law allowing concealed weapons was not being enforced on college campuses .
The critics of such laws predict that they would cause more problems , including making it hard for the police to sort a dangerous gunman from a crowd of others with guns .
They also argue that the guns would make it easier for people barely out of adolescence , or perhaps emotionally troubled , to respond lethally to typical campus frustrations like poor grades or failed romances .
Fred Boice , president of the Arizona Board of Regents , which oversees the state ’s three public universities , said he sympathized with people concerned about campus safety .
In October 2002 , a nursing student at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was failing his classes shot and killed three professors before killing himself .
But Mr. Boice said he believed security and a system of alerting people about crises had been improved since then , and he worried that disputes best handled by campus security could quickly turn deadly with more guns on campus .
“ I grew up in the country and a lot of people had guns , ” Mr. Boice said .
“ But my father said never carry a gun unless you are prepared to kill somebody , and I believe that . ”

Proponents concede the proposal could face a fight , even in this state ’s Republican - controlled Legislature .
The police chiefs at Arizona ’s universities and several law enforcement groups have condemned the bill .
The net 's search engines may soon have to develop a long - term memory loss program , after European regulators found that companies such as Google and Yahoo violate European data protection rules by keeping data for too long and not telling users how stored search queries and clicks help target advertisements .
If adopted by the European Commission , the findings ( .pdf ) are likely to lead to the first stringent regulation of search engines .
The rules ' reach would also likely extend to cover Americans ' net use , due to the technical difficulty of determining whether a particular user is or is n't a citizen of an EU country .
Jeffery Chester , who heads the Center for Digital Democracy , hailed the new rules as reasonable limits that may force more meaningful privacy rules by U.S. companies .
" After Google bought DoubleClick , it now owns the biggest cookie jar in the universe , and it does n't want to empty it out every six months , " Chester said .
Instead of discarding or obfuscating some details after 13 to 18
months , search engines need to purge personal data after six months or explain very carefully why it needs to keep data longer , according to a
Friday report from the European Union 's Article 29 Data Working Party .
Additionally , search engines will have to get explicit permission to cross -correlate information from various services – such as Yahoo 's news , email and fantasy baseball site .
The commission also determined that IP addresses that a search engine logs are also considered personal information , because civil litigants or the police could tie that IP address to a person through legal process .
If adopted , those rules would sharply curtail the hungry data collection of companies like Google , which say they need long term data to fight fraud and improve search relevance .
Chester and other privacy groups have been unsuccessfully pushing the U.S. 's Federal Trade Commission to impose similar conditions on search engines via their review of mergers like Google 's recent acquisition of DoubleClick , an ad- delivery and tracking giant .
The FTC approved that merger in December without attaching conditions .
" Here you had reasonable intelligent people who listened to the argument and came up with a moderate course of action , saying you have to explain what you are doing and have reasonable limits on how you collect this information , " Chester said .
" When we say the same thing to
U.S. regulators or Google or Yahoo , they look at us like we are the children of Karl Marx . "
Google signaled that it intended to fight the adoption of the rules in a blog response from its global privacy lawyer Peter Fleischer .
" We believe that data retention requirements have to take into account the need to provide quality products and services for users , like accurate search results , as well as system security and integrity concerns , " Fleischer wrote Monday .
" This perspective – the ways in which data is used to improve consumers ' experience on the web – is unfortunately sometimes lacking in discussions about online privacy . "
The Working Party also took issue with Google 's data retention practices , where Google attempts to anonymize search engine logs after
18 months by removing the last section of an IP address ( e.g .
71.202.117.xxx ) .
That may not be enough to anonymize users , the group found , since it only rules out 254 possible IP addresses .
It is possible , the commission argued , for law enforcement to re-identify a person by combining queries and the slightly redacted IP address .
The Working Party 's recommendations are based on Europe's Data
Protection directive , which are based on the core data privacy practices of notice , consent and choice .
However , search engines companies that also offer web mail have to comply with a different EU directive , the Data Retention Directive , that compels them to store communications data for six months to two years .
The U.S. has no such policy , though the Justice Department has pushed for such rules in the past .

In the rural areas of Northern California , in the shadow of beautiful Mt. Shasta , lies a sleepy small town .
In that town , however , lurks a menace .
The town itself elicits laughs from degenerate drug users all over the nation .
In fact , the town itself is a literal advertisement for drug use .
At least that ’s what the BATF would have you believe :
The federal government has said no to Weed .
Or at least to the bottle caps of beer brewed at a popular local brewery in this small Siskiyou County town , which has a name that no doubt would have kept 1970s pot-smoking duo Cheech and Chong giggling .
Weed brewer Vaune Dillmann faces possible sanctions or fines from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau if he continues to brew and sell beer with bottle caps printed with the label “ Try Legal Weed . ”
You see , in the world of the government , there is no room for humor .
After all , in a country of 300 million people , a few of those people are going to get the wrong idea .
Might they believe that a beer company is suggesting that they stop drinking beer and start smoking pot ?
Maybe so .
And the BATF ( actually , the TTB ) believes it ’s their place to save those people from their own idiocy , and at the same time ruin it for the rest of us .
Now , it ’s clear to me that this is nothing more than a clever marketing tactic .
As a homebrewer and beer connoisseur , I often see store shelves lined with a dizzying array of six - packs , and outside of word of mouth and places like beeradvocate.com , I have very little way to tell one brewery from another .
What might convince me to try something new ?
Perhaps if it catches my eye for some reason , I might buy it .
The use of the town ’s name may elicit a chuckle from a few potheads , but it ’s hardly an advertisement by a brewery for a competing ( and illegal ) product .
It ’s made even more ridiculous by the fact that a competing ( and well - known ) brewery has a similar double - entendre in their name and advertising , but is allowed to proceed with their own labeling and advertising .
Dillmann , who says his bottle caps both promote his beers and the community in which he brews them , has appealed the decision .
After all , he said , the labels on his beers have a picture of the Weed arch and the city ’s founding father , Abner Weed , on the label .
Dillmann ’s bottle caps also say a “ A Friend in Weed is a Friend Indeed . ”
“ We ’re dealing with a surname that ’s been used for hundreds of years , ” Dillmann said Monday .
The owner of the Mount Shasta Brewing Co. said he ’s also outraged that his beer is being singled out for using a possible pot play on words when Anheuser - Busch has used “ Bud ” — another name for marijuana — to promote their Budweiser line of beers .
“ What ’s the difference here ? ” Dillmann said .
“ They sell Bud — we sell Weed . ”
There is no difference , Mr. Dillman .
Some bureaucrat has a stick up his butt and the power of the federal government behind him .
You ’re bearing the brunt of it .
This is the way government works .
In a letter to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ’s administrator , Siskiyou County Supervisor Michael Kobseff said California tourism officials have identified Weed as the single most recognized name along I - 5 .
“ Surely , the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is not in the business of suppressing the ingenuity of a small business owner , ( and ) the community of Weed . . . , ” Kobseff wrote .
Of course that ’s not what they ’re trying to do .
They ’re trying to find some way to apply their one - size - fits - all rules , which do n’t allow any room for variation or common - sense , to a situation that requires variation and common sense .
It ’s not that they ’ve got a problem with the town of Weed .
It ’s much simpler than that .
Rules are rules , and you ’re not following them .
This is government , folks .
Petty , with no sense of humor and a complete inability to understand why we find them ridiculous .
You either conform or you get pounded down , in a high - stakes game of bureaucratic whack - a- mole .
As Washington called them “ a fearful servant and a terrible master ” , they ’ve been spending a lot more time being the latter .
Judge orders
White House to clarify whether or not missing e-mails are recoverable Nick Langewis
Published : Thursday April 24 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Today , Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola of the U.S. District Court ordered the White House to once and for all provide " precise information " about its e-mail system .
The order stems from a lawsuit by the National Security Archive , filed on September 5 , 2007 against the Executive Office of the President and the National Archives and Records Administration , claiming that a possible 5 - to - 10 million e-mails were either improperly preserved as Presidential records , as required by law , or lost entirely .
House Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , in a 2007 address , called such a breach of record - keeping requirements reminiscent of the " 18 - minute gap " in the infamous Nixon White House tapes , subpoenaed during the Watergate scandal .
The " missing " e-mails cover a 473 - day period , which includes the date of CIA agent Valerie Plame 's outing and a string of U.S. Attorney firings widely believed to have been politically motivated .
The White House was ordered to preserve all known e-mail records in November of 2007 .
" This ruling is a major victory for accountability at the White House , " said Tom Blanton , National Security Archive director .
" We have seen delay after delay , and constantly changing stories , none of which come up to the standards that are required by law . "
Between late 2001 and early 2002 , the Automated Records Management System ( ARMS ) , put in place by the Clinton Administration to store e-mail records , was dismantled , with the Bush Administration proposing a switch to ECRMS , or the Electronic Communications Records Management System .
In the meantime , a temporary procedure of manually archiving each staffer 's records was put in place .
E-mails began to disappear on January 3 , 2003 , and ECRMS was ultimately never put in place .
Backup tapes were re-used until October of 2003 .
Says the Archive 's General Counsel Meredith Fuchs : " The Court is reacting to the inconsistencies in the White House statements : e-mail are lost one day , the next they are not ; e-mails are recoverable , then they are not ; backup media is saved , then it is not .
" What worries us is that time is passing  there are only 8 ½ more months until this administration leaves office and if nothing is done soon not only could the e-mails disappear for good , but the federal records that are commingled with the presidential records could get swept away and become inaccessible for the next 12 years . "
When Evelina Domnitch and Dmitry Gelfand set out to create Camera Lucida , their most recent project , they faced some resistance .
Their goal was to capture a fleeting phenomenon called sonoluminescence , and it would require an unusual medium — large amounts of xenon - infused sulfuric acid .
The prospect , unsurprisingly , made laboratory scientists nervous :
Even in small amounts , sulfuric acid is nasty stuff because of the way it sucks the water out of anything it touches ( human tissue , beware ) .
Domnitch and Gelfand needed almost 3 gallons of the vitriol , which they were going to blast with ultrasonic waves .
Oh , and the reaction they intended to photograph — the ultraviolet light emitted by the xenon bubbles collapsing as they 're hit with those waves — generates temperatures as hot as the surface of the sun .
But the artists finally found a willing lab in Germany , where they turned out the lights and started shooting .
The resulting supersharp photographs are psychedelic , for sure , but the installations — the pair has a show opening in April at Media Lab Enschede in the Netherlands — are weirder still .
After five minutes in total darkness ( to let everyone 's eyes adjust ) , the audience is treated to a live demonstration of sonoluminescence , complete with the sound of the bubbles imploding .
To avoid corrosive meltdowns , Domnitch and Gelfand leave the fearsome H 2 SO 4 at home , opting instead for 13 gallons of water spiked with sodium hydroxide and luminol .
( They also decided against using a titanium horn transducer — an absurdly powerful ultrasonic transducer — because it would deafen unsuspecting patrons . )
The experience is like " being in outer space , " the creators say .
Or on some other long , strange trip .

From The Daily Mail ;-
‘ A man who lost his job after being falsely accused of a horrific sex crime has been found hanged in a shed .
Ian Adams , 51 , was suspended and then sacked from his job at a local IKEA store after his employers received a letter saying he had raped a woman and her two children .
The writer claimed to be a journalist on a local newspaper , but the name and address in the letter were false and the author has never been traced .
Police confirmed that Mr Adams , from Highams Park East , London , had never been arrested or convicted of a sexual offence or had any complaints made against him .
Mr Adams ’ life went downhill as he struggled to recover from the accusations .
He failed to get his job back after being sacked in January .
His drinking led to problems with his partner and he spent the last few nights of his life sleeping in a storage shed at the bottom of the block of flats in which he lived .
A neighbour , who did not wish to be named , said : “ If it was n’t for that letter he would still be here , I am sure of it .
“ He was happy and full of himself when he was working , he was more or less dancing on his way to work .
But he went from working all day to doing nothing .
“ He went down and down , poor chap , and we should have seen the warning signs . ”
Another neighbour , Darren Lupton , 34 , said : “ He was doing well , he was off the drink for a long time when he had the job , but when he lost it he was devastated . ”
Mr Adams worked for a contractor named Symonds employed by IKEA to collect trolleys .
Both Symonds and Ikea appeared to blame one another for the loss of his employment .
Ikea claimed that it had only suspended him from the premises until Symonds had carried out an investigation , while Symonds claimed that it had no choice but to let him go because Ikea would not let him work on its premises . ‘

Calling all graph nerds and lolcat fans : GraphJam , the latest project from the duo behind I Can Haz Cheezburger ? , wants your savvy pop-culture observations in visual form .
After stumbling across Jamphat , a site that takes concepts from rap songs and turns them into humorous graphs and charts , ICHC co-creators Tofuburger and Cheezburger knew they 'd found their ( next ) calling .
" We thought it was hilarious , " Cheezburger , aka Ben Huh , CEO of ICHC , said in a phone conversation .
" So we reached out to [ the creator of Jamphat ] and asked him if we could apply the same concept to pop culture . "
Unlike creating lolcats , which requires just a photo and a grasp of the broken English of kitty pidgin , GraphJam requires readers to come up with concepts and create pie charts , histograms and bar graphs .
Daunting for sure , but the potential for moments of meme - genius is there .
Cheez estimated about 15 submissions come in each day – not bad considering the site launched Monday .
GraphJam is n't the only new site up for perusal .
For bureaucratic - minded lolcatters , the ICHC guys also decided to parlay the hundreds of government - themed creations they receive each day into Pundit Kitchen , a site best described as lolpoliticans .

ILLEGAL firearms seized by police in Greater Manchester are being turned into symbols of peace .
The weapons have been melted down to create special coins commemorating the victims of gun crime .
Each coin is marked with 55 notches - a poignant tribute to the 55 people killed by gunmen in Greater Manchester over the last eight years .
Firearms confiscated by GMP or handed in during amnesties are normally destroyed .
But anti-violence campaigners have joined forces with Salford University to launch the Guns into Goods scheme , which will see a number of seized weapons smelted and transformed into usable commodities .
The Manchester Peace Coins are the first items to be created as part of the three - year scheme .
The coins will be sold to raise cash to help fight crime and also to fund activities to divert youngsters from a life of crime .
An exclusive first edition coin will be auctioned off at a special event at the City of Manchester Stadium on March 8th .
Paul Haywood , a metalwork expert from the university 's school of art and design , who has overseen the project , said youngsters who were at risk of drifting into gang culture would be asked to take part in future projects .
He said : " With this project we hope to engage with young people from the Manchester metropolitan area who are at greatest risk of becoming involved in gang and gun culture - as victims , witnesses or offenders .
" We want to convert the ideas of young people in the community into creative and original products that can be manufactured from smelted gun metals . "
Specialist equipment at the university is used to breakdown and melt the disabled weapons , including smelters capable of reaching fiery temperatures of up to 1,500C .
Erinma Bell , founder of campaign group Carisma , said that as well as equipping youngsters with new skills , the scheme would deliver a symbolic message for peace .
She said : " This is a brand new project and the first to directly target the physical destruction of guns .
" The goal is a sustained campaign of positive work with communities and schools to develop creative opportunities for young people to join in the efforts to raise awareness , counter gun crime and remove guns from the streets . "
The proceeds from the sale will pay for a monument to be erected in Manchester 's Peace Garden and will also fund further youth activities in the city .

While getting in shape has been a start - and - stop - and - start - again affair for me over the last couple years , over the long run , I ’ve become fitter than ever .
I ’ve dropped more than 30 pounds altogether ( or about 2 stone 6 , for the British - inclined among you ) , I run regularly , I ’ve become more consistent with strength training , and I ’ve dropped several sizes in clothes .
I ’m not saying all that to brag .
If you saw the details of how I got here , it ’s nothing to be proud of — I ran a marathon at the end of 2006 and then did a short triathlon but then stopped exercising altogether for awhile .
I became a vegetarian and was eating very healthily ( is that a word ? ) … but then I slowly started eating more junk food and gaining weight .
Recently , I dropped sweets from my diet ( cakes , pies , donuts , candy , CHOCOLATE ! , sodas , etc. ) , and surprisingly I do n’t really miss them .
I ’ve been exercising with my sister and my wife on alternate days and it ’s been great .
I still have more pounds to drop , but I ca n’t complain .
I ’m healthy .
The ups - and - downs of my fitness efforts have highlighted some important points for me .
Key among those points : do n’t quit .
If you mess up , and stop for awhile , that does n’t mean you should quit altogether .
Just keep going .
You ’ll get there eventually .
And during this journey , which has n’t stopped and probably wo n’t ever stop , and I ’ve learned a lot over these last couple of years , about what works and what does n’t .
What follows are some of the more important truths I ’ve learned , in the trenches , that I ’d like to share with you .
Take from them what you will — everyone will find different things that work for them , but I think just about all of them are important to share .
“ Every human being is the author of his own health or disease . ” – Buddha
Small steps .
That you get fitter in stages , as you exercise more , is pretty obvious I think .
You might start out just walking , but as you get fitter , you might add some slow jogging to your routine .
And then eventually you ’re running three miles , several stages later .
However , this really applies to everything , including diet , and many people do n’t realize that .
You should n’t try to change your entire diet overnight — do it in stages .
Small steps , one thing at a time , and you ’ll get there .
Just start eating more fruits at first , for example .
Then cut out sodas .
Then eat more veggies for dinner .
Then change your white bread for whole wheat bread .
Then cut out candy at work .
And so on .
The thing is , you get used to each thing after awhile , and so the changes do n’t seem drastic .
A year later , and you ’re eating extremely healthily ( that word again ) , and you ca n’t imagine going back to your old diet .
Small steps — this is extremely key , to both diet and exercise .
Find short - term rewards .
Most people quit their diet or exercise program because they ’re looking for immediate results .
And they ’re discouraged when they do n’t get them .
But you wo n’t get immediate results .
One fitness trainer said something like , “ After a month , you ’ll start feeling some results .
After two months , you ’ll start noticing results .
After three months , others will start noticing . ”
And that ’s pretty true — it takes months before you start to see the results you want … but in the meantime , you have to look for other things to keep you going .
Those shorter - term rewards could be simple things like the great feeling you get after a workout — that helps me stay motivated .
Or you could give yourself a treat ( something healthy , preferably ) or buy a book or something like that .
Track your progress .
The scale is probably the most popular way to see your progress , but other ways include measuring your waist , or taking photos of yourself each month .
You could also track your performance — for example , do a 5 K every month to see if you ’re getting faster , or log your miles to see them increase .
However you do it , you should have some kind of objective way to see your progress over the weeks and months .
Otherwise , you might not really notice the difference — but the numbers or pictures will .
Enjoy yourself .
Very very important .
If you see your exercise as extremely difficult , or painful , you wo n’t be able to sustain it for long .
You ’ll quit .
If you see your diet as very restrictive , or torture , you ’ll go back to junk food in a short while .
You must find exercise that you enjoy , and find healthy foods that taste good to you .
Maybe not chocolate cake good , but good nonetheless .
Experiment with new recipes until you find ones you absolutely love .
( Try my soup and chili recipes for example . )
Above all , enjoy the whole process .
It ’s what ’s kept me doing it — I love my new life .
Never ever give up .
Maybe the most important truth on this list .
If you give up , you wo n’t get to your goal .
Very obvious , I know , but the problem is that people do n’t put this into action .
Messing up by falling back into junk food or stopping exercise — that happens .
Life gets in the way .
No one is perfect .
Just forget about that stuff , and move on .
Learn from your failures , adjust your plan to prevent the same thing from happening again , and start again .
If you stop , that ’s OK — just start again .
Always start again .
If you do that , there ’s no way you wo n’t eventually get to your goal .
Get a workout partner .
I ’ve mentioned this before , but it ’s been the key to my most recent exercise success .
I began running with my sister , Katrina ( who btw is an incredible inspiration — she ’s come a very long way in the last year ) , and even though we ’re at different levels , we really enjoy our runs .
When we agree to meet at 5 a .m. for a run , I have to be there , or I disappoint her .
And sure , once in awhile we cancel appointments , but most of the time we ’re there , and we run , and that ’s the important thing .
These months of running with her have really gotten me in much better shape .
Now I ’m also running with my wife , so having two workout partners is taking me to another level .
Get a workout partner .
Best move I ’ve ever made .
Brush your teeth after dinner .
This is such a simple thing , but it really helps .
It makes you have that fresh , clean feeling in your mouth , and makes you not want to eat an after - dinner snack .
For me , after - dinner snacks or desserts are what ruin my diet a lot of the time .
Vary your workouts .
This helps keep things fresh and fun .
For runners , for example , do n’t just do 3 miles every day at the same pace .
Vary the distance , the route , the speed .
Do intervals .
And do stuff other than running — go hiking , go biking , play basketball , do strength training , swim , paddle .
Mixing it up will get you in even better shape , challenging your body in new ways , and making it an enjoyable process .
Focus .
There are always a lot of things we want to accomplish , goals we want to focus on … but by spreading ourselves thin , we lose focus and energy .
Focus on one thing at a time in order to really get it ingrained as a habit .
For example , for one month , focus on adding healthier foods to your diet ( and dropping some of the less healthy ones ) .
After that month , it ’ll be ingrained .
The next month , add walking or jogging or something like that , and only focus on that .
One goal at a time , one month at a time , and you ’ll get healthy .
Rest is important .
People who really get into exercise often forget this .
Without rest , exercise just keeps breaking down our muscles , and they do n’t have time to recover and grow .
The exercise puts stress on our bodies , and the rest allows them to adapt and improve .
Without the rest , they can’t really improve .
You should always follow a day of hard workouts with a day of rest .
If you ’ve been exercising a long time ( and then you probably do n’t need this article ) , you can do hard - easy days , or rotate different types of exercises so that parts of your body are getting rest on different days , but even then always have at least one day of complete rest , or you ’ll get burned out .
Shoot for a year or two , not a few weeks .
There are no instant fitness fixes , no matter what that website or magazine promises .
Do n’t believe them .
Getting fit and healthy takes time , and should be gradual .
If you ’ve got a long way to go , aim to be healthy after a year .
Those with a very long way might shoot for two years .
Those closer to the goal could try for 6 months .
Main thing : gradual improvement .
Focus on your diet first .
I ’m a huge proponent of exercise for health and other benefits , but if you ’re looking to lose weight and / or fat , the biggest factor is diet .
You can cut out more calories from what you eat than you can burn with exercise .
Of course , both should be vital components of your fitness regiment , but start on diet first , then add exercise .
Do n’t think that because you are exercising you can eat whatever you want ( unless you ’re a marathoner or triathlete or something like that ) — you wo n’t reach your fitness goals that way , most likely .
Do n’t compare yourself to magazine models .
Seriously .
I ’m sure we ’ve all done this , wishing we looked like that slim or cut or buff model on the cover of a magazine .
It ’s natural .
However , it ’s not healthy .
First of all , genetics plays a key factor in how these models look — most of us do n’t have body types like that .
Second , these models do n’t usually look like that — they go on special diets a couple weeks before a photo shoot , so they look perfect for that day .
Third , most of these magazines do some pretty heavy photoshopping .
And fourth , what ’s important is getting a healthy body image , not trying to look like a perfect model .
Focus on health , not appearance .
Find the exercise that works for you .
I love running , but not everybody is born to be a runner .
Many people enjoy swimming or water aerobics .
Many like lifting weights .
Many like cycling , or tae bo , or Pilates .
Others like sports like basketball or soccer or rugby .
It does n’t really matter what you choose , as long as you ’re moving and you enjoy what you ’re doing .
Also find the solution that works best : working at the gym , going on the road ( running and cycling , for example ) , working out at home ( which I do ) , etc .
Choose the one that you ’re most likely to stick to .
Learn to be present .
Going back to one of the key principles above , “ enjoy yourself ” , one of the best ways to do that is to learn to really be present when you exercise and eat .
For example , when you run , try to keep your mind in the moment , and feel your body and your breathing , and experience your surroundings as your run past them .
As you eat , really taste the food and feel the textures , instead of gobbling it down mindlessly .
It makes the entire experience much more enjoyable .
Do n’t let your body adapt too much .
Sometimes we hit plateaus , where we ’re still doing the same exercise but not really improving .
The reason is that you have to keep changing things , either taking your exercise to a slightly higher level ( gradually ) , or giving it new angles or routines .
Otherwise , your body adapts to doing the same exercise over and over , and it stops improving .
Once you start hitting a plateau , take it to a new level by increasing intensity or length of time in some way .
Get inspired .
Another key concept for me .
I like to read blogs or websites that show me how others have been successful .
One Zen Habits reader , for example , recently gave me some inspiration with his blog , Fat Man Unleashed .
He ’s doing a great job , making amazing progress , and it ’s inspirational .
Fitness magazines , for me , began to seem useless , because they just rehash the same articles over and over .
But then I realized that I like to read these magazines for the inspiration , not the information .
Find something to inspire you and it ’ll keep you going .

REUTERS / Vincent Kessler
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Installed U.S. wind energy capacity grew nearly 45 percent last year to 16,800 megawatts , or about enough to serve 4.5 million homes , as interest in low - carbon power grew , an industry group said on Wednesday .
Texas remained the top state in both total wind power capacity , which reached with 4,446 MW , and new wind power capacity , the annual report from the American Wind Energy Association said .
The two largest wind projects were both in Texas : Horse Hollow , owned by FPL Energy , a unit of FPL Group , and Sweetwater , owned by Babcock & Brown and Catamount .
Wind power remained the most common source of new installed electricity after natural gas .
Some U.S. utilities increased investments in renewable power generation as the country moved closer to regulating greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide , much of which is generated by coal - fired power plants .
AWEA spokeswoman Christine Real de Azua said a U.S. incentive known as the production tax credit also helped the industry grow last year .
The PTC is set to expire at the end of the year and wind backers hope Congress will renew it to ensure solid growth in coming years .
“ With the right public policy , ( wind ) will be a growing and affordable part of our long term plans , ” said Dick Kelly , the president and CEO of Xcel Energy Inc .
In 2007 , Xcel was the U.S. utility with the most wind power on it system for the third year running , with 2,635 MW , the report said .
While wind power growth soared last year , the industry has also faced challenges recently .
The Texas electric grid operator had to briefly cut power service to industrial customers in late February when the wind in the state stopped blowing .
While the industry said improvements in forecasting would help smooth electricity delivery going forward , the matter focused attention on the intermittent nature of wind power .
In Wednesday ’s report , the state of California came in second in the category of total installed wind capacity , with 2,439 MW , Minnesota was third with 1,299 MW , and Iowa was fourth with 1,271 MW .

The largest manufacturer of turbines installed in the United States last year was GE Energy , with 1,560 turbines , while Denmark ’s Vestas provided 537 turbines and Siemens provided 375 .
President Berdymukhamedov has promised more reforms to come
Turkmenistan 's President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov is abolishing the names of days and months introduced by his predecessor , state media have reported .
Due to popular demand , the Turkmen calendar will revert to its Turkic and Russian - language names .
Former President Saparmurat Niyazov , who died in 2006 , had named January after his own honorific - Turkmenbashi , or Father of the Turkmen .
Other months and days were named after his mother and historical figures .
Cult of personality
The change is one of several reversals of his predecessor 's autocratic legacy that President Berdymukhamedov has hinted at .
He has given few details , but has said that " profound politico - juridical change " is coming .
On Thursday he promised reforms to the constitution established by Mr Niyazov , Turkmenistan 's first ruler after independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Mr Niyazov was known for his eccentric cult of personality .
He used the country 's oil and gas wealth to build golden statues of himself around the country , a theme park based on Turkmen folk tales , and made his book - a " spiritual guide " called the Rukhnama - compulsory reading for students and workers .
In his calendar , Saturday was Rukhnama Day and April was named after his mother , who died in 1948 .
" Names of months and days have to comply with international standards , " Mr Berdymukhamedov was quoted in state media as saying .
Some parts of Johannesburg resembled a war - zone Some 6,000 people have fled a wave of attacks on foreigners in South Africa , which has left at least 22 dead , aid workers say .
" This is a classic refugee situation , " Rachel Cohen from Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) told the BBC .
Many of those who have sought refuge in police stations , churches and community halls are Zimbabweans , who have fled violence and poverty at home .
Up to three million Zimbabweans are thought to be in South Africa .
The BBC's Caroline Hawley in Johannesburg says the immigrants have become a scapegoat for social problems , such as unemployment , crime and a lack of housing .
Mobs of South Africans continue to roam around some townships near Johannesburg , looking for foreigners and looting their shops .
But there have also been attacks on South Africans from other parts of the country , especially from near the Zimbabwean border .
Over the weekend , correspondents say central Johannesburg resembled a war - zone , as armed police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse angry crowds .
SOUTH AFRICA Foreign population : 3 - 5 m Majority from Zimbabwe , also Mozambique , Nigeria Total population : 49 m Unemployment rate : 30 %
In pictures : Johannesburg violence S Africa violence : Your stories S Africa violence : Your comments Foreign attacks concern SA press " If we go back into the streets , they 're going to kill us there , " one Zimbabwean man seeking sanctuary in a police station told the BBC .
Some Zimbabweans say they will go home , despite the political violence there , rather than face attacks in South Africa .
The front pages of several South African newspapers on Monday show a horrific image of a man being burnt to death .
The police say they have made more than 200 arrests for crimes including murder , rape and robbery .
" We 're not talking about xenophobia , we 're talking about criminality , " said police spokesman Govindsamy Mariemuthoo .
He said police reservists and officers from other regions had been called in to help quell the violence , reports the AP news agency .
Loren Landau , from the Wits University Forced Migration Studies Programme , said the nature of the attacks was changing .
" We 're seeing what was an anti-foreigner conflict transforming into what might be seen as an ethnic conflict , " he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme , pointing to the attacks on South Africans .
He also said much of the violence was " opportunistic crime " .
' State of emergency ' A church where about 1,000 Zimbabweans have been taking refuge was attacked over the weekend .
Bishop Paul Veryn of the Central Methodist Church which was attacked told SABC radio : " We consider that the situation is getting so serious that the police can no longer control it . "
He called for a state of emergency to be declared .

Advertisement MSF spokesman Eric Goemaere said : " This reminds me of a refugee situation .
I have treated bullet wounds , beaten people , rape victims , and the people are terrified . "
The attacks on foreigners began a week ago in the township of Alexandra , north of Johannesburg , before spreading to the city centre and across the Gauteng region .
President Thabo Mbeki said he would set up a panel of experts to investigate the violence .
The leader of the governing African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , has also condemned the attacks .
" We cannot allow South Africa to be famous for xenophobia , " he told a conference in Pretoria .
But the Human Rights Commission on Monday accused the government of not doing enough to address the underlying problems .
" There has been poor leadership in this country as far as these issues are concerned , " HRC chief executive Tseliso Thipanyane told public radio .
He pointed out that there was a wave of attacks on foreigners in the late 1990s , before the situation eased in following years .
Since the end of apartheid , migrants from across Africa have gone to South Africa , attracted by its relative prosperity .

Conservatives rolling out attack ads aimed at Obama , supporters Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday April 23 , 2008

Print This Email This Willie Horton ad creator takes credit for Clinton win in PA , unveils new attack aimed at Obama , Clinton Two vicious attack ads aimed at Sen.
Barack Obama and his supporters have emerged in as many days , previewing what could become the most brutal onslaught from the GOP and its allies in modern history .
A third spot that appeared Tuesday attacked Obama and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton .
The North Carolina Republican Party unveiled an ad Tuesday that invokes the most incendiary comments from Obama 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , to attack two Democratic candidates for governor who have endorsed Obama for president .
North Carolina holds its primary in two weeks .
Also on Tuesday , Floyd Brown , the conservative ad- man who created the infamous Willie Horton ads in 1988 , unveiled an ad accusing Obama and Clinton of wanting to raise taxes and it targeted Obama for supporting drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants
That spot came a day after Brown unveiled his first attack ad , which seemed to try to blame Obama for several gang - related murders in Chicago after he had voted against a proposal to impose the death penalty for gang related crimes .
The ad quoted an editoral describing the murders as " urban terrorism " before displaying a picture of Ground Zero and questioning Obama 's toughness in the war on terror .
The narrator says the editorial demanded action on gang violence , but it was written more than three months after the bill it references , which was vetoed by the Illinois governor .
Obama 's campaign released this fact check discounting the ad's contentions .
A press release announcing Brown 's newest ad credited his first effort with delivering Pennsylvania to Clinton in Tuesday 's primary , saying 7 million copies were distributed to political activists .
As of noon Wednesday , the ad had been viewed just 25,000 times on YouTube .
Time magazine called the links the ad tries to portray " indirect and tenuous , " and the Obama camp panned it as " garbage " that represents " everything the American people hate about politics . "
Brown also said he would run his ads in North Carolina .
The state GOP's ad was the first televised effort to bring up Rev.
Wright 's comments , although right - wing ad makers have been salivating at the opportunity to exploit his statements since they first emerged last month .
The Republican National Committee and Sen. John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , both quickly denounced the North Carolina party 's efforts .
On a landing strip near Inez , Ky. , RNC Chairman Mike Duncan said he put in a call this morning to the chairwoman of the North Carolina Republican Party .
" I left a voicemail encouraging her not to run the ad , " he said .
Katie Wright , an RNC spokeswoman , elaborated , saying the national party first learned of the ad last night , and raised objections at a staff level .
" We did n't see it as helpful or appropriate .
But they are an independent organization , " she said of the North Carolina state party .
A few minutes later , McCain weighed in himself .
" We asked them not to run it .
I am sending them an email as we speak asking them to take it down , " McCain said .
" There is no place for that kind of campaigning . "
ABC reports the North Carolina party has " no real money behind the ad right now , " but a YouTube version asks for donations and the party will decide soon how widely to run the ad .
The North Carolina Republican Party issued this attack spot Wednesday morning : This ad debuted Tuesday from Floyd Brown , creator of the infamous " Willie Horton ad " : Brown followed up with this spot Wednesday :
WASHINGTON  The Justice Department revealed on Friday that its internal ethics office is investigating the department ’s legal approval of waterboarding of Al Qaeda suspects by the Central Intelligence Agency and is likely to make public an unclassified version of its report .
The disclosure by H. Marshall Jarrett , head of the department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility , was the first public acknowledgment of an internal review of the series of legal memorandums the department has issued since 2002 authorizing waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods .
His report could become the first public accounting for legal advice that endorsed methods widely denounced by human rights groups and legal authorities as torture .
Mr. Jarrett ’s office can refer matters for criminal prosecution , but legal experts said the likely outcome was a public critique of the legal opinions on interrogation , conceivably including reprimands for some current or former Justice Department attorneys who drafted them .
The disclosure came as a team of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents are conducting a criminal investigation of the C.I.A. ’s destruction in 2005 of videotapes of harsh interrogations of two Al Qaeda suspects , both of whom were subjected to waterboarding .
The technique , which has been used since the Inquisition , involves water poured into the nose and mouth to create a feeling of drowning .
Congress has passed a ban on all coercive interrogations , but President Bush has said he will veto it .
久々 にThe n-Category Cafeを見たら 、Mike Stayによ る" The Continuation Passing Transform and the Yoneda Embedding " なんて記事がありました 。
米田埋め込みは圏論ではお馴染み。継続渡しへの変換はコンピュータ・プログラミングではお馴染み。
この2つは、実は同じものなんだよ。なんで、誰もこのことを言わないんだろうね？
The Yoneda embedding is familiar in category theory .
The continuation passing transform is familiar in computer programming .
They 're the same thing !
Why does n't anyone ever say so ?
Mike Stayのこの記事、面白いのだけど、C++とJavaと圏論の記法がたいした説明もなく混じって出てきて、どうもわかりにくい（少なくとも僕には）。そこで、JavaScriptだけを使って説明してみます。圏論と米田埋め込みの話は今回はしませんが、JavaScriptにより、米田埋め込み（知らなくていいです！！）の対応物を完全に書き下します。*1
未来 のJavaScript CPS（継続渡し方式）への書き換え もっと系統的にCPSへと変換する もっともっと系統的にCPSへと変換する カリー化登場 CPS 変換を行うメタメタ関数 そしてそれか ら
未来 のJavaScript
「 みにくいアヒルの子」に書いたような理由で、今回も、説明用擬似コードとしてJavaScriptを使いたいと思います。が、しかし、現状のJavaScriptではなくて、近未来(? ) のJavaScritです。その仕様は：
変数、関数の引数、関数の戻り値に型宣言を付けられる。 function max(x : Number , y: Number ) : Number のような感じ。これ はJavaScript 2.0ではサポートされるはず。 型パラメータが使え、総称型（型パラメータ付きの型）、総称関数（型パラメータ付きの関数）が使える。
型パラメータについてちょっと説明します。例えば、文字列の配列は
Array < String > と書くことにします。このとき、Stringは型パラメータです。単にArrayと書くよりずっと正確に型を指定できますね。
Array < String > の場合は 、 「 Stringが型パラメータ」とは言っても、Stringは既に定まった型でした。型パラメータの本領が発揮されるのは、「なんだかわからないが、とある型X」を使って
Array<X > のような書き方をしたときです。このときのXは、まだ不定の型ですが、それでも「とある型を要素とする配列」という意味を持ちます。
ただし、Xが、ほんとにXという名前のユーザー定義の型である可能性もありますので、「既に定まった型ではなくて不定なんだぞ！」と強調する目的で、<X> Array <X>と、直前に<X>を付けることもあります。これは、ラムダ式 λx.f(x ) において、式f( x ) 内の変数xをラムダ記号で束縛するのと同じです。不定の型パラメータを持つ型を総称型と呼びます*2。
総称関数とは、不定の型パラメータを含むような関数です*3。例えば、Array2<X , Y> を第1要素がX型で第2要素がY型である配列の型（型パラメータを２つもつ総称型ですね）だとして、
function
makePair ( first : X , second : Y ) : Array2 < X , Y > {
return [ first , second ] ;
}
function <X , Y >
makePair ( first : X , second : Y ) : Array2 < X , Y > {
return [ first , second ] ;
}
は、型パラメータX、Yを含む総称関数です。ここでも、XとYが「 不定 なんだぞ！」と示すために次の書き方を採用することにしましょう。
function <X , Y>は、後続の関数定義内に登場するすべてのX、Yを束縛します -- 束縛の機構は、λ( x , y ) .( 2 x + y ) なんかと同じです 。
総称関数に実際の引数を渡して呼び出すには、不定の型パラメータを具体化しなくてはなりませんが、呼び出しのタイミングで、引数の型に応じて具体化がされると考えてください。上の例のmakePairでは、型を無視した1個の関数により総称関数が実現されてしまいますが、型パラメータX , Yが具体化された形の関数がイッパイあって、その全体（関数の束）が総称関数だと思ってください。
lengthを、文字列の長さを返す関数だとします。length:String ->
Integer のような書き方で、 「 関数lengthは 、String型引数を取り、Integer型の値を返す」ことを表すとします。String ->
Integer の部分を関数のプロファイルと呼びましょう。
さて、次のコードを考えます。
var n:Integer ;
n = length ( " Hello " ) ;
// ...
// nを使って何かする。
// ...
ここで 、 「 nを使って何かする」の部分を、doUsefulThing(n:Integer ) という関数にまとめれば、
var n:Integer ;
n = length ( " Hello " ) ;
doUsefulThing (n ) ;
doUsefulThingは、lengthの結果を使って続きの処理をするので、lengthに対する継続処理関数と呼ぶことにします。もちろん、前もってプログラム全体の処理がわかってないと、「lengthの後に何をやるか」も不明なので、プログラム全体との関係で「lengthに対する継続処理関数」が決まります。
ここで、次の関数を作ります。型宣言されてないcontは、関数引数です（型宣言の詳細は後述）。
function
doSomethingWithLength ( cont , str: String ) : Void {
var n: Integer = length ( str ) ;
cont (n ) ;
}
このdoSomethingWithLengthを使うと、先のコードは次のように書き換えられます。
doSomethingWithLength ( doUsefulThing , " Hello " ) ;
ここで、doSomethingWithLengthの第1引数が継続処理関数であり、第2引数がlengthに渡す文字列であることに注目してください。継続処理関数を単に継続（continuation）とも呼ぶので、次の書き換えを継続渡し方式（continuation passing style ; CPS ）への書き換えと呼びます。
「 lengthの呼び出し＋継続処理 」 → 「 doSomethingWithLength ( 継続処理関数 , lengthへの引数 ) 」
もっと系統的 にCPSへと変換する
前節のdoSomethingWithLengthの定義で、第1引数のcont（継続でした）の型宣言がありません。それをここで考えましょう。cont（に入るべきもの）は、関数であり、lengthの戻り値である整数を引数にとり、戻り値はありません。つまり、cont:Integer ->
Void です。contのプロファイルである Integer ->
Void は関数の型（高階の型）なので、プロファイルの記法をそのまま“ 型の表現 ” としても採用しましょう。
すると、doSomethingWithLength( cont : Integer -> Void , str: String ) : Void となります 。
いや、待ってください。contはいつでも戻り値なし（戻り値Void型）でいいのでしょうか？
例えば、次のコードを継続渡し方式に変換することを考えてください。
var n:Integer ;
n = length ( " Hello " ) ;
var x : Integer ;
x = n - 1 ;
当然これは次のようにしたいですよね。
var x : Integer ;
x = doSomething WithLength ( decrement , " Hello " ) ;
となると、関数doSomethingWithLengthは、その第1引数（継続です）の型に応じて戻り値の型が変動するような関数です。型が変動する -- そう、型パラメータの出番ですぜ、ダンナ。
function <X >
doSomethingWithLength( cont : Integer ->X , str: String ) :X {
return cont( length ( str ) ) ;
}
ここまでの話に出てきた未来JavaScriptのコードは、型宣言を省くと今のJavaScriptでも動きます。試してください。
function
doSomethingWithLength ( cont , str ) {
return cont( length ( str ) ) ;
} function
decrement (n ) {
return n - 1 ;
} var x ;
x = doSomething WithLength ( decrement , " Hello " ) ; // x == 4
もっともっと系統的 にCPSへと変換する
前節までの話は、length : String ->
Integer という関数を固定してのことです。length以外の関数に対しても、CPSへの変換（書き換え）をできるようにしましょう。
その前に言葉の準備 ； ここだけの用語法ですが、lengthのように、継続処理関数の直前に呼び出される（そして、その値は継続に渡される）関数を先行関数と呼びましょう。先行関数を呼び出し、その値を継続処理関数に渡す仕事をするdoSomethingWithLengthのような関数（高階関数）を継続処理メタ関数と呼ぶことにします。
この言葉使いで、前節でやったことをまとめると：
先行関数はlength : String ->
Integer だけを考えた 。
lengthを先行関数とする継続（継続処理の実行関数）は、引数の型がIntegerであり、戻り値型は任意。
以上の前提で、総称関数doSomethingWithLengthを書いた。
ここからは、任意の先行関数hogeに対して、継続処理メタ関数doSomethingWith_hogeを書くのが目的です。実はこれは簡単で、先行関数hogeが hoge : A -> B というプロファイルを持つなら 、
function <X >
doSomethingWith_hoge ( cont : B->X , arg : A ) :X {
return cont ( hoge ( arg ) ) ;
}
とするだけです 。
もし、次のtwice : String -> String という関数に対してdoSomethingWith_twiceを書くなら、下のようになります。
function
twice ( str: String ) : String {
return str + str ;
}
function <X >
doSomethingWith_twice ( cont : String ->X , arg : String ) :X {
return cont( twice ( arg ) ) ;
}
今 のJavaScriptに直しての実行例は：
js > doSomethingWith_twice ( length , " Hello " )
10
カリー化登 場
理論的な扱いを単純化するために、すべての関数を1引数にしましょう。そう、カリー化すればいいんですね。継続処理メタ関数であるdoSomethingWith_length（話の流れ上、Lengthから_lengthに変更）、doSomethingWith_twiceが2引数関数だったんで、これを継続だけを受け取る1引数関数に書き直しましょう。
なーに、たいしたことありません。
function <X >
doSomethingWith_length( cont : Integer ->X ) : String ->X {
return function ( str: String ) { return cont( length ( str ) ) } ;
}
function <X >
doSomethingWith_twice ( cont : String ->X ) : String ->X {
return function ( arg : String ) { return cont( twice ( arg ) ) } ;
}
今のJavaScriptで書くなら：
function
doSomethingWith_length( cont ) {
return function ( str ) { return cont( length ( str ) ) } ;
} function
doSomethingWith_twice( cont ) {
return function ( arg ) { return cont( twice ( arg ) ) } ;
}
ちゃんと動きますよ 。
js > doSomethingWith_length( decrement ) ( " Hello " )
4
js > doSomethingWith_twice( length ) ( " Hello " )

CPS 変換を行うメタメタ関数
さて、今までの話で僕たちは、与えられた先行関数（例えばlengthやtwice）から、それに対応する継続処理メタ関数を書き下しました。先行関数lengthに対してメタ関数doSomethingWith_length、先行関数twiceに対してはメタ関数doSomethingWith_twice、という具合に。
人手でCPSへの変換ができるなら、その手順を関数として書き下すこともできるはずですね。つまり、先行関数を引数にとって対応する継続処理メタ関数を作り出す関数（値がメタ関数ですからメタメタ関数ですね）を書いてみます。
その関数 を cpsTransformだとすると、cpsTransformのプロファイルは
( A->B ) -> (( B->X ) ->( A->X ) )
です。わかりますか ？ ( A->B) が先行関数の型です。先行関数がlengthなら、( String->Integer ) と具体化されます。継続処理メタ関数は、型が( B->X)である継続を受け取って、型が(A->X)である関数を返します（カリー化していますよ）。つまり、継続処理メタ関数の型は
(( B->X ) ->( A->X ) ですね。よって 、CPS変換を行うメタメタ関数のプロファイルは
( A-> B ) ->
(( B->X ) ->( A->X ) ) ってわけです。念のためまとめれば：
先行関数 : ( A -> B ) 継続 : ( B -> X ) 継続処理メタ関数の戻り値 : ( A -> X ) 継続処理メタ関数 : (( B->X ) ->( A->X ) ) CPS 変換メタメタ関数 : ( A-> B ) ->
(( B->X ) ->( A->X ) )
function <A , B , X >
cpsTransform ( prec: A->B ) :( B->X ) ->( A->X ) {
return function ( cont : B->X ) : A->X {
return function ( arg : A ) : X {return cont ( prec ( arg ) ) } ;
} ;
}
今のJavaScriptならば次です。
function
cpsTransform ( prec ) {
return function ( cont ) {
return function ( arg ) { return cont ( prec ( arg ) ) } ;
} ;
}
js > var cps_length = cpsTransform ( length )
js > cps_length ( decrement ) ( " Hello " )
4
js > var cps_twice = cpsTransform ( twice )
js > cps_twice ( length ) ( " Hello " )
10
そしてそれか ら
ここまで来れば、cpsTransformが、集合圏の適当な部分圏Cから、関手圏[ Cop ,
Set ]
への関手を表現していることを確認するのは容易です（定義を知っていれば）。型はCの対象、関数はCの射、メタ関数は関手圏の対象、メタメタ関数が関手圏の射になります。
そして、cpsTransformの定義をていねいに追いかければ、それが米田埋め込みとまったく同じであることが判明するわけですが、それはまたの機会に。

In recent weeks I have banged on about Open Source , expending two articles on Firefox alone .
Open Source applications make their code available to everyone .
Disagreements and rabid balkanisation within the Open Source community aside , for our purposes the term might as well refer to free software whose licence allows you to share the source code , alter it , use it , do with it what you will .
The two great pillars of Open Source are the GNU project and Linux .
I shan't burden you with too much detail , I 'll just make the outrageous claim that your computer will be running some descendant of those two within the next five years and that your life will be better and happier as a result .
I am writing this article on a kind of mini John the Baptist , a system that prepares the way of the software saviour whose coming will deliver the 90 % of world computer users who suffer under Windows from the expensive , clumsy , costly , ugly , pricey toils of Microsoft .
The Asus EEE PC perched on my knee combines GNU software with a Linux kernel powered by an Intel Celeron Mobile Processor to produce a very extraordinary little laptop .
It weighs less than a kilogram , starts up from cold in about 12 seconds and shuts down in five .
It has no internal hard disk and no CD drive .
It offers 512MB of RAM , 4GB of storage and a seven - inch display ; wireless , dial - out modem and ethernet adaptors are available for networking and internet connections , three USB ports , mini - jack sockets for headphones and microphone , a VGA out , an SD card slot and a built - in webcam .
All for about £ 200 - less than the price of a show , dinner and taxi for two in London 's West End .
When you press the EEE 's power button , the lightning speed and quietness of boot - up tell you that you are in the hands of a solid state flash drive : no vulnerable moving parts and buzzing platters here .
Within seconds a tabbed screen will appear on your display : the tabs are labelled Internet , Work , Learn , Play , Settings and Favourites .
A click on each reveals a page containing bright , clear icons that relate to 40 separate applications and half a dozen or so selected web links .
The applications include Skype , Firefox , Thunderbird ( the Mozilla mail client ) and OpenOffice.org , an Open Source suite of applications that allows you to create and edit Word , Excel and Powerpoint documents .
One of the pre-installed web links is to Google Docs , which lets you do the same MS Office compatible work online .
This combination of " server side " applications and Open Source software is , rightly , scaring the heck out of Microsoft which is in danger of relying , in a few years ' time , on its excellent Xbox games console for income and kudos , its domination of personal computing a rapidly diminishing memory .
Well , I 'm allowed to dream .
The EEE is far from perfect : system software claims two - thirds of its meagre 4GB of storage , the keyboard is sub-par , the trackpad worse ; it seems a shame to boast a built - in webcam and a full field of IM clients , yet be incapable of videochat ; the OS , a customised version of Linux , part Debian , part Asus 's own creation , makes downloading outside the bundled software updater uncertain .
But these defects are minor compared with the machine 's astounding value and functionality - and to the future trends in computing it heralds .
This is a computer designed as an introductory machine for children or adults , as well as a simple cheap do - it - all machine along the " One Laptop Per Child " model but which is also absolutely ideal as a truly cheap , portable , resilient device to slam into a backpack or briefcase .
Everything you could want is there in free , Open Source form .
It does not pretend to cater for the power user but , while file management is basic for the average person , tuxheads ( Linux experts ) can go straight to terminal mode and do their stuff .
Meanwhile , for the rest of us , this is a wonderful little friend who does all we need straight out of the box .
And it is only the beginning ...

Recordings of police radio communication reveal that even the LAPD did n't hear dispersal order , and that they knew they were in no danger !
http://la.indymedia.org/uploads/2007/05/lapd01.mp3
From an anonymous source :
" i found these two recordings of police radio communication on the net .
i think both are from after the police cleared out the park , describing how they deal with folks on the streets afterwards .
there is a very interesting part in the first mp3 - LAPD01.mp3 -
about the dispersal order .
apparently the cops did n't really hear
it either :
18:14
" do you know if any airships gave a dispersal order at 7th and alvarado where metro went in and cleaned out the park ? "
" that would be me , yes . "
" okay .
that was a question down here , i know we heard it , or we sort of heard one , but we did n't know where it was coming from . "
There are also lots of parts that make clear the situation was very neglible and there was no rioting going on .
Somewhere in the first mp3 , did n't write down time mark :
one officer : " verify that you are taking rocks and bottles from that building "
another officer : " negative .
what we had is somebody ( inaudible ) threw a can of coke in the middle of the street where no officers were near it . "
later :
" why are we standing around here and do n't clean this up "

During the betas , one of the few new functionality Windows Vista Service Pack 1 added was the ability to create a Windows recovery CD with an easy - to - use GUI interface .
Up and until then , it was slightly harder but still possible to do so through a command line .
Update :
To avoid confusion , this is not the type of recovery discs you find in prepackaged computer systems .
This recovery disc does not reinstall Windows , it merely offers tools to fix it if it ever becomes unbootable .
Whilst all Vista install DVDs include the recovery functionality natively , it ’s probably useful to burn yourself a spare copy to take with you .
You can also download an ISO from NeoSmart .
net but you might not have bandwidth to spare .
For unknown reasons , the functionality was then pulled out of the final release of SP1 .
If you look inside your system files , you can still find recdisc.exe which is the utility ’s executable , but clicking on it does not launch anything .
The shortcut in the Start Menu was also removed , indicating it was removed on purpose .
Out of curiosity , I decided to find out if by copying a version of recdisc.exe from a beta build of Vista SP1 and placing it in SP1 RTM would work .
Thanks to Chris123NT for digging up a copy , it did work .
If you also want to make it work , there ’s a bit of file permissions involved , so here ’s how .
Step 1 . Download a pre-final release of recdisc.exe ( x86 version ) or ( x64 version ) .
Step 2 .
Open your system 32 directory .
Start menu , type “ %systemroot % \system32 ” and click Enter .
Step 3 .
Find recdisc.exe , right click on it and click “ Properties ” .
Step 4 . Select the “ Security ” tab and click “ Advanced ” .
Step 5 . Select the “ Owner ” tab and click “ Edit… ” .
Step 6 . Select “ Administrators ” to change the owner to , click “ OK ” .
Click “ OK ” again on the dialog .
Step 7 .
You should be back at the file security settings dialog .
Click “ Edit .. ” .
Step 8 . Select “ Administrators ” and then tick the checkbox under the “ Allow ” column and “ Full control ” row .
Then click “ OK ” .
Click “ OK ” again to finish .
Step 9 .
Rename this file ( press F2 ) to something like “ recdisc.old ” to keep a backup of the original file in case you need to restore it in the future .
Step 10 .
Copy the “ recdisc.exe ” file you downloaded earlier .
Double click on it to run .
Dr. Bruce P. Rosenthal , chief of low - vision programs at Lighthouse International in Manhattan , which offers services for people with vision loss , said the portable magnifiers , with their built - in illumination and powerful electronics , have many advantages over traditional optical devices like magnifying glasses .
“ Optical devices ca n’t increase the contrast like these devices , ” he said .
“ Loss in contrast causes as many problems as loss of visual acuity . ”
Electronics in the new devices can make black print darker , or switch black lettering on white to white lettering on black  which some people with macular degeneration prefer .
Dr. Rosenthal said the devices could help people with low vision continue with their normal rounds  for instance , shopping in the supermarket or reading a prayer book at a religious service .
“ One of the concerns we have in working with the visually impaired is depression , ” he said .
The more that people can complete everyday activities like everyone else , he added , “ the more they can cope and feel that their lives are no different than others . ”
The devices have a substantial drawback , however , when compared with a $ 40 magnifying glass :
They typically cost $ 700 to $ 1,300 , and Medicare and most private insurance plans usually do not pay for them , said Robert McGillivray , low - vision specialist at the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton , Mass .
Image The SenseView Duo is used to read a newspaper and map .
“ But if the devices get you back to work , or help you with your education , or increase your pleasure in reading , ” he said , “ it ’s well worth considering them . ”
In Baiji , dozens of active insurgent groups feed off corruption from the refinery , said Lt. Ali Shakir , the commander of the paramilitary Iraqi police unit here .
“ If I give you all the names , your hand is going to be tired ” from writing them down , he said .

Credit ... Eros Hoagland for The New York Times
Lieutenant Shakir said the more hard - core insurgent groups had a lot of money to pay other fighters , and he grumbled that part of the reason they thrived was that obvious thievery was never prosecuted .
Another scheme , he said , involves a trucking company owned by a man tied to the insurgency who is also a relative of Baiji ’s mayor .
The trucks take fuel from the refinery but are then unloaded just south of Tikrit .
Making arrests would be a waste of time , he said , because provincial officials would let the perpetrators go .
“ What can I do ? ” he said .
“ After a half hour , they would be released . ”
Last year , the Pentagon estimated that as much as 70 percent of the Baiji refinery ’s production , or $ 2 billion in fuels like gasoline , kerosene and diesel , disappeared annually into the black market .
Baiji supplies eight provinces .
Some of the most obvious corruption and theft , like tanker trucks hijacked at gunpoint from distribution pumps , has been curbed by Captain Da Silva and his predecessors .
The American troops live inside the compound .
Moreover , American officials say they believe that in recent weeks , some illicit profits flowing from the refinery have diminished .
The refinery has been operating at almost full capacity , they say , pouring more fuel on the market and narrowing the spread between government - mandated rates for fuel and what it fetches on the black market .
Exploiting that spread is one key to illicit profits from the refinery .
For example , in January a tanker filled with kerosene that was supposed to be worth about $ 10,000 was going for $ 19,000 in Baiji , according to surveys of black market prices for the American military .
In Samarra , it cost $ 35,000 , a result of what soldiers described as the former mayor ’s efforts to manipulate fuel prices .
SAN DIEGO ( AP ) -- Let 's play 22 !
Colorado and San Diego did just that Thursday night and into Friday morning , slogging through a 22 - inning game that was the longest in the majors in nearly 15 years .
The Rockies finally won 2 - 1 , with Troy Tulowitzki's two - out RBI double bringing in Willy Taveras with an unearned run in nearly empty Petco Park .
A game that lasted 6 hours , 16 minutes was decided by an unearned run .
Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Jake Peavy threw the game 's first pitch at 7:05 p.m .
The game did n't end until 1:21 a.m. , when Padres pitcher Glendon Rusch took a called third strike .
Colorado's Yorvit Torrealba , who caught all 22 innings , wearily pumped a fist in celebration .
" It 's tough to keep your head into it and put together good at - bats and be into every pitch , " Tulowitzki said .
" We were talking about how our legs were hurting out there .
It 's tough to stand on your feet for 22 innings and keep moving . "
Manager Clint Hurdle noticed that his players were a little tight .
" This was a good game to get outside yourself , " Hurdle said .
" About the 16th inning , I said , ' Hey boys , no matter what 's in front of us , there 's a world of people out there who 've got harder rows to hoe than we do .
No matter what happens the rest of the night , have some fun with this thing . ' "
His players listened .
It just took them six more innings to score a run .
" It 's definitely better to win in a 22 - inning game than lose , I 'll tell you that , " Tulowitzki said .
It was the longest game since Aug. 31 , 1993 , when Minnesota beat Cleveland 5 - 4 in 22 innings .
It was also the longest game in Rockies history and in the 5 - year history of Petco Park .
It was the longest by innings for the Padres , and one minute short of matching the longest by time for San Diego .
There 's something about these two teams and extra innings .
On Oct 1. , Colorado rallied past the Padres for a 9 - 8 win in 13 innings in the wild - card tiebreaker game .
There was a little bit of everything , but far too little offense on Thursday .
There were planes to catch -- The Rockies open a series Friday in Houston and the Padres will be at Arizona -- but the game was scoreless until the 14th inning .
Would n't you know it , each team scored a run that inning to prolong it .
NY Times article questions official explanation of sex probe that forced New York governor to resign
By Barry Grey
24 March 2008
An article published by the New York Times on March 21 raises serious questions about the official explanation given by federal prosecutors for the high - powered investigation into the sexual activities of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer that led to Spitzer ’s public humiliation and forced resignation on March 12 .
The article , written by David Johnston and Philip Shenon , cites Justice Department lawyers and former federal prosecutors who make it clear that federal criminal investigations into public officials , like Spitzer , who are identified as clients of prostitution rings are extraordinarily rare .
The article also points to anomalies in the 47 - page affidavit filed March 5 along with the federal complaint against four employees of the Emperor ’s Club prostitution ring which Spitzer allegedly patronized .
The affidavit lists ten clients of the call - girl ring , but does not name them , referring to them only by number .
Spitzer , client number 9 , is the only one whose identity was leaked by federal officials to the press .
And , as the Times article points out , the affidavit “ provided far more detail , some of it unusually explicit , about Client 9’s encounter with the prostitute than about any of the nine other clients identified by number in the document . ”
The implication is that the affidavit was drawn up in such as way as to provide quasi- pornographic grist for a media - promoted sex scandal that would compel the recently elected governor to resign — which is precisely what occurred .
Within two days of the first reports of Spitzer ’s links to the call - girl ring — published by the self same New York Times — the governor announced his resignation .
The article underscores the point as follows : “ Several current and former federal prosecutors and prominent defense lawyers who reviewed the document said the inclusion of such salacious details about Mr. Spitzer ’s encounter with the prostitute went far beyond what was necessary to provide probable cause for the arrests and for searches , the purpose of the affidavit . ”
While questioning the official explanation , the article draws no conclusions as to the motives behind the Spitzer investigation .
However , the only plausible interpretation is that the Justice Department / FBI probe was a political operation directed by the Bush administration for the purpose of reversing an election and removing from office the Democratic governor of the third largest state in the country .
This conclusion is reinforced by a March 22 McClatchy Newspapers report that Roger Stone , a resident of Miami Beach and notorious Republican “ dirty trickster ” since the Nixon era , had a role in the probe of Spitzer .
The Kansas City Star reported that Stone ’s lawyer sent a letter last November to the FBI alleging that Spitzer had hired prostitutes while in Florida .
The letter , released by Stone ’s lawyer , states : “ The governor has paid literally thousands of dollars for these services .
It is Mr. Stone ’s understanding that the governor paid not with credit cards or cash but through some pre-arranged transfer . ”
Stone , recruited by the 2000 Bush campaign to block a recount of votes in the disputed Florida election , is credited with organizing the near - riot of Republican congressional staff members and other operatives that succeeded in shutting down the vote recount in Miami - Dade County .
According to the Star , the letter from Stone ’s lawyer was in response to requests from FBI agents investigating Spitzer to speak with his client .
As the World Socialist Web Site has said since the eruption of the Spitzer affair , we have no political sympathy for the former New York governor , a typical American bourgeois politician and multi-millionaire who , in his short term in office , proposed or carried out hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts to social programs .
Nor are we indifferent to the social issues raised by the purchase of the services of a human being for personal gratification .
However , the essential issue raised in this case is the role of the state apparatus , utilizing the immense financial and technological resources and police powers of the federal government , enhanced by the new domestic spying powers granted under laws enacted in the name of the bogus “ war on terror , ” in manipulating political life and intimidating , silencing or removing those deemed to be political obstacles .
The March 21 New York Times article sheds additional light on the scope and intrusiveness of the Justice Department investigation into the former New York governor , and makes clear that it was anything but routine .
It begins : “ The Justice Department used some of its most intrusive tactics against Eliot Spitzer , examining his financial records , eavesdropping on his phone class and tailing him during its criminal investigation of the Emperor ’s Club prostitution ring .
“ The scale and intensity of the investigation of Mr. Spitzer , then the governor of New York , seemed on its face to be a departure for the Justice Department , which aggressively investigates allegations of wrongdoing by public officials , but almost never investigates people who pay prostitutes for sex .
“ A review of recent federal cases shows that federal prosecutors go sparingly after owners and operators of prostitution enterprises , and usually only when millions of dollars are involved or there are aggravating circumstances , like human trafficking or child exploitation . ”
On the massive scale of the dragnet , the article states : “ The focus on Mr. Spitzer was so intense that the FBI used surveillance teams to follow both him and the prostitute in Washington in February .
The surveillance teams had followed him at least once before — when he visited the city in January but did not engage a prostitute , officials said , confirming a report in the Washington Post .
Stakeouts and surveillance are labor - intensive and often involve teams of a dozen or more agents and non-agent specialists . ”
On the extraordinary nature of the Justice Department decision to pursue a criminal investigation into Spitzer ’s use of call - girl services , the Times cites Bradley D. Simon , described as “ a veteran Justice Department trial lawyer who was federal prosecutor in Brooklyn throughout the 1990s . ”
The newspaper writes :
“ Mr. Simon said it was unusual for the department to bring criminal charges in a prostitution case in which there was no allegation of the exploitation of children , human trafficking or some more serious crime .
“ He said that in his eight years in the Brooklyn office in the 1990s , he could not recall a single major criminal case that centered on prostitution charges .
‘ There were a lot of serious crimes — organized crime , narcotics cases , major financial crime investigations , ’ he said in an interview .
‘ Prostitution was not a high priority . ’ ”
The article concludes : “ Justice Department officials insist that it has a strong record of breaking up large prostitution rings around the country , but many of the cases they cite involve cases brought several years ago , especially before the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks ; after that , the department vowed to focus its attention on national security threats .
“ And for years , they acknowledge , the department has rarely , if ever , prosecuted or even identified the clients of a prostitution ring . ”
The Times cites unnamed government officials who defend the Spitzer investigation and repeat the official story that it began when one of the then - governor ’s banks filed reports with the US Treasury Department of suspicious transactions in his account .
“ The reports suggested to investigators , ” the newspaper writes , “ that Mr. Spitzer might have been trying to keep anyone from noticing transfers of his own funds .
That is the kind of activity that can bring an investigation of the possibility of corruption . ”
However , even if this account of the origins of the investigation is true , it does not explain why a decision was made by the Department of Justice ’s Public Integrity Section and the US attorney of the Southern District of New York to continue the probe after no evidence was found of bribery , influence - peddling , illegal use of campaign funds or any other form of political corruption .
The Times article cites the unidentified government officials as saying that “ once they learned that such a prominent figure was involved in soliciting prostitutes , and had seemed to be arranging sex in violation of the statute that prohibits travel across state lines to engage in sex , they wanted to follow the evidence . ”
Why ?
At the point where no evidence was found of corruption , there was no legitimate reason for the Justice Department to press ahead with a criminal investigation of the governor of New York .
The statute referred to is a 1910 law known as the Mann Act , banning the interstate transport of females for “ immoral purposes . ”
This federal law has been used numerous times for reactionary purposes , including the cases of black boxer Jack Johnson , Charlie Chaplin and singer Chuck Berry .
The Justice Department and FBI had to invoke this law to justify a federal probe of Spitzer ’s sexual activities .
But none of the Public Integrity Section reports for 2004 , 2005 or 2006 , which cite dozens of cases of bribe - taking and influence - peddling by public officials , have a single reference to prostitution or the Mann Act .
The Times cites “ senior political appointees ” at the Justice Department in Washington as saying they had “ little involvement in the case , ” and asserts that Attorney General Michael Mukasey , a former federal judge in New York , was not even told about the case until shortly before March 5 , when the complaint was filed against four of the prostitution ring ’s employees .
This flatly contradicts previous reports that Mukasey signed off on the Spitzer probe .
Moreover , it is wholly unbelievable that top officials in the Justice Department would not have been consulted about a criminal investigation of a powerful and nationally prominent elected official .
The information contained in the New York Times article confirms the analysis made by the World Socialist Web Site and a number of legal experts that the investigation of Spitzer was a politically motivated dragnet organized by the Bush administration for reactionary and anti-democratic ends .
It was well known that Spitzer had presidential aspirations .
He had also made many enemies on Wall Street , because of his well - publicized investigations , during his time as New York State attorney general , of prominent bankers and stock market officials .
A political “ hit ” against Spitzer would be entirely in line with the modus operandi of the Bush administration , which came to power on the basis of electoral fraud and the suppression of votes , and continued its anti-democratic and conspiratorial practices by dragging the country into war on the basis of lies and using the Justice Department to carry out trumped - up voter fraud prosecutions of Democratic candidates and their supporters , as revealed in last year ’s scandal over the firing of nine US attorneys .
In a country wracked by political and economic crisis and dominated by an ever - widening chasm between a financial oligarchy and the working class , the methods of conspiracy and provocation , including the use of sex scandals as an instrument of political manipulation , become increasingly pervasive .
The ultimate target is not the Eliot Spitzers of the world , but the democratic rights of the American working class .
Fabio Messina has never run a shop before and agrees that the supermarket he sunk his savings into and opened yesterday sells a rather eclectic array of goods , from marmalade and pot plants to pyjamas and wristwatches .
But it is a landmark in Palermo : all products and staff are 100 per cent guaranteed Mafia - free , supplied only by shops and producers which have stood up to Sicily 's Cosa Nostra and refused to pay protection money .
' I decided it was right to give those traders who refuse to pay an extra opportunity , ' said Messina , 29 , a former boating instructor and bar owner and now owner of Punto Pizzofree .
The ' Pizzo ' refers to the € 200 ( £ 153 ) to €500 that up to 80 per cent of Palermo 's shopkeepers pay the mob monthly to avoid a smashed window , a mysterious fire or a bomb under their car .
The store is part of an anti-Mafia groundswell that started four years ago when activists plastered Palermo with bill stickers stating : ' An entire population that pays the pizzo is a population without dignity . '
That spawned ' Addiopizzo ' , an organisation promoting stores and suppliers that publicly vowed to pay no more .
Today , 9,000 Palermitans are registered customers and the list contains 241 businesses , 30 of which have their products on Messina 's shelves .
Punto Pizzofree also stocks produce from farms seized from jailed Mafia bosses including Salvatore ' The Beast ' Riina .
The Sicilian Mafia , on the back foot since the arrest in 2006 of fugitive godfather Bernardo Provenzano , was hurt again last year when powerful industrial association Confindustria said it would expel any members paying protection money .
But Palermo's businesses are not in the clear yet .
One member of Addiopizzo , a hardware wholesaler , lost €3 m in goods when mobsters burnt down his warehouse .
Addiopizzo organiser Laura Nocella said shop owners were nervous after recent arrests , fearing new mobsters might move in .
But she added : ' What they need to realise is this is the crucial moment to stand up , or the next mobster looking to take over the patch will know you can be forced to pay . '

It no longer is about Data Portability or Social Graph Portability , if you will .
I ’m hearing these rumors too that John Furrier ( my ex-boss ) is reporting .
That Microsoft will buy Yahoo ’s search and then buy Facebook for $ 15 to $ 20 billion .
Add that to all the news that Microsoft is buying Yahoo ’s search and that gets very interesting .
That just changed the whole argument of Facebook vs. Google to one of Microsoft vs. the Web .
Think about this just a second .
Let ’s say Microsoft gets Yahoo ’s search .
That does n’t look that brilliant .
After all , we know Google is gaining share there and taking Yahoo ’s best advertisers ( and let ’s just forget Microsoft ’s efforts , which have been an utter failure so far ) .
But these two moves would change everything and totally explain why Facebook is working overtime to keep Google from importing anything .
First , let ’s look at what is at stake here :
Loic Le Meur did a little test with me a couple of weeks ago .
He listed his Le Web conference on both Facebook and Upcoming.org .
Here ’s the Facebook listing .
Here ’s the Upcoming.org one .
The Facebook one ca n’t be seen if you do n’t have a Facebook account .
It ’s NOT open to the public Web .
Google ’s spiders CAN NOT REACH IT .
He put both listings up at exactly the same time and did no invites , nothing .
Just let people find these listings on their own .
The Facebook one is NOT available to the Web .
It has 467 people who ’ve accepted it .
The Upcoming.org one IS available to Google and the Web .
It has 101 people on it .
This is a fight for the Web .
We all just crawled inside a box that locks Google out .
Do n’t believe me ?
Go to Google and do a search for “ Le Web 08 . ”
Do you see a Facebook entry there ?
Nope .
Google is locked out of the Web that soon will be owned by Microsoft .
We will never get an open Web back if these two deals happen .
This has created HUGE value for Microsoft and has handed Steve Ballmer an Internet strategy which brings Microsoft from last place to first in less than a week .
Boom !
Now Microsoft / Yahoo search will have access to HUGE SWATHS of Internet info that Google will NOT have access to .
Data and social graph portability is dead on arrival .
Microsoft just bought itself a search strategy that sure looks like a winner to me .
If all this is true there is no way in hell that Facebook will open up now .
It ’s Facebook and Microsoft vs. the open public Web .
Can the open public Web fight back ?
Yes .
It ’s called FriendFeed .
Notice that FriendFeed replaces almost all of Facebook ’s killer features with open ones that are open to Google ’s search .
So , now , do you see why I ’m so interested in FriendFeed ?
It ’s our only hope to compete with Microsoft ’s new “ buy enough and keep it closed ” search strategy .
Do n’t think this matters ?
It sure does .
Relevancy on Yahoo search will go through the roof when it has access to Facebook data and Google does n’t .
People will see that Yahoo has people search ( something I ’ve asked Google for for years ) and Google does n’t .
That ’ll turn the tide in advertising , and all that .
Brilliant move , if this all comes true .
I ’ve SMS ’d Mark Zuckerberg and asked him if he ’s selling .
I doubt he ’ll answer .
I hope he holds out for more than $ 20 billion .
He just might get it .
UPDATE : Someone on Twitter ( Soulhuntre ) says that it does n’t matter as long as HTTP keeps working .
That ’s just the point .
Facebook BLOCKS HTTP if you are n’t logged into its system and it can remove you at a moment ’s notice .
@irinaslutsky ( former employee of mine ) was removed last week from Facebook .
This is a scary company and if it gets in the hands of Microsoft will create a scary monopoly .
UPDATE2 : thanks to XKCD for the cartoon .
I love those cartoons .
This week has seen the release of a raft of new proposals for features to be integrated into the CSS specification :
I personally have reservations about the Visual Effects proposals , feeling this is better suited to Javascript , but I seem to be in the minority on this so I will cede to the majority .
I ’m pretty excited about Variables , however .

The Ethics of Personal Stories
Today ’s thesis : just because you can see it , does n’t mean it ’s yours .
With the swell in personal blogging , a whole lot of people are sharing a whole lot of stories .
Many of these stories are readable by anyone with a modem and time on their hands .
And there are a whole lot of people out there who think that if they can read it , it ’s “ public domain ” .
They think that it ’s perfectly reasonable for them , as a member of a dominant group , to use a personal story of a dilemma , of pain , of grief , for their political ends – even when their use is exploitative , mean - spirited , mocking , and contrary to the original purpose of the story .
“ But it ’s perfectly legal ! ” goes the usual defensive bluster .
“ Do n’t you constrain my frea speach !
You gave up all your rights to your story when you put it out there ! ”
My take : when your political ends are completely antithetical to the story ’s intent , and you know this , and you are a member of that author ’s oppressor group : back off .
It ’s not about whose rights it is , or who has the legal power to enforce limits on speech .
We all know that even if these misuses of stories were illegal ( and it ’s usually not ) , there would be no realistic way of enforcing it .
I ’m talking about a more collective ethics , an ethic of care , á la Carol Gilligan ’s feminist ethics .
An ethics based on respect for others ’ personal boundaries , however fuzzy , and where they are situated in power structures both online and offline .
We ’re forming new sets of ethics here on the internet , in the blogging communities .
And it would be nice if it were based on unalloyed glibertarianism , on something more than the person with the loudest voice shouting , “ Shut up , I can take advantage of whatever and whomever I like .
Ca n’t stop me .
Ner . ”
Three examples coalesced while I was making notes for this story : one offline , two online .
Australian readers have probably guessed the first : Brendan Nelson twisting Faye Lynam ’s story of being one of the Stolen Generations .
The second example involved forced - birther blogger Dawn Eden and her misuse of a blogger ’s personal abortion narrative .
Thirdly , Oz Conservative ’s mocking exploitation of one of the best series in the femiblogosphere last year , Blue Milk ’s Feminist Motherhood series .
Note that the contested stories are all the stories of women .
They are all the stories of women struggling in challenging situations , all the stories of women in positions neither rewarded or respected by the dominant white - male - Christianist - coloniser group .
All are stories of deeply personal struggle and pain , many involving self - doubt or self - examination .
All of these women have been supremely courageous to put their stories out there so that other people , particularly women and / or Indigenous people , might read them and connect with them , might know that they are not alone .
Their personal stories have all been appropriated and misinterpreted for patriarchal purposes .
Their narratives have been colonised , their oppression has been dismissed , denied , and even mocked .
They have been used as pawns for ends they would vehemently disagree with – and their exploiters know this , and do not care .
Not only do they try to take control of and ill - treat our bodies and our labour ; they try to take our stories as well .
Brendan Nelson
Brendan “ Decimal ” Nelson , leader of the Opposition ( conservative ) party in Australia , gave a churlish , mannerless , and inappropriate speech [ video here ] in response to PM Kevin Rudd ’s Apology to the Stolen Generation .
Included in his speech was an misappropriation of Faye Lynam ’s story , from the Many Voices oral history at the National Library of Australia .
This is what he said :
No one should bring a sense of moral superiority to this debate in seeking to diminish the view that good was being sought to be done .
This is a complex issue .
Faye Lyman ’s life is one of the Many Voices oral history at the National Library of Australia .
Faye left her father when she was eight ; “ Personally I do n’t want people to say , ‘ I ’m sorry Faye ’ – I just want them to understand .
“ It was very hurtful to leave Dad .
Oh it broke my heart .
Dad said to me ,
It ’s hard for daddy and the authorities wo n’t let you stay with me in a tent on the riverbank .
You ’re a little girl and you need someone to look after you .
I remember him telling us that , and I cried .
I said , ‘ No , but Dad , you look after us . ’
But they kept telling us it was n’t the right thing .
“ I do n’t want people to say sorry .
I just want them to understand the hurt , what happened when we were initially separated , and just understand the society , what they ’ve done .
You do n’t belong in either world .
I ca n’t explain it .
It hurts so much . ”
There is no compensation fund , nor should there be .
How can any sum of money replace a life deprived of knowing your family ?
Separation was then , and remains today , a painful but necessary part of public policy in the protection of children .
news.com.au reported the effect that this had on Lynam :
“ How dare he use my words , the bloody bastard , ” Mrs Lynam told the newspaper , after reading the text of Dr Nelson ’s speech .
“ He does n’t realise how much that has hurt , it was a toxic speech . ”
She also said the speech had changed her greatly .
‘‘ He ’s turned my world upside down , ” she said .
“ Why would he use that in such a horrible way ?
It makes me so angry . ” [… ]
“ He took my story … out of context , ” she said .
“ And now I feel like I ’m stolen all over again … my dignity … I was ashamed to hear that he had done this to me .
He used … my story for his political career , and he told me he read ( these quotes ) three years ago , so he had plenty of time to get a hold of me . ”
The Milton - Ulladulla Times has more :
Dr Nelson quoted part of Ms Lynam ’s account of being taken from her father when she was six , which is included in the Many Voices oral history document .
“ He should have read it all , ” Ms Lynam said .
“ Then he would have realised , because they promised Dad he could come and visit me , see me , said they ’re not taking me away .
As soon as they got out of sight of my father , when he came to visit me , to the house , they said I was n’t there , they moved me . ”
Ms Lynam said her dad kept searching for her , but every time he got close , she was moved again , eventually being shifted from eastern Victoria ’s Gippsland region to Melbourne . [ … ]
Ms Lynam said the years she spent with white families were “ hell ” and that she had been sexually abused many times .
“ The hurt of going from my dad and then going to this place and be sexually abused and ridiculed day in day out , put a little black girl on show , ” she said .
“ I used to just keep very quiet somewhere .
They ’d bring me down because they always lived on the pub premises and when the men got a few beers into them , there were so many sexual abuses , yeah it was horrific .
It was horrific to go through .
If I was with my dad , it would have never happened to me .
My dad would have protected me . ”
After Dr Nelson quoted her as saying she did n’t want people to say sorry , Ms Lynam said she wanted to set the record straight .
“ It was n’t meant in the text that I did n’t want people to feel sorry , ” she said .
“ I did n’t want to say ‘ poor little Faye ’ , and all this ..
I wanted them to understand the real story , why I was taken and what we went through .
It was n’t a better life .
They put us in hell . ”
This .
This is the story that a white man manipulated to claim that good was being sought by the kidnappers , by the abusers .
This is the story that Nelson claims is the story of a girl who “ left her father ” .
Not the Stolen Generation , not even the “ Separated Generation ” ( repulsive euphemism ) , but an attempt to cast her in the eyes of the nation as a member of the “ Generation That Left Of Their Own Free Will For A Better Life ” .
Dawn Eden
You ca n’t be in the pro-reproductive - justice blogosphere and not know of egregiously - nasty forced - birther Dawn Eden .
Jill at Feministe recently picked up on an episode of particular nastiness from her foul corner of the web : “ Do Professional “ Pro- Lifers ” Care About Women ? ”
Pro-choice blogger in media res wrote her own medical abortion story , for women to share .
It was a story of pain and difficulty and loss , but not a story of regret .
The followups are here .
And Dawn Eden and her regulars , misogynists extraordinaire , appropriated it , and mangled it , and disingeuously claimed they were just doing it to ask her readers to “ pray for the woman in question ” .
As Jill says :
Her feelings , and her experiences , are valid .
And she is not the first feminist I ’ve spoken with who feels loss or pain after abortion .
Unfortunately , there are huge disincentives for women to be honest about their abortion experiences .
Women who do n’t grieve , or who simply feel relief and not pain , are accused of being selfish , heartless , or deluding themselves , assumed to be putting off the real pain that ’s bound to come .
Women who say “ I had an abortion ” without mentioning guilt or pain are accused of “ bragging . ”
Any woman who is n’t apologetic is at the very least an irresponsible whore .
Women who do admit some ambiguity in their emotions are inundated with religious anti-choice rhetoric about how they ’re surely grieving about killing their baby , and they should join this or that “ pro-life ” or “ post - abortive ” ministry .
Whenever pro-choicers try to create a space for women to speak about abortion , it ’s infiltrated and abused by shameless anti-choicers with an agenda .
And that ’s exactly what Dawn is doing here .
The blogger at In medias res has asked that her story not be used as anti-choice political fodder .
And despite Dawn ’s supposed concern for the blogger ’s mental health and well - being , she puts up a post that the blogger in question has made clear is doing her emotional harm .
The writer has said that while the experience was painful , she learned from it and she feels she ’s stronger for it .
She has written about feeling better .
Despite her words being twisted around to support an ideology she vehemently opposes , she still has the courage to write honestly .
Oz Conservative
Oz Conservative is pretty much what his blog title claims : a traditionalist Australian conservative man , Mark Richardson .
You know the deal : gold - digging women gotta be reminded of their sacred baby - making duties , white Australian fertility crisis , homophobia , evpsych - worship , etc .
He says shit like “ femininity can only flourish when men are moved to create a protected space for it . ” , and “ Worse , Gillard separates a woman ’s achievements and character from her femininity . ” , freaks out at critical whiteness studies and “ attacks on traditional family values ” .
You know the guy , or at least his type .
So when Bluemilk started her Feminist Motherhood series , he wallowed with joy .
Women sharing their stories !
Feminists talking critically about sacrifice , about motherhood , about the challenges they faced and the dilemmas they resolved !
Instead of seeing this as it was – a group of women sharing their real , complex , ambiguous personal stories – he leapt on it it as a chink in the feminist armour , as an opportunity for attack .
“ When feminists become mothers ” , he snarked , as if the two are somehow mutually exclusive .
He gotcha ’d Theresa for valuing her family as well as her autonomy .
He claimed Marjorie possessed only a “ residual feminism ” ( as though her feminism were pesky cancer cells , only nearly eradicated ) because she chose to be a stay - at - home mother .
He excoriated Rose and blamed her family difficulties on her feminist parenting .
And he revelled scornfully and triumphantly in the ways in which all of the women talked about the need to balance their individualism with their family ’s needs .
“ You submit , I win ” , was the overall , crowing impression .
Bluemilk responded thus :
Thanks Mark for your interest in the feminist motherhood series .
While I disagree with most of your conclusions I think we both found these posts fascinating .
Please remember that the women participating in this are real people who bravely put their thoughts and personal experiences out there for others ( particularly other mothers ) to read and reflect upon , and that most of them are not academics and are n’t used to seeing their words selectively quoted for the purposes of counter - argument .
Their stories should always be treated with respect .
It is also worth remembering that these women are the experts on their own lives , not you or I ( we ’re seeing a tiny snippet of these complex lives – even tinier when selectively quoted by you – that they ’ve been generous enough to share with us ) and describing their actions and decisions as “ mistakes ” is arrogant .
The second last question I posed to feminist mothers was – “ Do you feel feminism has failed mothers and if so how ? ” .
I wanted to look at the much cherished right - wing notion that feminists are anti-mothers and see whether there was in fact a burning resentment out there among feminist mothers towards feminism .
It is interesting to see that you ’ve chosen to quote from one of the very few mothers who perceived feminism as having failed her to some degree as a mother , rather than the many more who did n’t .
All their responses are interesting , but why not also quote from the feminist mothers who expressed the opposite view ?
If you want to use these mothers ’ responses to support your theories , acknowledge where they challenge them too .
Finally , a response to your own post ’s conclusions – ALL mothers , feminist and non-feminist alike experience a change in “ attitude to autonomy ” after motherhood , and I ’d guess that pretty much ALL involved fathers do too .
This is not some great lesson to teach feminists to come to heel , this is a lesson in the sacrifice of parenthood .
No -one can really be fully prepared for the exhaustion of parenting , it takes us all by surprise .
I would argue that the ones who cope best with this surprise are the ones who are empowered , supported , valued , and able to share the domestic workload fairly .
I echoed her interpretation , and I added this layer :
Among enormous masses of other leaps of illogic and selective quoting , he appears to have pigeonholed “ feminism ” , as though it is a monolithic hivemind , into a neoliberal box valuing autonomy above all else .
This does not accord in any way with the feminisms with which I ’m familiar – those which places a very high value on collectivism , connections between women , and ( within the subgroup of feminist mothers ) a much more thoughtful , compassionate approach to parenting than I ’ve ever seen out of antifeminist conservative circles , which have given us the Pearls and BabyWise .
The deep , warm , honest feminist - mothers series illustrated this point exquisitely .
But where would the neocons be without their haughty , materialistic strawfeminists ?
In Conclusion
The information explosion and the rise of blogging are further blurring public / private boundaries .
This is not a bad thing ; this allows some people who have traditionally been denied any voice to share their stories , to collate their experiences .
Exploiters try to validate their exploitation in terms of these personal stories being “ public domain ” , part of the “ historical record ” .
They justify their appropriation as “ free speech ” , and they consider anything they can access to be “ fair game ” .
By using the term “ game ” , of course , they are perhaps giving themselves away : casting themselves in the role of predator , the writer in the role of prey .
Why do they hunt us ?
Women are sharing their stories of personal pain .
Is this threatening to them ?
Yes , I think it is .
The personal is political , and consciousness - raising groups are about sharing our personal stories and learning from them .
We learn we are not alone .
We learn that our oppression is not our fault .
if we ca n’t share our stories safely , we ca n’t find the patterns and meanings in them .
We ca n’t postulate an underlying explanation , or begin collective action .
Women ’s stories are only a threat to those who oppress them .
So the oppressors will try to silence us any way they can : by appropriation , by misinterpretation , by mockery , by hitting us where they think it will hurt – our most personal feelings and experiences , our reproductive choices , our quandaries , our pain .
The oppressor ’s response to resistance to these attacks is the same as the oppressor ’s response to our rape activism : “ If you do n’t like it , stay home .
Protect yourself .
Lock your doors .
Do n’t talk to strangers .
If you put yourself out there , any abuse we visit on you is your own fault .
You ’ve only got yourself to blame . ”
To them , the answer to “ The world ’s a dangerous place ” is “ If you do n’t like it , stay out of it ” .
I ’m arguing for a different response : “ the world ’s a dangerous place : let ’s make it safer ” .
I am not arguing for banning , extrinsic control , or legal action ; but for respect for people who put their personal pain out there .
Examine your privilege .
If you ’re not going to use a personal story in good faith , if you ’re going to twist it into the polar opposite of everything that person holds dear , think twice .
just because you can see it , does n’t mean it ’s yours .
We ’re involved in the the collective writing of a new ethics , not based in law or regulations , but based in a chosen care and respect for those less powerful .
How is it going to work ?
I do n’t know .
But we ’ll never know if we do n’t try .

Six years ago , the New York Times published a front - page article reporting that only eight people had shown up at a Times Square cinema to see an afternoon screening of Woody Allen 's new film , Hollywood Ending .
To many of us , the number sounded a bit high ; surely the eight included ushers , refugees seeking political asylum , undercover cops and vagrants .
The ex cathedra pronouncement that Woody Allen comedies were no longer in vogue came as no great shock to most regular moviegoers , and certainly not to people under the age of 30 ( sticklers who prefer comedies that are actually funny ) , as it had been widely reported in other outlets that the once - revered actor / writer / director had n't made a film worth seeing in years , and nothing vaguely approaching the quality of Annie Hall , Broadway Danny Rose , Manhattan , The Purple Rose of Cairo , or even Bullets Over Broadway .
People did n't talk about Woody Allen movies any more , not even people who had been breathlessly waiting for his latest release since their university days .
Allen was a spent force , and - because of his unorthodox parenting style , his unseemly custody battles with ex-partner Mia Farrow and the distressing allegations of child abuse that arose from this contretemps - an embarrassment .
Be that as it may , the front - page coverage by the NYT , a newspaper whose core audience consists of people who positively adore the witty foreign - films - lite of the type Allen once offered , was a watershed moment : in a sense , a long - delayed eulogy over a corpse that had been awaiting interment for years .
It was a pretty clear indication that Allen was finished as a driving force in US cinema .
Nothing if not resilient , the feisty auteur trundled off to Britain in the hope of reviving his career .
The result was a glum trio of daft , extraneous London films : the sycophantic , culturally benighted Match Point , the paleolithic murder mystery Scoop , and the lugubrious drama Cassandra 's Dream .
Allen , who had complained vociferously about Hollywood 's crass obsession with big - budget films , was hoping that his diehard European fans would flock to his latest offerings , thereby shaming his compatriots back home into revising their opinion of his recent work .
This tactic paid off with Match Point , a deceptively repugnant film that did shockingly well at the box office considering its shallow premise and asinine plot , but Scoop was not a hit .
The water having run dry at this particular oasis , Allen then moseyed along to Spain , where he began shooting Vicky Christina Barcelona , which debuted at the Cannes film festival this weekend .
The cast includes Penélope Cruz , Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson , very possibly the only actor on the planet who is more annoying onscreen than Allen himself .
Americans can be blamed for many things , but the perpetuation of Allen 's zombie - like career is one atrocity for which we refuse to be held accountable .
It is Europeans who are providing much of the money for these projects , Europeans who are welcoming the director to their communities , Europeans who are marching through the turnstiles in support of Allen 's interchangeably neurasthenic films .
Europeans are the ones paying the freight for Allen 's cavalcade of duds .
To those of us who have watched Allen 's two - decade decline into that cataleptic Eric Claptonesque state where an artist is revered as a god , but not by anyone who originally worshipped in his church , Allen 's Grand Tour of Europe is baffling .
I have seen Match Point three times now and simply cannot keep a straight face during Allen 's perplexing and in many ways offensive attempt to make a Mike Leigh movie .
The film is ostensibly about class : a penniless Irish ex-tennis star ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) is determined to rise above his station by reading Dostoyevsky , attending La Traviata and Damien Hirst exhibits and marrying Emily Mortimer .
Unfortunately , Allen gets it all wrong : when you shoot a Mike Leigh movie , you are n't supposed to make Mummy and Papa and their grouse - shooting twit progeny the heroes .
And when you repeatedly show Mummy and Papa and Twitty and Tweedledum at Covent Garden going into raptures over Verdi , you can't then have Mortimer salivating at the prospect of attending Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Woman in White .
It makes you look like an idiot .
Here , as in so many other Allen films , art , music and literature serve a phony , ornamental function ; you never really believe that any of his characters actually enjoy abstract art or have read Aristophanes .
It 's just an excuse for the college drop - out Allen to show off .
" Look , Mom !
I know who Modigliani is !
See , I can pronounce the word ' Proust ' . "
Match Point is like a dozen other Woody Allen movies : Low - Fat High Culture , Bergman for Beginners .
Ostensibly a parable about the role of luck in human destiny , Match Point is actually yet another opportunity for the notoriously craven , Wasp - obsessed director to suck up to the wealthy , heaping all the abuse on the depraved - Irish !
- working - class slob who tries to better himself , while reserving the most glowing admiration for the aforementioned Mummy and Papa , paragons of pristine plumminess and supah seraphic swellness .
The crowning moment in the film occurs when the prole gets a surprise late - night visit from the ghost of his mistress ( Johansson ) , who still seems pretty ticked off that he blew her head off with a shotgun just as she was getting ready to pick out baby clothes for her unborn child .
Oliver Twisted handles the dopey ditz well enough , but then when the ghost of Johansson 's next - door neighbour also pops by for a late - night confab , and demands why on earth he had to blow an innocent bystander like her to smithereens , he replies by quoting Sophocles .
This is the reason there were only eight people in that Times Square movie theatre six years back .
We got sick of this malarkey years ago .
In the follow - up to Match Point , Allen made the disastrous decision to cast Johansson in the role that had previously been played by Louise Lasser , Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow - actresses who can actually act .
He made the equally disastrous decision to cast himself as her sidekick , a klutzy third - rate magician .
Thus , while he had officially taken the hint and stopped casting himself opposite nubile young women in romantic situations where he got to paw them for a few hours , Scoop ended up with Allen and Johansson sharing the screen together most of the time , with the dapper male lead Hugh Jackman twiddling his thumbs off - camera .
In other words , Allen - who simply has no idea how cadaverously gross he looks onscreen at this juncture , who simply cannot accept that he is not the second coming of Groucho Marx - was back to his old tricks as The Dirty Old Man with a Heart of Gold .
The laughs seeming to have dried up , Allen next cranked out Cassandra 's Dream , a grim tale about two brothers who decide to launch second careers and become the most inept hitmen in the history of south London .
The film is essentially a meditation on the meaning of life , which raises the interesting question of why it is set in south London .
There is no law against making movies about amateur working - class hitmen , just as there is no law against making movies about shotgun - toting tennis stars masquerading as Notting Hill burglars who quote Sophocles to spectral apparitions .
But if you people on your side of the Atlantic are going to keep funding this hokum , you 're going to have to accept the responsibility .
My greatest worry is that Allen will keep this European tour going for the rest of his life , dropping in on one gullible country after another , making a couple of locally financed films and then blowing town before the stench hits .
I can see a Zagreb - based Woody Allen film where the director plays a washed - up Serb stand - up comic whose career is suddenly revived by meeting a perky Bosnian - American exchange student played by Thandie Newton .
I can see a Polish Woody Allen film about a washed - up klezmer player whose career is revived by a chance encounter with a Santa Cruz forensic scientist ( Tina Fey ) investigating Chopin 's suspicious death .
I can see a Macedonian film about a social - climbing rag merchant who keeps getting visits from a ghost who claims to be Alexander the Great , but is actually a delusional Second Avenue deli counter man named Herbie Schlegel .
I can see movies with names like Fulvio's Inamorata , Anne - Laure et Ses Tantes Amusantes , The Caper Was in Copenhagen , the Kapers in Kiev and Trust Me , Mahmoud , I Can Get It for You Wholesale !
I can see the sultry , maladroit , pointless Johansson cast as Mata Hari , Marlene Dietrich , the Empress Dowager , Helen of Troy , Judy Garland and Boudica 's long - lost twin sister , Vicki .
I can see Allen casting himself opposite Angelina Jolie , Anne Hathaway , Audrey Tautou and three dozen as - yet unborn children .
Not only can I see a reworking of Hannah and Her Sisters , I can see Allen starring as an aging Lothario in Hannah Montana and Her Sisters .
I can see this thing going on and on , year after year , forever .
Do n't blame us , Europe .
We warned you .
· This article was amended on Tuesday May 27 2008 .
We described a piece in the New York Times about Woody Allen as " a long - delayed eulogy over a corpse that had been awaiting internment for years " .
It should have said interment ( burial ) rather than internment ( detention ) .
The mistake was introduced during the editing process .
This has been corrected .
“ She ’s raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran , ” said Geraldine Ferraro , a Clinton supporter and the first woman to be the vice - presidential nominee of a major party , contrasting her own brief stint as a running mate in 1984 with Mrs. Clinton ’s 17 - month - and - counting slog .

Ms. Goodwin and others say Mrs. Clinton was able to convert the sexism she faced on the trail into votes and donations , extending the life of a candidacy that suffered a serious blow at the Iowa caucuses .
Like so many women before , she was heckled ( in New Hampshire , a few men told her to iron their shirts ) and called nasty names ( “ How do we beat the bitch ? ” Senator John McCain was asked at one campaign event ) .
But the response may have been more powerful than the injury .
In the days after Mrs. Clinton was criticized for misting up on the campaign trail , she won the New Hampshire primary and drew a wave of donations , many from women expressing indignation about how she had been treated .
And Mrs. Clinton seemed to channel the lives of regular women , who often saw her as an avenging angel .
Take Judith Henry , 67 , for whom Mrs. Clinton ’s primary losses stirred decades - old memories of working at a phone company where women were not allowed to hold management positions .
“ They always gave us the clerical jobs and told us we did n’t have families to support , ” she said .
At a rally last month in Bloomington , Ind. , she sat with her daughter Susan Henry , 45 , a warehouse worker , who complained that her male colleagues did less work and made more money than the women did .
Decades after the dissolution of movement feminism , Mrs. Clinton ’s events and donor lists filled with women who had experienced insult or isolation on the job .
Moitri Chowdhury Savard , 36 , a doctor in Queens , was once asked by a supervisor why she was not home cooking for her husband ; Liz Kuoppala , 37 , of Eveleth , Minn. , worked as the only woman in her mining crew and is now the only woman on the City Council .
Ms. Kamarck , 57 , the Harvard professor and a longtime adviser to Democratic candidates , said she was still incredulous about the time her colleagues on Walter F. Mondale ’s presidential campaign , all men , left for lunch without inviting her  because , she later discovered , they were headed to a strip club .
Janet Napolitano , the Democratic governor of Arizona , said the world was different now , especially the political world , thanks in part to Mrs. Clinton .
“ I never heard anybody say she ca n’t be elected because she ’s a woman , ” said Ms. Napolitano , who supports Mr. Obama and like many of his supporters saw less sexism in the race than Mrs. Clinton ’s backers .
“ That ’s a different deal than we ’ve heard before in American politics . ”
One of the biggest selling points for Firefox has been their tabbed browsing , but there 's a lot of room for improvement in that department .
We 've got eight suggestions of extensions which may make your browsing experience at least a little bit more organized .
Aging Tabs -
Sometimes you end up leaving a tab open all day , and then you forget about it and what it was about in the first place .
With Aging Tabs , the color of the tab begins to fade with age , showing you that there is something different about it .
ChromoTabs -
This extension will color your tabs based on the site to give you more of a visual cue to what each tab is without having to read them .
FishEye Tabs - Instead of having to scroll from side - to - side when your number of tabs exceeds your screen width , FishEye will shrink the tabs so they all fit , an the one you roll over expands so you can read it .
Informational Tab -
Adds a progress meter and preview to each tab so you can see what is loading .
Multiple Tab Hanler -
Gives you the ability to close multiple tabs at once as opposed to clicking on each ( Yes , it does support English despite the image showing Japanese . )

At one meeting in the West Wing , a source told Broder and Johnson , Clinton “ kind of got this evil look and said , ‘ We ’ve got to do something about this Cooper bill .
We ’ve got to kill it before it goes any further . ’ ”
Clinton denounced the Cooper plan as “ dangerous and threatening . ”
Deputies were dispatched to Tennessee to attack his plan .
Senator Jay Rockefeller said that Cooper is “ a real fraud .
I hope he does n’t make it to this place . ”
According to Newsweek , Clinton brought an aide with a video camera to a meeting with senators and asked the senators to denounce Cooper on the spot .
The Clinton effort backfired .
It temporarily raised his profile back home .
Her health care reform failed , too .
She says she ’s learned the lessons from that failure , but she remains icy toward Cooper .
Her health care memos , including a three - page memo drafted in preparation for her meeting with Cooper , have not been made public by the National Archives .
Moreover , the debate Clinton is having with Barack Obama echoes the debate she had with Cooper 15 years ago .
The issue , once again , is over whether to use government to coerce people into getting coverage .
The Clintonites argue that without coercion , there will be free - riders on the system .
They ’ve got a point .
But there are serious health care economists on both sides of the issue .
And in the heat of battle , Clinton has turned the debate between universal coverage and universal access into a sort of philosophical holy grail , with a party of righteousness and a party of error .
She ’s imposed Manichaean categories on a technical issue , just as she did a decade and half ago .
And she ’s done it even though she has n’t answered legitimate questions about how she would enforce her universal coverage mandate .
Cooper , who , not surprisingly , supports Barack Obama , believes that Clinton has n’t changed .
“ Hillary ’s approach is so absolutist , draconian and intolerant , it means a replay of 1993 . ”
He argues that her more coercive approach would once again be a political death knell .
No Republican will support it .
Red state Democrats will face impossible pressures at home .
It ’s smarter to begin by offering people affordable access to coverage and evolve from there .
Cooper is , of course , a man who has been burned in the past .
But it is legitimate to wonder if adults can really change all that much .
A defter politician would have reached out to Cooper and made an attempt to address the concerns he represents .
Threads
Background and thoughts
Suppose you want some sort of coarse - grained parallel system with a set of compute nodes and a master node making requests of the compute nodes .
For examples , the compute nodes do BLAST searches , or chemical similarity searches , or energy minimization .
How do you implement it ?
There are many ways .
In the HPC ( that 's " High Performance Computing " ) world you could use MPI or PVM .
Or Linda or TCGMSG ( is that still around ? ) or any of a large number of alternates .
Descendants of Linda include JavaSpaces and variants , I think .
In the Python world I 've heard good comments about using Pyro ( " Python Remote Object " ) .
CORBA used to be a hot topic and is still a solution .
Try omniORB / omniORBpy if you want to try that route .
I 'm partial to web - based services .
Stick a web server on each machine .
The master node makes a request to the web server and gets a response .
Because the compute likely takes some time the response might be " check back later " , and possibly with a URL to use for the check .
Or because you control both sides of the connection , have the master node also implement a web server so the client nodes can send the results back through another web request .
That is , the master node 's request to the client includes a callback URL which the client uses to send the results back to the server .
In all of these solutions you have to worry about what happens when one of the machines goes down .
If a client goes down do you redo the request on another machine ?
How do you detect that a machine goes down ?
With a per-node MTBF of 5 years then a cluster with 128 machines will have a fault every 15 days .
RAID arrays have shown that it 's possible to have good overall reliability even when less reliable components .
Google and others are continuing decades of research in how to make distributed operating systems fault - tolerant .
For most things I do I can ignore the problem , or make occasional " are you alive ? " pings on the server .
Implementing this sort of system means the server should handle , or at least appear to handle , multiple things at the same time .
For example , doing a BLAST job while also answering a status or a ping request , or queuing up new jobs .
Implementations
This is supposed to be an educational talk so I 'll ask the question " how do you implement a multitasking server ? "
There are three general solutions .
Starting a new process
web server creates a working directory for the new task
web server starts a controller program as a backgrounded system process , passing the working directory and other parameters through the command line or in agreed upon file in that directory
the controller program starts up the real program - not in the background
when the real program finishes the controller resumes , collates data , and creates a status file in the working directory .
It could send email , make a web request , or otherwise notify something else that it 's done .
the web server can view the status file to get status information
Warning against threads
The easiest is to let the OS do everything for you .
Got a BLAST job to run ?
Start it as a new process in the background .
My usual solution looks like this :
This approach uses the file system for communication .
It 's boring but it works .
I said that to get it out of the way .
You 're likely reading this because you want to know about threads .
Mostly you should stay away from threads .
They are tricky to use .
Many libraries are n't thread - safe .
Even the CPython core is n't thread - safe so there 's a a global interpreter lock ( the " GIL " ) so only one thread has access to the core interpreter at a time .
C extensions can release the lock by using special calls to release the GIL , and reacquire when returning to the Python core .
Threads generally do n't scale well .
( Meaning more than 50 - 100 threads . )
Each thread has its own stack , which is about a MB or so .
Threads are susceptible to subtle and hard - to - debug timing problems because one thread can change things out from underneath another thread .
For example , suppose in the following
if key in some_dictionary : some_dictionary [ key ] += 1 else : some_dictionary [ key ] = 1
another thread got control just after the " if key in " test .
If the key was there then the test returns True and the first path is taken .
The other thread could remove the key from the dictionary causing the += 1 to fail .
This is solvable by locking parts of the data structure but then there 's the overhead of locking and unlocking all the time , even when collisions are rare , and it's hard to test that you got it right .
If you 're going to use threads then it 's best to use a " shared none " approach , where the data structures between the threads are not shared .
Failing that , the shared data should be read - only .
Failing that , well , locks help , and use Queues to pass data ownership between threads .
I 'll talk more about this in a bit .
Reactors and collaborative multitasking
Another solution , more appropriate to I/O multitasking , is using a dispatcher which checks if any data came in from the network , GUI , or scheduler .
If so , pass the data to a handler waiting for the event .
When the event is done the handler returns control to the dispatcher , which processes the next event .
This usually requires a big code rewrite to turn things inside out because the handler must explicitly say when it 's giving up control , which is called " collaborative multitasking " as compared to threads which are " preemptive multitasking " because control can pass to another thread at any time .
Python comes with the asyncore and asynchat modules which implement this sort of approach , known as a reactor pattern .
The " async " is short for " asynchronous " because there 's a separation of control between receiving data and doing something with it .
Allegra is a relatively new package still in development extending the core Python functionality .
Twisted is the best known asynchronous application toolkit for Python .
In general people find asynchronous libraries hard to write .
Yet another approach is Stackless Python .
It uses a completely different way to handle threads which let you have even tens of thousands of simultaneous lightweight threads , but with limitations on what you can do with them .
The limitations mostly affect C programs and not Python programs .
Note though that Stackless does not change the fundamentals of the problem .
If a function blocks ( waiting for I /O or doing some sort of computation ) then you 'll still need to use a system thread or asynchronous I/O .
Stackless only makes it easier .
I wo n't show any example of using these .
Besides requiring a different view on how to program there is n't much code available designed for these system so you 'll end up redoing a lot of existing work to get things running .
Threads
Here 's a function I want to have run in its own thread .
import time def compute( x ) : time.sleep ( x ) return x*x
In real code this might make a web request , start another program , connect to a database , etc .
The common way to start a new thread is through subclassing threading .
Thread .
It 's a two - step process : construct the object then call its " start " method .
The start method creates the new thread then then calls it 's own " run " method .
Each subclass must implement an appropriate " run " .
In the following I 'll start 3 threads , each with it 's own value to compute .
Note that the main thread ends before the compute threads have finished .
Unless the threads are marked as " daemons " Python wo n't exit until all threads have finished .
import time import datetime import threading def compute( x ) : time.sleep ( x ) return x*x # Include a timestamp in the log message def log( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M:%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message ) # Each compute request gets its own thread class ComputeThread ( threading .
Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , value ) : threading .
Thread.__init__( self ) self.value = value def run( self ) : result = compute ( self.value ) log ( " %s -> %s " % ( self.value , result ) ) def main ( ) : log (" starting main thread " ) ComputeThread ( 3) .start ( ) ComputeThread ( 2.5 ) .start ( ) ComputeThread ( 1) .start ( ) log ( " ending main thread " ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
00:36:17 starting main thread 00:36:17 ending main thread 00:36:18 1 -> 1 00:36:19 2.5 -> 6.25 00:36:20 3 -> 9
Thread pool and Queues
Here 's the outputYou can see that I 'm a late night person .
There is some overhead to starting new threads , which adds up .
Often there are resource limits to consider .
For example , if the thread connects to a remote server then you may want to limit the program so it makes at most three simultaneous requests .
The usual solution for this is a thread pool .
These are threads waiting for a request .
Some other thread sends the request to the thread pool .
One of the threads in the pool gets it and executes it .
When finished it waits for another request .
The key part to this is waiting for a request .
This is done with a Queue .
Queue object .
Use a Queue to communicate across threads .
I 'll say that again : use a Queue to communicate across threads .
Do n't worry about locks and other low - level techniques .
Queue does what you need .
Queues implement " put " and " get " .
These are thread - safe meaning that any thread can put and get without conflicts .
By default the queue has unlimited length and a thread can put things in the queue and keep on going .
If the queue is empty then doing a get in a thread will block that thread until the queue is not empty .
If the queue contains an object then doing a get in a thread will retrieve that object .
Only one thread will ever get that object .
The idea behind a Queue is there are producers and consumers .
Producers " put " things into the queue and consumers " get " things from the queue .
Consumers always wait until something is ready , and only one consumer gets an item from the queue .
There is a minor tricky point .
How does the thread know when to finish ?
I said " [ w ] hen finished [ the thread ] waits for another request " but I also said " Python wo n't exit until all threads have finished . "
I could mark a thread as a daemon but then it would exist the moment all other non-daemon threads are finished , aborting any task in progress .
What I 'll do is signal all of the compute threads to finish .
I 'll use a special request object .
When a ComputeThread get s it then it knows to exit .
I 'll use None for that object but the details are up to you .
I do have to send N termination objects , one for each compute thread .
Here 's an example of a thread pool with 3 threads handling 5 requests
import time import datetime import threading import Queue def log( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M :%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message ) def compute ( x ) : time.sleep ( x ) return x*x #
Threads form a thread - pool waiting for compute requests in the request_queue class ComputeThread ( threading .
Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , id , request_queue ) : threading .
Thread.__init__(self , name = " ComputeThread - %d " % ( id , ) ) self.request_queue = request_queue def run( self ) : while 1 : # block waiting for something in the queue req = self.request_queue.get ( ) if req is None : # Nothing more to process ; quit break result = compute ( req ) log ( " %s %s -> %s " % ( self.getName ( ) , req , result ) ) def main ( ) : log (" starting main thread " ) request_queue = Queue. Queue ( ) # Initialize the thread pool with three compute threads N_compute_threads = 3 for i in range ( N_compute_threads ) : ComputeThread( i , request_queue ) .start ( ) # Make 5 requests request_queue.put ( 4 ) request_queue.put (5 ) request_queue.put ( 3 ) request_queue .
put ( 1.5 ) request_queue.put( 2.2 ) # Send shutdown messages to all the threads in the pool for i in range ( N_compute_threads ) : request_queue.put( None ) log ( " Main thread finished . " ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
01:06:09 starting main thread 01:06:09 Main thread finished .
01:06:12 ComputeThread -2 3 -> 9 01:06:13 ComputeThread-0 4 -> 16 01:06:14 ComputeThread - 2 1.5 -> 2.25 01:06:14 ComputeThread -1 5 -> 25 01:06:15 ComputeThread -0 2.2 -> 4.84
Bidirectional communications
and when run just now it produced
In the previous example code passed from the main thread to the compute threads but nothing came back to the main thread .
This is rather useless in real code .
Usually the calling thread wants to make use of the result .
I can solve this with another Queue .
When I make the request I 'll send the value to compute and also send the Queue to use for the response .
When the computation is done the ComputeThread sends the result back through the response queue .
This is something easier shown in code than elaborating more .
import time import datetime import threading import Queue def log( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M :%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message ) def compute ( x ) : time.sleep ( x ) return x*x #
Threads form a thread - pool waiting for compute requests in the request_queue class ComputeThread ( threading .
Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , id , request_queue ) : threading .
Thread.__init__(self , name = " ComputeThread - %d " % ( id , ) ) self.request_queue = request_queue def run( self ) : while 1 : # block waiting for something in the queue req = self.request_queue.get ( ) if req is None : # Nothing more to process ; quit break value , response_queue = req result = compute ( value ) log ( " %s %s -> %s " % ( self.getName ( ) , value , result ) ) response_queue.put ( result ) request_queue = Queue. Queue ( ) def threaded_sum( values ) : sum = 0.0 response_queue = Queue. Queue ( ) for value in values : request_queue.put ( ( value , response_queue ) ) # accumulate results ; the response order will not be the same as the input !
#
The " _ " is a convention meaning " I do n't care about the actual variable name . " for _ in values : sum += response_queue.get ( ) return sum def main ( ) : log (" starting main thread " ) # Initialize the thread pool with three compute threads N_compute_threads = 3 for i in range ( N_compute_threads ) : ComputeThread( i , request_queue ) .start ( ) # Make 5 requests result = threaded_sum ( ( 4 , 5 , 3 , 1.5 , 2.2 ) ) log ( " the sum is %f " % ( result , ) ) # Send shutdown messages to all the threads in the pool for i in range ( N_compute_threads ) : request_queue.put( None ) log ( " Main thread finished . " ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
01:22:16 starting main thread 01:22:19 ComputeThread -2 3 -> 9 01:22:20 ComputeThread-0 4 -> 16 01:22:21 ComputeThread - 2 1.5 -> 2.25 01:22:21 ComputeThread -1 5 -> 25 01:22:22 ComputeThread -0 2.2 -> 4.84 01:22:22 the sum is 57.090000 01:22:22
Main thread finished .
and the output is Sweet !
I jokingly say " sweet " but there were bugs when I wrote the code .
An annoying thing about threads is they are hard to kill .
Hitting control - C does n't always kill a Python program with multiple threads .
When that happens I then hit control - Z to suspend the task , then do a " kill % % " to send the soft kill signal , then " fg " to go back to Python , and another control - C to really kill it .
I could also do " kill - 9 % % " instead of the " kill % % " but that always seems so rude .
thread variables
Sometimes you need per-thread variables .
For example , the C variable " errno " is a per- thread variable often implemented via # define macro tricks .
The value of errno reflects the most recent error value from a C library function call in the current thread and not the error value from some other thread .
As another example , CherryPy is a thread - based web server library for Python .
Each request is handled in by a differen thread .
The request and response information are stored in thread variables accessed via " cherrypy.request " and " cherrypy.response " .
For example , to change the content - type header for the response a Cherry Py handler might look like :
@expose def spam ( self , x ) : cherrypy.response.headers [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / plain " return " You asked for %r " % ( x , )
Making new thread - local variables is easy .
Before describing how , I 'll remind you that just like global variables ( or per- modules ) variables are generally the wrong solution , so are thread - local variables .
You 'll rarely need them , but there are times when they are useful .
Which means coming up with a good example is hard .
Suppose the compute task has a bug which occurs when the request value is >
3 and you want to debug that case via log ( or print ) statements .
There are a few ways to implement that .
I decided to use a thread variable solution .
I made the log function defer to a thread - local variable named " log " and added a couple of log ( ) calls to the compute ( ) fucntion .
For the main thread the thread - local log prints the information to stdout .
def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M:%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message ) def log_nothing ( message ) : pass local = threading .local ( ) # the main thread always logs local.log = log_to_stdout def log( message ) : local.log ( message ) def compute( x ) : log ( " want to compute %r " % ( x , ) ) time . sleep ( x ) result = x*x log ( " finished computing %r ; it is %r " % ( x , result ) ) return result
class ComputeThread ( threading .
Thread ) : ... def run( self ) : local.log = log_nothing while 1 : ...
while the ComputeThreads by default log using the log_nothing function
The caller can override the default using a new " debug " option which enables logging for the thread in the thread pool
def run( self ) : local.log = log_nothing while 1 : # block waiting for something in the queue req = self.request_queue.get ( ) if req is None : # Nothing more to process ; quit break value , response_queue , debug = req if debug : local.log = log_to_stdout else : local.log = log_nothing result = compute ( value ) log ( " %s %s -> %s " % ( self.getName ( ) , value , result ) ) response_queue.put( result )
To enable debugging when the requst > 3 I pass a debug flag as the third field in the item put ( ) into the request_queue .
( At this point I start thinking I need a new class with attributes for value , response_queue , and debug rather than passing them in as a tuple . )
def threaded_sum ( values ) : sum = 0.0 response_queue = Queue. Queue ( ) for value in values : debug = ( value > 3 ) request_queue.put ( ( value , response_queue , debug ) ) # accumulate results ; the order will not be the same as the input !
#
The " _ " is a convention meaning " I do n't care about the actual variable name . " for _ in values : sum += response_queue.get ( ) return sum
Here are all the changes in one place
import time import datetime import threading import Queue def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M:%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message ) def log_nothing ( message ) : pass local = threading .local ( ) # the main thread always logs local.log = log_to_stdout def log( message ) : local.log ( message ) def compute( x ) : log ( " want to compute %r " % ( x , ) ) time . sleep ( x ) result = x*x log ( " finished computing %r ; it is %r " % ( x , result ) ) return result #

Locks
When I run it I get
Sometimes using a Queue has too much overhead .
A Queue uses locks for syncronization and it's a way to communicate between threads .
What if you do n't need all that ?
For example , the print statement prints to stdout , which is a shared resources .
It 's possible that two threads could print to stdout at the same time and the two outputs be jumbled into one .
If you print a single string this wo n't happen because of Python 's GIL , but it could happen with comma-separated fields like this :
print " a= " , a ( ) , " b= " , b( )
because some other thread could get control of stdout between the time a( ) is called and the time it is printed .
My log_to_stdout function was written so the output was in one string .
In that way I did n't have to worry about locking stdout .
def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M:%S " ) print " %s %s " % ( now , message )
def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M :%S " ) print now , message
Suppose that I wanted to write it like this The thread change could occur between printing the " now " and the " message " .
I could uses a Queue and have a dedicated stdout writing thread , but like I said , that seems rather a lot of overhead .
Instead I 'll use a lock to guarantee that two " log_to_stdout " functions cannot mess each other up .
A lock is either locked or unlocked .
If it 's unlocked then calling its " acquire ( ) " method puts it into a locked state .
If it 's locked then calling its " acquire ( ) " method blocks the calling thread until the lock is released ( and no one else grabs it before the current thread . )
Calling " release ( ) " releases the lock
stdout_lock = threading .
Lock ( ) def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M:%S " ) stdout_lock.acquire( ) try : print now , message finally : stdout_lock.release ( )
stdout_lock = threading .
Lock ( ) def log_to_stdout ( message ) : now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) .strftime ( " %H : %M :%S " ) with stdout_lock : print now , message
Using single threaded libraries
Python 2.5 adds the " with " statement , which is designed for resource management tasks like this .
The object 's special __enter__ method is called at the start of the code block of the with statement and its __exit__ method is called when the code block ends or it raises an exception .
Python 2.5 's lock objects implement the with protocol .
The __enter__ method acquires the lock and the __exit__ releases it .
The result looks like this :
Some libraries are not thread - safe .
There are various solutions depending on what " not thread safe " means .
If the library uses global ( module ) variables to store per-instance values then it 's just badly written .
Libraries like Tk and SQLite are n't thread - safe meaning that two different threads must not call a library function at the same time .
The two solutions for this case are 1 ) use a lock around all library calls or 2 ) send the request to a special thread dedicated to that library .
Rather than use one of those complicated libraries I 'll have a simple example of a non - thread safe library which counts the number of times it 's been called
call_count = 0 def double( x ) : global call_count call_count += 1 return x*2

def call_in_thread( T , f ) : response_queue = Queue. Queue ( ) T.queue.put ( ( f , response_queue ) ) return response_queue.get ( ) call_count = 0 def double( x ) : global call_count call_count += 1 return x *2 class ComputeThread ( threading .
Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , value ) : threading .

partial is new in Python 2.5 .

I want to call it using something likeHere 's how to implement that using a Queue .
In the following I 'll start a few threads each doing something which calls the single - threaded doubler function .
Here 's how to implement it using a lock .
This code is obviously simpler .

The callable runs in the current thread .

Penis Professor – Is Growth Possible ?
Is it possible to grow your penis twice as fast with the Penis Professor program than with their closest competitor ?
There is no doubt that increasing the size of one ’s penis can be achieved through certain exercise techniques , though most men fail to make the decision to do something about it .
Every product proclaims to have the answer to your problem , so how do you choose which one to spend your money on ?
Penis Professor is no exception , so we ’ll look closer to see how this particular product stacks up against the competition .
Firstly , I have to speak a little about the psychology behind the male preoccupation with penis size .
In order to be a great lover and to perform well , a man needs to have confidence , and if the size of his penis is small then it can cause impotency simply because he doubts his ability to satisfy a woman .
Fortunately , the Penis Professor exercise program , and several other similar products come to the rescue offering a natural way of enhancing and enlarging the penis through a regular exercise routine .
It only takes 6 minutes per day , 4 or 5 days per week to produce astonishing results according to Penis Professor , and they also claim to enable your penis to grow at least twice as fast using their techniques , compared with even their closest competitor .
Penis Professor and Dangerous Alternatives
If you are lacking confidence and wish to find a solution which will enable you to satisfy your woman , or simply to make yourself irresistible to women , then Penis Professor has to be on your short - list .
There are many different methods that people have tried over the centuries , and some of these methods are outright dangerous .
Firstly , many men have tried to hang weights from the end of their penises .
This is NOT to be recommended .
Not only can this stress the tissue , but it can cause deformity and even impotence .
When using the techniques which are described in the Penis Professor method , there are none which instruct or imply the use of weights .
Surgery can be used to lengthen the penis .
This is known as penile augmentation surgery , and is not recommended for anyone with a flaccid penis size of more than 1.6 inches ( 4 cm ) or 3 inches ( 7.5 cm ) erect .
In any case , the most common method to increase penis size by surgery is to cut the suspensory ligament and then to use skin grafts to allow for the added length .
Generally , the results of this add a small amount of length to the penis when flaccid , but nothing much to the size when erect .
Also , there is a major downside to this , because when erect , the penis does not point upwards , which is a major draw - back when having sexual intercourse .
Results recorded have shown that the flaccid length of the penis can be increased by .5 cm to 1.6 cm ( .25 to .75 inches ) through this type of surgery .
Personally I would hate to have mine pointing towards the floor simply to feel happier about having a penis which only shows a small increase in size when flaccid , and no noticeable difference in length when erect .
Pills are often advertised as a solution to lengthening the penis .
Actually there is no evidence from good quality research resources which prove that any hormonal therapy ( testosterone or other sex hormones and steroids are able to make any permanent change to the size of a man ’s penis .
There are also a lot of herbal “ remedies ” advertised which claim to increase penile size and increase virility .
it could be that certain pills may increase a man ’s sex drive temporarily , but to claim that the length of a penis can be permanently increased through the use of hormones is complete nonsense .
Yet again , if one follows the exercise routine in the Penis Professor program , there is nothing within the instructions which recommends the use of pills or hormones of any kind .
Other methods which are sold by unscrupulous companies claiming to offer permanent size increases , include vacuum pumps , electrical or magnetic apparatus which attempt to stimulate penis growth .
Generally , these advertisements can be found in men ’s magazines , and are now widely found on the internet .
Is Penis Professor right for me ?
There is a lot of information available on the internet and choosing the right product can be confusing , so if a particular program can publish clinically proven results and testimonials , then it ’s probably time to jump off the fence and make a decision to go with it .
On their main web site , Penis Professor link to another site which show independently produced results from comparative tests done on 50 men using 10 different products … .
The results show that Penis Professor came out on top by a substantial margin .
I recently read an article by a guy who calls himself Boner Man who is apparently quite famous .
In the article he asks the questions , firstly , “ is it safe ? ” and secondly , will it work for me ? ”
Obviously a guy who calls himself Boner Man must be quite a fanatic , so probably a good place to get some advice from someone who has tried many different methods for enlarging his penis .
He warns that you should be careful which methods you use , and randomly choosing methods from the internet could cause you problems .
So it is best to choose a reputable source of information before you start to exercise .
When you are happy and confident that you have found the right source of information , make sure that you get a guarantee that gives you sufficient time to see the results that you are looking for .
A guarantee is necessary so that if you find that , despite your best efforts , you get no significant increase in size , you can get a full refund .
Guarantees are available from most companies of course , and the Penis Professor Guarantee offers a full 8 - week , no questions asked , money back guarantee , which is certainly enough time for you to find out if the exercise program lives up to their claims .
Results from Using the Penis Professor Program
More information about what you may expect when you use a natural penis enlargement exercise routine .
Natural penis enlargement exercise routines are amongst the safest methods of enhancing the size of your manhood , so long as you get your exercise advice from established and reputable sources such as Penis Professor .
So when you consider doing something along the lines of an all - natural penis enlargement exercise program , you need to know in advance what results you can expect .
With the right expectation and positive mindset going into this program , you ’re likely to be much happier and more satisfied with your results of your dedicated work .
Results Are Permanent
Of course the upside is that you can expect your penis exercise results to achieve permanent enhancements to your penis size .
This is the advantage of doing penis exercises with Penis Professor compared to other methods such as penis pumps , where to continue to enjoy results , you have to continue to use the apparatus , or for surgery which would require maintenance care , follow up procedures , not to mention the dangers and negligible benefits ( if any ) .
With exercises you are stimulating several areas of your penis , which also enhances their other functions , giving you loads of additional benefits .
Expect Extra Benefits of using Penis Professor
Some related benefits which result from the Penis Professor enlargement exercise routine include improved circulation .
The benefits of increased circulation give you harder and stronger erections , increases in stamina and better control of your ejaculate , all can be achieved through penal exercise .
Which means that you can hold yourself back from coming too quickly , which of course would do wonders for your partner ’s pleasure and for your satisfaction and self - esteem .
One to Three Inches Growth Within Three to Twelve Months
What improvements in size can you reasonably expect ?
There ’s no doubt that men will have differing results dependent on how committed they are and also with regard to different body attributes .
We have reports of men achieving a 1/ 4 ″ to 1/2 ″ inch size increase as soon as two weeks from starting the exercises , and 1 to 3 inches gain within 3 to 12 months .
Apart from the increase in length , they have also noticed an improvement in the girth and in the quality and strength of their erections .
There is one definite certainty …
If you are wishing to improve your package , it wo n’t matter what size you begin with , I ’ve never found any better method of penis enlargement , and I ’ve tried all of them .
Penis Professor – The Bottom Line
One thing that you ’ll definitely expect when you embark on a natural penis exercise program is to actually exercise .
Unlike surgery and pills ( discussed in our previous article ) which are much riskier and promise results without any effort on your part , natural exercise programs will require you to dedicate some time and effort into an exercises routine .
And unlike surgery and pills , exercise programs are more likely to be legitimate , giving you true and lasting results , provided you choose the right program .
It could take at least two weeks before you begin to see the first results of your efforts .
If you wish to learn more about high quality , trusted penis enlargement exercise programs , and what they can do for you , visit the Penis Professor official website and read from the many reports written by guys who have increased their size , confidence and self - esteem through using the exercise program .

CSS image replacement is a technique of replacing a text element ( usually a header tag ) with an image .
An example of this would be including a logo on a page .
You may want to use a < h1 > tag and text for this for the accessibility and SEO benefits , but ideally you ’d like to show your logo , not text .
Update ( March 14 , 2012 ) .
I ’ve created a new page that now covers more image replacement techniques , including the more recent Scott Kellum Method and the HTML5BP Method .
I ’m calling it the CSS Image Replacement Museum
Note that some of these techniques are very old .
Web design in the early 2000 ’s was a lot different than it is now , but there was still much thought being put into accessibility .
Because of that , most of these techniques still hold up today .
It is still very interesting to see all the thought and problem solving that was put into this .
Also note that I tested all these FF2 , Opera 9 , Safari 3 , and IE 6 and they all behaved identically ( hard to believe , I know ) .
The report card consists of five major categories :
CSS ON / Images ON
Represents browsers in their normal states .
All techniques should pass this test , since that ’s the whole point .
/ Images Represents browsers in their normal states .
All techniques should pass this test , since that ’s the whole point .
CSS ON / Images OFF
Represents browsing with regular stylesheets applied but images turned off .
This is rare but a possibility ( folks with bandwidth concerns … )
This is the most difficult test .
Since most of these techniques go to various lengths to hide text , when the images are turned off that means that nothing is displayed which ai n’t good .
Displaying text only here is considered a pass .
/ Images Represents browsing with regular stylesheets applied but images turned off .

Most techniques default to regular web text here which is n’t exactly a fail , but since images may still be turned on , I do n’t consider it a pass either .

/ Images Represents browsing with both images turned off and no stylesheets applied .

Extra Unnecessary Markup
Having to add markup for the sole purpose of image replacement is not ideal .
Does not achieve true separation from content and design .
Technique # 1
< h1 id =" technique - one " >
< span>CSS - Tricks</ span > </h1 >
h1#technique - one { width : 250 px ; height : 25 px ; background - image : url( logo.gif ) ; } h1 # technique - one span { display : none ; }
More information :
This technique is referred to as FIR or “ Fahrner Image Replacement “ .
Much has been written about this including an A List Apart article about it ’s problems with accessibility as well as an article from David Shea defending it .
The premise here is to use a span to wrap the text inside the header and use that span to hide the text .
It works , but using display : none will hide the text from screen readers ( and presumably search bots , not good ) .
Technique # 2
< h1 class =" technique - two " > CSS - Tricks </h1 >
h1.technique - two { width : 2350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) top right ; margin : 0 0 0 - 2000 px ; }
More information : Radu Darvas is credited with this technique .
Basically this technique creates a giant box that goes way off the screen to the left .
The text , being left - justified , cannot be seen .
The image is placed in the top left of this box .
It works , but it has the common problem of failing with CSS ON / Images OFF .
I can also see this giant box thing being a problem in more complex layouts , besides being just generally less efficient than some other techniques .
Technique # 3
< h1 class =" technique - three " >
CSS - Tricks </h1 >
h1.technique - three { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; }
More information :
This technique is credited to Mike Rundle and referred to as the Phark Method .
This is probably the most widely used technique today .
At the time of this writing , it is certainly the one I use most often .
There is even a T - Shirt based on this one ( 2nd up from the bottom .
The premise is deliciously simple : replace block with background image , kick text off page with indent .
It ’s effective and keeps screen readers happy .
It only fails the elusive CSS ON / Images OFF issue .
A variation on this technique is to use negative letter spacing instead , which purports to resolve problems with triggering huge unwanted scrollbars in some browsers .
Technique # 4
< h1 class =" technique - four " > < a href= " # " > < img src=" images/header-image.jpg " alt =" CSS - Tricks " /> </a> </h1 >
h1.technique - four { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; }
More information : I ’m not sure the origin of this technique , but it ’s basically an extension of the Phark technique .
Instead of bumping text off the screen you are bumping an image off the screen .
This has the distinct advantage of still showing an image when CSS is OFF and images are ON , and also has ALT text for 508 compliance .
This technique still fails with CSS ON / Images OFF .
I give credit to Volkan GÃ¶rgÃ¼lÃ¼ for pointing out this is the technique that Smashing Magazine is using in their header .
One concern over this technique is whether or not it is effective SEO , specifically , if ALT text is just as good as regular web text .
An extension of this technique would be to include regular web text inside the anchor link as well .
Both the text and the image would get bumped off the page with the text - indent and it would aliveate the SEO concerns , but then you ’d get “ double text ” with both images OFF and CSS OFF .
Technique # 5
< h1 class =" technique - five " > < img src=" images/blank.gif " alt = " CSS - Tricks " /> < span>CSS - Tricks</ span > </h1 >
h1.technique - five { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) ; } h1.technique - five span { display : none ; }
More information : Radu Darvas is also credited with this technique .
By including a single - pixel transparent GIF image to the markup , you can restore ALT text with images turned off .
This allows text to be displayed with CSS ON / Images OFF (! ) .
Very effective , but adding the shim GIF is quite the blow to semantics .
Also , with both CSS and Images OFF you get “ double text ” , meaning both the alt text and the regular header text .
Technique # 6
< h1 class =" technique - six " >
CSS - Tricks </h1 >
h1.technique - six { width : 350 px ; padding : 75 px 0 0 0 ; height : 0 ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) no-repeat ; overflow : hidden ; }
More information :
This technique is credited to simultaneous discovery by Seamus Leahy and Stuart Langridge .
This technique creates a box which will render with a height generated solely by top padding .
By setting overflow to hidden , text will automatically be hidden but the box will be properly sized for a background image .
This is accessibility - friendly and fairly effective , but fails in the CSS OFF / Images ON test as well as requires a box model hack for older versions of IE .
Technique # 7
< h1 class =" technique - seven " > < span>CSS - Tricks</ span > </h1 >
h1.technique - seven { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) no-repeat ; } h1.technique - seven span { display : block ; width : 0 ; height : 0 ; overflow : hidden ; }
More information : Credited to Leon Dwyer .
This technique is able to hide the text by putting it inside a box 0px wide and 0px tall with hidden overflow .
Because it does n’t use the display attribute to hide the text , it ’s safe for screen readers .
Technique # 8
< h1 class =" technique - eight " >
< span></span>CSS-Tricks </h1 >
h1.technique - eight { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; position : relative ; } h1.technique - eight span { background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) ; position : absolute ; width : 100 % ; height : 100 % ; }
More information :
This technique is credited to Levin Alexander .
In this technique , instead of pushing the text off the page or otherwise hiding it , the background image just sits on top of the text .
This is the only other technique besides # 5 which passes the CSS ON / Images OFF test .
One problem with this technique is that if your background image uses transparency , the text will show through .
Also , while not included in the original writeup of this technique , I would suggest hiding the overflow so that if the text size is bumped up large enough that it breaks out of the box it wo n’t show .
Technique # 9
< h1 class =" technique - nine " >
CSS - Tricks </h1 >
h1.technique - nine { width : 350 px ; height : 75 px ; background : url ( " images/header-image.jpg " ) no -repeat ; font - size : 1 px ; color : white ; }
More information :
This technique is credited to Russ Weakley .
With this technique , simply setting the text to an ultra-tiny 1 px size and matching it ’s color to the background color of the image , you do n’t even need to hide it .
While this technique makes a lot of sense accessibility wise , it has it ’s own problems .
Like most of the others , it does n’t work with CSS ON / Images OFF .
Even at the 1px size , the text is still visible , so this will only work on flat color backgrounds where it can blend in perfectly .
I also have my suspicions that there may be some SEO penalties for this , both for the very small font - size and for matching background - color and color .

My Life At NInety : Looking Back And Moving On
By Maggie Mahar , AlterNet
The Center for Public Integrity , a public interest investigative journalism organization , has obtained copies of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) study of environmental and health data in eight Great Lakes states that was scheduled for publication in July 2007 .
The report , which pointed to elevated rates of lung , colon , and breast cancer ; low birth weight ; and infant mortality in several of the geographical areas of concern has not yet been made public .
A few days before the report was slated to be released , it was pulled .
Meanwhile , at precisely the same time , its lead author , Christopher De Rosa , has been removed from the position he held since 1992 .
The Center for Public Integrity is asking why .
The study , “ Public Health Implications of Hazardous Substances in Twenty - Six U.S. Great Lakes Areas of Concern ” was developed by the CDC ’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) at the request of the International Joint Commission , an independent U.S - Canadian organization that monitors and advises both governments on the use and quality of boundary waters .
The CDC report brings together two sets of data : environmental data on known “ areas of concern ” — including superfund sites and hazardous waste dumps — and separate health data collected by county or , in some cases , smaller geographical regions .

AP :
The head of the Southern California slaughterhouse at the center of the largest beef recall in U.S. history acknowledged Wednesday that cattle were illegally slaughtered at his plant and that cows too sick to stand were forced into the food supply .
Westland / Hallmark Meat Co. President Steve Mendell made the admissions after a congressional panel forced him to watch undercover video of abuses of cattle at his plant .
Mendell watched head - in - hand as cows were dragged by chains , jabbed by forklifts and shocked to get them into the box where they'd be slaughtered .
This is what happens when you have a political ideology and party who believes that government and regulatory oversight is an impediment -- rather than a necessary instrument -- to protecting the public interest .
Whether it 's poisonous lead paint in our children 's toy bins or tainted meat on our dinner tables , government must play a vital role in ensuring consumer products are safe for public consumption .
Bravo to the House Energy and Oversight Committee for exposing this travesty and holding accountable those responsible .
UPDATE : The Westland / Hallmark Meat Company was the source of the nearly 37 million pounds of recalled meat earlier this month .
Last week many western commentators scrambling to interpret the protests in Lhasa found that they did not need to work especially hard .
Surely the Tibetans are the latest of many brave peoples to rebel against communist totalitarianism ?
The rhetorical templates of the cold war are still close at hand , shaping western discussions of Islam or Asia .
Dusting off the hoary oppositions between the free and unfree worlds , the Wall Street Journal declared that religious freedom was the main issue .
" On the streets of Lhasa , China has again had a vivid demonstration of the power of conscience to move people to action against a soulless , and brittle , state . "
This is stirring stuff .
Never mind that the rioters in Lhasa were attacking Han Chinese immigrants rather than the Chinese state , or that the Chinese authorities have been relatively restrained so far , one cautious step behind middle - class public opinion - which I sensed in China last week to be overwhelmingly against the Tibetan ethnic minority .
As for religious freedom , the Tibetans have had more of it in recent years than at any time since the cultural revolution .
Eager to draw tourists to Tibet , Chinese authorities have helped to rebuild many of the monasteries destroyed by Red Guards in the 1960s and 70s , turning them into Disneylands of Buddhism .
Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism have even inspired a counterculture among Chinese jaded by their new affluence .
Indeed , Tibet 's economy has surpassed China 's average growth rate , helped by generous subsidies from Beijing and more than a million tourists a year .
The vast rural hinterland shows few signs of this growth , but Lhasa , with its shopping malls , glass - and - steel office buildings , massage parlours and hair saloons , resembles a Chinese provincial city on the make .
Beijing hopes that the new rail link to Lhasa , which makes possible the cheap extraction of Tibet 's uranium and copper , will bring about kuayueshi fazhan ( " leapfrog development " ) - economic , social and cultural .
Tibet has been enlisted into what is the biggest and swiftest modernisation in history : China 's development on the model of consumer capitalism , which has been cheer - led by the Wall Street Journal and other western financial media that found in China the corporate holy grail of low - priced goods and high profits .
Tibetans - whose biggest problem , according to Rupert Murdoch , is believing that the Dalai Lama " is the son of God " - have the chance to be on the right side of history ; they could discard their superstitions and embrace , like Murdoch , China 's brave new world .
So why do they want independence ?
How is it that , as the Economist put it , " years of rapid economic growth , which China had hoped would dampen separatist demands , have achieved the opposite " ?
For one , the Chinese failed to consult Tibetans about the kind of economic growth they wanted .
In this sense , at least , Tibetans are not much more politically impotent than the hundreds of millions of hapless Chinese uprooted by China 's Faustian pact with consumer capitalism .
The Tibetans share their frustration with farmers and tribal peoples in the Indian states of West Bengal and Orissa , who , though apparently inhabiting the world 's largest democracy , confront a murderous axis of politicians , businessmen , and militias determined to corral their ancestral lands into a global network of profit .
However , Tibet 's ordeal has been in the making for some time .
Before the railway line speeded up Han Chinese immigration , China 's floating population of migrant workers , criminals , carpetbaggers and prostitutes conspicuously dominated Tibetan cities such as Lhasa , Gyantse and Shigatse .
Half of Lhasa 's population is Han Chinese , who own most of the city 's shops and businesses .
Chinese - style development , which heavily favours urban areas over rural ones , could only exacerbate economic inequality and threaten traditions , such as nomadic lifestyles .
Not surprisingly , Deng Xiaoping 's post - Tiananmen gamble - that people intoxicated with prosperity will not demand political change - failed in Tibet .
Like predominantly rural ethnic minorities elsewhere , Tibetans lack the temperament or training needed for a fervent belief in the utopia of modernity - a consumer lifestyle in urban centres - promised by China .
Far from losing his aura during his long exile , the Dalai Lama has come to symbolise more urgently than ever to Tibetans their cherished and threatened identity .
It has also become clear to Tibetans that they pay a high price for other people 's enhanced lifestyles .
Global warming has caused the glaciers of the Tibetan plateau , which regulate the water supply to the Ganges , Indus , Brahmaputra , Mekong , Thanlwin , Yangtze and Yellow rivers , to melt at an alarming rate , threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions in Asia .
Woeser , a Tibetan poet and essayist , told me that not even the cultural revolution undermined Tibet as much as the feckless modernisation of recent years .
The rail link to Lhasa has further deepened the Tibetan sense of siege .
No Tibetan I met last year in Lhasa had any doubt that the railway was devised by and for the Han Chinese , thousands of whom had already begun to pour into the city every day , monopolising jobs and causing severe inflation .
In the past two decades , new railways have economically integrated China 's remote provinces of Qinghai and Xinjiang , making them available for large - scale resettlement by the surplus population .
China , its leaders insist , will rise " peacefully " ; and they may be right in so far as China refrains from the invasions and occupations that Japan resorted to in its attempt to modernise and catch up with western imperial powers .
But it is not hard to see that China has employed in Xinjiang and now Tibet some of the same means of internal colonialism that the US used during its own westward expansion .
Propelled by an insatiable global thirst for consumer markets and natural resources , China has done little to allay the fear that Tibetans could soon resemble the Native Americans languishing in reservations - reduced , in the words of the Tibetan novelist Jamyang Norbu , to a " sort of broken third - rate people " , who in some years from now will be reduced to " begging from tourists " .
The most surprising thing about the eruption of Tibetan rage is that it did n't occur sooner .
Televised images of Tibetans assaulting Han Chinese immigrants now stoke a middle - class nationalism in the rich cities on the Chinese coast .
Well - off Chinese supporting harsh suppression of the " ingrate " Tibetans echo the middle - class media commentators in Delhi and Mumbai who egg on the police to " crush " those daring to resist their dispossession .
But then corporate globalisation has rarely been more successful in inculcating a culture of greed and brutality among its most educated beneficiaries .
Western commentators may continue to tilt at the straw man of communism in China .
Tibetans , however , seem to have sensed that they confront a capitalist modernity more destructive of tradition , and more ruthlessly exploitative of the sacred land they walk on , than any adversary they have known in their tormented history .

When Damon 's coworker stopped by his cubicle for a chat , Damon wondered if they should have met in a dark alley somewhere .
Damon , a developer , and his coworker in quality assurance were meeting to trade bugs on the newly created Defect Black Market .
It all started a week before , when the CTO of Damon 's midsize warehousing and transportation company in Northern California announced an innovative program to motivate employees and boost the quality of their logistics software .
For every bug found by a tester and fixed by a programmer , both would get $ 10 .
Bonus Plan in Operation
The CTO hoped to improve code quality in the firm 's far - reaching overhaul of its procurement , purchasing , inventory , warehousing , distribution , transportation , customer support and financial systems .
The development team was initially skeptical , but by the end of the incentive program 's first day , both coders and testers alike were convinced .
After an average day of finding and fixing bugs , they had each earned between 30 and 40 extra dollars .
Everyone worked a bit harder the next day .
Testers made sure to check and double - check every test case they ran , while developers worked through lunch to fix their assigned bugs .
And it paid off .
On that second day each had earned an average bonus of $ 50 .
Everyone worked even harder on the third day .
On the fourth day , however , the well had started to dry up .
The testers ran , re-ran , and re-ran again the test cases , but they could only find a handful of issues .
The developers strained the issue - tracking system , constantly reloading the " unassigned bugs " page and rushing to self - assign anything that appeared .
Lunch Dates
And then something strange happened at lunch .
Instead of going out to eat with his usual teammates , one of the developers went out with a tester .
Soon after , another developer went out with another tester .
Within a few minutes , almost all of the developers had paired up with testers .
As the developers returned from lunch , they immediately got to work .
Instead of scavenging for newly found bugs , they worked on " code refactoring " and new functionality .
And as soon as they deployed their changes , testers found bugs -- minor , obscure bugs that a developer could easily overlook .
And just as quickly as testers found bugs , the developers were able to fix them and re-deploy .
By the end of the day , developers and testers had earned an average of $ 120 .
But not all developers made out so well .
Some , like Damon , did n't feel comfortable " cheating " by overlooking minute requirements .
It just did n't seem right .
Cheating Does n't Pay
By the sixth day , however , Damon had changed his mind .
Sure , it was wrong to cheat .
But it was worse that everyone else was doing it and getting away with it and bragging about it .
And this brings us back to Damon and his coworker , who had just sat down to discuss how they 'd profit on the Defect Black Market .
" So in the new communications module , " his coworker started , " if a certain developer was to , say , not fully implement the ' sender address validation ' requirement , that 'd cause at least eight test cases to fail . "
Eight test case failures meant eight bugs , which meant eighty bucks a piece .
All Damon would have to do is misplace an " And " with an " Or " in the validation logic .
" Oh and check this out , " the tester said , showing Damon the test scripts , " if , * ahem * , someone neglected to use the ' validated ' address instead of the ' original ' address , there 'd be another six failures . "
It does n't feel right , Damon thought , but for a $ 140 , I can overlook one or two simple mistakes .
Shortly thereafter , Damon found himself feverishly writing code , eager to get his changes -- along with the bug he'd write -- deployed for testing .
But when the time came to misplace that " And , " he hesitated .
Before he plunged headfirst into the Defect Black Market , he decided to take a walk around the office and evaluate if he really wanted to cheat .
" Hey Damon , " a fellow developer said as he walked past his cube , " did you hear ?
They 're stopping the accuracy bonuses !
The CTO is writing up the announcement now . "
And like that , the Defect Black Market was closed .
It lasted a grand total of five days .

Some 3200 respondents reported suffering from anxiety or depression , but those who regularly …
It ’s not uncommon to come across a patch for a software problem you ’ve never heard of or thought was possible .
In most cases they ’re caused by an unconventional use - case or a bad combination of hardware / software configurations .

( CNN ) --
The most powerful African - American in Congress again scolded former President Bill Clinton for his comments during the Democratic presidential race .
Rep. James Clyburn says ex-President Clinton 's actions have deeply upset many African - Americans .
And he said he 's concerned that the venomous nature of the campaign might create wounds that wo n't heal before the general election in November .
House Majority Whip James Clyburn , D - South Carolina , told CNN Friday that Bill Clinton 's comments on the " race card " before Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary upset him .
Clinton 's tone in a phone interview , said Clyburn , " caused people to say things to me [ about Clinton ] that I never thought I would hear . "
In that interview the former president said , among other things , that the Obama campaign " played the race card on me . "
After the phone interview but before he hung up , Clinton was recorded saying : " I do n't think I should take any s*** from anybody on that , do you ? "
In the wake of Barack Obama 's victory in the South Carolina primary , Clyburn told Clinton to " chill out " after the former president made comments that angered some blacks , including Clinton 's comparing Obama 's blowout win to the Rev. Jesse Jackson taking the state in 1988 .
" I was talking then about not angering our voters to the point where they would n't show up in November , " Clyburn said .
" So what I 'm saying now is no different than what I said back in January . "
" And I do n't think it 's all racial .
I think it has to do with the tone of this campaign and how people are reacting to the campaign . "
Watch Clyburn discuss " venomous " tone of campaign »
Clyburn said he thinks the most important person in the process is going to be the person who finishes second .
" And if that person takes a walk -- no matter who he or she may be -- we are going to have a problem in November , " he said .
" If you tell me that Obama can not win if he can't get white votes in Ohio , but Hillary can win even if she does n't get black votes in New York , I do n't think so .
I do n't think so . "
Reacting to Clyburn 's comments , Jay Carson , communications director for the William J. Clinton Foundation , said the former president " has an impeccable record on race , civil rights and issues that matter to the African - American community . "
" When he addressed the issue of race in this election recently he was simply reacting to a deeply offensive accusation that runs counter to principles he 's held and worked for his entire life , " Carson said .
But Obama said Friday he does not believe in " irreparable breaches . "
" I am a big believer in reconciliation and redemption , " the senator from Illinois said .
" This has been a fierce contest .
I am confident , come August there are going to be a whole bunch of people standing on the stage with a lot of balloons and confetti raining down on the Democratic nominee and people are going to be excited about taking on John McCain in November . "
Earlier this week , the former president vigorously defended his words in a radio interview , saying it was the Obama campaign that " played the race card on me . "
" We were talking about South Carolina political history , and this was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere , " Clinton told WHYY - FM on Monday in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
" And you know , do I regret saying it ?
No .
Do I regret that it was used that way ?
I certainly do .
But you really got to go some to try to portray me as a racist . "
Clinton later told a reporter he did n't say the Obama campaign had played the " race card . "
In January , the former president also was criticized for calling parts of Obama 's position on the war in Iraq a " fairy tale . "
The former first lady then took heat for remarks that some critics said suggested President Johnson had more to do with passage of the Civil Rights Act than did the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Clyburn said he 's already noticing diminishing enthusiasm among younger voters , citing a difference in a visit to a college campus in January and a recent one .
" We have young people -- African - Americans that are as enthusiastic about this party as they 've been in the last 40 years , and we cannot tamp down that enthusiasm or we will not be successful in November if we do , " he said .
Both Obama and Clinton heavily courted Clyburn ahead of his state 's primary , but the congressman has remained neutral .

SHANGHAI — For over three decades the Chinese government dismissed warnings from scientists and environmentalists that its Three Gorges Dam — the world 's largest — had the potential of becoming one of China 's biggest environmental nightmares .
But last fall , denial suddenly gave way to reluctant acceptance that the naysayers were right .
Chinese officials staged a sudden about - face , acknowledging for the first time that the massive hydroelectric dam , sandwiched between breathtaking cliffs on the Yangtze River in central China , may be triggering landslides , altering entire ecosystems and causing other serious environmental problems — and , by extension , endangering the millions who live in its shadow .
Government officials have long defended the $ 24 - billion project as a major source of renewable power for an energy - hungry nation and as a way to prevent floods downstream .
When complete , the dam will generate 18,000 megawatts of power — eight times that of the U.S. 's Hoover Dam on the Colorado River .
But in September , the government official in charge of the project admitted that Three Gorges held " hidden dangers " that could breed disaster .
" We can't lower our guard , " Wang Xiaofeng , who oversees the project for China 's State Council , said during a meeting of Chinese scientists and government reps in Chongqing , an independent municipality of around 31 million abutting the dam .
" We simply cannot sacrifice the environment in exchange for temporary economic gain . "
The comments appeared to confirm what geologists , biologists and environmentalists had been warning about for years : building a massive hydropower dam in an area that is heavily populated , home to threatened animal and plant species , and crossed by geologic fault lines is a recipe for disaster .
Among the damage wrought : " There 's been a lot less rain , a lot more drought , and the potential for increased disease , " says George Davis , a tropical medicine specialist at The George Washington University ( G.W. ) Medical Center in Washington , D.C. , who has worked in the Yangtze River Basin and neighboring provinces for 24 years .
" When it comes to environmental change , the implementation of the Three Gorges dam and reservoir is the great granddaddy of all changes . "
Dam Quake
When plans for the dam were first approved in 1992 , human rights activists voiced concern about the people who would be forced to relocate to make room for it .
Inhabited for several millennia , the Three Gorges region is now a major part of western China 's development boom .
To date , the government has ordered some 1.2 million people in two cities and 116 towns clustered on the banks of the Yangtze to be evacuated to other areas before construction , promising them plots of land and small stipends — in some cases as little as 50 yuan , or $ 7 a month — as compensation .
Chinese and foreign scientists , meanwhile , warned that the dam could endanger the area 's remaining residents .
Among their concerns : landslides caused by increased pressure on the surrounding land , a rise in waterborne disease , and a decline in biodiversity .
But their words fell on deaf ears .
Harnessing the power of the Yangtze has been a goal since Nationalist leader Sun Yat - sen first proposed the idea in 1919 .
Mao Zedong , the father of China 's communist revolution , rhapsodized the dam in a poem .
The mega- project could not be realized in his lifetime , however , because the country 's resources were exhausted by the economic failures of the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and then the social upheaval of the Cultural Revolution from the mid-1960s a to the early 1970s .
Four decades later , the government resuscitated Mao 's plans .
The first of the Yangtze 's famed gorges — a collection of steep bluffs at a bend in the river — was determined to be the perfect site .
In June 2003 , nine years after construction began , the state - owned China Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corporation ( CTGPC ) filled the reservoir with 445 feet ( 135 meters ) of water , the first of three increments in achieving the eventual depth of 575 feet ( 175 meters ) .
The result is a narrow lake 410 miles ( 660 kilometers ) long — 60 miles ( 97 kilometers ) longer than Lake Superior — and 3,600 feet ( 1,100 meters ) wide , twice the width of the natural river channel .
Scientists ' early warnings came true just a month later , when around 700 million cubic feet ( 20 million cubic meters ) of rock slid into the Qinggan River , just two miles ( three kilometers ) from where it flows into the Yangtze , spawning 65 - foot ( 20 - meter ) waves that claimed the lives of 14 people .
Despite the devastating results , the corporation three years later ( in September 2006 ) raised the water level further — to 512 feet ( 156 meters ) .
Since then , the area has experienced a series of problems , including dozens of landslides along one 20 - mile ( 32 - kilometer ) stretch of riverbank .
This past November , the ground gave out near the entrance to a railway tunnel in Badong County , near a tributary to the Three Gorges reservoir ; 4,000 cubic yards ( 3,050 cubic meters ) of earth and rock tumbled onto a highway .
The landslide buried a bus , killing at least 30 people .
Fan Xiao , a geologist at the Bureau of Geological Exploration and Exploitation of Mineral Resources in Sichuan province , near several Yangtze tributaries , says the landslides are directly linked to filling the reservoir .
Water first seeps into the loose soil at the base of the area 's rocky cliffs , destabilizing the land and making it prone to slides .
Then the reservoir water level fluctuates — engineers partially drain the reservoir in summer to accommodate flood waters and raise it again at the end of flood season to generate power — and the abrupt change in water pressure further disturbs the land .
In a study published in the Chinese journal Tropical Geography in 2003 , scholars at Guangzhou ’s South China Normal University predicted that such tinkering with the water level could trigger activity in 283 landslide - prone areas .
That is apparently what happened to the 99 villagers of Miaohe , 10 miles ( 17 kilometers ) upstream of the Yangtze , who saw the land behind their homes split into a 655 - foot - ( 200 - meter - ) wide crack last year , soon after the reservoir water level was lowered for the summer floods .
Officials evacuated them to a mountain tunnel where they camped for three months .
One of the greatest fears is that the dam may trigger severe earthquakes , because the reservoir sits on two major faults : the Jiuwanxi and the Zigui–Badong .
According to Fan , changing the water level strains them .
" When you alter the fault line 's mechanical state , " he says , " it can cause fault activity to intensify and induce earthquakes . "
Many scientists believe this link between temblors and dams — called reservoir - induced seismicity — may have been what happened at California 's Oroville Dam , in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada .
The largest earthen dam in the U.S. , it was constructed on an active fault line in the 1950s and filled in 1968 .
Seven years later , when the reservoir 's water supply was restored to full capacity — after engineers lowered it 130 feet ( 40 meters ) for maintenance — the area experienced an unusual series of earthquakes .
U.S. Geological Survey seismologists subsequently found a strong link between the quakes and the refilling of the reservoir .
The Oroville area was sparsely populated , so little damage was done .
But earthquakes have also been connected to past hydropower projects in China , where dams are often located in densely populated and seismically active river basins .
Engineers in China blame dams for at least 19 earthquakes over the past five decades , ranging from small tremors to one near Guangdong province 's Xinfengjiang Dam in 1962 that registered magnitude 6.1 on the Richter scale — severe enough to topple houses .
Surveys show that the Three Gorges region may be next .
Chinese Academy of Engineering scholar Li Wangping reports on the CTGPC's Web site that the area registered 822 tremors in the seven months after the September 2006 reservoir - level increase .
So far , none have been severe enough to cause serious damage .
But by 2009 , the dam's water level is set to be raised to its full 575 - foot capacity and then lowered about 100 feet ( 30 meters ) during flood season .
That increase in water pressure , in water fluctuation and in land covered by the reservoir , Fan says , makes for a " very large possibility " that the situation will worsen .
Local news media report that whole villages of people relocated to make room for the dam will have to move a second time because of the landslides and tremors , indicating that officials failed to foresee the full magnitude of the dam 's effects .
Guangzhou's Southern Weekend late last year reported that villagers in Kaixian County were eager to move again , citing landslides , mudslides and ominous cracks that had appeared in the ground behind their homes .
They also hoped that moving might resolve land allocation issues :
Some said they received only half of the acreage they had been promised .
Water Displacement
The dam is also taking a toll on China 's animals and plants .
The nation — which sprawls 3.7 million square miles ( 9.6 million square kilometers ) — is home to 10 percent of the world 's vascular plants ( those with stems , roots and leaves ) and biologists estimate that half of China 's animal and plant species , including the beloved giant panda and the Chinese sturgeon , are found no where else in the world .
The Three Gorges area alone accounts for 20 percent of Chinese seed plants — more than 6,000 species .
Shennongjia , a nature reserve near the dam in Hubei province , is so undisturbed that it is famous for sightings of yeren , or " wild man " — the Chinese equivalent of " Big Foot " — as well as the only slightly more prosaic white monkey .
That biodiversity is threatened as the dam floods some habitats , reduces water flow to others , and alters weather patterns .
Economic development has spurred deforestation and pollution in surrounding provinces in central China , endangering at least 57 plant species , including the Chinese dove tree and the dawn redwood .
The reservoir created by Three Gorges dam threatens to flood the habitats of those species along with over 400 others , says Jianguo Liu , an ecologist at Michigan State University and guest professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who has done extensive work on biodiversity in China .
The dam further imperils delicate fish populations in the Yangtze .
Downstream , near where the river empties into the East China Sea , the land around the Yangtze contains some of the densest clusters of human habitation in the world , and overfishing there has already endangered 25 of the river 's 177 unique fish species .
According to a 2003 letter to Science by Wuhan University ecologist Ping Xie , many of these fish evolved over time with the Yangtze flood plain .
As the dam decreases flooding downstream , it will fragment the network of lakes around the middle as well as lower the Yangtze 's water level , making it difficult for the fish to survive .
The project has already contributed to the decline of the baiji dolphin , which is so rare that it is considered functionally extinct .
The reservoir could also break up land bridges into small islands , isolating clusters of animals and plants .
In 1986 , Venezuela 's Raúl Leoni Dam flooded 1,660 square miles ( 4,300 square kilometers ) of land , creating the vast Lake Guri , along with a scattering of nonsubmerged land .
The nascent islands lost 75 percent of their biological species within 15 years , according to research published in Science .
To determine the true toll , the Three Gorges Dam is taking on animal and plant species , Liu says , long - term data is needed , so that decreases in population totals can be compared with natural species fluctuation .
But he cautions that many of the dam 's effects may not be immediately apparent .
The project is altering reproduction patterns , meaning it may already be too late for some plants and animals .
" In the short term , you see the species still there , but in the long term you could see [ them ] disappear , " Liu says .
It is here that State Council representative Wang 's allusion to " hidden dangers " rings especially true .
Disease and Drought
When officials unveiled plans for the dam , they touted its ability to prevent floods downstream .
Now , the dam seems to be causing the opposite problem , spurring drought in central and eastern China .
In January , the China Daily ( the country 's largest English - language newspaper ) reported that the Yangtze had reached its lowest level in 142 years — stranding dozens of ships along the waterway in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces .
An unnamed official with the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission blamed climate change , even as he acknowledged that the dam had reduced the flow volume of the river by 50 percent .
To make matters worse , China is now plowing ahead with a controversial $ 62 - billion scheme to transfer water from the Yangtze to northern China , which is even more parched , through a network of tunnels and canals to be completed by 2050 .
Meanwhile , at the mouth of the Yangtze residents of Shanghai , China 's largest city , are experiencing water shortages .
The decreased flow of fresh water also means that saltwater from the East China Sea now creeps farther upstream .
This , in turn , seems to be causing a rise in the number of jellyfish , which compete with river fish for food and consume their eggs and larvae , thereby threatening native populations that are already dwindling as a result of overfishing .
In 2004 , a year after the dam was partially filled , scientists noted a jellyfish species in the Yangtze that had previously only reached the South China Sea .
The effects of the dam 's disturbance of whole ecosystems could reverberate for decades .
G.W.'s Davis is part of a project researching the disease schistosomiasis ( a.k.a. snail fever or swimmer 's itch ) , a blood parasite transmitted to humans by snails ; people can get it by swimming or wading in contaminated fresh water when infected snails release larvae that can penetrate the skin .
( Symptoms include fever , appetite and weight loss , abdominal pain , bloody urine , muscle and joint pain , along with nausea , a persistent cough and diarrhea . )
The snails used to breed on small flood plain islands where annual flooding prevented a population explosion .
Now , the decreased flow downstream from the dam is allowing the snails to breed unchecked , which has already led to a spike in schistosomiasis cases in some areas .
According to Davis , such alterations could precipitate a rise in other microbial waterborne diseases as well .
" Once you dramatically change the climate and change water patterns , as is now seen in the Three Gorges region , " he says , " you change a lot of environmental variables .
Almost all infectious diseases are up for grabs . "
The official recognition of the dam's dangers suggests that the project 's environmental and public health impacts are starting to sink in .
Political analysts speculate that President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao are eager to distance themselves from a project they inherited .
Although halting plans at this point would be an admission of government error , the openness following the Chongqing meeting raised the hopes of worried scientists that officials would take action to minimize the project 's environmental and public health fallout .
Government - funded institutions have been quietly assessing possible recourses .
Officials say they 've spent more than $ 1.6 billion on fortifying landslide - prone areas and will spend an additional $ 3.2 billion on water cleanup over the next three years .
In January the CTGPC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Nature Conservancy allowing that organization to consult on species protection and river health in the dam area .
China 's Ministry of Health , meanwhile , is trying to control schistosomiasis infections with a combination of drugs and applications of molluscicides , pesticides that wipe out the disease 's snail carriers .
But these measures may not be sufficient to avert disaster .
In February China 's State Environmental Protection Administration said reservoir water quality targets had not been reached despite a cleanup effort that had been underway since 2001 .
And fighting schistosomiasis requires a more holistic , multi-pronged approach — particularly now that ecosystems in the Three Gorges region have been altered .
To ward off an outbreak , Davis says , the government would have to prevent the use of night soil as fertilizer , build cement irrigation ditches , and ensure area villagers access to clean water .
So far , that has n't happened .
Government Oversight
In the wake of media reports about the government 's concerns , officials began to backpedal .
In a November 2007 interview with state news agency Xinhua , State Council 's Wang claimed that " no major geological disasters or related casualties " had occurred since the reservoir 's water level was raised in 2006 ; five days later , the earth in Badong crumbled and the railroad tunnel landslide wiped out the bus and its passengers .
Following a brief period of openness , discussion of the dam 's environmental effects has once again become largely taboo in China .
Government officials fear that continued free discussion of the project 's ramifications could lead to civil unrest .
One internationally published Chinese scientist working in the Yangtze Basin declined to comment publicly , noting , " This is a very sensitive topic … .
I ca n't give hypotheses . "
Despite the Three Gorges dam 's growing list of problems , however , hydropower remains an integral — and ostensibly green — component of China 's energy mix .
China still draws 82 percent of energy from coal , but large dams are crucial to the country 's climate change program , which aims to increase its proportion of electricity from renewable resources from the current 7.2 percent to 15 percent by 2020 .
Over one third of that will come from hydropower — more than from any other source .
Twelve new dams are planned for the upper Yangtze alone .
The logistical and environmental hurdles involved in executing these dams underscore China 's commitment to hydropower .
The Yangtze 's newest dams include several smaller projects that are necessary to alleviate sedimentation caused by the Three Gorges reservoir .
In his 2007 report to the National People 's Congress , Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said that China had relocated 22.9 million people to make room for its large hydroprojects .
China 's original goal was to fill the reservoir to its maximum level by 2013 .
Despite all the trouble , that target was moved up to 2009 , Fan says , to boost hydropower output by an additional 2.65 billion kilowatt - hours each year .
" For the economic interests and profit of the Three Gorges Project Development Corporation , " he says , " that 's very important .
But the function of any river , including the Yangtze , is not only to produce power .
At the very least , [ a river ] is also important for shipping , alleviating pollution , sustaining species and ecosystems , and maintaining a natural evolutionary balance . "
" The Yangtze does n't belong to the Three Gorges Project Development Corporation , " Fan adds .
" It belongs to all of society . "

( CNN ) -- Former President Clinton said that Democrats were more likely to lose in November if Sen.
Hillary Clinton is not the nominee and suggested that some were trying to " push and pressure and bully " superdelegates to make up their minds prematurely .
" I can't believe it .
It is just frantic the way they are trying to push and pressure and bully all these superdelegates to come out , " Clinton said at a South Dakota campaign stop Sunday , in remarks first reported by ABC News .
Clinton also suggested that some were trying to " cover up " Hillary Clinton 's chances of winning in key states that Democrats will have to win in the general election .
" ' Oh , this is so terrible :
The people they want her .
Oh , this is so terrible :
She is winning the general election , and he is not .
Oh , my goodness , we have to cover this up . ' "
Clinton did not expound on who he was accusing .
Watch Clinton talk about the " coverup " »
The former president added that his wife had not been given the respect she deserved as a legitimate presidential candidate .
" She is winning the general election today , and he is not , according to all the evidence , " Clinton said .
" And I have never seen anything like it .
I have never seen a candidate treated so disrespectfully just for running .
" Her only position was , ' Look , if I lose , I 'll be a good team player .
We will all try to win , but let 's let everybody vote and count every vote , ' " he said .
The former president suggested that if the New York senator ended the primary season with an edge in the popular vote , it would be a significant development .
" If you vote for her and she does well in Montana and she does well in Puerto Rico , when this is over , she will be ahead in the popular vote , " Clinton said .
" And they 're trying to get her to cry uncle before the Democratic Party has to decide what to do in Florida and Michigan , " which Clinton said the party would need to do " unless we want to lose the election . "
The current requirement to claim the Democratic presidential nomination is 2,026 delegates , a formula that does not take into account delegates from Florida and Michigan , whose contests were not sanctioned by the party because they moved them up on the primary calendar .
But if those votes were counted as cast , Hillary Clinton would still trail rival Barack Obama in the overall delegate count .
The former president said Sunday that the media had unfairly attacked his wife since the Iowa caucuses , repeating an often - used charge that press coverage had made him feel as though he were living in a " fun house . "
" If you notice , there has n't been a lot of publicity on these polls I just told you about , " he said .
" It is the first time you 've heard it ?
Why do you think that is ?
Why do you think ?
Do n't you think if the polls were the reverse and he was winning the Electoral College against Sen.
McCain and Hillary was losing it , it would be blasted on every television station ? "
He added , " You would know it , would n't you ?
It would n't be a little secret .
And there is another Electoral College poll that I saw yesterday had her over 300 electoral votes .
...
She will win the general election if you nominate her .
They 're just trying to make sure you do n't . "

Small groups of Indonesian Muslims voiced their anger over the film
Indonesia has banned a controversial film made by a Dutch MP which accuses Islam of inspiring violence .
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Geert Wilders , leader of the Dutch right - wing Freedom Party ( PVV ) , would be barred from the archipelago .
The 17 - minute film Fitna , which means strife in Arabic , shows terrorist attacks and links them to the Koran .
Small groups of activists gathered outside the Netherlands embassy in Jakarta to protest against the film .
Mr Yudhoyono said world leaders had a moral responsibility to prevent the making of such films .
But he urged protesters not to use violence to make their point .
Earlier , Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen called for calm in the Muslim world , saying that hurt feelings need not lead to violence .
The film shows graphic images of terrorist attacks , including the destruction of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and the London and Madrid train bombings , interspersed with verses from the Koran .
The film ends with someone turning pages of a Koran , followed by a tearing sound .
It concludes : " Stop Islamisation .
Defend our freedom . "
Fitna has been condemned by the Dutch government , and Dutch broadcasters have avoided showing it .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called it " offensively anti-Islamic " .
Mr Wilders has received death threats and is under constant police protection .
Turkish forces push deeper into Kurdish northern Iraq
By James Cogan
25 February 2008
In defiance of demands by the Iraqi government and the Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) that Turkey end its invasion , Ankara is continuing to deploy men and equipment into Kurdish northern Iraq .
Turkish troops have pushed at least 30 kilometres inside Iraqi territory since the invasion was launched on Thursday night on the pretext of destroying the mountain bases of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) .
Hundreds of special forces commandos are said to be operating in the remote north - eastern Qandil mountains , where Iraq ’s border intersects with both Turkey and Iran .
Since mid-December , Turkey has conducted repeated air strikes on the area , bombing villages and vantage points where it claimed there was a PKK presence .
The Iraqi Kurdish mayor of Deralouk told the Washington Post that more than 100 mountain villages had been abandoned because of the air war .
The United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , estimates that 1,255 people were displaced by Turkish bombing .
Turkish troops have reportedly crossed the border in the Zap region , on the western edges of the mountains , and engaged in bloody clashes with PKK fighters .
Turkish air strikes and helicopter gunship assaults were carried out on Saturday near the town of Amadiyah .
One Turkish helicopter was shot down .
The exact number of Turkish forces involved is the subject of conflicting reports .
The Iraqi government in Baghdad has downplayed the incursion , claiming it is “ very , very limited ” and involves no more than 1,000 troops .
The PKK - linked Firat newsagency , however , said on Sunday that 5,000 troops and at least 60 tanks were now converging on the town of Haftanin .
A large concentration of Turkish troops was also seen moving from the Turkish town of Cizre eastward toward Iraq .
In all , the Turkish military is believed to have well over 50,000 troops mobilised on the Iraqi border .
The Turkish press claimed Friday that the invasion involved 10,000 .
Reuters , citing a Turkish military source , reported that 8,000 troops have entered Iraq .
Available information suggests that the Turkish military is planning to permanently occupy the Qandil mountain region .
Turkish warplanes have destroyed five bridges spanning a major river over the weekend , effectively cutting the mountains off from the rest of Iraq and depriving thousands of villagers of the ability to return to their homes .
Turkish commanders are claiming that their forces have already killed 112 Kurdish guerillas , at the cost of 15 of their own troops .
While the destruction of bridges cuts off obvious escape routes , the Turkish military reported on Sunday that the PKK “ are trying to flee southwards in panic ” .
The Turkish government has issued assurances that the invasion has the limited aim of destroying the PKK and that it “ attaches importance to Iraq ’s territorial integrity and strongly defends its territorial integrity and political unity ” .
Unconfirmed statements attributed to Turkish commanders in the Turkish media have suggested that the invasion force will be withdrawn after 15 days .
No credence can be given to such claims .
While the Turkish military will certainly use the opportunity to kill as many PKK fighters as possible , the clear objective of the invasion is to thwart the ambitions of the Kurdish Regional Government for greater economic and political independence from Iraq .
For the Turkish ruling class , the existence of an autonomous Kurdish state on its southern border is already considered a tremendous danger .
Throughout its modern existence , the Turkish bourgeois state has suppressed separatist demands from among its large Kurdish minority .
Under certain conditions , an economically vibrant Iraqi KRG has the potential to function as the base for a movement throughout the Kurdish - populated regions of Iraq , Turkey , Syria and Iran for the breakup of those states and the establishment of a greater “ Kurdistan ” .
Turkish concerns have been steadily rising over the past year as the KRG has agitated internationally for major investment in oil and other economic projects within its territory .
The fears will have been dramatically heightened by the declaration of independence by Kosovo and the decision of the United States and other powers to recognise it .
It is by no means accidental that the invasion was launched just days after the Kosovo declaration and the KRG ’s announcement of an agreement with South Korea ’s National Oil Corporation to develop oil fields in northern Iraq and a $ US10.5 billion contract with Korean Ssangyong Engineering and Construction for the rapid modernisation of the region ’s infrastructure .
Thousands of South Korean troops are still based around the Kurdish capital of Irbil .
Turkey faces the possibility of major international players backing a declaration of independence by the KRG , using Kosovo as a precedent .
The invasion is also a response to renewed demands by Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani for a referendum in the oil - rich Iraqi province of Kirkuk , over whether the majority Kurdish population wants to join the KRG .
On February 18 , Barzani , the president of the KRG , met with representatives of the United Nations and the European Union to seek their assistance in holding the referendum within six months .
The incorporation of Kirkuk into the Kurdish region would give it control over between 30 and 40 percent of Iraq ’s oil fields , including what many experts believe are large untapped reserves .
Turkey has repeatedly opposed Kurdish control of Kirkuk on the pretext that it could lead to human rights abuses of the large Turkish - speaking Turkomen minority in the province .
It is too early to determine what the impact of the Turkish invasion will be on the flow of investment into Kurdistan and the status of Kirkuk .
It will further aggravate ethnic tensions in the city , however , between Kurds and Turkomens .
Any move by the KRG to hold a ballot is likely to be met with violent provocations intended to exacerbate the divisions and justify a Turkish intervention .
Turkey ’s actions have been supported by the Bush administration and the US military is supplying intelligence on PKK locations and movements .
Turkey is considered a crucial ally in the Middle East , particularly in the event of an American military confrontation with Iran and the long - term US geopolitical struggle with Russia and other powers for domination over the resources of the Central Asian republics .
In the final analysis , the ambitions of its erstwhile Kurdish collaborators in Iraq are expendable .
There is clear nervousness in Washington , however , over the implications of the invasion and the potential for the outbreak of open fighting between the Turkish forces and the KRG .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates told journalists on Saturday that his view on the Turkish operation was “ the shorter , the better ” .
On Sunday , the Turkish government declared that “ local Iraqi groups are expected to prevent members of the terrorist group [ the PKK ] ... from entering their region and being given protection there ” .
If they use allegations that the KRG is providing protection to PKK fighters to justify moving deeper into the Kurdish region , they will be resisted by the 80,000 - strong pesh merga militia .
The Kurdish leadership is well aware that the operation has wider motives than just dealing with the PKK .
Barzani declared on Saturday : “ We doubt the true intentions behind the Turkish attacks and we believe that their target is the Region of Kurdistan and not the PKK .
Otherwise what is the reason behind destroying vital bridges used by the citizens in their daily lives , well inside the populated areas ?
What has this to do with the PKK ? ”
As the situation stands , Turkish forces are consolidating positions that place them within a short distance of key Kurdish centres such as Dohuk and the capital Irbil .
If they do not withdraw clashes are likely .
Iraqi foreign minister Hoshyar Zebani told the BBC on Sunday that the invasion “ could destabilise the region because really one mistake could lead to further escalation ” .
The chaos and instability created by the US invasion is now engulfing the only part of Iraq that has been somewhat spared the destruction inflicted on the rest of the country .
For the US occupation , the consequences will be considerable .
In particular , the US backing for Turkey is shattering whatever support existed among Iraqi Kurds for the American presence in the country .
Serhat Erkmen , a Middle East expert with the Eurasian Strategic Research Centre , told the Turkish paper Zaman : “ Kurds will start thinking , ‘ whenever we act in cooperation , the United States dumps us . ’ ”

For the new job seeker or prospective career - changer , the idea of getting hired in a new field can be daunting .
You ’re looking for a job listing like this :
“ Exciting company seeks enthusiastic entry - level employee .
Competitive salary , great benefits , will train . ”
… but what you ’ll find is probably more like this :
“ Established company has an opening in the ABC department .
Prefer 1 - 2 years of experience , must have references . ”
Maybe you skipped the college internship thing , maybe you never found an opportunity that worked for you , or maybe you ’re just having a mid-life career crisis and you want something new .
Regardless of the reasoning , you find yourself without relevant experience and without the ability to get it – or so you think .
Luckily , the information age has rendered the “ no experience ” excuse almost completely irrelevant .
Consider these unconventional ways to get experience in a variety of fields .
Even if your dream career is n’t covered here , this should be enough to get your brain moving in the right direction .
Non-Profit Work :
Use sites like VolunteerMatch.com and Idealist.org to locate relevant opportunities .
Many of the postings you ’ll see are “ virtual jobs ” , meaning they do n’t require you to live in any specific location .
Because volunteer work does n’t pay , the expectations ( in terms of both time and experience levels ) are generally lower than for a similar paid position .
Relevant Fields : Almost any .
You could find yourself doing a copywriting project for a charity halfway across the country , shuttling cancer patients to and from medical appointments ( psychology , anyone ? ) , or soliciting donations for a local non-profit event .

Square custom shade sails :
This square shade sail has several jobs to do .
The first one , of course , is to shade the deck which has a southern exposure and was hot and unusable most of the summer - umbrellas blew away and an awning would not fit .
Secondly , this home looks over the ocean and the home owners wanted to enjoy the view and cool ocean breezes .
Lastly , they did not want to draw their curtians during the heat of the day ( bye bye view ) so the home needed sun protection as well to save on air conditioning and not obstruct the view .
Here we usedawning grade sunbrella fabric installed on a sharp angle to protect the house and deck .
Rectangular shade sails add style and sun protection :
This stunning shade sail application provides shade in an area where nothing else could - unless you waited for the trees to grow , An umbrella would be inadequate and an awing much too big to be functional .

PRECIOUS METALS �
For years now , I have presented a bullish case for all precious metals ( especially gold and silver ) .
And the recent spikes in these metals prove that my assessment has been correct .
It is my firm belief that we are living in a highly inflationary world where all the central banks are recklessly inflating the supply of money and credit .
Without the presence of anything tangible backing the various currencies , there is no limit to the amount of �money � that can be created by simply making credit entries in bank accounts on computer screens .
So , on one hand where you and I have to work very hard for our money , certain individuals in positions of power are able to manufacture the same money out of thin air , thereby diluting our purchasing power .
Let there be no mistake , monetary inflation via debasement of currencies is pure robbery as it diminishes the standard of living for most people .
In fact , I would argue that monetary inflation and credit growth are the reasons why , despite economic progress , most people today work much longer hours and most households rely on dual - incomes .
For sure , monetary inflation gives the illusion of wealth and it sure �feels � good to have more numbers in your bank account but is it really wealth ?
Again , I could easily make the case that access to more money due to debasement is not real wealth since everyone else is also becoming �wealthier� at the same time .
If you are still not convinced , I suggest you visit Zimbabwe and ask the locals how rich and fortunate they are feeling as a result of Mr. Mugabe�s hyper- inflationary policies !
Without a doubt , they all have access to a ridiculous amount of Zimbabwean Dollars but the problem is that this �money � is not worth much .
A few months ago , in a moment of true national pride , Zimbabwe issued a new bank - note worth 200,000 Zimbabwean Dollars but it only buys one kilo of sugar !
Despite the money - printing efforts of Mr. Mugabe , the Zimbabwean economy is a total disaster with widespread poverty , social unrest and sky - high unemployment .
So you can clearly see how monetary inflation never works in the long - term and ultimately destroys the purchasing power of money together with the lives of the unsuspecting public .
The reason I have mentioned the above is because I am concerned that the Federal Reserve is also going down the same path .
Although , the official inflation rate in the US is nowhere near Zimbabwe �s levels , the easy monetary policies of Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke are really starting to take a toll on the US currency .
Since 2002 , the US Dollar has lost over 50 % of its purchasing power against European currencies and even more so against the commodity - producing nations .
Unsurprisingly however , the world�s reserve currency has lost the most against real money which cannot be created without hard - work and sweat � gold and silver .
Now , most people would glee with the fact that both gold and silver have risen by roughly 400 % since the start of the precious metals bull - market .
However , my take on the situation is that gold and silver have not changed at all ( an ounce is still an ounce ) ; but the reality is that the US Dollar itself has lost a considerable amount of purchasing power over the same period .
Now , given what we have witnessed in Washington in the past few months , I have no doubt in my mind that the US establishment does not care about the health of its currency .
And it looks increasingly likely that if required , Mr. Bernanke will send out personal cheques of US $ 100,000 to every American household in order to revive the economy .
Now , this sort of action may jazz up the official economic data but I can assure you that it will be a national disaster for the average American .
Ultimately , the US currency will plummet and Americans will be faced with sky - high consumer prices and inflation .
In the current environment , I have no hesitation in recommending precious metals as a long - term store of value .
A few weeks ago in the Weekly Update sent out to subscribers of Money Matters , I advised taking profits in this sector and hope that my readers did .
In the weeks ahead , I anticipate the correction to continue ( Figure 1 ) and suggest that investors start buying precious metals in the summer months .
Figure 1 : Silver in correction mode !

As a parting shot , I would like to add that Mr. Bernanke is the perfect gift for precious metals investors and as long as he has control of the monetary levers , gold and silver have a bright future .

Demanding further intervention from the Federal Reserve to protect their endangered fortunes , thousands of the nation ’s leading hedge - fund managers marched on Washington today .
Dubbed “ The Million Mercedes March , ” the protest was said to be the largest chauffeur - driven demonstration in the capital ’s history .
Limousines started jamming the streets of Washington at approximately 10 in the morning as irate hedge - fund owners converged in front of the Federal Reserve building to demand stronger action to protect their imperiled riches .
Chanting “ No Rate Cut , No Peace , ” the furious money managers were pepper - sprayed by police as their protest threatened to take a violent turn .
Tracy Klujian , a hedge - fund manager from Greenwich , Conn. , said that simmering anger in the hedge - fund community was “ a powder keg ” waiting to explode .
“ We have yet to see the ripple effects of this crisis , ” Klujian said .
“ When these guys have to freeze their trophy wives ’ shopping allowances , there ’s going to be hell to pay . ”
Klujian ’s words seemed almost prophetic as a mob of angry trophy wives looted a Ralph Lauren boutique in East Hampton , N.Y. , later in the day , stripping the establishment of its entire fall collection .
If the Fed fails to intervene , Klujian warned , an ugly situation among the nation ’s wealthiest money managers will only get uglier .

SYDNEY , Nov. 24 — Prime Minister John Howard of Australia suffered a comprehensive defeat today , with a coalition led by his Liberal Party losing its majority in parliament .
After four terms in office , he will be replaced by Kevin Rudd , a Labor Party leader and former diplomat .
Mr. Rudd , 50 , campaigned on a platform of new leadership looking for new answers for new challenges .
He has said his first acts as prime minister will include pushing for the ratification of the Kyoto climate agreement and to negotiate the withdrawal of Australian combat troops from Iraq .
The attempts by Mr. Howard ’s coalition to stress their economic record failed to impress voters .
The Australian economy has had 17 years of continuous growth , in latter years driven by Chinese demand for Australian iron ore and coal , and he had warned voters that a Labor victory would endanger the country ’s future prosperity .
But despite the coalition campaign , there was little distance between the two parties on economic policy , and the defining characteristics came down to the personalities of the leaders and Labor ’s promise to readdress broad concerns about the environment , health and education .
Mr. Howard , 68 , was running for a record fifth term in office , but many voters said they were ready for a change .
There are myriad other survivor benefits , too , many determined by specific circumstances .
Joyce Wessel Raezer , chief operating officer of the National Military Family Association , said that a hypothetical widow of an Army corporal based at Fort Drum , in upstate New York , with three years of service and two young children would likely receive payments totaling $ 5,335 a month for the first year .
In addition , a spouse would get free medical care for three years  the children into adulthood  and all would receive education assistance .
Through private companies , the Department of Veterans Affairs provides insurance beneficiaries the service of a professional financial planner for a year , but a spokesman said that only one in 10 families uses it .
Bill Saunders , director of client services for the Armed Forces Services Corporation , a private firm based in Arlington , Va. , that offers military families advice on such issues , said that survivors are often overwhelmed by grief when they learn of the availability of financial advice , and that the military would do well to remind them after a few months .
“ The money all shows up in their accounts within days or weeks , where there might have been $ 500 in there  ever , ” Mr. Saunders said , referring to the lump sum of $ 500,000 .
“ Many of these surviving spouses are young , which means they ’ve never done any kind of money management or investing .
So it ’s completely foreign to them .
It ’s like saying , ‘ Hey , would you like me to teach you Russian tomorrow ?
Come down to my office . ’
And they do n’t show . ”
Ms .
Avery , the widow who bought furniture and a purse  but not the BMW she coveted  credited her financial adviser with pushing long - term investment , but said she knows some widows who are now destitute .
“ I do know that there have been widows who used all the money by paying cash for a house and paying cash for a car , ” she said .
“ If they pay cash for a McMansion , they may not think about all the incidentals like heat and water and phone and cable and taxes and furniture . ”

One widowed acquaintance , whom Ms. Avery declined to identify to protect her privacy , ended up applying to the Army for an emergency relief loan after blowing through the $ 500,000 .
“ You have to have nothing  like the electricity has to be getting turned off ” to qualify for such a loan , Ms. Avery said .
“ In grief , you ’re in such a state of shock that you do n’t take into account that you wo n’t have your husband ’s salary in six months . ”

Now it 's gone .
And look at this radio , each tube neatly sliced in half .
Blow the place up !
That was my advice .
But after the storm and the earthquake , after the tactic of the exploding plane and the strategy of the sinking boat , it looked like fate and I wanted to say , " Do n't you see ?
So what if you 're a famous biochemist !
Lost with all hands is an old story . "
Sure , we 're on the edge of an important breakthrough , everyone hearing voices , everyone falling into caves , and you 're out wandering through the jungle in the middle of the night in your negligée .
Yes , we 're way out there on the edge of science , while the rest of the island continues to disappear until nothing 's left except this cliff in the middle of the ocean , and you , in your bathing suit , crouched behind the scuba tanks .
I 'd like to tell you not to be afraid , but I 've lost my voice .
I 'm not used to all these legs , these claws , these feelers .
It 's the old story , predictable as fallout --- the re-arrangement of molecules .
And everyone is surprised and no one understands why each man tries to kill the thing he loves , when the change comes over him .
So now you know what I never found the time to say .
Sweetheart , put down your flamethrower .
You know I always loved you .

Reports say the ship is carrying millions of rounds of ammunition A Chinese ship carrying arms destined for Zimbabwe has been forced to leave the South African port of Durban four days after failing to unload .
Earlier , a South African judge ruled that the cargo of rocket - propelled grenades , mortar rounds and ammunition could not be transported overland .
Human rights groups had petitioned for a block on the arms and dockers had refused to unload the shipment .
Some fear Zimbabwe will use the arms to repress political opposition .
The country has yet to publish the results of its presidential election on 29 March , which the MDC opposition says was won outright by its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai .
President Robert Mugabe denounced the opposition on Friday in his first speech since the election , saying " thieves " were trying to steal the country .
Incommunicado According to the South African news agency Sapa , the ship upped anchor between 1800 ( 1600 GMT ) and 1900 ( 1700 GMT ) .
The ship 's master , who earlier identified himself as Captain Sunaijun , could not be reached by telephone , the agency added , quoting anonymous sources .
The transponder aboard the An Yue Jiang was not responding on Friday evening , the BBC's Adam Mynott reports from Durban .
The head of an independent human rights group monitoring the vessel said it was heading for Mozambique , en route to landlocked Zimbabwe .
Nicole Fritz , director of the Southern Africa Litigation Center , said her group aimed to pursue the issue with Mozambique .
Her group had called for the blocking of a permit allowing the arms to be offloaded from the An Yue Jiang and transported .
South Africa 's government had said it could not legally prevent the arms being transported through the country but the high court in Durban ruled that the cargo could not be moved overland , though it could be discharged in the port .
' Nothing to do with us '
The ship contains three million rounds of ammunition for AK - 47s , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and several thousand mortar rounds , according to South Africa 's Mail and Guardian newspaper .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The weapons are packed in large red and blue containers piled high on the ship 's decks .
There are Chinese crew on board and the ship is flying both the Chinese and South African flags , our correspondent said after going to look at the ship anchored 18 km ( 11 miles ) from the entrance to Durban harbour .
The Mail and Guardian reports that a subsidiary of a state - owned South African company , Armscor , was approached to handle the transport of the weapons after several private companies refused to handle the cargo due to its sensitivity .
South African Defence Secretary January Masilela said the country 's National Conventional Arms Control Committee had given approval for the transit of the weapons .
" If the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with that , " he said .
Mr Masilela added that there was no United Nations or African Union embargo on weapons sales to Zimbabwe .
Speaking in New York , South African President Thabo Mbeki echoed his defence secretary 's comments .
Several Western countries have banned arms shipments to Zimbabwe , as has the European Union .
' Military regime '
With continuing tension in Zimbabwe over the failure of the authorities to issue results from the presidential election three weeks ago , the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( Satawu ) said it would be " grossly irresponsible " to allow the cargo through .
" The South African government cannot be seen as propping up a military regime , " said Satawu General Secretary Randall Howard .
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the weapons were not needed because Zimbabwe was not at war .
Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga insisted no country had the right to stop the arms entering his country .
For its part , China says the shipment is part of normal trade relations with Zimbabwe , adding that " one of the most important principles is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries " .

What are these ?
( Editor 's note : This story has been updated . )
We hear the same terms bandied about whenever a popular site gets hacked .
You know ...
SQL Injection , cross site scripting , that kind of thing .
But what do these things mean ?
Is hacking really as inaccessible as many of us imagine -- a nefarious , impossibly technical twilight world forever beyond our ken ?
Not really .
When you consider that you can go to Google right now and enter a search string which will return you thousands of usernames and passwords to websites , you realize that this dark science is really no mystery at all .
You 'll react similarly when you see just how simple a concept SQL Injection is , and how it can be automated with simple tools .
Read on , to learn the basics of how sites and web content management systems are most often hacked , and what you can do to reduce the risk of it happening to you .
SQL Injection
SQL Injection involves entering SQL code into web forms , eg. login fields , or into the browser address field , to access and manipulate the database behind the site , system or application .
When you enter text in the Username and Password fields of a login screen , the data you input is typically inserted into an SQL command .
This command checks the data you 've entered against the relevant table in the database .
If your input matches table / row data , you 're granted access ( in the case of a login screen ) .
If not , you 're knocked back out .
The Simple SQL Injection Hack
In its simplest form , this is how the SQL Injection works .
It 's impossible to explain this without reverting to code for just a moment .
Do n't worry , it will all be over soon .
Suppose we enter the following string in a Username field :
' OR 1=1
The authorization SQL query that is run by the server , the command which must be satisfied to allow access , will be something along the lines of :
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?
USRTEXT '
AND password = ?
PASSTEXT ?
... where USRTEXT and PASSTEXT are what the user enters in the login fields of the web form .
So entering `OR 1=1 -- as your username , could result in the following actually being run :
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? '
OR 1=1 -- ' AND password = '?
Two things you need to know about this :
[ '] closes the [ username ] text field .
' ' is the SQL convention for Commenting code , and everything after Comment is ignored .
So the actual routine now becomes :
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1
1 is always equal to 1 , last time I checked .
So the authorization routine is now validated , and we are ushered in the front door to wreck havoc .
Let 's hope you got the gist of that , and move briskly on .
Brilliant !
I 'm gonna go hack me a Bank !
Slow down , cowboy .
This half - cooked method wo n't beat the systems they have in place up at Citibank , evidently .
But the process does serve to illustrate just what SQL Injection is all about -- injecting code to manipulate a routine via a form , or indeed via the URL .
In terms of login bypass via Injection , the hoary old ' OR 1=1 is just one option .
If a hacker thinks a site is vulnerable , there are cheat - sheets all over the web for login strings which can gain access to weak systems .
Here are a couple more common strings which are used to dupe SQL validation routines :
username field examples :
admin'--
') or ( ' a '='a
" ) or ( " a " = " a
hi " or " a " = " a
... and so on .
Backdoor Injection - Modules , Forums , Search etc .
Hacking web forms is by no means limited exclusively to login screens .
A humble search form , for instance , is necessarily tied to a database , and can potentially be used to amend database details .
Using SQL commands in search forms can potentially do some extremely powerful things , like calling up usernames and passwords , searching the database field set and field names , and amending same .
Do people really get hacked through their search forms ?
You better believe it .
And through forums , and anywhere else a user can input text into a field which interacts with the database .
If security is low enough , the hacker can probe the database to get names of fields , then use commands like INSERT INTO , UNION , and so forth to get user information , change product prices , change account settings / balances , and just about anything else ... depending on the security measures in place , database architecture and so on .
So you can have security locked down at the login , but poor security on other forms can still be exploited .
Unfortunately this is a real worry regarding 3rd party modules for Web CMS products which incorporate forms , and for CMS products these 3rd party modules are often the weakest links which allows hackers access to your database .
Automated Injection
There are tools to automate the process of SQL Injection into login and other fields .
One hacker process , using a specific tool , will be to seek out a number of weak targets using Google ( searching for login.asp , for instance ) , then insert a range of possible injection strings ( like those listed above , culled from innumerable Injection cheat - sheets on the Web ) , add a list of proxies to cover his movements , and go play XBox while the program automates the whole injection process .
Remote Injection
This involves uploading malicious files to inject SQL and exploit other vulnerabilities .
It 's a topic which was deemed beyond the scope of this report , but you can view this PDF if you 'd like to learn more .
SQL Injection in the Browser Address Bar
Injections can also be performed via the browser address bar .
I do n't mean to have a pop at Microsoft , but when it comes to such vulnerabilities , HTTP GET requests with URLs of the following form are most often held to be vulnerable :
http://somesite.com/index.asp?id=10
Try adding an SQL command to the end of a URL string like this , just for kicks :
http://somesite.com/index.asp?id=10 AND id=11
See if both articles come up .
Do n't shoot your webmaster just yet if it's your own site and you get two articles popping up : this is real low - level access to the database .
But some such sites will be vulnerable .
Try adding some other simple SQL commands to the end of URLs from your own site , to see what happens .
As we saw above , access to the database raises a number of interesting possibilities .
The database structure can be mapped by a skilled hacker through ill - conceived visibility of error messages -- this is called database footprinting -- and then this knowledge of table names and so forth can be used to gain access to additional data .
Revealing error messages are manna - they can carry invaluable table name and structural details .
The following illustrative string is from Imperva .

UNION SELECT username , password FROM USERS
There are vast swathes of information on SQL Injection available , here are a couple of good sources :
Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )
XSS or Cross Site Scripting is the other major vulnerability which dominates the web hacking landscape , and is an exceptionally tricky customer which seems particularly difficult to stop .
Microsoft , MySpace , Google ... all the big cahunas have had problems with XSS vulnerabilities .
This is somewhat more complicated than SQL Injection , and we 'll just have a quick look to get a feel for it .
XSS is about malicious ( usually ) JavaScript routines embedded in hyperlinks , which are used to hijack sessions , hijack ads in applications and steal personal information .
Picture the scene : you 're there flicking through some nameless bulletin board because , yes , you really are that lazy at work .
Some friendly girl with broken English implores you to get in touch .
' Me nice gurl ' , she says .
You 've always wondered where those links actually go , so you say what the hell .
You hover over the link , it looks like this in the information bar :
[ %63%61%74%69%6f%6e%3d%274%74%70%3a%2f%2f%77%7 ...]
Hmmm ... what the hell , let 's give it a bash , you say .
The one thing I really need right now is to see an ad for cheap Cialis .
Maybe the linked page satisfies this craving , maybe not .
Nothing dramatic happens when you click the link , at any rate , and the long day wears on .
When a link in an IM , email , forum or message board is hexed like the one above , it could contain just about anything .
Like this example , from SandSprite , which helps steal a session cookie , which can potentially be used to hijack a session in a web application , or even to access user account details .
Stealing cookies is just the tip of the iceberg though -- XSS attacks through links and through embedded code on a page or even a bb post can do a whole lot more , with a little imagination .
XSS is mostly of concern to consumers and to developers of web applications .
It 's the family of security nightmares which keeps people like MySpace Tom and Mark Zuckerberg awake at night .
So they 're not all bad then , I suppose ...
For additional resources on this topic , here 's a great overview of XSS ( PDF ) and just what can be accomplished with sneaky links .
And here 's an in - depth XSS video .
Authorization Bypass
Authorization Bypass is a frighteningly simple process which can be employed against poorly designed applications or content management frameworks .
You know how it is ... you run a small university and you want to give the undergraduate students something to do .
So they build a content management framework for the Mickey Bags research department .
Trouble is that this local portal is connected to other more important campus databases .
Next thing you know , there goes the farm
Authorization bypass , to gain access to the Admin backend , can be as simple as this :
Find weak target login page .
View source .
Copy to notepad .
Delete the authorization javascript , amend a link or two .
Save to desktop .
Open on desktop .
Enter anything into login fields , press enter .
Hey Presto .
Here 's a great video of a White Hat going through the authorization - bypass process on YouTube .
This was done against a small university 's website .
It 's a two - minute process .
Note that he gets into the User 1 account , which is not the Admin account in this case .
Is Admin User 1 on your User table ?
Google Hacking
This is by far the easiest hack of all .
It really is extraordinary what you can find in Google 's index .
And here 's Newsflash # 1 : you can find a wealth of actual usernames and passwords using search strings .
Copy and paste these into Google :
inurl:passlist.txt
inurl : passwd.txt
... and this one is just priceless ...
" login : * " " password= * " filetype:xls
Such strings return very random results , and are of little use for targeted attacks .
Google hacking will primarily be used for finding sites with vulnerabilities .
If a hacker knows that , say , SQL Server 2000 has certain exploits , and he knows a unique string pushed out by that version in results , you can hone in on vulnerable websites .
For specific targets
Google can return some exceptionally useful information : full server configurations , database details ( so a good hacker knows what kind of injections might work ) , and so forth .
You can find any amount of SQL database dumps as well ( fooling around with a Google hack while preparing this article , I stumbled across a dump for a top - tier CMS developer 's website ) .
And a vast amount more besides .
johnny.ihackstuff.com is the man to go to for Google hacks .
One interesting one I toyed with invited me to the Joomla !
install page for dozens of sites ... people who had uploaded Joomla ! , decided against installing it , and subsequently had either left the domain to rot , or else set a redirect on the page to , say , their Flickr account ( in one case ) .
Allowing anybody to walk in and run through the installer .
Other query strings target unprotected email / IM archives , and all sorts of very sensitive information .
What fun we can have !
Password Cracking
Hashed strings can often be deciphered through ' brute forcing ' .
Bad news , eh ?
Yes , and particularly if your encrypted passwords / usernames are floating around in an unprotected file somewhere , and some Google hacker comes across it .
You might think that just because your password now looks something like XWE42GH64223JHTF6533H in one of those files , it means that it can't be cracked ?
Wrong .
Tools are freely available which will decipher a certain proportion of hashed and similarly encoded passwords .
A Few Defensive Measures
If you utilize a web content management system , subscribe to the development blog .
Update to new versions soon as possible .
Update all 3rd party modules as a matter of course -- any modules incorporating web forms or enabling member file uploads are a potential threat .
Module vulnerabilities can offer access to your full database .
Harden your Web CMS or publishing platform .
For example , if you use WordPress , use this guide as a reference .
or publishing platform .
For example , if you use WordPress , use this guide as a reference .
If you have an admin login page for your custom built CMS , why not call it ' Flowers. php ' or something , instead of " AdminLogin.php " etc . ?
why not call it ' Flowers. php ' or something , instead of " AdminLogin.php " etc . ?
Enter some confusing data into your login fields like the sample Injection strings shown above , and any else which you think might confuse the server .
If you get an unusual error message disclosing server - generated code then this may betray vulnerability .
Do a few Google hacks on your name and your website .
Just in case ...
When in doubt , pull the yellow cable out !
It wo n't do you any good , but hey , it rhymes .
UPDATE
I had posted a link here to a hacking bulletin board containing specific sql injections strings etc .
The link pointed to a page which listed numerous hacks targeting various CMS platforms , but containing a disproportionate number of hacks for one platform in particular .
In retrospect , and following a specific complaint , I have pulled down this link .
Apologies to the complainant and to anyone else who found this link to be inappropriate .

But there have been no fatal crashes in which maintenance error was a cause since January 2003 , when a US Airways Express flight , a Beechcraft 1900 , went out of control on takeoff because of an improperly rigged tail .
Statistically , the era of outsourcing appears to be safer than when airlines did most of the work themselves , although that does not suggest a cause - and - effect relationship .
The decade - long push to reduce the accident rate began with a “ safety summit ” in 1996 , after the T.W.A .
Flight 800 disaster off Long Island and the ValuJet crash in the Everglades of Florida .
The summit was convened by the secretary of transportation at the time , Federico F. Pena , who declared a goal of zero accidents .
In 1997 , a national commission on aviation safety and security , led by Vice President Al Gore and known as the Gore Commission , concluded that a more realistic goal would be to cut the rate of fatal accidents by 80 percent .
Because crashes are sporadic , the goal was stated as the average of the most recent three years .
Despite the safety improvements since then , not all the trends are positive .
Airports have lately recorded a disturbing number of what they call “ proximity events , ” in which a plane lands on a runway already occupied by another because someone made a wrong turn or a controller made an error .
On July 11 , for example , a United plane in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , took a wrong turn onto a runway where a Delta Air Lines plane was supposed to land ; the two came within 100 feet , according to the F.A.A .
“ Probably the biggest threat of all , today , many , many people agree , is not so much a midair collision as a runway incursion incident , ” said Richard Healing , an aviation safety expert and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board .
The F.A.A. has a radar system at many airports to warn tower controllers of conflicts on the airport surface , but the system can be confused by puddles on the pavement , which the radar sometimes misinterprets as airplanes .
And it warns only the controllers , not the pilots directly .
Thomas Friedman , the author and NY Times columnist , was invited to Brown University to give a keynote speech on Earth Day , before a packed auditorium .
His talk , titled “ Green is the new Red White and Blue ” was about how corporate environmentalism ( based on putting a price on the atmosphere , and investing in biofuels and techno - fixes ) can restore America to its “ natural place in the global order . ”
Luckily , this outrageous neoliberal capitalist propaganda was interrupted with a surprise visit from the Greenwash Guerrillas .
After splattering him with two green cream pies , leaflets were thrown to the crowd , stating :
Thomas Friedman deserves a pie in the face …
* because of his sickeningly cheery applaud for free market capitalism ’s conquest of the planet
* for telling the world that the free market and techno fixes can save us from climate change .
From carbon trading to biofuels , these distractions are dangerous in and of themselves , while encouraging inaction with

HARARE , Zimbabwe  President Robert Mugabe ’s decades - old control of Zimbabwe seemed to erode further on Tuesday , as diplomats , analysts and opposition members contended that talks were under way for the 84 - year - old leader to step down after trailing in Saturday ’s election .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition candidate who appears to be ahead in the voting , denied in an evening address that his party had been in discussions over Mr. Mugabe ’s resignation , saying he would “ not enter into any deal ” before the vote results were officially announced .
But his denial was at odds with a flurry of accounts that the two sides were having discussions about a possible transfer of power .
The nation ’s election commission has yet to release any results in the presidential race , only a steady trickle of outcomes in contests for Parliament .
But a projection by an independent civic group , based on data from polling stations , gives Mr. Tsvangirai a lead of about 49.4 percent to 41.8 percent , raising the prospect of either outright defeat for Mr. Mugabe or a runoff should neither one win a majority .
As it approaches its one - year anniversary next month of selling laptop and desktop computers pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux , Dell Inc. is continuing to expand the fledgling program to new computer models and markets .
In interviews at Dell 's Parmer campus north of Austin last week , four Dell representatives said sales of the Linux - loaded machines are encouraging .
Though they declined to give sales figures for the Linux - equipped machines , the Dell officials were adamant in saying that the program would n't be continuing or adding new models if the sales figures were not adequate .
" A [ sales ] number is not going to validate it as much as our actions to date , " which include adding new models and configurations , said company spokeswoman Anne Camden .
Dell first offered Linux on Dell machines in 1999 , when Dell installed Red Hat Linux on a selection of Dell servers , said Matt Domsch , the company 's Linux technology strategist in the CTO 's office .
A short time later , Dell tried selling consumer - focused laptops with Red Hat Linux but the effort was not sustained due to inadequate demand .
Dell has continued to sell enterprise servers with Linux since that 1999 debut , he said .
The recent Linux on Dell program for laptops and desktop machines , however , has been gaining momentum , he said .
" If the program was n't successful , we would n't be able to continue it , " Domsch said .
The machines can be configured and ordered at the company 's Dell and Linux Web page .
In January , Dell announced another Linux - loaded laptop machine , with a host of high - performance features .
The Linux on Dell idea was born in February 2007 after CEO Michael Dell debuted a new company - hosted blog called IdeaStorm , where customer could provide ideas and input on prospective new products and services .
More than 100,000 people posted comments about wanting to see the company sell computers with Linux preloaded , straight from the factory .
Ten weeks later , in May of last year , Dell announced it would begin selling Linux - loaded machines to consumers and businesses .
So far , Dell has n't advertised Linux on its machines in consumer advertising campaigns , but is relying on open source enthusiasts seeking out the machines on the Dell site .
Those are often the same people who suggested the combination in the first place .
" Those who care know " that Dell is selling the machines , said Russ Ray , a Dell product marketing representative .
" If you know Linux , you 're going to know we sell Dell products with Linux on them . "
Consumer - focused ads featuring Linux on Dell could appear at some point , Ray said , but it 's not critical to the company .
" I think that will occur when there 's a reason for that to occur , " he said .
" We would like to get to a place where to some degree , it really does n't matter " to consumers about which operating system is on the machines .
For business users , there has been a growing interest in the Linux on Dell program , Ray said .
" We have had many inquiries , " he said , regarding cost savings , infrastructure needs , desired applications and compatibility with existing Unix systems , he said .
" It 's the stuff that you would assume . "
John Hull , manager of Dell 's Linux engineering department in its Global Solutions Engineering division , said that two years ago , he'd have never expected such a program to get started .
The Linux on Dell program has made Dell machines more desirable for users who are seeking alternative operating systems to Microsoft Corp .'s
Windows ,
Hull said .
" People might have looked at other brands previously , but are now looking at Dell because of Linux .
We started in the big markets where they were asking the loudest and we went from there . "
The company has employees who are monitor a wide variety of blogs , looking for discussions involving consumers seeking information on Linux and laptops and desktops , Camden said .
The employees identify themselves and post replies pointing people to Dell and its Linux offerings .
" They evangelize it on that kind of level , " she said .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Dolly Parton ’s breasts may be two of the wonders of the entertainment world , but the country music icon says they are a pain in her back .
Parton , 62 , said on Monday she would postpone her upcoming North American tour after doctors told her to take it easy for six to eight weeks to rest her sore back .
“ Hey , you try wagging these puppies around a while and see if you do n’t have back problems , ” the folksy singer - songwriter said in a statement .
The tour was due to begin on February 28 in Minneapolis , two days after the release of “ Backwoods Barbie , ” her first album of mainstream country music in 17 years .
She hopes to hit the road in late April .
Parton , also famous for her big voice , big wigs and big smile , has long joked about her famous bust .
When she received a songwriters award in New York last year , she noted that she ’s been known for two things throughout her career .
“ I ’m talking about my music and my lyrics , ” she said .
Parton , a member of both the country music and songwriters halls of fame , has been enjoying a renaissance since she released the first of a trio of bluegrass - tinged albums in 1999 .
As with other veterans such as Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard , Parton found that she was no longer welcome at country radio , and changed tack by delving into roots music .
Her releases garnered widespread critical acclaim and a fond examination of her 40 - year career .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Eight million Americans admit they send themselves Valentine ’s Day gifts -- they may feel lonely and unloved but at least they will get something nice .

British lovers ought to steer clear of Paris as a Valentine destination -- one in three picked the French capital as the city most likely to cause them to argue on a romantic break .
It ’s the time of year again when love is in the air -- or at least the pressure is on to show you really , really care on February 14 .
Surveys abound on what makes the perfect gift -- usually commissioned by a company trying to sell its Valentine wares -- but the way the big day for lovers is celebrated around the world could not be more different .
Saudi Arabia has banned red roses ahead of Valentine ’s Day , forcing couples in the conservative Muslim nation to think of new ways to show their love .
The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered florists and gift shop owners in the capital Riyadh to remove any items coloured scarlet which is widely seen as symbolising love , newspapers reported .
Violence in Naivasha , Kenya ’s key flower - producing town , has threatened the industry in the key period leading up to Valentine ’s Day but growers hope the damage will be limited .
They are also keeping their fingers crossed in the Netherlands .
Dutch auction house FloraHolland , the world ’s biggest flower auctioneer , still expects bumper sales in the run-up to the big day as romantic impulses outweigh worries about the health of the global economy .
It all used to be so simple -- buy your lover chocolates , roses or , if you are feeling very generous , diamonds .
But what if the diamonds financed wars , the cocoa beans were harvested by children and the roses grown in a pesticide mist ?
“ Most roses in the U.S. are grown in Latin America .
And they are grown in a way that uses a lot of chemicals , ” said Rene Ebersole at the environmental Audubon Magazine .
Ivory Coast , which grows 40 percent of the world ’s cocoa , has a persistent child labour problem , a U.S. State Department human rights report said .

Then what about blood diamonds -- the term referring to gems mined under brutal conditions and sold to support a war effort ?
However , incorrigible bookmaker Ladbrokes believe that caution could still be thrown to the wind on the big day .
They are offering odds of 2 - 1 that Prince William will go down on bended knee and crown his on - off affair with girlfriend Kate Middleton by proposing .
Though of course this is a Leap Year , so if the future king does n’t get the job done on February 14 , tradition dictates that Middleton can ask him to marry her on February 29 .

If there were such a thing as the Ten Commandments of programming , code reuse would surely be included .
Now you ’re probably thinking I ’ve lost my mind , because any good developer knows that code reuse is a pipe dream .
But that ’s because you are thinking on the macro level and not the micro level .
At the micro level , code reuse has altogether more pleasant acronym , DRY , or do not repeat yourself .
The tussle in the Rails community over components illustrated this tension well .
On one extreme , advocates dreamed of creating plug - and - play components that could be reused across multiple applications .
On the other extreme , detractors sneered at code reuse as a hopeless endeavor and vowed to strip out all traces of components from the the Rails 2.0 release .
Left out in the cold was the view that reusing code , specifically controllers , within a single application was a good thing .
Reusing Controllers
Rails is built using the Model - View - Controller pattern , which is designed to segment an application into controllers , models and views .
Rails also adds in the concept of filters , which are pieces of code that run before and after controllers .
The Rails community encourages reuse of models , filters and views , but seems to actively discourage the reuse of controllers if the Ruby on Rails book is any indication :
When Rails was initially released , it came with a system for creating components .
Unfortunately , the implementation of components left a lot to be desired : performance
was poor , and there were unanticipated side effects .
As a result ,
components are being phased out .
Instead , the common wisdom now is to synthesize component - like functionality
using a combination of before filters and partials .
Use the before filter to set up the context for the partial , and then render the fragment you want using
a regular render : partial call .
Like much conventional wisdom , this advice is hogwash .
Filters + Partials !=
Controllers
The problem with just using filters and partials is that it only applies to a subset of web applications .
A good example , and of course the one used in the Ruby on Rails book , is a shopping website .
The focal point of most shopping websites is a shopping cart .
The point of the application is to make it easy for users to add things to the cart , modify the cart and hopefully buy the contents of the cart .
Since the cart plays such a crucial role , it often make sense to have a filter that setups the cart so each controller has easy access to it .
A nice side affect of this approach , is that views also have access to the cart , as described in the quote above .
But for many other types of applications , filters and partials can’t make up for controllers .
For example , take a look at the Boulder community on MapBuzz .
The top - left side of the page is rendered by the community controller , the comments on the bottom left by a comment controller and the map listings on the right are by a map browser controller .
If you log - in , then a couple of additional tabs are added to the page , each rendered by its own controller .
This type of composition is quite common in Web 2.0 applications .
Take most social networking sites – they ’ll mix together news feeds , discussion boards , friends / friends lists , pictures , etc. , in a variety of different ways depending on the current page .
The design problem is that any given controller can be called in two different contexts :
When the whole page is rendered via a Browser page refresh
When just the controller is rendered via an Ajax call
Trying to do this with just filters and helpers is a non-starter , because you end up with one big controller that needs to run different filters depending on the context of the call .
The better approach is to divide your controllers into logical units , and then have a separate page controller for the entire page .
When the page is rendered , the page controllers should delegate rendering the various sub-parts ( for example , tabs ) of the page to the appropriate controller .
When just one of the sub -parts of the page needs to be rerendered , due to an Ajax call , then you directly call the appropriate controller .
Performance
In Rails , a controller or view can call another controller using the much maligned render_component method .
Part of the problem is the method is misnamed .
It no longer has anything to do with rendering components – instead its used to invoke another controller .
Therefore , it would be more appropriately named render_controller , call_controller , invoke_controller , etc .
Assuming you agree with my so far , reading the Rails documentation for render_component with certainly give you pause :
Components should be used with care .
They ‘re significantly slower than simply splitting reusable parts into partials and conceptually more complicated .
Do n‘t use components as a way of separating concerns inside a single application .
Instead , reserve components to those rare cases where you truly have reusable view and controller elements that can be employed across many applications at once .
So to repeat : Components are a special - purpose approach that can often be replaced with better use of partials and filters .
Undoubtedly this was true once upon a time .
Is it still ?
There is one way to find out – run a test .
I created a new Rails application using the built - in generators and then added the following simple code :
controller/main_controller.rb
class MainController < ApplicationController def get_without_controller a = 1 end def get_with_controller a = 1 end end
controller/sidebar_controller.rb
class SidebarController < ApplicationController def get render ( : partial => ' sidebar / content ' ) end end
views / main/get_without_controller.html.erb
< p > Some fun content goes here </ p> < div class = " sidebar " > <%= render ( : partial => ' sidebar / content ' ) %> </div>
views / main/get_with_controller.html.erb
< p > Some fun content goes here </ p> < div class = " sidebar " > <%= render_component ( : controller => SidebarController , : action => ' get ' ) %> </div>
views / sidebar/_content.html.erb
< p> Hi there </p>
There are two paths through this application :
GET ‘/main/get_without_controller.rb ’
GET ‘/main/get_with_controller.rb ’
In case its not obvious , get_without_controller uses render ( : partial ) to include the sidebar content while get_with_controller uses render_component .
Using both benchmark and ruby - prof , I ran each method 100 times using a souped up integration test ( more about that in a future post ) .
The results , using Rails 2.02 on Ruby 1.8.4 on WindowsXP on a Pentium M laptop ( about 3 years old ) are :
Method
100 Requests ( s )
1 Request ( s )
get_without_controller
0.30
0.0030
get_with_controller
0.45
0.0045
So using components is 50 % slower , but the overhead is a miniscule 0.0015 seconds per request .
That overhead is obviously lost in a real application .
Of course you have to be careful when using render_component to not try and do to much per HTTP request – but the same is true using filters and partials .
DRY Up Your Controllers
Benjamin Franklin remains one of America 's most cherished historical figures .
He was an inventor , a writer , a philosopher and a statesman ; though he 's considered a Founding Father of our nation , the average person may remember him best for the wit and wisdom of his most famous sayings , many of which have passed nobly into cliché .
Among his many projects , Franklin wrote and published a yearly compendium of facts and amusements known as Poor Richard 's Almanack .
Within the Almanack 's pages , Franklin dispensed sage advice : " Early to bed and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise " ; " God helps them that help themselves . "
Though many of his nuggets of wisdom have survived the ages , many more have been forgotten or suppressed due to their questionable merit .
We are proud to republish a collection of Franklin 's minor quotations and lesser wisdom .
The industrious man needs no food , for there shall be nourishment enough in the grave .
He who endeavors to drink salt needs fear no thirst .
The working man is fit and fed , and stabs the sluggard in his bed .
Preparation is the burden of fools .
To cross the sea takes naught but a pair of legs and the will to swim .
The nude man catcheth the hen while the clothed man shivers .
Shrewdness can turn one penny into two , but wisdom can turn a horse into a boy .
Save a penny every year and you shall die a millionaire .
For every pound of sand you eat , another shilling 's yours to keep .
The wise man learns things , but the fool does not .
A rich man 's pockets hold more shillings than spiders , because he is not afraid to grope blindly in dark woodpiles .
Judge a man not by the size of his hat , but by the angle of its tilt .
Genius without education is like a dog without shoes .
A heavy ship cannot sink .
No sin withers the soul more quickly than laughter .
It is always better to be diligent , for he who toils with honor dies content , while he who is lazy sleeps with the diligent man 's wife .
Save a moment each day by leaving your trousers on while you relieve your bladder .
When you have grown old , you will relish not only the time saved but also the warmth and contentment of your marvelous habit .
He who dines on human meat , shall never want for things to eat .
The patient man shall live to bury his sons .
Benjamin Franklin lives with his wife and two adult children in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
He is over three hundred years old .

Senator John McCain ’s wife , Cindy McCain , has decided not to release her tax returns  not now and not in the future .
In the interest of transparency and to support her husband ’s frequent calls for clean and open government , she should rethink that decision .
Since their marriage in 1980 , Mrs. McCain , the daughter of a multimillionaire Anheuser - Busch distributor , and her husband have filed separate tax returns .
In April , Mr. McCain released his own returns , but just for the last two years  a paltry nod to openness .
Mrs. McCain , it was explained , would not release her tax returns in “ the interest of protecting the privacy of her children . ”
Mrs. McCain dug in deeper this month , insisting that she will never make her returns public , even if her husband wins the presidency and she becomes first lady .
“ My husband is the candidate , ” she said .
There is no question that Mr. McCain  the candidate  has reaped considerable benefits from his wife ’s wealth , including discounted use of her company ’s corporate jet to fly from state to state during this campaign .
* Illustration : Paula Scher / Pentagram * Trolling down the street in Manhattan , I suddenly hear a woman 's voice .
" Who 's there ?
Who 's there ? " she whispers .
I look around but can't figure out where it 's coming from .
It seems to emanate from inside my skull .
Was I going nuts ?
Nope .
I had simply encountered a new advertising medium : hypersonic sound .
It broadcasts audio in a focused beam , so that only a person standing directly in its path hears the message .
In this case , the cable channel A&E was using the technology to promote a show about , naturally , the paranormal .
I 'm a geek , so my first reaction was , " Cool ! "
But it also felt creepy .
We think of our brains as the ultimate private sanctuary , a zone where other people can't intrude without our knowledge or permission .
But its boundaries are gradually eroding .
Hypersonic sound is just a portent of what 's coming , one of a host of emerging technologies aimed at tapping into our heads .
These tools raise a fascinating , and queasy , new ethical question :
Do we have a right to " mental privacy " ?
" We 're going to be facing this question more and more , and nobody is really ready for it , " says Paul Root Wolpe , a bioethicist and board member of the nonprofit Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics .
" If the skull is not an absolute domain of privacy , there are no privacy domains left . "
He argues that the big personal liberty issues of the 21st century will all be in our heads — the " civil rights of the mind , " he calls it .
It 's true that most of this technology is still gestational .
But the early experiments are compelling :
Some researchers say that fMRI brain scans can detect surprisingly specific mental acts — like whether you 're entertaining racist thoughts , doing arithmetic , reading , or recognizing something .
Entrepreneurs are already pushing dubious forms of the tech into the marketplace :
You can now hire a firm , No Lie MRI , to conduct a " truth verification " scan if you 're trying to prove you 're on the level .
Give it 10 years , ethicists say , and brain tools will be used regularly — sometimes responsibly , often shoddily .
Both situations scare civil libertarians .
What happens when the government starts using brain scans in criminal investigations — to figure out if , say , a suspect is lying about a terrorist plot ?
Will the Fifth Amendment protect you from self - incrimination by your own brain ?
Think about your workplace , too :
Your boss can already demand that you pee in a cup .
Should she also be allowed to stick your head in an MRI tube as part of your performance review ?
But this is n't just about reading minds ; it 's also about bombarding them with messages or tweaking their chemistry .
Transcranial magnetic stimulation — now used to treat epilepsy — has shown that it can artificially generate states of empathy and euphoria .
And you 've probably heard of propranolol , a drug that can help erase traumatic memories .
Let 's say you 've been assaulted and you want to take propranolol to delete the memory .
The state needs that memory to prosecute the assailant .
Can it prevent you from taking the drug ?
" To a certain extent , memories are societal properties , " says Adam Kolber , a visiting professor at Princeton .
" Society has always made claims on your memory , such as subpoenaing you . "
Or what if you use transcranial stimulation to increase your empathy .
Would you be required to disclose that ?
Could a judge throw you off a jury ?
Could the Army turn you away ?
I 'd love to give you answers .
But the truth is no one knows .
Privacy rights vary from state to state , and it 's unclear how , or even if , the protections would apply to mental sanctity .
" We really need to articulate a moral code that governs all this , " warns Arthur Caplan , a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist .
The good news is that scholars are holding conferences to hash out legal positions .
But we 'll need a broad public debate about it , too .
Civil liberties thrive only when the public demands them — and understands they 're at risk .
That means we need to stop seeing this stuff as science fiction and start thinking about how we 'll react to it .
Otherwise , we could all lose our minds .

Berliner Zeitung Staffers Admit Secret Past Top Berlin Journalists Outed as Stasi Spies
The dark past of two senior journalists at one of Berlin 's biggest newspapers has come to light after one of them was outed as a former Stasi collaborator and his colleague chose to come forward and talk about his past voluntarily .
Let me see if I have got this right , somebody fired a lot of rockets into empty lots in Siderot and Olmert ( he whose face looks like a grinning skull ) ordered some murders .
Oh they blame these things on Hizbollah and they blame them on Hamas but I ’ve got a sneaking suspicion that it ’s the IDF that likes to launch rockets into empty lots .
It ’s difficult to understand how .05 percent of the population can have such a locked down control on the banking industry , the American government , many European governments , most of the international media , the entertainment industry and god knows what else , all while making anyone who points it out a pariah dog bitch regardless of the fact that it is demonstrably fact .
It ’s difficult to understand how a fat slug of a presently comatose mass murderer could storm the Temple Mount creating an Intifada and then make it the fault of a wretched , huddled mass of displaced peoples who can hardly feed themselves .
It ’s hard to imagine how these same wretched people now have their food , water and power shut off to starve them into submission with the intention of driving them off somewhere far away .
It ’s hard to imagine how the lawyer ( Stolz ) defending the man ( Zundel ) hijacked from one country to another merely for questioning an event and finally imprisoned , can also be imprisoned for defending the man .
It ’s even harder to imagine when the Red Cross figures of this event are at odds with the declared numbers and when detailed forensic investigation of Treblinka has irrefutably shown that there were NO mass graves there .
It ’s hard to imagine that anyone would ever be imprisoned for questioning something ... unless ...
UNLESS ... someone does n’t want any questions asked because of what the results might be .
After all ... what could investigators find that would contradict official published stories ?
Is there something to find ?
Why would impressive legal machinery be set into place to silence those who ask questions ?
After all ... the death count listed outside Auschwitz continues to be lowered by the same people imprisoning the people questioning the event .
It ’s hard to imagine a people who daily practice the same tactics practiced against them against a people that they displaced off of the land upon which they were living before they displaced them .
It ’s hard to imagine that a company from a certain country was controlling security at all of the 9/11 airports , the London tube and the Madrid train station and that members of their security forces were caught video - taping the 9/11 attacks and dancing around and one wonders ... one wonders indeed how they knew about this in advance .
It ’s hard to imagine that dual nationals from America and this country are responsible for all of the wars following .
It ’s hard to imagine and difficult to understand how this country could launch a horrible attack on Lebanon or that there would be such questions remaining about assassinations the world over that benefit no one but this country and the countries they control .
It ’s not surprising to now find that Entebbe was orchestrated by the Israelis .
As I go back in time and watch the progression of events as they move to the moment in which I write these words I have to say that there is an overwhelming weight of evidence that indicates that the drive toward the creation of Israel and the activities of Israel since have resulted in the lion ’s share of death and suffering on this planet since .
There is no other way to see it .
Even if we do n’t leave out Chairman Mao they get the Oscar .
It could be that there is some shadowy alien pod race that is making all of this happen just to blame it on the same victims that always get blamed - and who ’ve made out like gangbusters since - but I find that difficult to imagine .
No matter how you play it out they are working for them because they are in many of the positions of authority .
I find it odd that most of the so - called anti-Semitic offenses of recent years have all been revealed to have been perpetrated by Zionists jitterbugging through blood puddles with Herzl - rock on the headphones .
Please see the actual police reports in France , the US and elsewhere for the slimy details .
I am starting to believe that the nation of Israel and those who created it for the purpose it serves today are guilty of worse crimes than even the most imaginative of us have suggested .
I am starting to think that whenever this ‘ chosen people ’ thing got said it was The Devil himself saying it .
I am starting to think things that I can never say but I will be goddamned if I do n’t connect some dots and have at it with a will while I am still standing .
I have come to the point where I just ca n’t take it any longer .
I just ca n’t take the ongoing impunity of emptying automatic weapons into nine year old girls .
I ca n’t take the false flag outrages that are blamed on the people being eliminated .
I ca n’t take these odious , blood - sucking swine going on and on and on while the world masturbates in front of its TV set .
I just ca n’t take it .
I suspect that this is the source of the fog I was talking about .
I suspect that this is the source of most of the evil that plagues humanity at this time .
I realize that the smear machine will come after me .
I realize that I ’ll be labeled and branded and god knows what else but I do n’t care .
If I have to live in fear of these forces then I will have to count my life not worth having been lived .
I ’m lucky that I ’m not important enough to have a reputation wide enough to where anything said about me would make any difference .
But I assure you that I would have long ago compromised such a reputation if I had had it .
It ’s as plain as plain can be .
This does n’t make Iran and Russia and China the good guys ; not hardly .
Every nation in this world is run by compromising me firsters .
Lucky for some that they have laws and constitutions as yet uncompromised .
Israel and her lap dog America and her lapdog England and who knows who is sitting in whose lap ; but we can be sure there is a circle jerk of canines with their noses up each others asses who only turn away long enough to gorge themselves on human flesh and blood and misery .
These are the people that did 9/11 .
These are the people who are running the killing fields of the moment .
These are the ones who have revised history to their own purposes , who silence dissent , who fire university professors , who control the medium of the massage , who rape the children and who place the children in the hotel rooms for the politicians to fuck and who videotape it and then murder the children afterwards and who then control the politicians .
These are the shits who control the banks and the arms industries and who are marching you as these words are written toward the grayscale destiny of your final hours .
Connect the dots .

370,000 people treated in hospital emergency rooms for abusing illegal drugs in 2005 , with overdose rates for heroin , cocaine , pharmaceuticals and drugs mixed with alcohol far higher than among teenagers ...
More than half of all new H.I.V./ AIDS diagnoses in 2005 were given to middle - aged Americans , up from less than one - third a decade ago ...
What experts label " adolescent risk taking " is really baby boomer risk taking .
It 's true that 30 years ago , the riskiest age group for violent death was 15 to 24 .
But those same boomers continue to suffer high rates of addiction and other ills throughout middle age , while later generations of teenagers are better behaved .
Today , the age group most at risk for violent death is 40 to 49 , including illegal - drug death rates five times higher than for teenagers .

Now they show the World War 2 as was seen from a simple Russian soldier perspective .
This soldier later has become a very famous Russian and played in more than sixty Russian movies .
It is not quite incest .
And though it will increase your chances of birthing a healthy baby , it is a bit unorthodox , to say the least .
Still , scientists at Icelandic biotechnology company deCODE genetics say that when third and fourth cousins procreate , they generally have scads of kids and grandkids ( relative to everyone else ) .
It has long been wondered exactly how kinship influences reproductive success .
Previous studies have uncovered positive correlations , but the biological data has been clouded by socioeconomic factors ( such as average marrying age and family size ) in those populations in which consanguineous marriage is commonplace , such as in India , Pakistan and the Middle East .
The new study , however , was able to shed light on the biological reason for the earlier findings .
Scientists came to their conclusions after studying the records of more than 160,000 Icelandic couples with members born between 1800 and 1965 .
" The advantage of using the Icelandic data set lies in this population being small and one of the most socioeconomically and culturally homogenous societies in the world , " the researchers report in Science , " with little variation in family size [ and ] use of contraceptives and marriage practices , in contrast with most previously studied populations . "
The results of the exhaustive study are constant throughout the generations analyzed .
Women born between 1800 and 1824 who mated with a third cousin had significantly more children and grandchildren ( 4.04 and 9.17 , respectively ) than women who hooked up with someone no closer than an eighth cousin ( 3.34 and 7.31 ) .
Those proportions held up among women born more than a century later when couples were , on average , having fewer children .
Despite the general pattern for reproductive success favoring close kinship , couples that were second cousins or more closely related did not have as many children .
The most likely reason , scientists say : offspring of such close relatives were likely to have much shorter life spans , because of the chance of inheriting harmful genetic mutations .
" With close inbreeding — between first cousins — there is a significant increase in the probability that both partners will share one or more detrimental recessive genes , leading to a 25 percent chance that these genes will be expressed in each pregnancy , " says Alan Bittles , director of the Center for Human Genetics at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup , Australia , who was not involved in the study .
Interestingly , one evolutionary argument for mating with a relative is that it might reduce a woman 's chance of having a miscarriage caused by immunological incompatibility between a mother and her child .
Some individuals have an antigen ( a protein that can launch an immune response ) on the surface of their red blood cells called a rhesus factor — commonly abbreviated " Rh . "
In some cases — typically during a second pregnancy — when a woman gets pregnant , she and her fetus may have incompatible blood cells , which could trigger the mother 's immune system to treat the fetus as a foreign intruder , causing a miscarriage .
This occurrence is less probable if the parents are closely related , because their blood makeup is more likely to match .
" It may well be that the enhanced reproductive success observed in the Iceland study at the level of third [ and ] fourth cousins , who on average would be expected to have inherited 0.8 percent to 0.2 percent of their genes from a common ancestor , " Bittles says , " represents this point of balance between the competing advantages and disadvantages of inbreeding and outbreeding . "
Apple rang in this Tuesday morning with a Safari 3.1 announcement for both Mac and Windows , which the company claims " loads web pages 1.9 times faster than IE 7 and 1.7 times faster than Firefox 2 . "
( No thanks to those hidden APIs ? * cough * )
Apple also claims that Safari 3.1 is capable of running JavaScript " up to six times faster " than other browsers .
The company even provided this handy performance graph :
Graphs courtesy of Apple
( Turns out the browser performance was measured on a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo iMac running Leopard Windows XP and 1GB of RAM , along with a ATI Radeon HD 2600 with 256MB of VRAM , and JavaScript results were based on VeriTest ’s iBench Version 5.0 's default settings .
Edit : Apple 's Safari site says the iMac is running Leopard , while the PDF where these graphs come from say Windows XP .
Tricky tricky . )
But what does it really do ?
Turns out Safari 3.1 now supports CSS animations , CSS web fonts , and HTML 5 media support , improved SVG support , and HTML 5's offline storage support .
Offline storage , of course , is something like Google Gears that allows the browser to serve up web pages and other data locally without having to access the Internet .
It 's pretty cool if you 're into that sort of thing .
The updated Safari also contains a smattering of security updates .
Check out the entire changelog and product overview document ( PDF ) to read more about what 's in Safari 3.1 , which is available for Mac OS X Tiger ( 10.4.11 ) and up , as well as Windows XP and Vista .

San Francisco's 68 controversial anti-crime cameras have n't deterred criminals from committing assaults , sex offenses or robberies - and they 've only moved homicides down the block , according to a new report from UC Berkeley .
Researchers found that nonviolent thefts dropped by 22 percent within 100 feet of the cameras , but the devices had no effect on burglaries or car theft .
And they 've had no effect on violent crime .
Mayor Gavin Newsom called the report " conclusively inconclusive " on Thursday but said he still wants to install more cameras around the city because they make residents feel safer .
" When I put the first cameras in , I said , ' This may only move people around the corner , ' " he said .
" But the community there said , ' We do n't care , we want our alleyway back . '
No one 's actually had a camera up that they wanted torn down in the community . "
But not all city officials think it 's wise to spend money on public safety measures if the best thing that can be said about them is they have a placebo effect for worried residents .
" In their current configuration they are not useful , and they give people a false sense of security , which I think is bad , " said Police Commissioner Joe Alioto - Veronese .
He added that previous studies of security cameras in other parts of the country have also shown that they do not deter violent crime .
The cameras have been installed in phases on some of the city 's roughest streets since 2005 with large concentrations of them in the Western Addition and Mission District and others in the lower Haight , the Tenderloin and near Coit Tower .
They 've been controversial from the start .
Representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union say they 're a violation of privacy , and some members of the Board of Supervisors and Police Commission , as well as the city 's public defender , say they 're ineffective in fighting crime .
The cameras have contributed to only one arrest nearly two years ago in a city that saw 98 homicides last year , a 12 - year high .
The video is choppy , and police are n't allowed to watch video in real - time or maneuver the cameras to get a better view of potential crimes .
Final report not ready
The city has spent $ 900,000 on the cameras so far and has budgeted $ 200,000 for 25 more cameras that need Police Commission approval to be installed .
The commission has refused to approve the new cameras until seeing a report on whether they 're doing any good .
The city administrator contracted with researchers at UC Berkeley 's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society to do the study , and the group published its preliminary results this week .
A final report is expected in a few months , and the Police Commission will hold off on approving any new cameras until then , President Theresa Sparks said .
Researchers examined data from the San Francisco Police Department detailing the 59,706 crimes committed within 1,000 feet of the camera locations between Jan. 1 , 2005 , and Jan. 28 , 2008 .
These were the total number of crimes for which police had reports - regardless of whether the crimes were caught on video .
The idea was to look at whether criminals stopped committing crimes at those locations because they knew cameras were there .
Using a complicated method , researchers were able to come up with an average daily crime rate at each location broken out by type of crime and distance from the cameras .
They then compared it with the average daily crime rate from the period before the cameras were installed .
They looked at seven types of crime : larcenies , burglaries , motor vehicle theft , assault , robbery , homicide and forcible sex offenses .
The only positive deterrent effect was the reduction of larcenies within 100 feet of the cameras .
No other crimes were affected - except for homicides , which had an interesting pattern .
Murders went down within 250 feet of the cameras , but the reduction was completely offset by an increase 250 to 500 feet away , suggesting people moved down the block before killing each other .
The final report is expected to analyze the figures in more depth and to include other crimes , including prostitution and drug offenses .
Kevin Ryan , director of the Mayor 's Office of Criminal Justice , said it 's premature to dismiss the use of the cameras based on the preliminary report .
He said the report shows the devices change behavior in some instances .
" At the end of the day , if the report does suggest what I think it 's going to suggest , that it can be an effective tool , we 're going to have to deploy it in the most effective way we can , " he said .
Real - time monitoring sought
Ryan is pushing for the cameras to be monitored in real - time like they are in Chicago and other cities .
Those police departments are often able to catch crimes in progress and immediately respond .
Newsom does not support that idea .
Public Defender Jeff Adachi , who has long been a critic of the cameras , said the report is further proof they 're not improving public safety .
He said they 're no substitute for attacking the causes of crime and said money would be better invested in community - based policing , anti-violence projects in schools , and services that help ex-prisoners readjust to life in society so they do n't commit more crimes .
Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , who heads the board 's public safety committee , pointed out that the report comes at a time when the city is facing one of its biggest budget deficits in recent memory .
He has supported the cameras because they make residents in high - crime areas feel safer , but he said that may not be enough of a reason to expand the program .
" We have to decide the fiscal value of that scarecrow strategy , " he said .
" It gives people some psychological relief , but if the data shows the cameras do n't have the intended consequences , it 's going to come down to a matter of dollars . "

Even as he told reporters on his flight to America that he was " deeply ashamed " over the church sex abuse scandal , Pope Benedict was accused by victims of protecting some 19 bishops accused of sexually abusing children .
" As a Catholic , I have to sadly conclude that he is not serious about ridding the church of corrupt bishops , " said Anne Doyle , co-director of BishopAccountability.org , a group tracking public records involving the bishops .
According to the group , of the 19 bishops " credibly accused of abusing children , " none has lost his title , been publicly censured by the Vatican or referred for criminal prosecutions .
" The sexual corruption in the Catholic church starts at the very top , " said Doyle .
Pope Benedict told reporters on his flight this morning from Rome to Washington , D.C. , he would do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the scandal .
" We will absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry , " he said , according to Reuters .
While the church has moved to expel accused priests , critics say the higher - ranking bishops have been given favored treatment .
" The attitude of the bishops towards the victims and the families of sexual abuse and predatory clergy is drop dead , " said Michael Wegs , of Marion , Iowa , one of nine former high schools students who said they were abused at a seminary in Missouri by former Palm Beach , Fla .
Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell .
When the allegations were made public , Bishop O'Connell admitted at least two cases of abuse and was allowed to resign .
He now lives on the beautiful , sprawling grounds of the Trappists Mepkin Abbey in South Carolina .
" He deserves to be in jail , " said Wegs , his accuser .
" I do n't think there is any justice because he is allowed to travel , go where he please .
He 's still a bishop , and he 's living among priests in the hierarchical structure ; he is a top dog despite the fact that he 's a sexual predator . "
Wegs says O'Connell has failed to even apologize to his victims .
Bishop O'Connell did not return phone calls from ABCNews.com seeking comment , but church officials say he and other bishops have been punished appropriately .
" You can not put on clerical attire , and you cannot service in a public way in ministry , " said Austin , Texas Bishop Gregory Aymond , chair of the U.S. Bishop 's Committee on Protection of Children and Young People .
" That is a very , very significant consequence , and I would say a significant penalty , " said Bishop Aymond , who conceded the accused bishops maintain their title .
" Priests and bishops remain priests and bishops forever , regardless of what happens to them or what they do , " said Bishop Aymond .
But victims groups and church critics say the pope can and should do much more to punish the bishops and finally resolve the scandal .
Before he became pope , as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , he was in charge of monitoring cases of pedophile priests and was directly involved in deciding what punishment , if any , would be administered to priests and bishops .
" Priests who abuse children can be removed from the priesthood , but they do not remove bishops , they do not remove cardinals , " said author Jason Berry who has been tracking the sex abuse scandal and produced a documentary film on the subject , " Vows of Silence , " which premiered in New Orleans last night .
" The problem is the power structure .
There is no accountability , " said Berry .
Berry says the pope 's decision to have the Los Angeles archbishop , Cardinal Roger Mahoney , accompany him on his trip proves the point .
" Why would you want someone in your entourage " like Roger Mahoney , asked Berry .
" This man has overseen a great many cases in which priests were moved from parish to parish .
His diocese has paid over $ 660 million in settlements .
And yet this cardinal has refused to release the files on these priests who have abused children , " Berry said .
Cardinal Mahoney did not return calls from ABC News seeking comment .

Online community Habbo's second Global Youth Survey has discovered that the PlayStation 3 is the console of choice among teenagers .
A total of 58,486 youngsters between the ages of 11 and 18 took part in the worldwide survey across 31 markets , with some 69 % of all respondents referring to the console as " great " or " good " .
This was followed by the Nintendo Wii on 64 % and Microsoft 's Xbox 360 with 58 % .
The PS3 was ahead of the Wii in every age group except the 11 to 12 year - olds , but the Wii was the preferred female choice overall .
The survey also revealed that while the Xbox 360 was third in Europe and Asia , in the US it came second and in Mexico and Columbia it was the number one console .
" The results of this survey are interesting as it gives us an insight into which brands these teens aspire to , as the level of ownership does not correspond to the consoles ’ popularity , " said Emmi Kuusikko , director of user and market insight at Sulake .
" By order of ownership , the Wii leads , followed by the Xbox 360 and PS3 . "
Believing that gender appears to indicate the console of choice , Kuusikko added : “ As Sony and Xbox strive to broaden their consoles ' appeal , from hardcore to casual gamer , the results of the survey seem to indicate that gender , not previous gaming experience , determines console choice .
Regardless of their level of interest towards gaming , boys prefer the PS3 and girls prefer the Wii . ”

They blow up aging casinos in this town .
Now , some are wondering what to do about yesterday ’s desert dream homes .
Take the foreclosed million - dollar house realty agent Michael Antos recently showed .
Please .
To the untrained eye , the four - bedroom , five - bath retreat may appear top - drawer , shimmering with granite and marble throughout , and with posh touches like a pool with a sandy beach entry .
But Antos pointed out that the house was showing its age .
After all , it was built in 2000 .
In Vegas , that makes it as dated as a coin - operated slot machine .

The chandelier ?
Plastic .
The granite surrounding the upstairs bathtub is tile , not slab .
And those polished travertine tiles in the entryway may look luxurious , but at 12 inches by 12 inches , they just wo n’t cut it today .
“ Now you ’ve gotta have at least 20 by 20 to sell something at this price , ” Antos explained .
The housing slump has fattened the inventory of unsold homes throughout the country , and a staggering 51 % of them in Las Vegas are vacant .
But there ’s another twist to the story here : a glut of glitzy homes .
About 1,000 houses are listed for sale in Las Vegas for $ 1 million or higher , more than 600 of them built since 2004 .
But unless they ’ve been constructed in the last year or two , the properties are considered out - of - date , making them all that more difficult to sell , real estate agents say .

Just as casinos on the Strip compete fiercely to be the prime destination -- and seldom hold that distinction for more than a couple of years -- houses and entire neighborhoods are quickly eclipsed by flashier newcomers .
In most of the country , prized neighborhoods become even more desirable over time ( think Beverly Hills or Greenwich , Conn . ) .
But Las Vegas is n’t about stately trees , old lawns and older money , said Gene Moehring , chairman of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , history department and a specialist in urban history .
“ In Vegas , new is the most important thing , ” Moehring said .
And building homes is relatively easy in a city surrounded by desert land available for development , so there ’s always room to build a newer , more - opulent golf course community across town from the last hot spot ( concern about the region ’s water resources has yet to stem the building boom ) .
Advertisement
The new homes often do n’t cost much more than the older ones , at least to buyers at the top end , for whom a couple hundred grand here and there wo n’t make or break a deal , said veteran Las Vegas real estate broker Michelle Sterling .
“ Once you get into the market over $ 2.5 million , a lot of people just prefer to build their own , ” she said .
One developer , Christopher Homes , recently opened a neighborhood of homes in the hills west of the Strip selling for $ 1.7 million to $ 3 million .
Several houses have sold to residents of adjoining neighborhoods who lived in their houses for less than five years , including homes built by the same developer , said Erika Geiser , the company ’s vice president .
“ They feel their residence is obsolete , ” she said .
“ They ’re looking for something more innovative , more cutting - edge . ”

Michael Lemoine , an architect who specializes in custom houses for the wealthy , says he has clients who build houses as often as some people buy cars .
“ New neighborhoods pop up that become the place where these people want to live , ” he said .
“ They move from one to another because they want to be with their friends , then in five to seven years ’ time they go to another community . ”
To be considered a premium home , “ 8,000 to 10,000 square feet is the new threshold , ” Lemoine said .
It was 5,000 to 7,000 square feet just five years ago , he added .
Buyers today want two sets of refrigerators and freezers , two game rooms ( one for the kids , another for adults ) and showers that are at least 7 feet by 7 feet , he said , adding , “ Laundry rooms now are better than kitchens were five years ago .
They have stainless steel cabinets , glass tiles . ”

The high - end home market barely existed when Lemoine moved to Las Vegas from Southern California 21 years ago .
Real estate agents say few if any houses sold for more than $ 1 million before the mid-1990s .
That began to change as Las Vegas evolved into an upmarket destination , which Moehring traces to the opening of the Mirage resort in 1989 .
That ushered in an era in which gambling shared the stage with golf , spas and shopping .
Soon , the Strip was filling up with world - class restaurants , boutiques and hotels .
This helped draw even wealthier visitors who bought second homes in the area , Moehring said , while also expanding the local population of wealthy professionals and casino executives .
In 2000 , 176 Las Vegas homes sold for more than $ 1 million , according to real estate research firm DataQuick Information Systems .
By 2006 , that number multiplied nearly eightfold -- to 1,385 before ebbing to 1,219 last year .

Along with being out - of - date , developer Tom McCormick says , a lot of the mansions built hastily during the boom were poorly designed .
Some used the wide - open lots in the desert to showcase fine architecture and good taste , McCormick said .
Many more did not .
“ Just because you ’re a great entrepreneur does n’t mean you ’re a great home designer , ” said McCormick , president of mid-market home builder Astoria Homes .

The housing slump has left Las Vegas strewn with empty houses , and at all price points .
There are now more than 22,000 homes for sale here , 51 % of them vacant , according to Las Vegas real estate research firm SalesTraq .
That compares with perhaps 15 % to 20 % in Southern California , said John Burns , an Irvine real estate consultant .
Among high - end homes in Las Vegas , the vacancy rate is actually lower than the overall figure -- about 36 % for homes in the $ 1 million - plus category , SalesTraq said .
But experts say that ’s largely because the lower end of the market is flooded with unsold new tract homes and condos .
The lower end also includes unoccupied houses purchased by flippers , who have let the properties fall into foreclosure because of the soured market .
Advertisement
Some wealthy investors also have an option lesser flippers can’t afford : taking their custom - built mansions off the market and moving in .
William Derentz , who heads the company that runs the annual Harvest Festival in Laguna Hills , bought a 5,400 - square - foot home in Las Vegas for $ 2 million in 2004 .
He never moved in , since he planned to resell it in a year or two at a hoped - for profit of $ 1 million .
But after the home languished on the market , Derentz threw in the towel in February and relocated his family from Mission Viejo to the house .
He now hopes to sell it when the market recovers , even if that takes several years .
Meanwhile , to make the property more competitive , he ’s spending $ 200,000 to fix up the backyard of the house , outfitting it with a pool and “ his - and - her ” cabanas .

“ It ’s going to look like the Bellagio back there , ” Derentz said .
“ You ’ve got to make it two cuts above . ”

Winning hearts and minds -- the Bush administration , foreign policy wonks , even the U.S. military agree that this is the key to any victory over global terrorism .
Yet our public diplomacy program has made little progress on improving America ’s image .
Few seem to recognize that American ignorance of Islam and Muslims has been the fatal flaw .
How much do Americans know about the views and beliefs of Muslims around the world ?
According to polls , not much .
Perhaps not surprising , the majority of Americans ( 66 % ) admit to having at least some prejudice against Muslims ; one in five say they have “ a great deal ” of prejudice .
Almost half do not believe American Muslims are “ loyal ” to this country , and one in four do not want a Muslim as a neighbor .
Why should such anti-Muslim bias concern us ?
First , it undermines the war on terrorism : Situations are misdiagnosed , root causes are misidentified and bad prescriptions do more harm than good .
Second , it makes our public diplomacy sound like double - talk .
U.S. diplomats are trying to convince Muslims around the world that the United States respects them and that the war on terrorism is not out to destroy Islam .
Their task is made infinitely more difficult by the frequent airing of anti-Muslim sentiment on right - wing call - in radio , which is then heard around the world on the Internet .
Finally , public ignorance weakens our democracy at election time .
Instead of a well - informed citizenry choosing our representatives , we are rendered vulnerable to manipulative fear tactics .
We need look no further than the political attacks on Barack Obama .
Any implied connection to Islam -- attending a Muslim school in Indonesia , the middle name Hussein -- is wielded to suggest that he is unfit for the presidency and used as fuel for baseless rumors .
Anti-Muslim sentiment fuels misinformation , and is fueled by it -- misinformation that is squarely contradicted by evidence .
Starting in 2001 , the research firm Gallup embarked on the largest , most comprehensive survey of its kind , spending more than six years polling a population that represented more than 90 % of the world ’s 1.3 billion Muslims .
The results showed plainly that much of the conventional wisdom about Muslims -- views touted by U.S. policymakers and pundits and accepted by voters -- is simply false .
For instance , Gallup found that 72 % of Americans disagreed with this statement : “ The majority of those living in Muslim countries thought men and women should have equal rights . ”
In fact , majorities in even some of the most conservative Muslim societies directly refute this assessment : 73 % of Saudis , 89 % of Iranians and 94 % of Indonesians say that men and women should have equal legal rights .
Majorities of Muslim men and women in dozens of countries around the world also believe that a woman should have the right to work outside the home at any job for which she is qualified ( 88 % in Indonesia , 72 % in Egypt and even 78 % in Saudi Arabia ) , and to vote without interference from family members ( 87 % in Indonesia , 91 % in Egypt , 98 % in Lebanon ) .
What about Muslim sympathy for terrorism ?
Many charge that Islam encourages violence more than other faiths , but studies show that Muslims around the world are at least as likely as Americans to condemn attacks on civilians .
Polls show that 6 % of the American public thinks attacks in which civilians are targets are “ completely justified . ”
In Saudi Arabia , this figure is 4 % .
In Lebanon and Iran , it ’s 2 % .
Moreover , it ’s politics , not piety , that drives the small minority -- just 7 % -- of Muslims to anti-Americanism at the level of condoning the attacks of 9/11 .
Looking across majority - Muslim countries , Gallup found no statistical difference in self - reported religiosity between those who sympathized with the attackers and those who did not .
When respondents in select countries were asked in an open - ended question to explain their views of 9/11 , those who condemned it cited humanitarian as well as religious reasons .
For example , 20 % of Kuwaitis who called the attacks “ completely unjustified ” explained this position by saying that terrorism was against the teachings of Islam .
A respondent in Indonesia went so far as to quote a direct verse from the Koran prohibiting killing innocents .
On the other hand , not a single respondent who condoned the attacks used the Koran as justification .
Instead , they relied on political rationalizations , calling the U.S. an imperialist power or accusing it of wanting to control the world .
If most Muslims truly reject terrorism , why does it continue to flourish in Muslim lands ?
What these results indicate is that terrorism is much like other violent crime .
Violent crimes occur throughout U.S. cities , but that is no indication of Americans ’ general acceptance of murder or assault .
Likewise , continued terrorist violence is not proof that Muslims tolerate it .
Indeed , they are its primary victims .
Still , the typical American cannot be blamed for these misperceptions .
Media - content analyses show that the majority of U.S. TV news coverage of Islam is sharply negative .
Americans are bombarded every day with news stories about Muslims and majority - Muslim countries in which vocal extremists , not evidence , drive perceptions .
Rather than allow extremists on either side to dictate how we discuss Islam and the West , we need to listen carefully to the voices of ordinary people .
Our victory in the war on terrorism depends on it .

A few days ago I sent an email to Chad Dickerson , who I ’ve met at Yahoo ! and had a chance to hang out with at Mashup Camp in Dublin .
Chad , From what I can tell , if you create a Pipe and add additional fields ( Shortcuts , Term Extraction ) , the only way to get to them in an API - like way is to use the JSON renderer .
The RSS renderer removes those extra fields to follow the RSS spec .
PHP supports JSON decoding , but you need a PEAR library or a quite recent version of PHP .
If Yahoo supported serialized php with Pipes like you do with the other common API ’s , it would be a lot easier for folks on shared hosting to work with Pipe data on the server side .
I imagine with the new badge stuff you released that there ’s a push to keep things client side , but there ’s a huge advantage to rendering server - side to keep things nice and spiderable .
Short Version : Expose Pipe results as serialized PHP .
Pretty please .
Chad sends this along to the Pipes team , and less than three days later :
Pipes Blog » Blog Archive » New Yahoo Pipes PHP serialized output renderer
kick .
ass .
Two points to be made : first , I ’m damn impressed that one of the largest sites on the ‘ net would roll a feature request from an outside developer in less than three days .
Second , developers should never resist the urge to ask for help from an API provider .
If a company is taking the time to support an API , chances are very good that they will listen to developers and react .
I can personally say I ’ve gotten immediate results from Technorati , Dapper , and now Yahoo !.
So blow off the idea that a big website would never listen to little ol ’ developer you .
With that negative attitude it ’s guaranteed you ’ll never get it .
Ask , believe , receive , right ?
So props to Chad , Jonathan Trevor , Paul Donnelly , and the rest of the Pipes team !
The Details
I ’m a big fan of Yahoo Pipes .
It ’s an incredibly useful tool for putting together quick aggregators and filters for mashups .
To integrate a Pipe on a webpage , you have a few options .
You can go the cut and paste route and use a Badge , which works client side , or you roll your own code to integrate a pipe .
After you run a Pipe , you ’re given a list of output formats .
Copy the link location of these to get the URL of the output and tweak the parameters .
Until yesterday , the output formats useful for mashups were JSON and RSS .
JSON is great for client side mashups , but as you know , search engines will not index client side content , so you lose any SEO love you might get .
RSS is easy to consume server side , but Pipes will normalize the output to conform to the RSS spec .
That means if you ’re using term extraction or Shortcuts or any other meta data to your pipe , you ’ll lose it with RSS ouput unless you put that data into one of the RSS fields ( title , description , etc. ) .
So that leaves us with hacking JSON on the server side .
The JSON output format retains all that sweet metadata .
In PHP , the best options are a JSON PEAR module or , if you ’re rocking 5.2 and above , you have the handy json_decode ( ) function .
Now that Yahoo supports serialized PHP , using Pipe output just got a lot easier .
I made a Pipe to add Term Extraction info from any RSS feed .
Basically what we ’re doing is automatically tagging all the posts in the feed and to retrieve the tags in your own script , all it takes is :
<?
$ pipeURL = ‘ http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Zli1l6UB3RG_l7ZvX0sBXw&_render=php&rssurl=‘;
$ feedURL = ‘ http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories‘;
$ tags = array ( ) ;
$ response = unserialize ( file_get_contents ($pipeURL.rawurlencode($feedURL ) ) ) ;
foreach ( $ response [ ‘ value ’ ] [ ‘ items ’ ] as $ item ) {
foreach ( $ item [ ‘ tags ’ ] as $ itemTags ) {
$ tags [ ] = $ itemTags [ ‘ content ’ ] ;
}
}
var_dump ( $tags ) ;
At this point $ tags is and array of all of the terms from the feed .
Now what could be done with that data ?
Serialized PHP or JSON ?
If you have json_decode ( ) available in your PHP install , is there any advantage to using JSON over serialized PHP ?
Let ’s find out .
File Size
Saving the output directly to disk gave me
JSON – 51192 bytes
Serialized PHP – 56885 bytes
Because of syntax and PHP ’s type specification , serialized PHP is about 11 % larger than JSON .
This ratio will increase as the number of elements in your output increases .
Decoding Speed
How long does it take to slurp these formats into PHP variables ?
My tests decode each 100 times .
JSON
real 0m0.269s
user 0m0.264s
sys 0m0.004s
Serialized PHP
real 0m0.088s
user 0m0.088s
sys 0m0.000s
It ’s clear that unwinding serialized PHP is faster than JSON , so it ’s a better choice performance - wise despite being slightly bigger over the wire .
5 Big Changes in the Insurance Industry Thanks to Advanced Insurance Analytics
Every time you sign up a new client for insurance , your bottom line gets bigger .
But so does your data collection .
The truth is , large amounts of an insurance company ’s data today are kept in siloed computer systems .
That means underwriters have a hard time communicating important data to brokers and agents .
On top of this , insurance agents cannot share this information across multiple offices very easily .
The good news ?
As an insurance industry player , you ’re in the middle of a massive data analytics–fueled revolution .
And thanks to advances in insurance analytics software , more and more insurance companies are using data analytics .
Here ’s a rundown on five ways analytics has changed the industry .
Let ’s get started !
1. Insurance Analytics Can Support Increased Client Focus
The insurance industry is increasingly focused on being more customer centered .
That means insurance brokers are trying harder to help clients to get the types of insurance they truly need .
Fortunately , data analytics has the potential to fulfill this role .
Today ’s intelligent management platforms in the insurance industry are making it easier for agents to gain actionable insights from customer data .
For instance , if clients develop gaps in their coverage , your insurance company will be alerted .
As a result , you can help these clients to get the coverage they need .
This beats cold - calling other clients who may not need certain types of coverage right now .
2. Better Pricing
With data analytics , insurance companies can also extract helpful information for tracking individual policyholders ’ behaviors and then price their policies accordingly .
For instance , after your insurance company tracks a policyholder ’s driving habits over time , you can reprice their policy premiums so that this policyholder will pay a just premium for insurance coverage .
3. Fraud Prevention
Fraudulent claims are on the rise .
But data analytics can help to put an end to this by showing you who could commit fraud before they ever do .
As an example , agents can monitor real - time data from social media , with the help of data analytics , to determine if policyholders might be taking part in fraud .
After all , some policyholders may file claims for problems at their homes , while their Facebook photos paint completely different stories .
4. Self - Service
Another major benefit of insurance analytics software is that it allows insurance customers to manage their own insurance policies .
This means that insurers can eliminate the underwriting process traditionally used in the medical insurance space , for example .
In the end , data analytics can make underwriting more streamlined and thus lead to quicker policy issue times .
5. Internal Processes
Finally , data analytics is enabling insurance companies to accurately pinpoint which insurance lines were the most profitable during a set period of time .
This is golden , as insurance companies can use this information to tweak their sales practices and eliminate wasted time with their policyholders .
All of this can improve their profits in the end .
How We Can Help
In addition to highlighting the benefits of insurance analytics , we offer the latest information about other types of software on the market today .
For instance , we highlight the top team collaboration software around , as well as the leading top payroll system software .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Nearly 900 scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency have experienced political interference in their work in the last five years , the Union of Concerned Scientists reported on Wednesday .
The White House is pictured in Washington , early January 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
The nonprofit environmental organization said its investigation of EPA was in line with previous probes of other U.S. agencies which found “ significant administration manipulation of federal science . ”
A government spokesman denied this , and said scientific findings were balanced with policy concerns .
“ Our investigation found an agency in crisis , ” said Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists , referring to the Environmental Protection Agency .
“ Distorting science to accommodate a narrow political agenda threatens our environment , our health and our democracy itself . ”
The report included interviews with current and former staff members , analysis of government documents and a questionnaire sent to 5,419 EPA scientists , which generated 1,586 responses .
Of those responses , 889 scientists or 60 percent , said they had personally experienced at least one instance of political interference in the last five years ; 394 said they experienced frequent or occasional “ statements by EPA officials that misrepresent scientists ’ findings . ”
More than one - fifth , or 285 , said they had experienced “ selective or incomplete use of data to justify a specific regulatory outcome , ” the report said .
Nearly 100 scientists said the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) was the main offender .
“ OMB and the White House have , in some cases , compromised the integrity of EPA rules and policies ; their influence , largely hidden from the public and driven by industry lobbying , has decreased the stringency of proposed regulations for nonscientific , political reasons , ” one scientist wrote in response to the investigation .
A spokesman for EPA , Jonathan Shradar , denied these allegations .
“ Certainly OMB plays a policy role , ” Shradar said by telephone .
“ It ’s important that there is inter-agency cooperation .
There ’s not interference against the scientific work that they ’re doing , that ’s still highly respected and taken into account . ”
U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman , a California Democrat who chairs the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , called on EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to respond to questions about the report at a committee hearing in May .
The EPA has come under fire recently for its standard for ground - level ozone , which critics claim is too high .
The agency is also in a court fight with 18 U.S. states over its failure to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks , more than a year after the Supreme Court ruled EPA had the power to do so .
Low doses of hydrogen sulfide , the toxic gas responsible for the unpleasant odor of rotten eggs , can safely and reversibly induce ' suspended animation ' , in mice , say Massachusetts General Hospital reseachers .
They report that effects seen in earlier studies do not depend on a reduction in body temperature and include a substantial decrease in heart rate without a drop in blood pressure .
“ Hydrogen sulfide is the stinky gas that can kill workers who encounter it in sewers ; but when adminstered to mice in small , controlled doses , within minutes it produces what appears to be totally reversible metabolic suppression , ” says Warren Zapol , MD , chief of Anesthesia and Critical Care at MGH and senior author of the Anesthesiology study .
“ This is as close to instant suspended animation as you can get , and the preservation of cardiac contraction , blood pressure and organ perfusion is remarkable . ”
Previous investigations into the effects of low - dose hydrogen sulfide showed that the gas could lower body temperature and metabolic rate and also improved survival of mice whose oxygen supply had been restricted .
But since hypothermia itself cuts metabolic needs , it was unclear whether the reduced body temperature was responsible for the other observed effects .
The current study was designed to investigate both that question and the effects of hydrogen sulfide inhalation on the cardiovascular system .
The researchers measured factors such as heart rate , blood pressure , body temperature , respiration and physical activity in normal mice exposed to low - dose ( 80 ppm ) hydrogen sulfide for several hours .
They analyzed cardiac function with electrocardiograms and echocardiography and measured blood gas levels .
While some mice were studied at room temperature , others were kept in a warm environment – about 98 º
F – to prevent their body temperatures from dropping .
In all the mice , metabolic measurements such as consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide dropped in as little as 10 minutes after they began inhaling hydrogen sulfide , remained low as long as the gas was administered , and returned to normal within 30 minutes of the resumption of a normal air supply .
The animals ’ heart rate dropped nearly 50 percent during hydrogen sulfide adminstration , but there was no significant change in blood pressure or the strength of the heart beat .
While respiration rate also decreased , there were no changes in blood oxygen levels , suggesting that vital organs were not at risk of oxygen starvation .
The mice kept at room temperature had the same drop in body temperature seen in earlier studies , but those in the warm environment maintained normal body temperatures .
The same metabolic and cardiovascular changes were seen in both groups , indicating that they did not depend on the reduced body temperature , and analyzing the timing of those changes showed that metabolic reduction actually began before body temperature dropped .
“ Producing a reversible hypometabolic state could allow organ function to be preserved when oxygen supply is limited , such as after a traumatic injury , ” says Gian Paolo Volpato , MD , MGH Anesthesiology research fellow and lead author of the study .
“ We do n’t know yet if these results will be transferable to humans , so our next step will be to study the use of hydrogen sulfide in larger mammals . ”
Zapol adds ,
“ It could be that inhaled hydrogen sulfide will only be useful in small animals and we ’ll need to use intravenous drugs that can deliver hydrogen sulfide to vital organs to prevent lung toxicity in larger animals . ”
Zapol is the Reginald Jenney Professor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School .
The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and Linde Gas Therapeutics .

Terror and Just Response
Noam Chomsky
ZNet , July 2 , 2002
September 11 will surely go down in the annals of terrorism as a defining moment .
Throughout the world , the atrocities were condemned as grave crimes against humanity , with near - universal agreement that all states must act to “ rid the world of evildoers , ” that “ the evil scourge of terrorism ” — particularly state - backed international terrorism — is a plague spread by “ depraved opponents of civilization itself ” in a “ return to barbarism ” that can not be tolerated .
But beyond the strong support for the words of the US political leadership — respectively , George W. Bush , Ronald Reagan , and his Secretary of State George Shultz [ 1 ] — interpretations varied : on the narrow question of the proper response to terrorist crimes , and on the broader problem of determining their nature .
On the latter , an official US definition takes “ terrorism ” to be “ the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political , religious , or ideological in nature … through intimidation , coercion , or instilling fear . ” [ 2 ]
That formulation leaves many question open , among them , the legitimacy of actions to realize “ the right to self - determination , freedom , and independence , as derived from the Charter of the United Nations , of people forcibly deprived of that right … , particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation … ”
In its most forceful denunciation of the crime of terrorism , the UN General Assembly endorsed such actions , 153 - 2 . [ 3 ]
Explaining their negative votes , the US and Israel referred to the wording just cited .
It was understood to justify resistance against the South African regime , a US ally that was responsible for over 1.5 million dead and $ 60 billion in damage in neighboring countries in 1980 - 88 alone , putting aside its practices within .
And the resistance was led by Nelson Mandela ’s African National Congress , one of the “ more notorious terrorist groups ” according to a 1988 Pentagon report , in contrast to pro-South African RENAMO , which the same report describes as merely an “ indigenous insurgent group ” while observing that it might have killed 100,000 civilians in Mozambique in the preceding two years .
[ 4 ]
The same wording was taken to justify resistance to Israel ’s military occupation , then in its 20th year , continuing its integration of the occupied territories and harsh practices with decisive US aid and diplomatic support , the latter to block the longstanding international consensus on a peaceful settlement . [ 5 ]
Despite such fundamental disagreements , the official US definition seems to me adequate for the purposes at hand , [ 6 ] though the disagreements shed some light on the nature of terrorism , as perceived from various perspectives .
Let us turn to the question of proper response .
Some argue that the evil of terrorism is “ absolute ” and merits a “ reciprocally absolute doctrine ” in response . [ 7 ]
That would appear to mean ferocious military assault in accord with the Bush doctrine , cited with apparent approval in the same academic collection on the “ age of terror ” : “ _If you harbor terrorists , you ’re a terrorist ; if you aid and abet terrorists , you ’re a terrorist — and you will be treated like one_ . ”
The volume reflects articulate opinion in the West in taking the US - UK response to be appropriate and properly “ calibrated , ” but the scope of that consensus appears to be limited , judging by the evidence available , to which we return .
More generally , it would be hard to find anyone who accepts the doctrine that massive bombing is the appropriate response to terrorist crimes — whether those of Sept. 11 , or even worse ones , which are , unfortunately , not hard to find .
That follows if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right ( or wrong ) for others , it is right ( or wrong ) for us .
Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others — more stringent ones , in fact — plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response ; or of right and wrong , good and evil .
To illustrate what is at stake , consider a case that is far from the most extreme but is uncontroversial ; at least , among those with some respect for international law and treaty obligations .
No one would have supported Nicaraguan bombings in Washington when the US rejected the order of the World Court to terminate its “ unlawful use of force ” and pay substantial reparations , choosing instead to escalate the international terrorist crimes and to extend them , officially , to attacks on undefended civilian targets , also vetoing a Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe international law and voting alone at the General Assembly ( with one or two client states ) against similar resolutions .
The US dismissed the ICJ on the grounds that other nations do not agree with us , so we must “ reserve to ourselves the power to determine whether the Court has jurisdiction over us in a particular case ” and what lies “ essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States ” — in this case , terrorist attacks against Nicaragua . [ 8 ]
Meanwhile Washington continued to undermine regional efforts to reach a political settlement , following the doctrine formulated by the Administration moderate , George Shultz : the US must “ cut [ the Nicaraguan cancer ] out , ” by force .
Shultz dismissed with contempt those who advocate “ utopian , legalistic means like outside mediation , the United Nations , and the World Court , while ignoring the power element of the equation ” ; ” Negotiations are a euphemism for capitulation if the shadow of power is not cast across the bargaining table , ” he declared .
Washington continued to adhere to the Shultz doctrine when the Central American Presidents agreed on a peace plan in 1987 over strong US objections : the Esquipulas Accords , which required that all countries of the region move towards democracy and human rights under international supervision , stressing that the “ indispensable element ” was the termination of the US attack against Nicaragua .
Washington responded by sharply expanding the attack , tripling CIA supply flights for the terrorist forces .
Having exempted itself from the Accords , thus effectively undermining them , Washington proceeded to do the same for its client regimes , using the substance — not the shadow — of power to dismantle the International Verification Commission ( CIVS ) because its conclusions were unacceptable , and demanding , successfully , that the Accords be revised to free US client states to continue their terrorist atrocities .
These far surpassed even the devastating US war against Nicaragua that left tens of thousands dead and the country ruined perhaps beyond recovery .
Still upholding the Shultz doctrine , the US compelled the government of Nicaragua , under severe threat , to drop the claim for reparations established by the ICJ . [ 9 ]
There could hardly be a clearer example of international terrorism as defined officially , or in scholarship : operations aimed at “ demonstrating through apparently indiscriminate violence that the existing regime cannot protect the people nominally under its authority , ” thus causing not only “ anxiety , but withdrawal from the relationships making up the established order of society . ” [ 10 ]
State terror elsewhere in Central America in those years also counts as international terrorism , in the light of the decisive US role , and the goals , sometimes frankly articulated ; for example , by the Army ’s School of the Americas , which trains Latin American military officers and takes pride in the fact that “ Liberation Theology …was defeated with the assistance of the U.S. Army . ” [ 11 ]
It would seem to follow , clearly enough , that only those who support bombing of Washington in response to these international terrorist crimes — that is , no one — can accept the “ reciprocally absolute doctrine ” on response to terrorist atrocities or consider massive bombardment to be an appropriate and properly “ calibrated ” response to them .
Consider some of the legal arguments that have been presented to justify the US - UK bombing of Afghanistan ; I am not concerned here with their soundness , but their implications , if the principle of uniform standards is maintained .
Christopher Greenwood argues that the US has the right of “ self - defense ” against “ those who caused or threatened … death and destruction , ” appealing to the ICJ ruling in the Nicaragua case .
The paragraph he cites applies far more clearly to the US war against Nicaragua than to the Taliban or al - Qaeda , so if it is taken to justify intensive US bombardment and ground attack in Afghanistan , then Nicaragua should have been entitled to carry out much more severe attacks against the US .
Another distinguished professor of international law , Thomas Franck , supports the US - UK war on grounds that “ a state is responsible for the consequences of permitting its territory to be used to injure another state ” ; fair enough , and surely applicable to the US in the case of Nicaragua , Cuba , and many other examples , including some of extreme severity . [ 12 ]
Needless to say , in none of these cases would violence in “ self - defense ” against continuing acts of “ death and destruction ” be considered remotely tolerable ; acts , not merely “ threats . ”
The same holds of more nuanced proposals about an appropriate response to terrorist atrocities .
Military historian Michael Howard proposes “ a police operation conducted under the auspices of the United Nations … against a criminal conspiracy whose members should be hunted down and brought before an international court , where they would receive a fair trial and , if found guilty , be awarded an appropriate sentence . ”
Reasonable enough , though the idea that the proposal should be applied universally is unthinkable .
The director of the Center for the Politics of Human Rights at Harvard argues that “ The only responsible response to acts of terror is honest police work and judicial prosecution in courts of law , linked to determinate , focused and unrelenting use of military power against those who cannot or will not be brought to justice . ” [ 13 ]
That too seems sensible , if we add Howard ’s qualification about international supervision , and if the resort to force is undertaken after legal means have been exhausted .
The recommendation therefore does not apply to 9 - 11 ( the US refused to provide evidence and rebuffed tentative proposals about transfer of the suspects ) , but it does apply very clearly to Nicaragua .
It applies to other cases as well .
Take Haiti , which has provided ample evidence in its repeated calls for extradition of Emmanuel Constant , who directed the forces responsible for thousands of deaths under the military junta that the US was tacitly supporting ( not to speak of earlier history ) ; these requests the US ignores , presumably because of concerns about what Constant would reveal if tried .
The most recent request was on 30 September 2001 , while the US was demanding that the Taliban hand over Bin Laden . [ 14 ]
The coincidence was also ignored , in accord with the convention that minimal moral standards must be vigorously rejected .
Turning to the “ responsible response , ” a call for implementation of it where it is clearly applicable would elicit only fury and contempt .
Some have formulated more general principles to justify the US war in Afghanistan .
Two Oxford scholars propose a principle of “ proportionality ” : “ The magnitude of response will be determined by the magnitude with which the aggression interfered with key values in the society attacked ” ; in the US case , “ freedom to pursue self - betterment in a plural society through market economics , ” viciously attacked on 9 - 11 by “ aggressors … with a moral orthodoxy divergent from the West . ”
Since “ Afghanistan constitutes a state that sided with the aggressor , ” and refused US demands to turn over suspects , “ the United States and its allies , according to the principle of magnitude of interference , could justifiably and morally resort to force against the Taliban government . ” [ 15 ]
On the assumption of universality , it follows that Haiti and Nicaragua can “ justifiably and morally resort to ” far greater force against the US government .
The conclusion extends far beyond these two cases , including much more serious ones and even such minor escapades of Western state terror as Clinton ’s bombing of the al - Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in 1998 , leading to “ several tens of thousands ” of deaths according to the German Ambassador and other reputable sources , whose conclusions are consistent with the immediate assessments of knowledgeable observers . [ 16 ]
The principle of proportionality therefore entails that Sudan had every right to carry out massive terror in retaliation , a conclusion that is strengthened if we go on to adopt the view that this act of “ the empire ” had “ appalling consequences for the economy and society ” of Sudan so that the atrocity was much worse than the crimes of 9 - 11 , which were appalling enough , but did not have such consequences . [ 17 ]
Most commentary on the Sudan bombing keeps to the question of whether the plant was believed to produce chemical weapons ; true or false , that has no bearing on “ the magnitude with which the aggression interfered with key values in the society attacked , ” such as survival .
Others point out that the killings were unintended , as are many of the atrocities we rightly denounce .
In this case , we can hardly doubt that the likely human consequences were understood by US planners .
The acts can be excused , then , only on the Hegelian assumption that Africans are “ mere things , ” whose lives have “ no value , ” an attitude that accords with practice in ways that are not overlooked among the victims , who may draw their own conclusions about the “ moral orthodoxy of the West . ”
One participant in the Yale volume ( Charles Hill ) recognized that 11 September opened the _second_ “ war on terror . ”
The first was declared by the Reagan administration as it came to office 20 years earlier , with the rhetorical accompaniment already illustrated ; and “ we won , ” Hill reports triumphantly , though the terrorist monster was only wounded , not slain . [ 18 ]
The first “ age of terror ” proved to be a major issue in international affairs through the decade , particularly in Central America , but also in the Middle East , where terrorism was selected by editors as the lead story of the year in 1985 and ranked high in other years .
We can learn a good deal about the current war on terror by inquiring into the first phase , and how it is now portrayed .
One leading academic specialist describes the 1980s as the decade of “ state terrorism , ” of “ persistent state involvement , or `sponsorship , ’ of terrorism , especially by Libya and Iran . ”
The US merely responded , by adopting “ a `proactive ’ stance toward terrorism . ”
Others recommend the methods by which “ we won ” : the operations for which the US was condemned by the World Court and Security Council ( absent the veto ) are a model for “ Nicaragua - like support for the Taliban ’s adversaries ( especially the Northern Alliance ) . ”
A prominent historian of the subject finds deep roots for the terrorism of Osama Bin Laden : in South Vietnam , where “ the effectiveness of Vietcong terror against the American Goliath armed with modern technology kindled hopes that the Western heartland was vulnerable too . ” [ 19 ]
Keeping to convention , these analyses portray the US as a benign victim , defending itself from the terror of others : the Vietnamese ( in South Vietnam ) , the Nicaraguans ( in Nicaragua ) , Libyans and Iranians ( if they had ever suffered a slight at US hands , it passes unnoticed ) , and other anti-American forces worldwide .
Not everyone sees the world quite that way .
The most obvious place to look is Latin America , which has had considerable experience with international terrorism .
The crimes of 9 - 11 were harshly condemned , but commonly with recollection of their own experiences .
One might describe the 9 - 11 atrocities as “ Armageddon , ” the research journal of the Jesuit university in Managua observed , but Nicaragua has “ lived its own Armageddon in excruciating slow motion ” under US assault “ and is now submerged in its dismal aftermath , ” and others fared far worse under the vast plague of state terror that swept through the continent from the early 1960s , much of it traceable to Washington .
A Panamanian journalist joined in the general condemnation of the 9 - 11 crimes , but recalled the death of perhaps thousands of poor people ( Western crimes , therefore unexamined ) when the President ’s father bombed the barrio Chorillo in December 1989 in Operation Just Cause , undertaken to kidnap a disobedient thug who was sentenced to life imprisonment in Florida for crimes mostly committed while he was on the CIA payroll .
Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed that the US claims to oppose terrorism , but actually supports it worldwide , including “ in Indonesia , in Cambodia , in Iran , in South Africa , …and in the Latin American countries that lived through the dirty war of the Condor Plan , ” instituted by South American military dictators who conducted a reign of terror with US backing . [ 20 ]
The observations carry over to the second focus of the first “ war on terror ” : West Asia .
The worst single atrocity was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 , which left some 20,000 people dead and much of the country in ruins , including Beirut .
Like the murderous and destructive Rabin - Peres invasions of 1993 and 1996 , the 1982 attack had little pretense of self - defense .
Chief of Staff Rafael ( “ Raful ” ) Eitan merely articulated common understanding when he announced that the goal was to “ destroy the PLO as a candidate for negotiations with us about the Land of Israel , ” [ 21 ] a textbook illustration of terror as officially defined .
The goal “ was to install a friendly regime and destroy Mr. Arafat ’s Palestinian Liberation Organization , ” Middle East correspondent James Bennet writes : “ That , the theory went , would help persuade Palestinians to accept Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . ” [ 22 ]
This may be the first recognition in the mainstream of facts widely reported in Israel at once , previously accessible only in dissident literature in the US .
These operations were carried out with the crucial military and diplomatic support of the Reagan and Clinton administrations , and therefore constitute international terrorism .
The US was also directly involved in other acts of terror in the region in the 1980s , including the most extreme terrorist atrocities of the peak year of 1985 : the CIA car - bombing in Beirut that killed 80 people and wounded 250 ; Shimon Peres ’s bombing of Tunis that killed 75 people , expedited by the US and praised by Secretary of State Shultz , unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council as an “ act of armed aggression ” ( US abstaining ) ; and Peres ’s “ Iron Fist ” operations directed against “ terrorist villagers ” in Lebanon , reaching new depths of “ calculated brutality and arbitrary murder , ” in the words of a Western diplomat familiar with the area , amply supported by direct coverage . [ 23 ]
Again , all international terrorism , if not the more severe war crime of aggression .
In journalism and scholarship on terrorism , 1985 is recognized to be the peak year of Middle East terrorism , but not because of these events : rather , because of two terrorist atrocities in which a single person was murdered , in each case an American . [ 24 ]
But the victims do not so easily forget .
This very recent history takes on added significance because leading figures in the re-declared “ war on terror ” played a prominent part in its precursor .
The diplomatic component of the current phase is led by John Negroponte , who was Reagan ’s Ambassador to Honduras , the base for the terrorist atrocities for which his government was condemned by the World Court and for US - backed state terror elsewhere in Central America , activities that “ made the Reagan years the worse decade for Central America since the Spanish conquest , ” mostly on Negroponte ’s watch . [ 25 ]
The military component of the new phase is led by Donald Rumsfeld , Reagan ’s special envoy to the Middle East during the years of the worst terrorist atrocities there , initiated or supported by his government .
No less instructive is the fact that such atrocities did not abate in subsequent years .
Specifically , Washington ’s contribution to “ enhancing terror ” in the Israel - Arab confrontation continues .
The term is President Bush ’s , intended , according to convention , to apply to the terrorism of others .
Departing from convention , we find , again , some rather significant examples .
One simple way to enhance terror is to participate in it , for example , by sending helicopters to be used to attack civilian complexes and carry out assassinations , as the US regularly does in full awareness of the consequences .
Another is to bar the dispatch of international monitors to reduce violence .
The US has insisted on this course , once again vetoing a UN Security Council resolution to this effect on 14 December 2001 .
Describing Arafat ’s fall from grace to a position barely above Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein , the press reports that President Bush was “ greatly angered [ by ] a last - minute hardening of a Palestinian position … for international monitors in Palestinian areas under a UN Security Council resolution ” ; that is , by Arafat ’s joining the rest of the world in calling for means to reduce terror . [ 26 ]
Ten days before the veto of monitors , the US boycotted — thus undermined — an international conference in Geneva that reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the occupied terrorities , so that most US - Israeli actions there are war crimes — and when “ grave breaches , ” as many are , serious war crimes .
These include US - funded Israeli settlements and the practice of “ wilful killing , torture , unlawful deportation , wilful depriving of the rights of fair and regular trial , extensive destruction and appropriation of property … carried out unlawfully and wantonly . ” [ 27 ]
The Convention , instituted to criminalize formally the crimes of the Nazis in occupied Europe , is a core principle of international humanitarian law .
Its applicability to the Israeli - occupied territories has repeatedly been affirmed , among other occasions , by UN Ambassador George Bush ( September 1971 ) and by Security Council resolutions : 465 ( 1980 ) , adopted unanimously , which condemned US - backed Israeli practices as “ flagrant violations ” of the Convention ; 1322 ( Oct. 2000 ) , 14-0 , US abstaining , which called on Israel “ to abide scrupulously by its responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention , ” which it was again violating flagrantly at that moment .
As High Contracting Parties , the US and the European powers are obligated by solemn treaty to apprehend and prosecute those responsible for such crimes , including their own leadership when they are parties to them .
By continuing to reject that duty , they are enhancing terror directly and significantly .
Inquiry into the US - Israel - Arab conflicts would carry us too far afield .
Let ’s turn further north , to another region where “ state terror ” is being practiced on a massive scale ; I borrow the term from the Turkish State Minister for Human Rights , referring to the vast atrocities of 1994 ; and sociologist Ismail Besikci , returned to prison after publishing his book _ State Terror in the Near East_ , having already served 15 years for recording Turkish repression of Kurds . [ 28 ]
I had a chance to see some of the consequences first - hand when visiting the unofficial Kurdish capital of Diyarbakir several months after 9 - 11 .
As elsewhere , the crimes of September 11 were harshly condemned , but not without memory of the savage assault the population had suffered at the hands of those who appoint themselves to “ rid the world of evildoers , ” and their local agents .
By 1994 , the Turkish State Minister and others estimated that 2 million had been driven out of the devastated countryside , many more later , often with barbaric torture and terror described in excruciating detail in international human rights reports , but kept from the eyes of those paying the bills .
Tens of thousands were killed .
The remnants — whose courage is indescribable — live in a dungeon where radio stations are closed and journalists imprisoned for playing Kurdish music , students are arrested and tortured for submitting requests to take elective courses in their own language , there can be severe penalties if children are found wearing Kurdish national colors by the omnipresent security forces , the respected lawyer who heads the human rights organization was indicted shortly after I was there for using the Kurdish rather than the virtually identical Turkish spelling for the New Year ’s celebration ; and on , and on .
These acts fall under the category of state - sponsored international terrorism .
The US provided 80 % of the arms , peaking in 1997 , when arms transfers exceeded the entire Cold War period combined before the “ counter - terror ” campaign began in 1984 .
Turkey became the leading recipient of US arms worldwide , a position it retained until 1999 when the torch was passed to Colombia , the leading practitioner of state terror in the Western hemisphere . [ 29 ]
State terror is also “ enhanced ” by silence and evasion .
The achievement was particularly notable against the background of an unprecedented chorus of self - congratulation as US foreign policy entered a “ noble phase ” with a “ saintly glow , ” under the guidance of leaders who for the first time in history were dedicated to “ principles and values ” rather than narrow interests . [ 30 ]
The proof of the new saintliness was their unwillingness to tolerate crimes near the borders of NATO — only within its borders , where even worse crimes , not in reaction to NATO bombs , were not only tolerable but required enthusiastic participation , without comment .
US - sponsored Turkish state terror does not pass entirely unnoticed .
The State Department ’s annual report on Washington ’s “ efforts to combat terrorism ” singled out Turkey for its “ positive experiences ” in combating terror , along with Algeria and Spain , worthy colleagues .
This was reported without comment in a front - page story in the _New York Times_ by its specialist on terrorism .
In a leading journal of international affairs , Ambassador Robert Pearson reports that the US “ could have no better friend and ally than Turkey ” in its efforts “ to eliminate terrorism ” worldwide , thanks to the “ capabilities of its armed forces ” demonstrated in its “ anti- terror campaign ” in the Kurdish southeast .
It thus “ came as no surprise ” that Turkey eagerly joined the “ war on terror ” declared by George Bush , expressing its thanks to the US for being the only country willing to lend the needed support for the atrocities of the Clinton years — still continuing , though on a lesser scale now that “ we won . ”
As a reward for its achievements , the US is now funding Turkey to provide the ground forces for fighting “ the war on terror ” in Kabul , though not beyond . [ 31 ]
Atrocious state - sponsored international terrorism is thus not overlooked : it is lauded .
That also “ comes as no surprise . ”
After all , in 1995 the Clinton administration welcomed Indonesia ’s General Suharto , one of the worst killers and torturers of the late 20th century , as “ our kind of guy . ”
When he came to power 30 years earlier , the “ staggering mass slaughter ” of hundreds of thousands of people , mostly landless peasants , was reported fairly accurately and acclaimed with unconstrained euphoria .
When Nicaraguans finally succumbed to US terror and voted the right way , the US was “ United in Joy ” at this “ Victory for US Fair Play , ” headlines proclaimed .
It is easy enough to multiply examples .
The current episode breaks no new ground in the record of international terrorism and the response it elicits among the perpetrators .
Let ’s return to the question of the proper response to acts of terror , specifically 9 - 11 .
It is commonly alleged that the US - UK reaction was undertaken with wide international support .
That is tenable , however , only if one keeps to elite opinion .
An international Gallup poll found only minority support for military attack rather than diplomatic means . [ 32 ]
In Europe , figures ranged from 8 % in Greece to 29 % in France .
In Latin America , support was even lower : from 2 % in Mexico to 16 % in Panama .
Support for strikes that included civilian targets was very slight .
Even in the two countries polled that strongly supported the use of military force , India and Israel ( where the reasons were parochial ) , considerable majorities opposed such attacks .
There was , then , overwhelming opposition to the actual policies , which turned major urban concentrations into “ ghost towns ” from the first moment , the press reported .
Omitted from the poll , as from most commentary , was the anticipated effect of US policy on Afghans , millions of whom were on the brink of starvation even before 9 - 11 .
Unasked , for example , is whether a proper response to 9 - 11 was to demand that Pakistan eliminate “ truck convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to Afghanistan ’s civilian population , ” and to cause the withdrawal of aid workers and a severe reduction in food supplies that left “ millions of Afghans …at grave risk of starvation , ” eliciting sharp protests from aid organizations and warnings of severe humanitarian crisis , judgments reiterated at the war ’s end . [ 33 ]
It is , of course , the assumptions of planning that are relevant to evaluating the actions taken ; that too should be transparent .
The actual outcome , a separate matter , is unlikely to be known , even roughly ; crimes of others are carefully investigated , but not one ’s own .
Some indication is perhaps suggested by the occasional reports on numbers needing food aid : 5 million before 9 - 11 , 7.5 million at the end of September under the threat of bombing , 9 million six months later , not because of lack of food , which was readily available throughout , but because of distribution problems as the country reverted to warlordism . [ 34 ]
There are no reliable studies of Afghan opinion , but information is not entirely lacking .
At the outset , President Bush warned Afghans that they would be bombed until they handed over people the US suspected of terrorism .
Three weeks later , war aims shifted to overthrow of the regime : the bombing would continue , Admiral Sir Michael Boyce announced , “ until the people of the country themselves recognize that this is going to go on until they get the leadership changed . ” [ 35 ]
Note that the question whether overthrow of the miserable Taliban regime justifies the bombing does not arise , because that did not become a war aim until well after the fact .
We can , however , ask about the opinions of Afghans within reach of Western observers about these choices — which , in both cases , clearly fall within the official definition of international terrorism .
As war aims shifted to regime replacement in late October , 1000 Afghan leaders gathered in Peshawar , some exiles , some coming from within Afghanistan , all committed to overthrowing the Taliban regime .
It was “ a rare display of unity among tribal elders , Islamic scholars , fractious politicians , and former guerrilla commanders , ” the press reported .
They unanimously “ urged the US to stop the air raids , ” appealed to the international media to call for an end to the “ bombing of innocent people , ” and “ demanded an end to the US bombing of Afghanistan . ”
They urged that other means be adopted to overthrow the hated Taliban regime , a goal they believed could be achieved without death and destruction . [ 36 ]
A similar message was conveyed by Afghan opposition leader Abdul Haq , who was highly regarded in Washington .
Just before he entered Afghanistan , apparently without US support , and was then captured and killed , he condemned the bombing and criticized the US for refusing to support efforts of his and of others “ to create a revolt within the Taliban . ”
The bombing was “ a big setback for these efforts , ” he said .
He reported contacts with second - level Taliban commanders and ex-Mujahiddin tribal elders , and discussed how such efforts could proceed , calling on the US to assist them with funding and other support instead of undermining them with bombs .
But the US , he said , “ is trying to show its muscle , score a victory and scare everyone in the world .
They do n’t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose . ” [ 37 ]
The plight of Afghan women elicited some belated concern after 9 - 11 .
After the war , there was even some recognition of the courageous women who have been in the forefront of the struggle to defend women ’s rights for 25 years , RAWA ( Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ) .
A week after the bombing began , RAWA issued a public statement ( Oct. 11 ) that would have been front - page news wherever concern for Afghan women was real , not a matter of mere expediency .
They condemned the resort to “ the monster of a vast war and destruction ” as the US “ launched a vast aggression on our country , ” that will cause great harm to innocent Afghans .
They called instead for “ the eradication of the plague of Taliban and Al Qieda ” by “ an overall uprising ” of the Afghan people themselves , which alone “ can prevent the repetition and recurrence of the catastrophe that has befallen our country … . ”
All of this was ignored .
It is , perhaps , less than obvious that those with the guns are entitled to ignore the judgment of Afghans who have been struggling for freedom and women ’s rights for many years , and to dismiss with apparent contempt their desire to overthrow the fragile and hated Taliban regime from within without the inevitable crimes of war .
In brief , review of global opinion , including what is known about Afghans , lends little support to the consensus among Western intellectuals on the justice of their cause .
One elite reaction , however , is certainly correct : it is necessary to inquire into the reasons for the crimes of 9 - 11 .
That much is beyond question , at least among those who hope to reduce the likelihood of further terrorist atrocities .
A narrow question is the motives of the perpetrators .
On this matter , there is little disagreement .
Serious analysts are in accord that after the US established permanent bases in Saudi Arabia , “ Bin Laden became preoccupied with the need to expel U.S. forces from the sacred soil of Arabia ” and to rid the Muslim world of the “ liars and hypocrites ” who do not accept his extremist version of Islam . [ 38 ]
There is also wide , and justified , agreement that “ Unless the social , political , and economic conditions that spawned Al Qaeda and other associated groups are addressed , the United States and its allies in Western Europe and elsewhere will continue to be targeted by Islamist terrorists . ” [ 39 ]
These conditions are doubtless complex , but some factors have long been recognized .
In 1958 , a crucial year in postwar history , President Eisenhower advised his staff that in the Arab world , “ the problem is that we have a campaign of hatred against us , not by the governments but by the people , ” who are “ on Nasser ’s side , ” supporting independent secular nationalism .
The reasons for the “ campaign of hatred ” had been outlined by the National Security Council a few months earlier : “ In the eyes of the majority of Arabs the United States appears to be opposed to the realization of the goals of Arab nationalism .
They believe that the United States is seeking to protect its interest in Near East oil by supporting the _status quo_ and opposing political or economic progress … . ”
Furthermore , the perception is accurate : “ our economic and cultural interests in the area have led not unnaturally to close U.S. relations with elements in the Arab world whose primary interest lies in the maintenance of relations with the West and the status quo in their countries … . ” [ 40 ]
The perceptions persist .
Immediately after 9 - 11 , the _Wall Street Journal_ , later others , began to investigate opinions of “ moneyed Muslims ” : bankers , professionals , managers of multinationals , and so on .
They strongly support US policies in general , but are bitter about the US role in the region : about US support for corrupt and repressive regimes that undermine democracy and development , and about specific policies , particularly regarding Palestine and Iraq .
Though they are not surveyed , attitudes in the slums and villages are probably similar , but harsher ; unlike the “ moneyed Muslims , ” the mass of the population have never agreed that the wealth of the region should be drained to the West and local collaborators , rather than serving domestic needs .
The “ moneyed Muslims ” recognize , ruefully , that Bin Laden ’s angry rhetoric has considerable resonance , in their own circles as well , even though they hate and fear him , if only because they are among his primary targets . [ 41 ]
It is doubtless more comforting to believe that the answer to George Bush ’s plaintive query , “ Why do they hate us ? , ” lies in their resentment of our freedom and love of democracy , or their cultural failings tracing back many centuries , or their inability to take part in the form of “ globalization ” in which they happily participate .
Comforting , perhaps , but not wise .
Though shocking , the atrocities of 9 - 11 could not have been entirely unexpected .
Related organizations planned very serious terrorist acts through the 1990s , and in 1993 came perilously close to blowing up the World Trade Center , with much more ambitious plans .
Their thinking was well understood , certainly by the US intelligence agencies that had helped to recruit , train , and arm them from 1980 and continued to work with them even as they were attacking the US .
The Dutch government inquiry into the Srebrenica massacre revealed that while they were attempting to blow up the World Trade Center , radical Islamists from the CIA - formed networks were being flown by the US from Afghanistan to Bosnia , along with Iranian - backed Hizbollah fighters and a huge flow of arms , through Croatia , which took a substantial cut .
They were being brought to support the US side in the Balkan wars , while Israel ( along with Ukraine and Greece ) was arming the Serbs ( possibly with US - supplied arms ) , which explains why “ unexploded mortar bombs landing in Sarajevo sometimes had Hebrew markings , ” British political scientist Richard Aldrich observes , reviewing the Dutch government report . [ 42 ]
More generally , the atrocities of 9 - 11 serve as a dramatic reminder of what has long been understood : with contemporary technology , the rich and powerful no longer are assured the near monopoly of violence that has largely prevailed throughout history .
Though terrorism is rightly feared everywhere , and is indeed an intolerable “ return to barbarism , ” it is not surprising that perceptions about its nature differ rather sharply in the light of sharply differing experiences , facts that will be ignored at their peril by those whom history has accustomed to immunity while they perpetrate terrible crimes .

March 2 , 2008  --
Since writing my book " Irreligion " and some of my recent Who 's Counting columns , I 've received a large number of e-mails from subscribers to creation science ( who have recently christened themselves intelligent design theorists ) .
Some of the notes have been polite , some vituperative , but almost all question " how order and complexity can arise out of nothing . "
Since they can imagine no way for this to happen , they conclude there must be an intelligent designer , a God .
( They leave aside the prior question of how He arose . )
My canned answer to them about biological order talks a bit about evolution , but they often dismiss that source of order for religious reasons or because of a misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics .
( See Complexity and Intelligent Design for my Who 's Counting discussion of biological and economic order and complexity arising out of very simple programs . )
Because the seemingly inexplicable arising of order seems to be so critical to so many , however , I 've decided to list here a few other sources for naturally occurring order in physics , math , and biology .
Of course , order , complexity , entropy , randomness and related notions are clearly and utterly impossible to describe and disentangle in a column like this , but the examples below from " Irreligion " hint at some of the abstract ideas relevant to the arising of what has been called " order for free . "
Necessarily Some Order
Let me begin by noting that even about the seemingly completely disordered , we can always say something .
No universe could be completely random at all levels of analysis .
In physics , this idea is illustrated by the kinetic theory of gases .
There an assumption of disorder on one formal level of analysis , the random movement of gas molecules , leads to a kind of order on a higher level , the relations among variables such as temperature , pressure and volume known as the gas laws .
The law - like relations follow from the lower - level randomness and a few other minimal assumptions .
( This bit of physics does not mean that life has evolved simply by chance , a common mischaracterization of evolution . )
In addition to the various laws of large numbers studied in statistics , a notion that manifests a different aspect of this idea is statistician Persi Diaconis ' remark that if you look at a big enough population long enough , then " almost any damn thing will happen . "
Ramsey Order
A more profound version of this line of thought can be traced back to British mathematician Frank Ramsey , who proved a strange theorem .
It stated that if you have a sufficiently large set of geometric points and every pair of them is connected by either a red line or a green line ( but not by both ) , then no matter how you color the lines , there will always be a large subset of the original set with a special property .
Either every pair of the subset 's members will be connected by a red line or every pair of the subset 's members will be connected by a green line .
If , for example , you want to be certain of having at least three points all connected by red lines or at least three points all connected by green lines , you will need at least six points .
( The answer is not as obvious as it may seem , but the proof is n't difficult . )
For you to be certain that you will have four points , every pair of which is connected by a red line , or four points , every pair of which is connected by a green line , you will need 18 points , and for you to be certain that there will be five points with this property , you will need -- it 's not known exactly - between 43 and 55 .
With enough points , you will inevitably find unicolored islands of order as big as you want , no matter how you color the lines .
A whole mathematical subdiscipline has grown up devoted to proving theorems of this same general form :
How big does a set have to be so that there will always be some subset of a given size that it will constitute an island of order of some sort ?
Ramsey - type theorems may even be part of the explanation ( along , of course , with Diaconis ' dictum ) for some of the equidistant letter sequences that constitute the bible codes .
Any sufficiently long sequence of symbols , especially one written in the restricted vocabulary of ancient Hebrew , is going to contain subsequences that appear meaningful .
Self - Organization and Order
Finally , of more direct relevance to evolution and the origin of living complexity is the work of Stuart Kauffman .
In his book , " At Home in the Universe , " he discusses what he has termed the aforementioned notion of " order for free . "
Motivated by the idea of hundreds of genes in a genome turning on and off other genes and the order and pattern that nevertheless exist , Kauffman asks us to consider a large collection of 10,000 light bulbs , each bulb having inputs from two other bulbs in the collection .
Assume that you connect these bulbs at random , that a clock ticks off one - second intervals , and that at each tick each bulb either goes on or off according to some arbitrarily selected rule .
For some bulbs , the rule might be to go off at any instant unless both inputs are on the previous instant .
For others it might be to go on at any instant if at least one of the inputs is off the previous instant .
Given the random connections and random assignment of rules , it would be natural to expect the collection of bulbs to flicker chaotically with no apparent pattern .
What happens , however , is that very soon one observes order for free , more or less stable cycles of light configurations , different ones for different initial conditions .
Kauffman proposes that some phenomenon of this sort supplements or accentuates the effects of natural selection .
Although there is certainly no need for yet another argument against the seemingly ineradicable silliness of " creation science , " these light bulb experiments and the unexpected order that occurs so naturally in them do seem to provide one .
In any case , order for free and apparent complexity greater than we might naively expect are no basis for believing in God as traditionally defined .
Of course , we can always redefine God to be an inevitable island of order or some sort of emergent mathematical entity .
If we do that , the above considerations can be taken as indicating that such a pattern will necessarily exist , but that 's hardly what people mean by God .

■ OpenID に関する過去の日 記
山口さんから@ITのOpenID Authentication 2.0時代の幕開けという記事で、この日記を紹介していただいた。
でも、今月は OpenID の話を書いていなくて、金沢旅行の写真が最新になってる。 せっかく来ていただいた方に申し訳ないので、これを機に過去の
OpenID に関する日記を整理してみるよ 。
IDはそのままで認証サーバを簡単に変えられるのなら、自分でなんちゃって認証サーバを立てることも可能。ということは、サービス側にとっては「認証された」事自体はあまり意味が無いということか。
OpenIDの場合は、そのユーザが「どこで 」
「どうやって」認証されたかはあまり問題にしていない。サービス側が判断できるのは、以前にそのOpenIDでアクセスした人と同じ人が、今回もアクセスしてきたということだけ。サービス側が、どの認証サーバを受け入れるかを選択できるのなら、また話は変わってくるけど（この辺、要調査）。
これって、「認証システム」じゃなくて「識別システム」なんじゃないかな。
OpenIDをインフラとして、その上でどのように信頼関係を作っていくかが鍵みたいね。
たぶん、一番最初に OpenID について書いた日記。 自分で言うのもなんだけど、意外といい点を突いていたと思う。
信頼を構築しないと使えない以上、これは、OpenIDは何に使えるかを考えることと同じなのかも。基本的に、サービス側で信用を構築していくモデル（メール、SPAM判定）よりも、ユーザ側で信用を構築していくモデル（SNS）のほうに向いている気がしているけど。
URLとFoaFを関連付けるとかね。
前の日記の続き。 「 信頼」についての考察。

OpenIDプロキシがあると何が嬉しいかよく分からなくなったので、絵にしてみた
この流れを考えると、はてなスターを OpenID 時代の評価システムとして使おうとしているかもって思うようになった。スターを付けることで、人と人が結び付けられる。そして、その人は
OpenID で識別できる。 この人と人との繋がりを SNS っぽく可視化したのが、はてなワールドなんじゃないかと予想してみる。といっても、従来の
SNS のマネだと mixi と競合するので、もう少し緩いネットワークを目指すんじゃないかな。この繋がりの情報は評価 ( Reputation ) の貴重な材料にもなるしね 。

Forty feet underground , secured in a temperature - and humidity - controlled vault here , lies Kilogram No. 20 .
It ’s an espresso - shot - sized , platinum - iridium cylinder that is the perfect embodiment of the kilogram -- almost perfect .
In the more than a century since No. 20 and dozens of other exact copies were crafted in France to serve as the world ’s standards of the kilogram , their masses have been mysteriously drifting apart .
The difference is on average about 50 micrograms -- about the weight of a grain of fine salt .
But the ramifications have rippled through the world of precision physics , which uses the kilogram as the basis for a host of standard measures , including force of gravity , the ampere and Planck ’s constant -- the omnipresent figure of quantum mechanics .
Advertisement
In essence , no one really knows today what a kilogram is .
“ How do I trust what I have ? ” asked Zeina Jabbour , the physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology , or NIST , in charge of maintaining No. 20 , the official U.S. kilogram .
The kilogram crisis has kicked off an international race to redefine the measure .
Instead of using an object , scientists are searching for some property of nature or scientific constant , such as the vibrations of a cesium atom now used to define a second .
The kilogram is the last of seven base units in the International System of Units that is still based on a physical object , a remnant of the era before relativity and quantum mechanics transformed our understanding of the universe .

“ The real problem is , people in other areas of science do n’t want to measure , say , fundamental constants with respect to this artifact made in the 19th century , ” said Richard Davis , head of the mass section at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France .
Besides , Jabbour added : “ You could drop it . ”
In fact , at least six copies of the kilogram have been lost or damaged over the years from war , clumsiness or other reasons .
Two ideas have emerged as the leading contenders to redefine the kilogram .
One involves counting the trillion trillion atoms in the most perfect silicon sphere ever made .
The other attempts to measure the electrical current necessary to balance a one kilogram weight against Earth ’s gravity .
Advertisement
Serious complications ensnare both approaches .
“ We ’re running into the wall of measurement , ” said Richard Steiner , the physicist heading NIST ’s effort to define a new kilogram .
In the 18th century , hundreds of thousands of different weights and measures were in use around the world .
The French alone employed about 250,000 different units of measure .
The Enlightenment and the French Revolution spurred the idea of standardization , said Ken Alder , a historian at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill .
People could only be free if they could calculate for themselves the weight and cost of things they bought , philosophers reasoned .

The French government created the kilogram in 1795 , defining it as the mass of a liter of distilled water at the temperature of melting ice .
A century later , the Treaty of the Meter established the kilogram as an international standard .
The foundation of the standard was a cylindrical ingot of 90 % platinum and 10 % iridium created in 1878 that became known as Le Grand K , or more officially the International Prototype .
Forty copies were made and distributed a decade later to governments around the world .
Another 50 were made later .
These 90 copies serve as national standards , used to calibrate working weights in science and industry .
About every 50 years , the national prototypes are returned to the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres , France , to be compared with the International Prototype .
During the first major comparison about 1950 , scientists noticed discrepancies between the average masses of Le Grand K and its copies .
They were concerned but could not discern a trend .
Advertisement
Science was already grappling with inconsistencies in other units and was trying to replace the pieces of metal and other artifacts that delineated the old world .
The meter , for example , was changed in 1960 from two scratches on a platinum - iridium bar to a certain number of wavelengths of light emitted from a particular kind of krypton .
In 1983 , it was changed again to the distance traveled by light in a specific fraction of a second .
At the last major kilogram comparison done in and around 1990 , some copies had gained as much as 132 micrograms .
A few had lost up to 665 micrograms .
The United States ’ No. 20 was 18 micrograms heavier .
There was no way to tell which was changing : Le Grand K , its copies or both .
Perhaps the platinum in the cylinders was sopping up mercury from the atmosphere .
Maybe dissolved gas was escaping from the cylinders .
One idea was that cleaning the cylinders with distilled water and ether had altered their weights .
Advertisement
“ Nobody has a really good idea why , ” said Davis of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures .
“ It ’s all speculation . ”
Just outside a sealed chamber situated on a lonely corner of the NIST grounds , Steiner laid his wallet and wristwatch on a wooden desk .
The magnetic field in the room was strong enough to erase the magnetic strips on his credit cards and stop the gears in his watch .
The elfish 53 - year - old physicist with graying light brown hair pulled aside the heavy door and stepped into the warm glow of the room , sheathed in shiny copper plates to shield out radio and radar waves .
Wires threaded across the walls .
At the heart of the chamber hummed Steiner ’s hulking machinery he hopes will lead to the next kilogram -- a two - story device with a pair of superconducting magnets the size of fire hydrants .
Advertisement
Steiner came to NIST here in Gaithersburg 23 years ago , a freshly minted physics PhD from the nearby University of Virginia .
He signed on to the kilogram project about 14 years ago .
The NIST device is known as a watt balance , but Steiner affectionately calls it “ my UFO . ”
The idea is to standardize the kilogram relative to a constant in quantum mechanics known as Planck ’s constant .
If scientists know the current , the strength of the magnetic field and Planck ’s constant , they can accurately determine the mass of an object .
The problem with Steiner ’s watt balance is that it can be finicky .
Distant earthquakes , motors from nearby office buildings and tides have shaken up the measurements , he said .
There are about 20 potential sources of error , including the buoyancy of air , electrical current leaks and the changes in local gravity .
Advertisement
Peter Becker , a physicist at Germany ’s National Metrology Institute , thinks he has a simpler solution : Count atoms .
The idea is to define the kilogram as the number of atoms of a specific element .
Becker ’s hopes ride on two silvery croquet - ball - sized spheres of the purest silicon that cost $ 3.2 million to make .
They are the roundest objects ever made -- within 30 nanometers of perfection , about the width of a few atoms , he said .
Becker , a trim , jolly 63 - year - old man with a graying mustache , has been working on X - ray optics since the 1970s .
In the mid-1990s , when the drift in the kilogram copies ’ masses started to cause concern , Becker and his collaborators realized their work could be used to help solve the problem .
It ’s impossible to count atoms individually , but Becker ’s group , known as the International Avogadro Project , used X - rays to determine the spacing of atoms in an object .
Once that was known , and the volume of an object determined using precise laser measurements , they could derive the number of atoms -- about 20 trillion trillion for a kilogram of silicon .
Advertisement
Such calculations , however , require a material with a very regular spacing pattern .
The group settled on silicon because its atoms are laid out in a nearly perfect cubic lattice .
The group initially used natural silicon and manufactured about 20 spheres for their measurements in their last 14 years of collaboration .
They calculated a fairly accurate value , but it was still off , largely because natural silicon contains a variety of isotopes with different lattice spacing .
The scientists realized they needed a purer material , preferably a crystal composed entirely of one kind of silicon .
Russia ’s Nuclear Ministry and Institute for Ultrapure Materials produced a large silicon crystal , and the Institute of Crystal Growth in Germany repeatedly melted the material to remove contaminants , resulting in 99.99 % pure silicon - 28 , the most common isotope .
The spheres were ground using progressively smaller grains of aluminum oxide at the Australian Center for Precision Optics .
Advertisement
“ If you look at the experiment , it looks very easy , ” said Becker , who just picked up the new spheres this month .
“ The devil is in the details . ”
After decades of work , both efforts have so far produced stunningly precise measurements -- but still too inconsistently to prove the accuracy of their methods .
Steiner ’s latest calculation of uncertainty is less than the 50 - microgram average difference between the kilogram copies and Le Grand K .
But a few months ago , a British team used a watt balance of its own design to generate a value that was significantly different .
Neither lab can explain the gap .
The disagreement has given Becker ’s atom - counting effort some hope .
Advertisement
He said his group should be able to make a better calculation next year using the new spheres .
“ Our goal is to reduce [ the uncertainty ] by a factor of 10 or better , ” Becker said .
“ We are convinced we can reach it . ”
The watt balance approach , however , has an advantage in that it does n’t require each country to manufacture its own ultra -pure silicon spheres .
And so the quest continues .
Steiner said that even after 14 years , it is still difficult to explain why he feels so strongly about his work .
“ Basically , I can never really justify [ to my friends and relatives ] that they ’re going to be able to buy some new thing based on what I work on , ” he said .
Advertisement
Even if he succeeds , he knows it ’s only a matter of time before scientists demand something even more precise .
Just last month , NIST announced the development of two new atomic clocks that surpassed the accuracy of the current ones , which lose one second over about 80 million years .
The new clocks lose less than a second over 1 billion years .
“ You ’ll never get perfect , ” Steiner said .
“ There ’s always a whole lot more digits out there . ”

A French aviation expert has come forward to reveal his participation in a secret meeting held at the United Nations New York headquarters that discussed the UFO phenomenon from February 12 - 14 .
Gilles Lorant is an attaché to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS - National Center for Scientific Research ) which is a government - funded research organization , under the administrative authority of France 's Ministry of Research .
He is also a member Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense ( IHEDN - the French Organization that produced the 1999 COMETA Report ) .
Both CNRS and IHEDN are prestigious scientific organizations in France , and Lorant was invited to attend the UN meetings in a professional capacity .
A report released by a French UFO organization ( Federation of European Airplane ) , of which Lorant is an executive member , contained a summary of the UN meeting where he describes what happened at the meeting .
Lorant revealed that a series of UN meetings were held over a three day period .
In the meetings there was discussion of a confidential report , prepared by the U.S. Air Force and a branch of the National Guard , concerning the societal impact of UFO sightings .
The initial meeting was held on February 12 and , according to Lorant ’s report , led to a request by three U.S. Senators for further discussions .
Additional meetings were held immediately after on February 13 and 14 .
The implication is that three U.S. Senators attended the secret UN meetings .
The meetings were very concerned about social upheaval from continued UFO sightings and the testimonies of individuals claiming to have first hand knowledge about UFO ’s , extraterrestrial life , and future global events .
It was reported that adverse public reactions to UFO sightings could have a dramatic economic impact that could lead to recessions in some countries .
The emphasis on possible societal upheaval due to growing UFO sightings was reminiscent of recommendations by the 1953 Robertson Panel , convened by the CIA , which identified adverse public reactions as a major security threat that could be exploited by foreign enemies .
The UN discussions appeared to match concerns identified in both the 1953 Robertson Panel and the 1961 Brookings Report ( ) to the U.S. Congress , over ramifications of UFO reports and the eventual discovery of extraterrestrial life .
2009 was raised as the year when an important change in official attitudes concerning the UFO phenomenon could be made .
This suggested that the official debunking policy underway since the 1953 Robertson Panel would be abandoned and more serious study of the UFO phenomenon would occur .
This indicated an important policy shift were the study of UFO ’s would be officially encouraged .
However , certain global conditions would have to be met for the official opening .
Most important appeared to be social stability in G - 8 countries and the maintenance of liberal democratic systems in developing nations .
Lorant also suggested that an official opening in attitudes would only occur if UFO sightings continued to occur at present levels .
Lorant ’s testimony provides independent corroboration for an anonymous source who first came forward on February 12 to reveal to two New York researchers ( Clay and Shawn Pickering ) that the UN meeting had taken place .
The source ’s testimony was revealed in two articles published by this author on February 13 and 20 , and a follow up article by Robert Morningstar on Feb 25 .
Lorant ’s testimony gives more detailed information of what happened at the meeting , and is consistent with statements from the original source of the UN meeting concerning approximately 40 participants , multiple issues being discussed as well as the UFO phenomenon , and public reactions to increased UFO sightings .
Most importantly , Lorant provides insight into reasons for a significant change in official public policy towards the UFO phenomenon .
The reported results of the UN meetings indicate agreement was reached for an international strategy to more seriously study the UFO phenomenon in a manner that maintains present levels of social stability .
This raises the possibility that those presenting information on UFOs / extraterrestrial life deemed to threaten national stability or financial systems , would receive special attention by national security agencies .
The meetings results suggest that an official change in government policy from ‘ debunking ’ to ‘ openness ’ concerning UFO ’s would lead to official approval to narrowly define study of the UFO phenomenon .
However , those claiming to have first hand experience of extraterrestrial life would be targeted as charlatans .
The UN meeting thereby suggested continuation of policies aimed at exploiting divisions in the UFO community between researchers advocating a strictly scientific study of the UFO phenomenon , and those wishing to discuss testimonies / documentation concerning extraterrestrial life visiting Earth .
An article exposing " Galactic COINTELPRO " is available here .
Lorant ’s testimony finally suggests that governments are being driven to more open approach to the UFO phenomenon due to the recent increase sightings that are projected to continue well into 2009 .
What follows is a summary report of the UN meetings based on Lorant ’s testimony that appears in a newsletter of the FEA and is available in the original French .

Newsletter No. 4 of the F.E.A , 25.02.2008
Posted by Jean - Jacques Yvars …
Dear Friends ,
…
For strictly professional reasons and by coincidence , an active member of the FEA was invited to the UN in New York in the week starting February 11 , 2008 .
This person took part in the development of discussions on the subject of UFOs , after the meeting of February 12 .
These discussions at the United Nations , brought forth further deliberations during three conferences held behind closed doors on 13 and 14 February , to which our member had the honor and pleasure to attend .
Here is a summary of the minutes that Mr. Gilles Lorant , invited to the meetings , kindly shared with us about what was said at the United Nations in New York :
On 12 February , the U.S. Air Force and the National Guard would actually presented a report on the subject of UFOs and the impact of sightings on many communities in the United States .
Since this report was considered important for industrialized countries , representatives from several countries were invited to attend .
Then , at the request of three United States Senators , a series of three meetings took place in the [ two ] following days , in the presence of forty representatives from twenty - eight member countries , including the Vatican ( two countries did not send representatives ) .
On both days , the subject of UFO ’s was discussed , for no more than an hour and a half , as one of the causes of social upheaval of a country , due to the high probability of economic recession resulting from the speeches of ‘ contactees ’ , charlatans , religious [ figures ] , some scientists and prophecies .
Sightings of UFOs increase sharply the risk of social unrest threatening the political systems of several emerging democracies .
According to Mr. Gilles Lorant , what was discussed was an opening in official attitudes when publicly considering , in future , how to treat the UFO phenomenon .
An official opening to be held under two conditions :
1 ) Until the end of 2009 , that social peace in the G8 countries is guaranteed around the liberal democratic model ( US version )

While protesting outside the Scientology Church of Georgia in Atlanta , Georgia , United States , two members of the group Anonymous were arrested by DeKalb County riot police while standing opposite the Church of Scientology - owned building .
The two protesters , who earlier participated in the delivery of a ' global speech ' collaboratively written and read by members of Anonymous at protests worldwide , are believed to have been charged by Dekalb police for protesting without a permit and causing ' offensive or hazardous conditions ' .
However , other members of Anonymous who took leading roles in arranging the protest are adamant that the Dekalb police had previously told them they did not need a permit to protest .
Video of the arrest
The arrests were filmed by other members of Anonymous who subsequently posted the videos onto popular video - sharing website YouTube .
The videos show a very quick arrest in which the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights of the protesters , which — contrary to popular belief — is only required to be read before a police officer interviews someone in custody .
This was confirmed by other members of the group who say they did n't hear their rights being read before they were led away .
" They were grabbed and taken behind the complex in one swift strike .
There was no Miranda rights read when they were initially grabbed " said one member of Anonymous interviewed by Wikinews .
In other videos published on YouTube , the same members of Anonymous were shown thanking police for their work and offering them some of the cake members of Anonymous had brought to the protest , shortly before they were arrested .
Members of Anonymous have composed an open letter to Dekalb 's Chief of Police , asking if such a show of police strength was really needed at a non-violent protest organised and attended mainly by college students and young Americans .

Drivers showing their support for the protesters by honking their car horns while driving past were followed by police bikes waiting in the Scientology building 's driveway and given tickets for violating noise ordinance laws .
However , many members of Anonymous have voiced confusion over these tickets , as the honks of support were only 2 - 3 seconds in duration at most , and noise ordinance laws state a horn must be sounded for longer than 60 seconds to count as a violation of the law .
When , after the arrests were made , the police started to adopt the policy of ticketing drivers who honked , members of Anonymous quickly raised " Do not honk " signs to drivers .
Both of the members of Anonymous have been released , one with a bail of $ 763.00 .
There are confirmed to be two charges standing against one .
No information has been released from the police department at this point .
They did no wrong , and that building they were led into was reportedly the Scientology Org building .
— Kalira , Doomfeller blog
Initial reaction from bloggers was generally critical of the arrests .
Kalira of Doomfeller blog wrote : " This is UNACCEPTABLE .
They did no wrong , and that building they were led into was reportedly the Scientology Org building .
If the police — nay , the walking tanks , totally uncalled for with a peaceful protest — had them unmask inside ... suffice it to say if they get harassed , there will be great big steaming piles of hell to pay . "
Scientology critic Jeff Jacobsen , who was interviewed by Wikinews on February 19 , wrote on his blog : " But then I see that the Atlanta police arrested two Anons , and were even stopping cars that honked in approval of the protest !
Is Atlanta not a part of the United States ?
I do n't get it . "

Interview
The videos and arrests have sparked outrage amongst members of the public and Anonymous , and Wikinews interviewed members of Anonymous who were at the Atlanta protest on Saturday :
(( Wikinews ) )
What was your initial reaction to the arrests at the protest ?
Anonymous 1 : Just disbelief .
On February 10th , the police were completely cool , and we heard they liked us .
(( WN ) )
What has been your experience dealing with the Atlanta police ?
Anonymous 1 : Usually the police are very chilled with the protests and such .
This is the first time that I can recall them acting like this .
Anonymous 2 : They really did n't talk to us at all at the last protest .
Several people had called in before both protests to confirm that we did n't need a permit and that everything was OK - they knew we were coming , and so on - but at this protest initial requests to get more information from the officers were either ignored or met with hostility .
(( WN ) )
Was there any statement issued by police on what the two arrested individuals were arrested for ?
Anonymous 2 : Originally I heard that they could n't answer that , but then people started saying it was for inciting disorder and for protesting without a permit .
We had contacted the police department earlier , and were told that we would n't need a permit .

No way .
But all true !
Higher incidences of congenital anomalies , including cryptorchidism ( undescended testicles ) and hypospadias , were found in boys whose mothers had higher serum levels of certain organochlorine compounds , researchers say .
Two separate studies presented during the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Urological Association ( AUA ) in Orlando confirmed existing hypotheses that maternal exposure to endocrine - disrupting chemicals -- including total polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs , such as Arochlor ) and organochlorinated pesticides ( such as dichlorodiphenyl - trichloroethane , or DDT ) may contribute to an increased incidence of these conditions .
Mothers with high levels of organochlorine compounds in their bodies are at a greater risk of bearing sons with undescended testicles ( cryptorchidism ) .
In a study of 40 boys undergoing surgical treatment for the condition , researchers from New York and Michigan analyzed PCB serum levels from both the patient and the mother and compared the readings to residual PCB levels in the patients ' fatty tissue samples ( taken at surgery ) .
Patients ranged from eight to 18 months of age at the time of treatment .
Researchers ' analysis of the amount of OCC residue in the samples revealed that serum PCB levels reflect the fatty burden of OCC residues in the boys , and OCC concentration in maternal serum samples correlated with the son 's serum levels .
Aggregate PCB levels and maternal levels of individual PCB congeners were significantly higher in boys with undescended testicles than in mothers of boys without the anomaly .
Researchers from Michigan and Atlanta presented similar findings on congenital anomalies and chemical exposure .
Using data from the Michigan Long - Term PBB Cohort , researchers examined individuals exposed to polybrominated biphenyl ( PBB ) during 1974 - 1974 , including sons of mothers with known serum PBB levels , to determine whether in - utero exposure to PBB put male neonates at a greater risk for genitourinary ( GU ) or reproductive conditions .
Self - reported data on varicocele , cryptorchidism , hypospadias and other GU and reproductive conditions was compared to estimated maternal PBB levels at the time of conception .
Of the sons whose mothers had measurable PBB levels at the time of conception , 35 reported GU conditions , including hernias ( 13 ) , hydroceles ( 10 ) , undescended testicles ( 9 ) , hypospadias ( 5 ) , phimosis ( 2 ) and varicocele ( 1 ) .
Sons whose mothers had PBB levels greater than 5 parts per billion were more likely to report these conditions than those whose mothers had lower levels .
Maternal PBB levels were not found to have an impact on birth weight or estimated gestational age .
12.2 percent of boys with maternal serum levels greater than 5 were more likely to report GU conditions , compared to 5.5 percent of boys with lower maternal PBB levels .
" Mothers with known exposure to these enduring compounds should tell not only their own doctors but also their sons ' pediatricians , " said Anthony Y. Smith , M.D. , a spokesman for the AUA .
" These data underscore the importance of regular ' well - baby checkups ' so that these easily treatable conditions are diagnosed promptly . "
About Pediatric Urological Conditions
Cryptorchidism : Undescended testicles occur in 3 to 4 percent of full - term infants and , if left untreated , can lead to infertility and a greater risk of developing testicular cancer .
In about 65 percent of patients , the condition spontaneously resolves by nine months of age .
The condition is treated hormonally or surgically in patients whose testicles do not descend into the scrotal sac naturally .
Hypospadias :
One of the most common birth defects of the male genitalia , hypospadias varies in incidence around the world but can affect up to one in 125 boys .
It occurs when the urethral opening is not positioned at the tip of the penis .
Hypospadias can range in severity , depending on whether the urethral opening is minorly displaced on the glans penis ( first degree ) , on the shaft of the penis ( second degree ) or not on the penis at all ( third degree ) .
Not all first - degree cases require treatment ; surgical repair of severe hypospadias can involve multiple surgical procedures and , in some cases , mucosal grafting .
Hydrocele : Approximately one in 10 male infants present with a hydrocele at birth .
A fluid - filled sac surrounding a testicle , hydroceles are typically benign and painless and disappear in the first year of life .
Hydroceles require treatment only when large enough to cause disfigurement or discomfort .
Treatments include surgical excision and needle aspiration .
About Organochlorine Compounds : Initially lauded for their chemical stability , PCBs ( such as Araclor and its congeners ) and organochlorinated pesticides such as DDT are lipid - soluble compounds actively produced around the world in the first half of the 20th century .
After widespread use in agricultural and manufacturing applications ( as plastizers , heat - stabilizing additives for PVC electric insulation , adhesives and paints ) , they were discontinued in both open and closed uses in the 1970s when health risks became apparent .
Lipid soluble , the compounds are absorbed and dispersed to living tissue and , as a result , can have a cumulative effect and cause toxin damage across generations .
The United States banned their domestic production in 1977 .
Women 's Rights Brief in DC v. Heller :
A brief on behalf of 126 women state legislators , and several academics , presents a women 's rights perspective on the DC ban on handguns and on home self - defense with any firearm .
Part I points out that , compared to the past , women are more likely to live alone .
Young women are less likely to move straight from their father 's house to their husband 's house , but may instead live on their own .
A large number of elderly women live alone , because they have outlived their mates , or for other reasons .
Accordingly , the paternalistic assumption that all women are under the protection of a man has no validity today .
Part II notes the prevalence of violence against women , particularly domestic violence .
( This point is also made at great length in a pro-prohibition amicus filed on behalf of many state domestic violence groups ) .
The brief quotes Andrea Dworkin discussed the battered woman : " She has a constitutional right to a gun and a legal right to kill if she believes she 's going to be killed .
And a batterer 's repeated assaults should lawfully be taken as intent to kill . "
Other feminist advocates of women 's empowerment for self - defense are cited and quoted too .
Section B of Part II summarizes the relevant social science evidence , showing that armed self - defense by women is effective .
Although the domestic violence groups cited studies showing that guns caused an increased risk of homicide to a domestic violence victim , the brief points out that the research shows an increased risk if an abuser has a gun .
The data show no statistically significant risk for gun ownershp by victims who lives apart from the abuser and who has her own gun .
The remainder of Part II points out that under cases such as Castle Rock and Warren v. D.C. women are victimized because of law enforcement failure to act against known threats ( or even women who rely on false 911 promises that help is on the way ) have no legal remedy .
Part III points out that because most women have less upper body strength than men , a handgun is superior to a long gun for self - defense .
Also :
Advocates of women 's reproductive choice commonly argue that pregnancy disproportionately affects women due to their innate gender - based characteristics .
Thus , they argue , courts failing to recognize the right to terminate a pregnancy therefore discriminate against women and bar their ability to participate as equal and full members of civil society .
While choices about pregnancy no doubt impact a woman 's ability to determine the course of part of her life , it is not clear why such a right should be due greater protection than a woman 's ability to defend her very existence .
The brief acknowledges that some women are hostile to gun ownership .
Historically , A large segment of women were likewise averse , moderately supportive or even downright indifferent to female suffrage and women 's reproductive choice .
However , the fact that only some will choose to exercise their right to self - defense should in no way prove a legal impediment to those women for whom owning a firearm is necessary to their ability to determine the course of their lives and consequently their place in society .
Read in conjunction with the brief of the domestic violence groups , the two briefs present the court with the contrasting perspectives , in regard to the gun issue , of victim feminism and empowerment feminism .
Doctors are often perceived as benevolent professionals .
They are hard - working individuals who extend their largesse by giving away free medical care to those in need .
Studies by Cunningham and May ( 2006 ) and the American Hospital Association find that doctors provide uncompensated care equal to 6.3 % or 5.6 % of their cots annually respectively .
A recent Journal of Health Economics article by Gruber and Rodriguez concludes that these figures may be overstated .
In fact , the study finds that physicians provide negative amounts of uncompensated care to the uninsured .
How is this possible ?
While it is true that doctors do give away free care to the uninsured and that many of those without insurance do not pay their bills , the uninsured patient often pay a large portion of the list price whereas those who have insurance receive a negotiated lower price .
Thus , the authors find that “ the majority of physicians actually make money , on net on their uninsured patients … 12 - 14 % of physicians found their uninsured patients more than twice as profitable as their insured patients ; that is the net payments from the uninsured were more than twice the expected payments from the insured patients . ”
Even when the authors ignore the higher list prices the uninsured pay , they still find that only about 1 % of total revenues are given away as free care to the uninsured .
Much of this amount , however , is due to non-payment by the patients rather than free care given away by the physicians .
Medicine may be a business after all .
Have you ever wondered what really happened to that mall in The Blues Brothers or where Tarkovsky filmed those jarring and surrealistic scenes in Stalker ?
While many urban abandonments are left alone or the occasional subject of urban exploration , some remarkable buildings and complexes have become famous ( or infamous ) after being used as film sets for cult classics or contemporary major motion pictures .
Here are five films that made use of deserted buildings ranging from suburban malls and insane asylums to an unfinished nuclear reactor .
To learn more or see larger original images click the movie - titled links below each film clip .
The Blues Brothers : Did you ever wonder if they really destroyed a mall to make one of the most famous scenes in this film ?
As it turns out , the infamous mall car chase scene did in fact wreak havoc on what remained the ( yes , recently deserted ) Dixie Square Mall .
Fans of the film may enjoy the above video clip which shows the chase scene moment by moment from the movie reenacted in a real vintage police car , in the same mall and with the same camera shots ( now fully deserted and falling apart ) .

12 Monkeys :
This retrofuturistic film was shot across a number of prominent locations from mansions and power plants in Baltimore , Maryland to jails and convention centers in Philadelphia , Pennsylvia .
One of its more eerie settings , however , was the Westport Power Generation Station .
This site was used to create some of the more chilling interior shots set in the post - apocalyptic future from which the movie ’s protagonist originates .
Even from these seemingly benign shots it is easy to see how they could create the steampunkish settings required for the film .
[ Article update : other power station locations used in the filming of 12 Monkeys can be found here , here and here .
Thanks Dave !]
The Abyss :
The underwater scenes in this gripping over - two - hour science - fiction thriller were filmed at the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant in South Carolina .
Millions of gallons of water were brought in to fill existing unfinished structures on the site and The Abyss thus broke the record for the largest underwater movie set in the world .
The power plant was never completed but the complex contained a turbine pit and incomplete containment vessel were used as primary and secondary sets and on - site warehouses for interior shots .
For more images of this amazing movie set and a larger version of the one above check out HistoricDecay .
Session 9 : This 2001 horror movie was shot almost entirely in the abandoned rooms and halls of the deserted Danvers State Hospital .
In an unusual twist , the film ’s overt premise is the remodeling of this real - life asylum rather than pretending the building is some other structure for the purposes of the movie .
While many of the details are , of course , changed for cinema the building did provide a remarkably appropriate setting for the dramatic action of the film .
The Danvers State Hospital is also rumored to be the inspiration for H.P. Lovecraft ’s own Arkham hospital which , in turn , was the inspiration for the Akrham Asylum .
Despite increased security many deserted - building urban explorers found their way into this abandoned building complex after the film popularized the site .
During the demolition of many of the older buildings and construction of new buildings on the site in 2006 a mysterious fire laid waste to much of the complex and disabled an on - site web camera filming the grounds .

Stalker :
This infamous Tarkovsky film is notorious not only for its impact on cinema but also for the strange and sad stories surrounding its filming .
The movie was shot primarily in and around Tallinn , Estonia near chemical factories , power plants and other dangerous locations .
Dreadful allergic reactions by the crew and Tarkovsky ’s own cancer were blamed on the poisonous liquids pouring downstream from these nearby structures .
When the film crew returned to Moscow much of the film was found to be improperly developed and the Soviet government , which frowned on the theistic undertones of Tarkovsky ’s work , was suspect of having a hand in mishandling the film .
Many Russian urban explorers and abandoned building hobbyists actually call themselves “ stalkers ” or variants of the word as a kind of tribute to the film and its setting , many of which have since been demolished .

One of the arguments that government apologists have used in trying to prop up the official story of why the World Trade Centers came down on 9/11 is that no structural engineers have questioned the government 's version of events .
However , that is now changing .
The following structural engineers have now publicly challenged the government 's account of the destruction of the Trade Centers on 9/11 : A prominent engineer with 55 years experience , in charge of the design of hundreds of major building projects including high rise offices , former member of the California Seismic Safety Commission and former member of the National Institute of Sciences Building Safety Council ( Marx Ayres ) believes that the World Trade Centers were brought down by controlled demolition ( see also this
Two professors of structural engineering at a prestigious Swiss university ( Dr. Joerg Schneider and Dr. Hugo Bachmann ) said that , on 9/11 , World Trade Center 7 was brought down by controlled demolition ( translation here )
The sight of two blind people has been partially restored after surgeons at a leading UK hospital fitted them with " bionic eyes " .
The operations , carried out at Moorfields eye hospital in London , give new hope to sufferers of a hereditary disease of the retina that causes progressive and severe blindness .
The groundbreaking surgery is part of a clinical study to test the effectiveness of the artificial retinal devices in treating retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) , a group of inherited eye diseases in which there is gradual deterioration of the light - sensitive cells of the retina .
The implant gives severe RP sufferers a basic level of useful vision , in the form of spots of light and shapes of light and dark .
The technology consists of a tiny camera and transmitter mounted in a pair of glasses .
The camera transmits a wireless signal to an ultra - thin electronic receiver and electrode panel implanted in the eye and attached to the retina .
The electrodes stimulate the remaining retinal nerves , which send a signal along the optic nerve to the brain .
The brain perceives patterns of light and dark spots corresponding to the electrodes that are stimulated .
The operations were done by a consultant retinal surgeon , Lyndon da Cruz , and his team under the supervision of colleagues in the US who developed the device with the American company Second Sight .
Cruz said Moorfields was one of three sites in Europe chosen for the trial .
" The devices were implanted successfully in both patients and they are recovering well from the operations , " he said .
" It is very special to be part of a programme developing a totally new type of treatment for patients who would otherwise have no chance of visual improvement . "
David Head , the chief executive of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society ( BRPS ) , said : " These are significant advances and , in conjunction with the advances being made in stem cell therapy and gene therapy , make for really exciting times as we work to translate science into treatment .
" I 'm encouraged and cautiously optimistic that treatments are perhaps being developed in a time scale that is meaningful for people who have retinitis pigmentosa now .
" The society has been fighting RP for 32 years and there 's no doubt these are some of the most promising developments we have seen . "
Professor John Marshall of St Thomas ' hospital London , who is chairman of the BRPS medical advisory board , said the surgery was still in its " very early days " .
" It is very , very good news that devices have been developed , it is very good news that in experimental trials some individuals have had these inserted .
" However , the general public should not run away with the idea that this is going to be routine surgery for blind people in the immediate future because there is an enormous amount to learn . "
WILLEMSTAD : During refurbishing and reparatory work , which involved removing the ceiling and panelling on cruise ship Freewinds , blue asbestos was released and ended up in the ventilation system .
Freewinds ' captain did not report this when it's own personnel were working on the ship on the Mathey warf in Otrobanda .
The Curacao Drydock Company ( CDM ) , where the ship was taken for reparatory work on the hull , heard from the surveyor that there may be asbestos on the ship .
The captain acknowledged the incident and said that after the incident Freewinds had some investigation done .
Keeping the incident quiet became more noticeable when it turned out that the 40 - year - old ship contatined blue asbestos .
The question is whether or not the blue asbestos dust , which can cause cancer , can be removed from the ship .
The CDM has stopped all work on the ship .
The ship was sealed and isolated and experts will investigate and measure the presence of asbestos dust in the hull and surrounding areas .
Commissioners Eugene Rhuggenaath ( Economic Affairs ) and Humphrey Davelaar ( Public Health ) said on Friday .
CDM interim director Frank Esser , deputy head of the Department of Labour Affairs Christiene van der Biezen were accompanied by two inspectors and head of the health Department Tico Ras .
Samples taken from the panelling last week by inspectors that were sent to the Netherlands showed that they contained significant amounts of blue asbestos .
After an extraordinary meeting , the Executive Council decided to inform the public in general about the incident to avoid remours and panic .
The CDM personnel were also informed via the media because it was impossible to gather all the workers Friday evening to personally give them the information .
From toothpick sculptures to hammer - and - nail portraits , a surprising number of artists use remarkably conventional materials as the basis for their offbeat masterpieces .
Sometimes the results are inspiring and other times they seem to border on kitsch .
Still , art from ordinary objects can provide an interesting reminder that the things around us we take for granted can be repurposed in ways most of us might never think of .
Also , as any artist knows , a new material can mean new aesthetic possibilities and unique material - dependent expressions .
The packing tape art of Mark Khaisman demonstrates that even the most mundane material can be the basis of a complex and rich composition .
Comprised entirely of brown tones and illuminated from behind , there is something vaguely film noir about some of his more scenographic works .
In other pieces he takes ordinarily colorful snapshot scenes or classic portraits and renders them unfamiliar and abstract .
Originally from the Ukraine Mark now lives , works and has regular shows in Philadelphia , PA .
Artist Saimir Strati holds world records both for the largest toothpick mosaic and largest nail mosaic in the world .
The above work shows Leonardo da Vinci using tens of thousands of individual nails set at different heights and angles to create subtle differences in tone and reflectivity .
His toothpick mosaic features over 1.5 million individual toothpicks .
Aside from these record - setting creations he also paints colorful and abstract landscapes and composes fantastical mosaic scenes in more conventional materials like tiles .
There are a lot of artists in San Francisco , so having a day named after him is no small feat for woodworker Steven Backman who has been constructing toothpick models for over 30 years .
His works range from an impressive thirteen foot replica of the Golden Gate Bridge to a rather cutesy musical rotating model of a San Francisco street car ( that plays “ I Left My Heart in San Francisco ” as it spins ) .
On top of being an impressive scale model , the yacht shown above actually floats and works as a remote - control boat .
Next time an incandescent bulb goes , spring for a GE Edison Halogen replacement .
CFLs are awful for a handful of reasons , which others have detailed nicely above .
They last thousands of hours ( reducing waste ) , give off MUCH more light per watt ( reducing your overall energy consumption ) , and you wo n't believe the difference in the colors you see in the room .
" Why are there so many banking crises ? " asks the economist Jean - Charles Rochet in his new book .
A good question , and one a lot of policy - makers have been asking since the credit squeeze began last summer .
Yesterday , amid all the excitement as the bosses of the big five high - street banks met Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , in a pinstriped version of High Noon , it was easy to forget one thing : we have been here before .
The thing about banking crises is that they come around as regularly as a gondola on a ferris wheel .
" Financial market crashes do not emerge randomly , but follow booms , " wrote former Bank chief economist Charles Goodhart and fund manager Avinash Persaud recently .
" What fuels the boom are market estimates that risks are low .
This optimism encourages imprudent lending , which eventually leads to the next crash . "
At which point some of those banks that helped stoke the boom take a dive .
Mr King is as aware of this cycle as the next long - suffering central banker , which is why he held out on financiers last summer when they demanded he pump more money into the system .
After all , ran the reasoning , why should the Bank bail out financiers from their own mess ?
A bit of pain might encourage reflection and reform .
That was a good policy , but eventually the banking turmoil got so bad - threatening to turn a slowdown in the wider economy into something much worse - that the Bank of England relented .
The crisis of confidence in the banking industry has not gone away .
That is why a mere rumour this week about a cash shortage at the giant HBOS knocked almost 20 % off its shares .
Faced with that kind of turbulence , Mr King and his colleagues have little alternative but to lend money to banks , and to keep on reducing interest rates .
This does not mean Mr King 's earlier instinct was wrong .
If the banks have landed themselves in such a mess that they now need a huge helping hand , conversely the same institutions need a great deal of reforming once the crisis has finally abated .
Regulators and politicians would do well to identify key areas of the banking system that require changing .
An obvious area is the reserves kept by banks to tide themselves over when trading conditions get tough .
Both Northern Rock and the American investment firm Bear Stearns nearly collapsed after running out of ready funds ; that indicates as brightly as a neon sign how much the reserve system needs an overhaul .
One idea , suggested by Mr Goodhart and Mr Persaud , is for banks to be required to build up their rainy - day funds when times are good .
Regulators should also give serious thought to reforming bankers ' pay .
The current system of annual bonuses only encourages short - termism .
Second , policy - makers should support only a few banks in clearly defined businesses .
Not all banks are equally worth preserving .
The Bank of England let investment firm Barings go for a song in the 90s , but would be far more worried about a big high - street bank getting into trouble .
Under current regulations , however , high - street giants like Barclays can plough into financial trading knowing that if they get into trouble , regulators will have to bail them out .
So the taxpayer is effectively underwriting any high - street bank that wants to get into ( say ) trading sub - prime mortgages .
That is unfair on competitors and on the taxpayer .
After the Great Crash of 1929 , the Americans introduced a law to prevent retail banks from getting into market trading .
That system has been eroded in the past few years , thanks to business lobbying .
Now would be a good time to restore that principle in the US and introduce it in Britain .
Finally , this crisis has affected banks from Japan to the US to the UK .
It has been international and underlined how badly we need a proper international monitor of financial flows .
This would be a good task to give to a currently purposeless IMF .
April 8 , 2008 -- Because of salmonella risk , Malt - O - Meal is recalling its unsweetened puffed rice and puffed wheat cereals with " Best If Used By " dates ranging from April 8 , 2008 ( coded as " APR0808 " ) to March 18 , 2009 ( coded as " MAR1809 " ) .
Salmonella bacteria can cause symptoms including diarrhea , fever , nausea , and abdominal pain .
Severe cases of salmonella infection can be life - threatening .
No illnesses linked to the recalled cereals have been reported .
The recalled cereals were distributed nationwide , marketed under the Malt - O - Meal brand and as some private label brands including Acme , America 's Choice , Food Club , Giant , Hannaford , Jewel , Laura Lynn , Pathmark , Shaw's ShopRite , Tops , and Weis Quality .
In a news release , Malt - O - Meal states that it issued the voluntary recall " out of an abundance of caution " after its routine safety testing detected salmonella in a product made on March 24 , 2008 .
The company says it has fixed the problem and that the recalled cereals account for less than half of one percent of the company 's yearly production of ready - to - eat cereal .
Malt - O - Meal advises consumers to return the recalled cereals to the store where they were purchased for a full refund .
For more information , call Malt - O- Meal at 877-665-9331 or visit the company 's recall web site for a full list of recalled products .
Security is both a feeling and a reality , and they 're different .
You can feel secure even though you 're not , and you can be secure even though you do n't feel it .
There are two different concepts mapped onto the same word — the English language is n't working very well for us here — and it can be hard to know which one we 're talking about when we use the word .
There is considerable value in separating out the two concepts : in explaining how the two are different , and understanding when we 're referring to one and when the other .
There is value as well in recognizing when the two converge , understanding why they diverge , and knowing how they can be made to converge again .
Some fundamentals first .
Viewed from the perspective of economics , security is a trade - off .
There 's no such thing as absolute security , and any security you get has some cost : in money , in convenience , in capabilities , in insecurities somewhere else , whatever .
Every time someone makes a decision about security — computer security , community security , national security — he makes a trade - off .
People make these trade - offs as individuals .
We all get to decide , individually , if the expense and inconvenience of having a home burglar alarm is worth the security .
We all get to decide if wearing a bulletproof vest is worth the cost and tacky appearance .
We all get to decide if we 're getting our money 's worth from the billions of dollars we 're spending combating terrorism , and if invading Iraq was the best use of our counterterrorism resources .
We might not have the power to implement our opinion , but we get to decide if we think it 's worth it .
Now we may or may not have the expertise to make those trade - offs intelligently , but we make them anyway .
All of us .
People have a natural intuition about security trade - offs , and we make them , large and small , dozens of times throughout the day .
We can't help it :
It 's part of being alive .
Imagine a rabbit , sitting in a field eating grass .
And he sees a fox .
He 's going to make a security trade - off : Should he stay or should he flee ?
Over time , the rabbits that are good at making that trade - off will tend to reproduce , while the rabbits that are bad at it will tend to get eaten or starve .
So , as a successful species on the planet , you 'd expect that human beings would be really good at making security trade - offs .
Yet , at the same time , we can be hopelessly bad at it .
We spend more money on terrorism than the data warrants .
We fear flying and choose to drive instead .
Why ?
The short answer is that people make most trade - offs based on the feeling of security and not the reality .
I 've written a lot about how people get security trade - offs wrong , and the cognitive biases that cause us to make mistakes .
Humans have developed these biases because they make evolutionary sense .
And most of the time , they work .
Most of the time — and this is important — our feeling of security matches the reality of security .
Certainly , this is true of prehistory .
Modern times are harder .
Blame technology , blame the media , blame whatever .
Our brains are much better optimized for the security trade - offs endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands in 100,000 B.C. than to those endemic to living in 2008 New York .
If we make security trade - offs based on the feeling of security rather than the reality , we choose security that makes us feel more secure over security that actually makes us more secure .
And that 's what governments , companies , family members and everyone else provide .
Of course , there are two ways to make people feel more secure .
The first is to make people actually more secure and hope they notice .
The second is to make people feel more secure without making them actually more secure , and hope they do n't notice .
The key here is whether we notice .
The feeling and reality of security tend to converge when we take notice , and diverge when we do n't .
People notice when 1 ) there are enough positive and negative examples to draw a conclusion , and 2 ) there is n't too much emotion clouding the issue .
Both elements are important .
If someone tries to convince us to spend money on a new type of home burglar alarm , we as society will know pretty quickly if he's got a clever security device or if he 's a charlatan ; we can monitor crime rates .
But if that same person advocates a new national antiterrorism system , and there were n't any terrorist attacks before it was implemented , and there were n't any after it was implemented , how do we know if his system was effective ?
People are more likely to realistically assess these incidents if they do n't contradict preconceived notions about how the world works .
For example :
It 's obvious that a wall keeps people out , so arguing against building a wall across America 's southern border to keep illegal immigrants out is harder to do .
The other thing that matters is agenda .
There are lots of people , politicians , companies and so on who deliberately try to manipulate your feeling of security for their own gain .
They try to cause fear .
They invent threats .
They take minor threats and make them major .
And when they talk about rare risks with only a few incidents to base an assessment on — terrorism is the big example here — they are more likely to succeed .
Unfortunately , there 's no obvious antidote .
Information is important .
We can't understand security unless we understand it .
But that 's not enough :
Few of us really understand cancer , yet we regularly make security decisions based on its risk .
What we do is accept that there are experts who understand the risks of cancer , and trust them to make the security trade - offs for us .
There are some complex feedback loops going on here , between emotion and reason , between reality and our knowledge of it , between feeling and familiarity , and between the understanding of how we reason and feel about security and our analyses and feelings .
We 're never going to stop making security trade - offs based on the feeling of security , and we 're never going to completely prevent those with specific agendas from trying to take care of us .
But the more we know , the better trade - offs we 'll make .

Inside the Twisted Mind of the Security Professional
The Myth of the ' Transparent Society '
David Brin Rebuts Schneier In Defense of a Transparent Society
“ If the male is successful in forming a friendship with a female , that gives him an opening with her relatives and allows him to work his way into the whole female network , ” said Barbara Smuts , a biologist at the University of Michigan .
“ In olive baboons , friendships with females can be much more important than political alliances with other males . ”
Because males are often the so - called dispersing sex , while females stay behind in the support network of their female kin , females form the political backbone among many social mammals ; the longer - lived the species , the denser and more richly articulated that backbone is likely to be .
With life spans rivaling ours , elephants are proving to possess some of the most elaborate social networks yet observed , and their memories for far - flung friends and relations are well in line with the species ’ reputation .
Elephant society is organized as a matriarchy , said George Wittemyer , an elephant expert at the University of California , Berkeley , with a given core group of maybe 10 elephants led by the eldest resident female .
That core group is together virtually all the time , traveling over considerable distances , stopping to dig water holes , looking for fresh foliage to uproot and devour .
“ They ’re constantly making decisions , debating among themselves , over food , water and security , ” Dr. Wittemyer said .
“ You can see it in the field .
You can hear them vocally disagree . ”
Typically , the matriarch has the final say , and the others abide by her decision .
If a faction disagrees strongly enough and wants to try a different approach , “ the group will split up and meet back again later , ” said Dr. Wittemyer .
Age has its privileges , he said , and the older females , even if they are not the biggest , will often get the best spots to sleep and the best food to eat .
But it also has its responsibilities , and a matriarch is often the one to lead the charge in the face of conflicts with other elephants or predatory threats , sometimes to lethal effect .
Hal Whitehead of Dalhousie University and his colleagues have found surprising parallels between the elephant and another mammoth mammal , the sperm whale , possessor of the largest brain , in absolute terms , that the world has ever known .
As with elephants , sperm whale society is sexually segregated , the females clustering in oceanic neighborhoods 40 degrees north or south of the Equator , and the males preferring waters around the poles .
As with elephants , the core social unit is a clan of some 10 or 12 females and their offspring .
Sperm whales also are highly vocal .
They communicate with one another using a Morse code - like pattern of clicks .
Each clan , Dr. Whitehead said , has a distinctive click dialect that the members use to identify one another and that adults pass to the young .
In other words , he said , “ It looks like they have a form of culture . ”
Nobody knows what the whales may have to click and clack about , but it could be a form of voting  time to stop here and synchronously dive down in search of deep water squid , now time to resurface , move on , dive again .
Clans also seem to caucus on which males they like and will mate with more or less as a group and which ones they will collectively spurn .
By all appearances , female sperm whales are terrible size queens .
Over the generations , they have consistently voted in favor of enhanced male mass .
Their dream candidate nowadays is some fellow named Moby , and he ’s three times their size .
Lawyer questions whether Spitzer was set up , noting political prosecutions RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday March 11 , 2008

This A prominent New York lawyer who has written for Harper 's Magazine about the politically - motivated dismissals of US Attorneys in the Bush Justice Department says he believes there 's a strong case that the fall of New York governor Eliot Spitzer was politically motivated .
Spitzer was caught on a federal wiretap discussing plans to meet a high - priced prostitute in Washington , D.C.
The news was first reported Monday afternoon in The New York Times .
Later that day , however , ABC News ' Brian Ross revealed that federal sources said the prosecution stemmed from an investigation of Spitzer 's finances -- not from the prostitution ring .
" The suspicious financial activity was initially reported by a bank to the IRS which , under direction from the Justice Department , brought kin the FBI 's Public Corruption Squad , " Ross wrote .
" We had no interest at all in the prostitution ring until the thing with Spitzer led us to learn about it , " a Justice Department official told Ross .
Tuesday 's Times added : " The rendezvous that established Gov. Eliot Spitzers involvement with high - priced prostitutes occurred last month in one of Washingtons grandest hotels , but the criminal investigation that discovered the tryst began last year in a nondescript office building opposite a Dunkin Donuts on Long Island ...
There , in the Hauppauge offices of the Internal Revenue Service , investigators conducting a routine examination of suspicious financial transactions reported to them by banks found several unusual movements of cash involving the governor of New York , several officials said . "
" Because the focus was a high - ranking government official , prosecutors were required to seek the approval of the United States attorney general to proceed , " they added .
" Once they secured that permission , the investigation moved forward . "
Horton does n't buy it .
" Note that this prosecution was managed with staffers from the Public Integrity Section at the Department of Justice , " Horton writes on his blog , " No Comment . "
" This section is now at the center of a major scandal concerning politically directed prosecutions .
During the Bush Administration , his Justice Department has opened 5.6 cases against Democrats for every one involving a Republican . "
In his post at Harper 's , Horton notes : ( 1 ) The prosecutors handling the case came from the Public Integrity Section .
( 2 ) The prosecution is opened under the White - Slave Traffic Act of 1910 .
You read that correctly .
The statute itself is highly disreputable , and most of the high - profile cases brought under it were politically motivated and grossly abusive .
Here are a few : * Heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson was the first man prosecuted under the act  for having an affair with Lucille Cameron , whom he later married .
The prosecution was manifestly an effort  to get 
Johnson , who at the time was the most famous African - American .
( All of this is developed well in Ken Burnss film  Unforgiveable Blackness 
* University of Chicago sociologist William I. Thomas was prosecuted for having an affair with an officers wife in France .
Thomas was targeted because of his Bohemian social and his radical political views .
* In 1944 Charles Chaplin was prosecuted for having an affair with actress Joan Barry .
The prosecution again provided cover for a politically motivated effort to drive Chaplin out of the country .
* Canadian author Elizabeth Smart was arrested and charged in 1940 while crossing the border with the British poet George Barker .
(3) The resources dedicated to the case in terms of prosecutors and investigators are extraordinary .
( 4 ) How the investigation got started .
The Justice Department has yet to give a full account of why they were looking into Spitzers payments , and indeed the suggestion in the ABC account is that it didnt have anything to do with a prostitution ring .
The suggestion that this was driven by an IRS inquiry and involved a bank might heighten , rather than allay , concerns of a politically motivated prosecution .
" The answer of the Justice Department to all this is likely to be : Trust us , " Horton concludes .
" This has nothing to do with Spitzers guilt or innocence .
But it has everything to do with the fading integrity of the Public Integrity Section . "
Baldelli has appeared in 127 of a possible 486 games the last three seasons .
And — surprise ! — he will begin this season on the disabled list .
His latest DL - inducing " injury " is exhaustion .
Who does he think he is , Mariah Carey ?
And what is he exhausted from , the off - season ?
I was actually kinda shocked by this one .
Kevin Hench has decided to take some shots at Rocco Baldelli on his " Hit List .
" " Well , Rocco , we 've been looking over the tests . " " And ?
What is it , doc ?
Give it to me straight . "
" SURPRISE !
You have an extremely rare combination of metabolic and mitochrondrial abnormalities , which prevent the muscles in your legs from working and recovering properly .
" Baldelli 's condition is straight up unfunny .
Doctors still have n't pinpointed the nature of his disease , but they know that it will affect his ability to perform the most basic of baseball skills .
He 's 26 years old , and his once promising career is probably over .
And Kevin Hench is going to put the word " injury " in quotes ?
As if it 's fake ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?
I prefer Julio Lugo 's response : “ I read it in the newspaper and my heart dropped , ” he said .
Again , there is nothing funny about this .
Kevin Hench owes Rocco Baldelli an apology .
Simple as that .
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
no his mitochondria are n't working properly .

Get It
Try It Code at a link below could totally toast your system if you access it with the Apple Safari web browser .
There 's a likelihood this was discovered on Windows machines so it should work there too .
This has only been tested on Intel boxes but the likelihood is it works on any boxes running Safari - perhaps even the Apple iPhone .
JavaScript must be toggled on ; after that it 's all over .
If you do decide to subject your system to this ' ordeal ' you should be prepared : there should be no permanent damage but you 'd do well to secure everything on your system first .
By that is meant you should close all open applications and documents and if you 're running the latest version ( 3.1/5525.18 ) prepare to do a power reboot .
Power Reboot
You accomplish a power reboot by holding down ctrl - cmd - power button ( ⌃⌘- power ) .
[ Windows users will have to figure out their own shortcut before beginning . ]
You will need to do this if you are running the latest version of Safari .
Earlier versions ( 2.x ) are also toast but they wo n't take down your entire system .
YMMV but Safari 3.1/5525.18 will most likely take down your entire system .
Damage Control Hold down ⌘S - ' single user mode ' - when rebooting your system .
Once in single user mode run the following command until you 're told the file system 's OK .
/ sbin / fsck - fy Note : this hack does not normally corrupt anything in your file system but it 's best to be careful .
What to Expect With versions of Safari prior to the latest 3.1/5525.18 you 'll probably just see Safari disappear .
There will be no crash log anywhere and no notice the application is going down .
Neither will there be the obsequious panel to send something to Apple .
Safari will just be gone .
Poof .
With the latest version of Safari things get a bit hairier .
Your system will spin totally out of control .
You wo n't be able to run any other applications or ' force quit ' Safari or anything .
You 'll be toast .
The only way you have out is a power reboot - so make sure you know how to do it before you begin .
Safari may also accumulate a lot of ' junk ' in your ' Caches ' directory .
This can simply be removed .
For some curious reason the application - regardless of version - creates ' web bookmark ' files for all your bookmarks .
Here 's a listing for the aftermath of the meltdown test on an earlier version 2.x of Safari . total 1136 drwxr - xr-x 144 davehyatt appleinc 4896 Apr 25 15:31 .

Most companies realize that having top - notch software developers can have a significant impact on the success of their software projects .
So how do you identify the best software developers during the hiring process ?
Many companies realize that the difference in productivity between a " rock - star " programmer and an average performer can be huge , by a factor of 10:100 .
As a result many companies are desperate to attract the creme - de - la - creme of programmers .
However , most job interviews are constructed in a manner that overlooks many excellent candidates .
The following is a list of tips for how to improve your interview process when looking for top - notch programmers :
Stop thinking that " only the top 1 percent will do " .
The top 1 percent is actually a misnomer , because different people are top performers in different circumstances .
No one is a " rock - star " all the time .
The reality is that our profession attracts lots of very talented , smart , and creative people .
Given the right circumstances , about 25 percent of the candidates you will encounter can be top performers .
Make the interview process a low - stress and relaxed environment .
Programmers do their best work " in the zone " , which is hard to get in to in a single hour .
It like judging marathon runners based on how well they run the 100 - meter dash .
The really outstanding candidates are very hard to recognize on paper and in interviews .
They can sometimes be shy , or nervous , or not particularly good at promoting themselves .
Give the candidate lots of opportunities to show what they are made of .
Work with the candidate to help them demonstrate their abilities .
You want to create a positive environment that makes interviewees feel safe .
Do n't expect the best candidates to tell you that they are the best candidates .
They better someone is , the more likely they are to be humble .
Be aware about who is conducting the interview .
An interviewer who has insecurities may have a desire to bring down the candidate to make themselves feel better about their own achievements .
Tell programmers in advance ( at least a day or two , if not more ) what you will be asking questions about .
In the real world we have time to prepare for meetings , and to propose solutions to problems .
This is a job interview , not a high - school exam .
Interviews need to be be much longer than an hour , and should not be on a stop - watch .
Programming is not a high intensity quick - fire activity .
I think of traditional one - hour interviews ( or series of one - hour interviews ) like judging marathoners by their ability to sprint .
Do n't let non-technical people filter resumes .
Some companies filter resumes according to traditional techniques .
Certain key accomplishments are going to be overlooked by non-programmers , whereas a software engineer would more likely catch the significance of these items .
Potential hires are as important as customers , so treat them as customers .
A well - run business is only successful because of its employees , and the employees will generate many times their cost in revenue ( directly or indirectly ) .
The trend nowadays is to treat applicants as people begging for change and that they are lucky if you choose to respond to their questions .
Hire people , do n't fill positions .
Talented programmers can adapt to any scenario .
Do n't get hung up on the details of the specific technical knowledge .
Do not misrepresent your job demands and search for overqualified people .
Be honest to yourself and the applicant about the level of technical expertise that is really needed .
Do not automatically reject overqualified applicants if they are aware of the job requirements .
People sometimes want a job that is technically less demanding , so that they have more free time , and less stress .
Get to know an employee 's strengths and passions .
Do n't just ask about " one project they are proud of " .
It takes more than a single question , and five minutes to really get know what a person is passionate about .
Open -ended problem solving challenges are good , but do n't just give just one puzzle and judge the candidate based on the outcome .
Puzzles often require " eureka moments " to solve .
Problem solving in general requires a certain amount of inspiration and creativity , which can't be summoned on a moment 's notice , and requires a certain amount of relaxation .
Letting the programmer choose can relax them , and bolster their confidence in the interview process .
Do n't test people 's knowledge of language specifications .
In our jobs we have access to books , people , and the Internet .
Good programmers know how to look up references , and use their tools effectively to write code .
Not everyone can properly use reference manuals , and apply them to specific problems .
When testing programmers , consider a take - home portion of the exam .
Give people a chance to go home and relax , and see what they come up with .
People have most of their moments of brilliance in the shower , or while they are lying in bed .
When interviewing recreate the working environment , provide a computer , compiler , and access to the Internet .
Do n't ask programmers to write on a whiteboard .
Some have been using a keyboard for so long , they can barely write their own name with a pen .
Adapt your interview process to slow thinkers .
Programming is a job that is a good fit for people that like to think long and slow about a problem before solving it .
It sometimes takes a programmer an hour or two sometimes to do simple stuff , however when they hit the zone they can churn out reams and reams of really complex code in a very short time .
Give a long list of programming problems , and let the candidate approach it how they want .
Programming is not a linear activity , we do something here and something there , and pull it together in the end .
By letting a programmer choose their problems , you may be surprised that they choose to solve the harder problems with ease , or conversely they may choose to try to solve the traveling salesman problem in an interview indicating a certain level of naivete .
You can gain a lot by observing a candidate 's thought process in a more open - ended environment .
Do n't judge too harshly negatively based on one or two mistakes .
A bad assumption is that if someone makes a basic mistake then they automatically suck , and can't possibly be good , even if they are capable of amazing coding feats .
There can be many reasons for a mistake , especially in a stressful and artificial environment like an interview .
You need to give people as many opportunites to succeed as possible in the interview process , to reveal all the potential top- performers .
In summary my advice is to try and recreate the working environment when interviewing and evaluating programmers .
Try and give them every opportunity to expose their qualities .
No matter how much opportunity you give them , mediochre programmers will simply never really impress you , but the really talented people will sometimes only shine brightly if you have aim the light just right .
Full Transcript : Exclusive Obama Interview
ABC News Anchor Terry Moran Talks to Sen. Barack Obama
The following is an unedited transcript of an interview between ABC News ' Terry Moran and Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , Tuesday , after Obama 's speech addressing the issue of race and his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , in Philadelphia .
TERRY MORAN : So what was your goal with this speech ?
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA :
You know , what I wanted to do was provide context for not just the controversy that 's swirled around my former pastor over the last couple of days , but for a shift in tone that we 've been seeing in the campaign , both in the coverage and the comments of both my supporters , Sen. Clinton's .
You could see race bubbling up in a way that was distracting from the issues that I think are so important to America right now .
So what I wanted to do was to , rather than try to tamp it down , lift it up and see if maybe that would help clarify where we are as a nation right now on the issues .
MORAN : Given your candidacy , race was bound to bubble up in this campaign at some point .
So was this a speech that you always planned to give or knew you had to ?
OBAMA : I expected that at some stage we'd have to give it .
Now , I 'm not sure that we expected that it would come up in the way that it did .
But it was unrealistic to anticipate that , during the course of this campaign , if not now then certainly in the general election , that this was not going to be an issue that had to be addressed .
This is a big leap for the country .
Even me being the nominee is a big leap and then , obviously , actually being the president is a big leap .
And , you know , what I want to do is to make sure that we understand that my campaign is not premised on that , it 's not premised on making history , but that , whoever is president , this is always going to be an ongoing issue that we have to struggle with and that , perhaps , I can lend some special insight into it .
But it 's nothing that 's going to be unique to my presidency .
It 's been something that presidents throughout our history have or have not dealt with , but it 's always been there .
MORAN : Now , things are changing in this campaign .
Race is emerging as an issue .
In the Mississippi primary , you won 92 percent of the black vote , just 26 percent of the white vote .
Given what 's happening , do you feel this is a make - or - break moment for your candidacy ?
OBAMA : You know , I do n't think it 's a make - or - break moment .
I mean , if you just look at the mathematics and the popular vote of the campaign , we 're in a good place .
But one of the things that I 've always believed is that this campaign could n't just be about me , my ambitions , winning a nomination , that the process itself had to reflect the changes I say I 'm going to bring about when I 'm president .
And I do think this was a moment in the campaign where maybe I rediscovered a core truthfulness to the campaign that sometimes you lose during the course of campaigning .
There were times before Texas and Ohio where you 're there , and there are these big rallies , and people are yelling and screaming , and having a great time , and you are just -- you 're giving your stump , and you 've been giving it now for three months , and it becomes a performance , as opposed to really tapping into some of these essential challenges that the country faces in a meaningful and serious way .
And I think this was an opportunity for me to pull back for a second and say , " OK , hold on a second .
What is it that you 're trying to accomplish ?
What are the conflicts and contradictions that are preventing us from solving health care or education or these other issues ?
And what do you really have to say about it ?
What is it that 's specific to you that you have to contribute ? "
And so , in that sense , I think it was a good moment for our campaign .
MORAN : Let 's talk about Rev. Wright , your former pastor .
Some of the things that Rev. Wright has said in those little clips that are making their way around , " God damn America , " for example , blaming this country for 9/11 , are so troubling , so hurtful to people that they ask legitimately , " What does it tell us about Barack Obama , about his judgment , that he was a member of this man 's congregation ? "
How do you answer that ?
OBAMA : Well , as I said in the speech , this is somebody who'd preached for 30 years , probably three times on a Sunday and multiple times during the week , so we can do the math , but there are a lot of seconds there of talking .
And essentially what 's been created is a montage of some very offensive and disturbing language .
And I do n't excuse it at all ; I 've condemned it unequivocally .
But the person I know is somebody who , for 20 or 30 years , has been leading one of the pillars of the African - American community on the south side of Chicago as a church of tremendous breadth and depth , its ministries on everything from HIV - AIDS to providing care for the poor to providing day - care services for the community .
It is a member of the United Church of Christ , which is a 99 percent white denomination .
And so the church gets visitors constantly from other UCC members .
And if you talk to them , they would always tell you that this is a welcoming , diverse church .
So , in that sense , it was a caricature .
Now , what I also said was that Rev. Wright is somebody who , for all his good qualities , is somebody that I 've had strong disagreements with for a very long time , but he 's somebody who helped to introduce me to my Christian faith .
He is somebody who married Michelle and I .
He baptized our kids .
He was on the brink of retirement during the course of this year when some of these very offensive comments came to light , which is n't to say that I had n't heard him say controversial things before , things I did n't agree with before , but nothing that was so visceral and incendiary .
And my point , I think , was that you do n't disown certainly the church , but you do n't even disown a man simply because he says something that you profoundly and deeply disagree with .
At least I was n't in -- that is not something that I would have been comfortable to do .
What I can do is condemn the man -- condemn the words , but not condemn the man .
MORAN : Well , let me press you on that .
If I went to a church where white supremacy was preached , what would you think of me ?
OBAMA : Well , but , see , I disagree with you , though , Terry .
That 's not what 's preached at Trinity .
And that , I think , that is an easy equivalence that is not at all what is taking place there .
If you look at the sermons , even the most offensive ones that are at issue , he is condemning white racism , as he defines it , but he is not condemning the white race .
He is not suggesting that blacks are superior .
What he 's saying is , is that this -- that white racism is endemic in the society .
Now , that 's something that I disagree with and I said in this speech today .
And it 's reflective of , I think , an anger and bitterness that is part of the black community 's experience .
It is a legacy of our past that is n't going away anytime soon .
But in each successive generation , it hopefully lessens its grip .
And he has , in some ways , he has reason to be angry and bitter .
I mean , here 's somebody who grew up in the '50s and the '60s .
He 's gone through things that you and I never went through .
And so I think what was revealing in this whole episode was the degree to which I think large portions of white America were shocked or surprised that a lot of black people are still really angry about slavery and Jim Crow and segregation and discrimination , absolutely .
And I pointed out in the speech , that anger is n't necessarily healthy .
In fact , often times it 's self - destructive .
More often , it is internalized in all kinds of ways .
I mean , that 's part of what we see in the inner city , where that anger and bitterness is turned inward , and kids shoot each other and take drugs and end up in jail sometimes .
Sometimes it expresses itself outwardly in ways that are offensive to the larger community .
You remember when , during the O.J. trial , there was a similar moment when the culture -- you know , black and white culture just had these completely opposite reactions and nobody understood it .
And , by the way , I 'm somebody who was pretty clear that O.J. was guilty .
And I was ashamed for my own community to respond in that way , but I also understood what was taking place , which was that reaction had more to do with a sense that somehow the criminal justice system historically had been biased so profoundly that a defeat of that justice system was somehow a victory .
Now , that is an example of how unproductive that anger is and how we have to get beyond it , but it 's there .
And so that 's why I said during the speech , in some ways for me to completely disown Rev.
Wright is for me to disown the African - American community , because he embodies all the contradictions .
You know , this is why , during the course of this campaign , there have been moments where people say , " Well , I like Barack Obama , but not Al Sharpton .
I like Colin Powell , but not Jesse .
I like Oprah , but , " you know , those of us who are African - American do n't have that luxury .
And so what I can do then is to say , " Here 's what I believe .
Here 's what I think .
Here 's where I think America needs to go . "
MORAN : What do you mean you do n't have the luxury ?
OBAMA : I do n't have the luxury of separating myself out and being selective , in terms of what it means to be African - American in this society .
It 's a big , complex thing .
It 's not monolithic .
MORAN : It seems to me that one of the things you were trying to do in this speech is say out loud , in public what we say in private within our different groups .
OBAMA : Right , exactly .
And hopefully , I accurately captured not just what blacks say privately , but of what whites say privately .
And that 's part of -- you know , one strength I do have is that I 've got a foot in each camp , right ?
You know , since I 'm half - white and was raised by a white mom and white grandparents , I have a little more insight into those white resentments , again that are also rooted in history , and some of which are legitimate .
I mean , you think about the experience of whites in a place like Boston or Scranton , Pennsylvania , where , at time of economic stress and difficulty , suddenly blacks are moving in and kids are being bused , and there 's some sense that the economic competition is being tilted unfairly because of affirmative action , right ?
And , you know , there 's street crime , because the blacks may be of lower income .
And so it feels like neighborhoods are being destroyed , and that anger builds up , and that resentment builds up .
MORAN : And is n't that the nerve that Geraldine Ferraro touched …
( CROSSTALK )
OBAMA : Absolutely .
Absolutely .
She 's from Queens .
MORAN : … she was interpreted as saying you 're an affirmative action candidate .
OBAMA : Right .
Well , you know , you think about her generation and her background , coming from a neighborhood in New York that went through some of those same things .
And I 'm sure that that is part of what 's in her mind .
And it 's a mistake then to simply tag it as racist .
It 's not -- that 's not what 's going on .
There is somebody who is shaped by a series of experiences with race in this country .
And those things we do n't talk about and , as a consequence , they get -- they go underground , but there are strong subterranean currents , and they shape our politics very powerfully .
MORAN : So this is a moment maybe where -- some people might put it this way :
Do you consider yourself a black man or an American first ?
OBAMA : An American , absolutely .
MORAN : Is there a difference between black patriotism and white patriotism ?
OBAMA : No , I do n't think so .
I mean , what I think is that the African - American community is much more familiar with some of the darker aspects of American life and American history and so is less -- here 's a good way to describe it .
You know , I think that they understand much less as a marching band playing John Philip Sousa and they understand America much more as a jazz composition , with blue notes .
And I think those are different things .
And so the African - American community can express great rage and anger about this country and love it all the same , in a way that probably is less familiar to white America .
MORAN : And I suppose some people might ask , is that giving an excuse for the expression of anti-American sentiments , simply because they come from a black person ?
OBAMA : Well , it does n't excuse it .
It just describes a reality .
And , look , I mean , I think it is very important -- and I tried to raise this in a speech -- for white America to understand that this anger is not based on nothing .
The anger is based on slavery and Jim Crow and a history that continues to have powerful sway over our daily lives .
And I know that one of the most difficult things about race in this country is that white America is much more likely to say , " That was in the past , so forget about it .
Let it go . "
MORAN : They 'll say , " I did n't do that . "
OBAMA : " I did n't do it . "
( CROSSTALK )
OBAMA : Exactly .
" So why are we focused on that ? "
And black America is saying , " The violence that was committed then under Jim Crow now expresses itself or is tied to the street crime that I 'm having to deal with in my neighborhood or in my own family .
The destruction of my great - grandfather 's farm back then is directly related to the financial troubles I 'm having now . "
I mean , those connections are made in the black community .
And so part of what we have to do is , on the one hand , the African - American community has to say to itself -- and this is our job -- it is to say that we can affirm and acknowledge that tragic history , but not be trapped by it , not be obsessed by it , not use this as an excuse or a crutch for our responsibilities in moving ourselves forward as a community , and individuals taking responsibility for their own success , and walking through the doors of opportunity that have been busted open for us .
On the other hand , white America , I think , has to take the time to say , " You know what ?
That history is powerful and painful .
And I understand that , because of that history , there remain profound inequalities in this country and we as a country have an obligation to deal with them .
It 's not just something that we can shove aside or sweep under the rug . "
And if those two transformations in attitudes could take place , we 're still going to have conflicts , there are still going to be differences , but we can make progress .
MORAN : Do you really think you can do this , that your candidacy can help to change the racial dialogue , the way we deal with race ?
OBAMA : Well , I was very clear in the campaign -- you know , I 've never been so naive as to think that one election cycle or , as I put it , my candidacy , as imperfect as it is , could somehow change entirely 300 years of history .
I think , instead , this campaign offers an opportunity for America to think about some of these issues and engage them in a more honest way .
But that 's just one of the opportunities .
I mean , hopefully , what I 'm trying to do in this campaign is to do the same thing that maybe I was able to do about race , to talk about the economy or talk about our foreign policy or talk about our obligations to each other with that same sense of a complex truth , you know , not simplifying things , not sound - biting things , seeing if we can dig , scratch a little deeper .
MORAN : There 's a political risk for you here , though , is n't there ?
By embracing race , you might become the race candidate .
And that 's a limiting …
OBAMA : Absolutely .
And so , you know , hopefully this is something that we have talked about , we 've lifted up , it will spur discussion , like Robert Kennedy 's wonderful metaphor , " ripples of hope . "
You know , you throw a rock into a pond and those ripples will go out .
We do n't know where those ripples will go .
I have no idea how this plays out politically .
But I think it was important to do .
And in a couple of days , I 'll be talking about Iraq and national security , back on the trail .
MORAN : One more .
You mentioned your wife , Michelle 's , heritage in this speech .
What kind of advice has she given you on these matters ?
OBAMA : You know , Michelle and most of my black friends I think were much more confident and calm about me giving this speech .
My white friends and advisers were much more nervous .
MORAN : Why ?
What 's the difference ?
OBAMA : I think that -- you know , the African - American community deals with this , grapples with this in ways that the white community just does n't .
I mean , I think this makes the larger society nervous and it's easier to disengage from it .
I think there are a lot of African - Americans who would love to be able to not worry about race , but somehow it encroaches upon them .
You know , it 's the classic example -- and this is a common experience .
I think most African - Americans will share it .
If there is some horrendous crime out there , black people are always a little nervous until they see the picture , hoping that it 's not a black person who committed it .
A white person never thinks that way , because you , Terry Moran , would never assume that if there is some white male who fits your description who , you know , went on a rampage that somehow people are going to think of you differently .
Black people , they worry about that .
So that 's an example of how those realities are different and it means that the African - American community views these things in a different way and feels as if talking about it is important .
MORAN : Thank you .
OBAMA : Thanks .
On Friday , Expelled made $ 1,200,000 .
On Saturday , receipts totaled less than $ 1,000,000 .
On Sunday , the movie made even less than that .
Expelled was the only movie on the weekend box office list to make less money on Saturday than Friday .
I ’d still like to see the comparison of how much the movie cost to make versus how much it made in theaters … but it ’s doubtful that anyone will be able to call it “ successful ” by any conventional means .

When 435 Congressmen exercise almost unlimited power to spend and then shift the bill to every other American , the result is what we have today — out - of - control federal spending .
This spending has resulted in a national debt of over $ 9 trillion .
In truth , the Constitution of the United States does not provide this unlimited power .
Yet because , as a nation , we have lost our collective understanding of constitutional principles , Congressmen behave as though they have this power .
Our collective lack of understanding is further revealed by the simple observation that most candidates seeking office , at all levels , make promises of expanding spending into new areas .
In the presidential campaign , last week ’s focus was on a Clinton aide ’s comments on Obama ’s youthful drug use and Huckabee ’s repulsive bigotry against Mormons .
With this , the public focus is turned away from the fact that all three of these candidates have proposed an expanded role for the federal government .
Of course , character issues are important ; but the media devotes proportionally little time to issues such as the role of the federal government in the economy .
To the media , it is simply a given that all “ good ” and “ serious ” candidates will support an expanded role for government .
Sometimes a good story can go a long way to help us reflect on the basic values and principles that help determine the size of government .
American folk hero Davy Crockett , who died at the Battle of the Alamo , serves up a helpful story .
Crockett served three terms in the U.S. Congress from 1827 - 1831 and again from 1833 - 1835 .
An 1884 book The Life of Colonel David Crockett by Edward Sylvester Ellis relates the origins of Crockett ’s most famous congressional speech .
This speech has been commonly referred to as “ Not Yours to Give . ”
As the 2008 candidates engage in a bidding war of promises to spend other people ’s money , Ellis ’s account can help stimulate dialogue on the principles that help determine the role of government .
One day in the House of Representatives a bill was taken up appropriating money for the benefit of a widow of a distinguished naval officer .
Several beautiful speeches had been made in its support .
The speaker was just about to put the question when Crockett arose :
“ Mr. Speaker –I have as much respect for the memory of the deceased , and as much sympathy for the suffering of the living , if there be , as any man in this House , but we must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for part of the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living .
I will not go into an argument to prove that Congress has not the power to appropriate this money as an act of charity .
Every member on this floor knows it .
We have the right as individuals , to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity ; but as members of Congress we have no right to appropriate a dollar of the public money .
Some eloquent appeals have been made to us upon the ground that it is a debt due the deceased .
Mr. Speaker , the deceased lived long after the close of the war ; he was in office to the day of his death , and I ever heard that the government was in arrears to him .
“ Every man in this House knows it is not a debt .
We cannot without the grossest corruption , appropriate this money as the payment of a debt .
We have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as charity .
Mr. Speaker , I have said we have the right to give as much money of our own as we please .
I am the poorest man on this floor .
I cannot vote for this bill , but I will give one week ’s pay to the object , and if every member of Congress will do the same , it will amount to more than the bill asks . ”
He took his seat .
Nobody replied .
The bill was put upon its passage , and , instead of passing unanimously , as was generally supposed , and as , no doubt , it would , but for that speech , it received but few votes , and , of course , was lost .
Later , when asked by a friend why he had opposed the appropriation , Crockett gave this explanation :
“ Several years ago I was one evening standing on the steps of the Capitol with some members of Congress , when our attention was attracted by a great light over in Georgetown .
It was evidently a large fire .
We jumped into a hack and drove over as fast as we could .
In spite of all that could be done , many houses were burned and many families made houseless , and besides , some of them had lost all but the clothes they had on .
The weather was very cold , and when I saw so many children suffering , I felt that something ought to be done for them .
The next morning a bill was introduced appropriating $ 20,000 for their relief .
We put aside all other business and rushed it through as soon as it could be done .
“ The next summer , when it began to be time to think about election , I concluded I would take a scout around among the boys of my district .
I had no opposition there but , as the election was some time off , I did not know what might turn up .
When riding one day in a part of my district in which I was more of a stranger than any other , I saw a man in a field plowing and coming toward the road .
I gauged my gait so that we should meet as he came up , I spoke to the man .
He replied politely , but as I thought , rather coldly .
“ I began : ‘ Well friend , I am one of those unfortunate beings called candidates and —
“ Yes I know you ; you are Colonel Crockett .
I have seen you once before , and voted for you the last time you were elected .
I suppose you are out electioneering now , but you had better not waste your time or mine , I shall not vote for you again . ”
“ This was a sockdolger … I begged him tell me what was the matter .
“ Well Colonel , it is hardly worthwhile to waste time or words upon it .
I do not see how it can be mended , but you gave a vote last winter which shows that either you have not capacity to understand the Constitution , or that you are wanting in the honesty and firmness to be guided by it .
In either case you are not the man to represent me .
But I beg your pardon for expressing it that way .
I did not intend to avail myself of the privilege of the constituent to speak plainly to a candidate for the purpose of insulting you or wounding you . ’
“ I intend by it only to say that your understanding of the constitution is very different from mine ; and I will say to you what but for my rudeness , I should not have said , that I believe you to be honest .
But an understanding of the constitution different from mine I cannot overlook , because the Constitution , to be worth anything , must be held sacred , and rigidly observed in all its provisions .
The man who wields power and misinterprets it is the more dangerous the honest he is . ’
” ‘ I admit the truth of all you say , but there must be some mistake .
Though I live in the backwoods and seldom go from home , I take the papers from Washington and read very carefully all the proceedings of Congress .
My papers say you voted for a bill to appropriate $ 20,000 to some sufferers by fire in Georgetown .
Is that true ?
“ Well my friend ; I may as well own up .
You have got me there .
But certainly nobody will complain that a great and rich country like ours should give the insignificant sum of $ 20,000 to relieve its suffering women and children , particularly with a full and overflowing treasury , and I am sure , if you had been there , you would have done just the same as I did . ’
“ It is not the amount , Colonel , that I complain of ; it is the principle .
In the first place , the government ought to have in the Treasury no more than enough for its legitimate purposes .
But that has nothing with the question .
The power of collecting and disbursing money at pleasure is the most dangerous power that can be entrusted to man , particularly under our system of collecting revenue by a tariff , which reaches every man in the country , no matter how poor he may be , and the poorer he is the more he pays in proportion to his means .
What is worse , it presses upon him without his knowledge where the weight centers , for there is not a man in the United States who can ever guess how much he pays to the government .
So you see , that while you are contributing to relieve one , you are drawing it from thousands who are even worse off than he .
If you had the right to give anything , the amount was simply a matter of discretion with you , and you had as much right to give $ 20,000,000 as $ 20,000 .
If you have the right to give at all ; and as the Constitution neither defines charity nor stipulates the amount , you are at liberty to give to any and everything which you may believe , or profess to believe , is a charity and to any amount you may think proper .
You will very easily perceive what a wide door this would open for fraud and corruption and favoritism , on the one hand , and for robbing the people on the other .
‘ No , Colonel , Congress has no right to give charity . ’
“ ‘ Individual members may give as much of their own money as they please , but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose .
If twice as many houses had been burned in this country as in Georgetown , neither you nor any other member of Congress would have Thought of appropriating a dollar for our relief .
There are about two hundred and forty members of Congress .
If they had shown their sympathy for the sufferers by contributing each one week ’s pay , it would have made over $ 13,000 .
There are plenty of wealthy men around Washington who could have given $ 20,000 without depriving themselves of even a luxury of life . ’
“ The congressmen chose to keep their own money , which , if reports be true , some of them spend not very creditably ; and the people about Washington , no doubt , applauded you for relieving them from necessity of giving what was not yours to give .
The people have delegated to Congress , by the Constitution , the power to do certain things .
To do these , it is authorized to collect and pay moneys , and for nothing else .
Everything beyond this is usurpation , and a violation of the Constitution . ’
“ ‘ So you see , Colonel , you have violated the Constitution in what I consider a vital point .
It is a precedent fraught with danger to the country , for when Congress once begins to stretch its power beyond the limits of the Constitution , there is no limit to it , and no security for the people .
I have no doubt you acted honestly , but that does not make it any better , except as far as you are personally concerned , and you see that I can not vote for you . ’
“ I tell you I felt streaked .
I saw if I should have opposition , and this man should go to talking and in that district I was a gone fawn - skin .
I could not answer him , and the fact is , I was so fully convinced that he was right , I did not want to .
But I must satisfy him , and I said to him :
“ Well , my friend , you hit the nail upon the head when you said I had not sense enough to understand the Constitution .
I intended to be guided by it , and thought I had studied it fully .
I have heard many speeches in Congress about the powers of Congress , but what you have said here at your plow has got more hard , sound sense in it than all the fine speeches I ever heard .
If I had ever taken the view of it that you have , I would have put my head into the fire before I would have given that vote ; and if you will forgive me and vote for me again , if I ever vote for another unconstitutional law I wish I may be shot . ’
“ He laughingly replied ; ‘ Yes , Colonel , you have sworn to that once before , but I will trust you again upon one condition .
You are convinced that your vote was wrong .
Your acknowledgment of it will do more good than beating you for it .
If , as you go around the district , you will tell people about this vote , and that you are satisfied it was wrong , I will not only vote for you , but will do what I can to keep down opposition , and perhaps , I may exert some little influence in that way . ’
“ If I do n’t , said I , ‘ I wish I may be shot ; and to convince you that I am in earnest in what I say I will come back this way in a week or ten days , and if you will get up a gathering of people , I will make a speech to them .
Get up a barbecue , and I will pay for it . ’
“ No , Colonel , we are not rich people in this section but we have plenty of provisions to contribute for a barbecue , and some to spare for those who have none .
The push of crops will be over in a few days , and we can then afford a day for a barbecue .
‘ This Thursday ; I will see to getting it up on Saturday week .
Come to my house on Friday , and we will go together , and I promise you a very respectable crowd to see and hear you .
“ ‘ Well I will be here .
But one thing more before I say good - bye .
I must know your name . ”
“ ‘ My name is Bunce . ’
“ ‘ Not Horatio Bunce ? ’
“ ‘ Yes
“ ‘ Well , Mr. Bunce , I never saw you before , though you say you have seen me , but I know you very well .
I am glad I have met you , and very proud that I may hope to have you for my friend . ’
“ It was one of the luckiest hits of my life that I met him .
He mingled but little with the public , but was widely known for his remarkable intelligence , and for a heart brim - full and running over with kindness and benevolence , which showed themselves not only in words but in acts .
He was the oracle of the whole country around him , and his fame had extended far beyond the circle of his immediate acquaintance .
Though I had never met him , before , I had heard much of him , and but for this meeting it is very likely I should have had opposition , and had been beaten .
One thing is very certain , no man could now stand up in that district under such a vote .
“ At the appointed time I was at his house , having told our conversation to every crowd I had met , and to every man I stayed all night with , and I found that it gave the people an interest and confidence in me stronger than I had ever seen manifested before .
“ Though I was considerably fatigued when I reached his house , and , under ordinary circumstances , should have gone early to bed , I kept him up until midnight talking about the principles and affairs of government , and got more real , true knowledge of them than I had got all my life before . ”
“ I have known and seen much of him since , for I respect him – no , that is not the word – I reverence and love him more than any living man , and I go to see him two or three times every year ; and I will tell you , sir , if every one who professes to be a Christian lived and acted and enjoyed it as he does , the religion of Christ would take the world by storm .
“ But to return to my story .
The next morning we went to the barbecue and , to my surprise , found about a thousand men there .
I met a good many whom I had not known before , and they and my friend introduced me around until I had got pretty well acquainted – at least , they all knew me .
“ In due time notice was given that I would speak to them .
They gathered up around a stand that had been erected .
I opened my speech by saying :
“ Fellow - citizens – I present myself before you today feeling like a new man .
My eyes have lately been opened to truths which ignorance or prejudice or both , had heretofore hidden from my view .
I feel that I can today offer you the ability to render you more valuable service than I have ever been able to render before .
I am here today more for the purpose of acknowledging my error than to seek your votes .
That I should make this acknowledgment is due to myself as well as to you .
Whether you will vote for me is a matter for your consideration only . ”
“ I went on to tell them about the fire and my vote for the appropriation and then told them why I was satisfied it was wrong .
I closed by saying :
“ And now , fellow - citizens , it remains only for me to tell you that the most of the speech you have listened to with so much interest was simply a repetition of the arguments by which your neighbor , Mr. Bunce , convinced me of my error .
“ It is the best speech I ever made in my life , but he is entitled to the credit for it .
And now I hope he is satisfied with his convert and that he will get up here and tell you so . ’
“ He came up to the stand and said :
“ Fellow - citizens – it affords me great pleasure to comply with the request of Colonel Crockett .
I have always considered him a thoroughly honest man , and I am satisfied that he will faithfully perform all that he has promised you today . ’
“ He went down , and there went up from that crowd such a shout for Davy Crockett as his name never called forth before . ’
“ I am not much given to tears , but I was taken with a choking then and felt some big drops rolling down my cheeks .
And I tell you now that the remembrance of those few words spoken by such a man , and the honest , hearty shout they produced , is worth more to me than all the honors I have received and all the reputation I have ever made , or ever shall make , as a member of Congress . ’
“ Now , sir , ” concluded Crockett , “ you know why I made that speech yesterday .
“ There is one thing which I will call your attention , “ you remember that I proposed to give a week ’s pay .
There are in that House many very wealthy men – men who think nothing of spending a week ’s pay , or a dozen of them , for a dinner or a wine party when they have something to accomplish by it .
Some of those same men made beautiful speeches upon the great debt of gratitude which the country owed the deceased–a debt which could not be paid by money–and the insignificance and worthlessness of money , particularly so insignificant a sum as $ 20,000 when weighed against the honor of the nation .
Yet not one of them responded to my proposition .
Money with them is nothing but trash when it is to come out of the people .
But it is the one great thing for which most of them are striving , and many of them sacrifice honor , integrity , and justice to obtain it . ”

Given all the crazies in the GOP , John McCain could spend the next six months denouncing most of his supporters .
Instead , McCain is trying to exploit the tenuous link Obama has to William Ayers .
( Thanks to team Clinton for getting that one out there . )
Okay , if McCain wants to play that way , we can play .
As the new leader of the GOP , McCain is now responsible for everyone in the GOP .
All of them .
We already saw that McCain ca n’t control ( or does n’t want to control ) the North Carolina GOP .
Fired Up Missouri asks the question about McCain and Tony Zirkle .
Normally , no one would ever try to tie a candidate to the Nazis .
But Republican Zirkle did it himself .
Yes , he did .
It happened earlier this week and in the news about the PA primary , we almost missed it .
You see , Zirkle is the Republican candidate for Congress from Indiana who showed up to celebrate Hitler ’s birthday with a bunch of Neo - Nazis .
Not kidding .
So , using McCain ’s own standards , it ’s fair game to ask what he thinks of Tony Zirkle .
This did n’t happen forty years ago , it happened this week .
Do the neo - Nazi / White supremacists have a place in the McCain / Zirkle GOP ?
It ’s a serious question .
No outrage from McCain has surfaced yet .
Now , the hard part is getting any of McCain ’s BFFs in the media to ask him the question .
Remember , the reporters who travel with McCain all know he ’s got a fierce , volatile temper so they do n’t want to piss him off .

And so our ongoing project to learn about evidence through nonsense enters its sixth improbable year .
This week , the assembled celebrity community and vitamin pill industry will walk us through the pitfalls of reading through a systematic review and meta- analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration , an international not for profit organisation set up 15 years ago to create transparent , systematic , unbiased reviews of the medical literature on everything from drugs , through surgery , to community interventions .
Last week Cochrane produced a comprehensive , gold standard review , looking at 67 trials describing the experiences of 230,000 people , which showed that antioxidant vitamin pills do not reduce deaths , and in fact may increase your chance of dying .
[ Summary here , full document here , plain language summary on page 2 ] .
In the Health Food Manufacturers Association press release , both Gloria Hunniford and Sir Cliff Richard issued their own definitive refutations .
Carole Caplin explained : “ It must be obvious to everyone who has n’t got a vested interest in supplements that this review is absolute rubbish , it contains fundamental flaws . ”
In a press release issued on behalf of the food supplement industry .
Criticising an academic collaboration which does not accept any corporate funding .
So what were these flaws ?
The entire pill community were worried by the way that trials were selected for inclusion in the group analysis .
Dr Rajendra Sharma , ex-head of the Harley Street -ish Hale Clinic – a man who advertises his use of a “ bioresonance ” machine called the Quantum Xrroid Consciousness Interface to diagnose his patients – explained science to the nation on More4 News .
“ The writers of this study started with 16,000 studies , and we ’re asking the question why did it go down to 68 , clearly there ’s a bias that we ’re not yet quite sure about . ”
Let the mystery be revealed .
The answer to his question can be found in figure 1 on page 156 of the Cochrane report ( which of course he read ) .
Of the 16,111 studies which the Cochrane authors found – by using various search terms in various databases – 12,703 were duplicates , 983 were in children and so not applicable to this review ’s predescribed remit , and so on .
Carole Caplin picks up the ball .
“ With nearly 750 studies to choose from , why did the researchers manage to focus on just 67 ?
That ’s less than nine per cent of the total number of clinical trials on antioxidants available . ”
Well , Carole .
Many of those trials were excluded simply because they were not the type of trials being looked at in the study – in accordance with the standard protocol for Cochrane reviews – but 400 trials were excluded because there were no deaths in them .
This Cochrane review was a study of deaths , comparing deaths on antioxidant pills to deaths on placebo pills .
You need deaths to be reported to put a trial in such an analysis .
These deathless trials were mostly small and brief , representing only 40,000 people in total ( page 5 , kids ) .
But in any case , as a precaution , the Cochrane authors did a re-analysis of their 230,000 people data , adding in hypothetical fake data , for the 40,000 people , with one death in each of the vitamin and placebo groups : it made no difference .
Carole may have skipped that part of the 191 page Cochrane report which she read in full and understood [ it ’s on page 7 ] .
“ This is n’t even a new study , ” continues Caplin : “ it ’s simply a re-hash of old work which was widely criticised in 2007 for its inaccuracies . ”
Interesting point , Carole .
This was indeed a reworking of an earlier review published in the journal JAMA , but updated , and in the format required by Cochrane , resulting in a report about 10 times longer than the original journal article .
I should hope it did incorporate criticisms from previous work in the same area : this is the whole point of publishing papers , and opening them to informed criticism .
A key question with all research is how to apply it in practice .
Are the interventions in the study comparable to the decisions in your real life ?
“ The analysis largely focused on extraordinarily and atypically high doses of antioxidant vitamins , ” explained David Adams of the HFMA : “ Supplement users would have some trouble trying to replicate this kind of daily intake . ”
Well , not that much trouble .
I went to Holland and Barrett .
In the Cochrane review , the mean dose of betacarotene was 18mg : H&B sell 100 capsules of 15 mg betacarotene for £ 7.49 .
So practically identical , then .
The mean dose of vitamin E was 570 IU : H&B sell 100 capsules of 1000IU – twice that dose – for £ 19.99 .
Perhaps David Adams thought nobody would check .
But my favourite insight comes from the actress Jenny Seagrove , and it is a valid one .
“ I ’m not going to be bullied by this dismal research paper – I am 100 % confident that the vitamins and mineral supplements I use are safe and effective and I will continue to use them when I choose . ”
This is the key move .
Do you put evidence into practice ?
Yes : not as an automaton , but at your discretion , taking into account not just the best possible evidence , but also the individuals ’ preferences .
That is the core of evidence based practice , so munch away , Jenny , and good luck to you .
But the publics ’ understanding of evidence is far more important than your vitamin pills , so show a little consideration .

Manufacturing Doubt :
The “ contriversy ” over this Cochrane meta- analysis has been well covered elsewhere , including DrAust , Holfordwatch , Holfordmyths , Quackometer and more .
In many ways what I found most striking were the similarities between the dissembling of the $ 60bn food supplement pill industry in this case , and the well established strategy of “ manufacturing doubt ” , first seen in the tobacco lobby ’s war with epidemiology over 40 years ago .
The history of this corporate strategy is very well covered in David Michaels ’ new book , Doubt is Their Product : How Industry ’s Assault on Science Threatens Your Health , on which there is an excellent essay here .
How To Make $ 100 k When Your Senator Is Caught With A Prostitute Posted by Pile ( 14909 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Get - Rich - Quick ]
Meet Gene Mills , head of the Louisiana Family Forum , a fundamentalist Christian activist group that is seeking " to develop a plan to promote better science education . "
Their plan basically involves introducing creationism and discrediting evolution and normal scientific principals .
In addition to promoting good , strong Christian values , the Louisiana Family Forum also is in the business of defending Senator David Vitter in the scandal over his use of prostitutes in both D.C. and LA .
And what 's the reward ?
David Vitter sneaks an earmark into the US Farm Bill funneling a hundred thousand dollars to the Louisiana Family Forum .
Hello ?
FBI ?
Anyone paying attention ?
Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , earmarked $ 100,000 in a spending bill for a Louisiana Christian group that has challenged the teaching of Darwinian evolution in the public school system and to which he has political ties .
The money is included in the labor , health and education financing bill for fiscal 2008 and specifies payment to the Louisiana Family Forum " to develop a plan to promote better science education . "
The earmark appears to be the latest salvo in a decades - long battle over science education in Louisiana , in which some Christian groups have opposed the teaching of evolution and , more recently , have pushed to have it prominently labeled as a theory with other alternatives presented .
Educators and others have decried the movement as a backdoor effort to inject religious teachings into the classroom .
The nonprofit Louisiana Family Forum , launched in Baton Rouge in 1999 by former state Rep. Tony Perkins , has in recent years taken the lead in promoting " origins science , " which includes the possibility of divine intervention in the creation of the universe .
The group 's stated mission is to " persuasively present biblical principles in the centers of influence on issues affecting the family through research , communication and networking . "
Until recently , its
Web site contained a " battle plan to combat evolution , " which called the theory a " dangerous " concept that " has no place in the classroom . "
The document was removed after a reporter 's inquiry .
The group 's tax - exempt status prohibits the Louisiana Family Forum from political activity , but Vitter has close ties to the group .
Dan Richey , the group 's grass - roots coordinator , was paid $ 17,250 as a consultant in Vitter 's 2004 Senate race .
From 1997 - 2004 , Richey served under appointment of Republican Governor Murphy J. " Mike " Foster , Jr. , as director of the federally - funded Governor 's Program on Abstinence .
Records also show that Vitter 's campaign employed Beryl Amedee , the education resource council chairwoman for the Louisiana Family Forum .
When Vitter 's use of a Washington , D.C. , call girl service drew comparisons last month to the arrest of Sen.
Larry Craig , R - Idaho , in what an undercover officer said was a solicitation for sex in an airport men's room , Family Forum Executive Director Gene Mills came to Vitter 's defense .
Critics said taxpayer money should not go to support a religion - based program .
" This is a misappropriation of public funds , " said Charles Kincade , a civil rights lawyer in Monroe who has been involved in church - state cases .
" It 's a backdoor attempt to push a religious agenda in the public school system . "

“ Big science is kicking smart new ideas out of of school …
What they forgot is that every generation has its Rebel !
Ben Stein blows the horn on suppression . ”
Touché !
“ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed ” has made Ben Stein the new hero of believers in God everywhere , and has landed a smart right cross to the protruding jaw of evolution ’s elite .
Stein is known for his dry , Droopy Dog demeanor , and for his diverse public career which included playing a memorable roll in the comedy movie , “ Ferris Bueller 's Day Off , ” on the one end , and the important task of presidential speech writer , on the other .
Here he serves as the documentary ’s globetrotting reporter .
Humorous film clips punctuate the movie , making what many might think a dry academic topic for theater - going into a smart romp and most enjoyable experience .
Audiences are applauding as credits roll , and people are leaving theaters empowered as they perceive a mighty chink has now been made in the armor surrounding our culture ’s impenetrable , atheistic , Darwinian monopoly .
There is little doubt that evolutionary belief and atheism go had in hand , as one after another of its intellectual proponents admit this to Stein .
When Darwinism is embraced , atheism is sure to follow as death follows decapitation , and this fact appears born out as the elite interviewees confess the sequence in their own lives and careers .
One Cornell University professor in the movie positively conceded that the end result of accepting evolution was , for him , the realization that there is no free will and no after - life .
This seems a peculiar and irrationally happy reaction to the prospect , and thinking people everywhere would find this a rather undesirable state of affairs , if true .
So much is at stake , and the conclusion of the godless mindset is neither certain nor very scientific .
In addition , Stein notes that “ evolution ’s top apologists have switched from defending Darwinism to attacking religion , ” and this is really the thing upon which the movie most concentrates .
Is the United States a freedom loving , free - thinking , intellectually inquisitive nation of cordial academic pursuit , or is it a politically correct , closed - minded arena of thought controlling , in - crowd Neanderthals ?
The latter seems to be the conclusion of internationals , and the audience will draw the same conclusion as professors and educators present their tales of discrimination , blacklisting , and defamation at the hands of the American evolutionary juggernaut and its related tentacles .
The evidence is clear that a glass ceiling exists for scientific professionals who would dare countenance the notion of God as an explanation for what they readily observe in their various disciplines , and one notable scientist ( who actually discovered a planet ) immediately lost tenure for merely suggesting other than the Darwinian status quo .
A clip or two of Nazi atrocities are shown in brief , which are never easy to look at , but which are included as evidence of the outcome of evolutionary embrace .
Stein comes from a Jewish background and traveled to Germany to examine some of the aftermath of Darwin ’s philosophy .
There he found the various crematoriums used in World War II built to destroy the less “ evolved ” of the human species as well as those “ less fit to survive . ”
The Berlin wall is also included as something of an illustration for what our own culture is doing with regard to scientific dissent .
The East Germans walled out the western ideas that might get across and upset its prevailing communistic philosophies , and so our own culture has erected non-material walls against one informed dissenting hypothesis , namely , Intelligent Design ( ID ) .
ID is not creationism , although the two are related .
The former seeks truth though scientific investigation and concludes an intelligent designer behind the vast information and mathematical intricacies so evident in observed “ creation . ”
Creationism starts with the intelligent Designer and argues for evidence to support the premise .
For Christians , God created the universe , and He did it according to what he has revealed to us in the Bible .
Good Christians disagree as to whether the Genesis account is to be understood in terms of literal days or day - ages , but most would contend that evolution is nowhere to be found in the process .
The religious contribution ID makes is that it validates a transcendent designer — which everyone naturally refers to as “ God . ”
What ID does n’t do is tell us which God , and it ’s up to us Christians to provide an intelligent witness and reasonable evidence for the God of Intelligent Design being the same God of inspired Scripture , the one incarnated as Jesus Christ .
What makes the movie worth every penny spent on popcorn and admission , are the blatant “ missing links ” found in the conclusions of all the evolution proponents throughout .
Stein would humbly ask for explanations , looking for inconvertible answers , yet was left amazed at what the responses all boiled down to .
What got the evolutionary process going to begin with ?
Perhaps inanimate crystals just gave way to biological organisms , was one answer .
What of the observed natural complexities in organisms that seemingly would require some sort of intelligent agency for existence ?
This was a good one .
Richard Dawkins , the infamous atheist , evolutionary biologist and author of The God Delusion — a man who hates the very notion of God and says every imaginably awful thing regarding Him — in the film , conceded that if the design had an agent it would be that of some extra terrestrial .
To hear that he would punt to Martians or little green men rather than God , brought to mind Romans 1:22 - 23 , “ Although they claimed to be wise , they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God … ” ( NIV ) .
All he did was leave the design question on another planet , rather than provide the solution .
ID is not a dead issue , because even those who oppose it cannot figure out how design in the universe got there , and despite whatever accusations they want to make against Christians and their faith , evolutionists also have faith , and it is blind .
Blind , because they will not turn aside to what can readily be observed and consider its more obvious consequence .
There is one minor expletive uttered , closely synonymous with “ Hades , ” but other than that there is little else to warn anyone about .
Perhaps the old - time stock footage showing a man with a cigarette will offend some , but this is about as objectionable as it gets .
I can say whole - heartedly that I recommend this film for Christians everywhere .
See it , and show it to your non-Christian friends .
I think you will enjoy the movie and glean some rich material for discussion afterward .
My only regret is that “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed ” is limited in its release .
Maybe with mass patronage , it will spread to wider exhibition .
Let ’s hope it does , because the emperor has no clothes , and this exposé makes it obvious .
Also , pray for our science community , because …
“ The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers , so that they cannot see … ” ( 2 Corinthians 4:4 NIV ) .

Production Information
There is a nation today in which scientists are being silenced and ousted , in which teachers and professors teach a theory as indisputable fact .
No , this is n’t a Third World dictatorship , it ’s America , as recorded in Ben Stein ’s controversial , satirical and entertaining documentary “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed . ”
Stein , the well - known television personality , actor and former White House presidential speechwriter , takes a journey across America and to Europe to explore the debate between proponents of intelligent design and Darwinian evolution .
What he discovers is an elitist scientific establishment that has traded in its skepticism for dogma .
Even worse , Stein uncovers a long line of scientists and philosophers who have had their reputations destroyed and their careers ruined by a scientific establishment that allows absolutely no dissent from Charles Darwin ’s theory of random mutation and natural selection .
What freedom - loving American would n’t be outraged ?
Says Stein , who is also a lawyer , economist , author and social commentator ,
“ Big Science in this area has lost its way .
Scientists are supposed to be allowed to follow the evidence wherever it may lead , no matter what the implications are .
Freedom of inquiry has been greatly compromised , and this is not only anti-science , it ’s anti-American . ”
Hosted and co-written by Stein , “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” is a Premise Media Corporation presentation of a Rampant Films Production .
It is directed by Nathan Frankowski , co-written by Kevin Miller and produced by Logan Craft , Walt Ruloff and John Sullivan .
The associate producer is Mark Mathis .
“ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” is being marketed by Motive Entertainment , which has spearheaded the grassroots marketing for blockbusters like “ The Passion of the Christ , ” “ Polar Express ” and “ The Chronicles of Narnia , ” and is being distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures .
The film is rated PG .
INTELLIGENT DESIGN
“ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” uncovers that educators and scientists are being ridiculed , denied tenure and even fired in some cases for believing there is evidence of intelligent design in nature , challenging the idea that life is the result of random chance .
What is intelligent design ?
It is a theory that attempts to empirically detect if the apparent design in nature acknowledged by virtually all biologists is genuine design or the product of an intelligent cause .
Darwinists , on the other hand , believe that all the myriad forms of life are the product of an undirected process : natural selection of the fittest acting on random mutations within organisms .
This documentary rejects the notion that the case is closed in favor of Darwinism and exposes the widespread persecution of scientists and educators who are pursuing legitimate , opposing scientific views to the reigning orthodoxy .
At stake are two very consequential views of existence :
Is life intelligently designed and purposeful ?
Or is it random and purposeless ?
Despite the seriousness of its topic , this is no boring academic thesis but a lively , entertaining and often humorous film that goes far beyond the static talking - heads format one might expect .
Director Nathan Frankowski said ,
“ We did n’t want to take ourselves too seriously .
But at the same time when we needed to be serious , we were . ”
THE EXPELLED
The creators of “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” crossed the globe over a two - year period interviewing scores of scientists , doctors , philosophers and public leaders on both sides of the divide .
Among them is Richard Sternberg , a double Ph.D. biologist who allowed a peer - reviewed research paper describing the evidence for intelligence in the universe to be published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington .
Not long after publication , officials from the Smithsonian Institution , where Sternberg was a research fellow , and the National Center for Science Education began a coordinated smear and intimidation campaign to get the promising young scientist expelled from his position .
The NCSE is , according to its Web site , a “ nationally recognized clearinghouse for information and advice to keep evolution in the science classroom and ‘ scientific creationism ’ out . ”
This attack on scientific freedom was so egregious that it prompted a Congressional investigation and report entitled Intolerance and the Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian , spearheaded by Rep. Mark Souder , Republican from Indiana , who was also interviewed for the film .
The Smithsonian failed to respond to repeated requests for an interview and ejected the “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” crew from its buildings and front steps when they showed up to pursue the issue .
Stein also interviewed other scientists such as astrobiologist Guillermo Gonzalez , who was denied tenure at Iowa State University in spite of his extraordinary record of achievement .
Gonzalez made the mistake of documenting the design he had observed in the universe .
There are others , such as Caroline Crocker , a brilliant biology teacher at George Mason University who was forced out of the university for briefly discussing problems with Darwinian theory and for telling the students that some scientists believe there is evidence of design in the universe .
The list goes on and on , including some who agreed to be interviewed only if they could remain anonymous and be filmed in silhouette for fear of being stigmatized by their colleagues .
Unlike some other documentary films , “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” does n’t just talk to people representing one side of the story .
The film interviews scientists such as Richard Dawkins , author of The God Delusion ; P.Z. Myers , influential biologist and atheist blogger ; and Eugenie Scott , head of the National Center for Science Education .
Others interviewed include Christopher Hitchens , author of God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything , who says the only thing intelligent in intelligent design is its name , and Michael Shermer , publisher of Skeptic magazine , who is , not surprisingly , skeptical that scientists are in fact being persecuted for not strictly hewing to the Darwinian line .
( Some interviewees who could not be included “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” for reasons of space will be included in the DVD release . )
Walt Ruloff , co-founder of Premise Media and one of the film ’s producers explains :
“ In ‘EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed , ’ we do n’t resort to manipulating our interviews for the purpose of achieving the shock effect , something that has become common in documentary film these days .
People will be stunned to actually find out what elitist scientists proclaim , which is that a large majority of Americans are simpletons who believe in a fairy tale .
Premise Media took on this difficult mission because we believe the greatest asset of humanity is our freedom to explore and discover truth . ”
GENESIS OF “ EXPELLED ”
“ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” began with an observation made by Ruloff , a successful computer software entrepreneur who comes from a high - tech world in which innovation is constant and eagerly sought .
In stark contrast , he noticed , the scientific and academic communities were deeply resistant to innovation , in this case innovation that might revise Darwin ’s theory that random mutation and natural selection drive all variation in life forms .
To explore this phenomenon , he joined with Logan Craft , a businessman , producer and social commentator with a media background , and John Sullivan , a successful music and commercial producer , to produce “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed . ”
Craft became interested in the project because …
“ I knew that this issue of evolution was foundational , it was the backdrop to a lot of other discussions that revolved around who we are as people , what our identity is , where do we draw an understanding of who were are and what our value and significance are .
These questions are answered very differently by secularists and people who hold religious beliefs . ”
Sullivan , who had a long - term philosophical interest in evolution , also saw the documentary ’s commercial appeal .
“ When we started , we did n’t know which way the film was going to go because it ’s unscripted , but we did know that this was an issue that the faith - based community was always engaged in .
We ’re hoping that it takes root in that community , which is a very large market , but it does n’t just relate to the faith - based markets .
We also have seen good response from the college age group and across the board . ”
Having determined to make the documentary , the producers went looking for someone to carry the film as its host and guide …
“ someone who was smart and funny with high credibility and who was willing to go on a journey , ” Craft said .
They arranged a meeting with Ben Stein and “ within the first few minutes of meeting Ben , he said , ‘ Sign me up , where do we go ? ’ ”
Stein proved to be incisive , humorous and as demanding an interviewer of intelligent design proponents as he was of evolutionists .
Director Frankowski said ,
“ He was n’t going to take the intelligent design side just because this is what the movie is about .
Even when he interviewed ID guys he was kind of hostile to them .
He wanted to put the heat on them and see if they could come out of the fire . ”
When Frankowski came aboard the production , he admitted that he was a little worried at first .
“ I did n’t know what kind of movie they wanted me to make .
I told John ( Sullivan ) that I did n’t want to make a right - wing propaganda piece or an agenda piece .
I wanted to honestly explore the issue and be open to whatever we found , and he assured me that he was open to that .
Ultimately this film is about freedom .
I do n’t want it to be about one side or the other .
It ’s not about right or wrong , but it ’s about the freedom to pursue a line of thought . ”
Echoing that though , Craft said :
“ The film is about the issue of freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech in the United States and in the worldwide scientific and educational communities .
And the film takes on that issue through the lens the controversy of evolution . ”
ABOUT THE PRODUCTION
Filming began in the summer of 2006 when the “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” crew traveled to Oxford , England to interview Richard Dawkins , author , Oxford University professor and prominent atheist , and John Lennox , a mathematician and author who lectures on science and religion at Oxford .
It was the first stop on a two - year journey that would take the filmmakers all over the United States and Europe .
Among its U.S. locations were Washington , D.C. , California , Texas , Florida , Iowa , Virginia , Washington and New York .
In Europe , “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed ” traveled to Berlin ; London ; Paris ; Venice ; Oxford ; Kent , where Charles Darwin had his home and wrote
On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ; Dachau , the infamous Nazi concentration camp in Germany ; and Hadamar , also in Germany , where the Nazis pursued the now - discredited theory of social Darwinism through a eugenics program that exterminated physically and mentally disabled people .
One of the central motifs of the film is the Berlin Wall , which was built in 1961 by the East German Communist government to keep its citizens from escaping to the West and to limit the infiltration of ideas from West into East Germany .
For the filmmakers , the wall is a metaphor for the barrier that the scientific community has erected to lock out any new , non-Darwinian ideas concerning evolution and intelligent design .
The film ’s credits are incorporated into archival footage of the Berlin Wall ’s construction , and Stein interviews mathematician , philosopher and intelligent design proponent David Berlinski in front of a remnant of the barrier , which was torn down in 1989 .
The film ends by pairing President Ronald Reagan ’s speech in Berlin in 1987 , in which he famously said : “ Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall , ” with Ben Stein ’s call for the scientific and educational communities to tear down the walls of orthodoxy that prevent a balanced exploration of the origins of life .
Director Frankowski wanted this film to have a unique visual energy that other documentaries do n’t have .
One challenge , he said , was that most of his subjects are scientists who lack the on - screen vibrancy that a movie star would have .
“ What they ’re saying is really interesting , ” Frankowski said , “ but how do we bring that energy to the screen ?
So I wanted to use the camera to bring out the energy ” that the interviewees did n’t necessarily display on their own .
One way to accomplish this was his use of multiple high - definition cameras to shoot interviews .
“ I wanted to have multiple cameras to pick up different moments and angles .
We had a lot of tight shots on people ’s faces to really feel the emotion .
At the same time we could focus on other things — what their hands were doing , were they twitching , for example . ”
He also shot through doorways , books on a library shelf and other framing devices “ so you have a sense that you ’re spying , that you ’re not supposed to be hearing these kinds of things .
And it worked . ”
In addition , cameraman Ben Huddleston created a piece of equipment called the High Roller that added motion to the image .
A variation on the dolly , it mounted a camera on what looked like a mini-skateboard running along small four - foot rails that sat on top of the camera tripod .
“ It enabled us to give a little motion to the interviews , to keep things fluid and intense , ” Frankowski said .
The quest for movement and energy continued in the post - production phase as well , when Frankowski and Editor Simon Tondeur created montages and incorporated archival images from B & W ’50s educational films to humorous effect .
A high point in the production for Frankowski came near the end of filming , in the beautiful cathedral - like space of the Natural History Museum in London , home to the Darwin Center and repository of specimens collected by Darwin himself .
Associate producer Mark Mathis was able to have the museum closed to visitors during the filming .
It was here that Stein was filmed walking somberly through the exhibition halls reflecting on the journey that he had taken .
The very next day the museum was the site of the climactic meeting of minds between Stein and Richard Dawkins .
Frankowski said ,
“ Throughout the production we were waiting for these two sides to collide .
Our two power players were coming together , and it was a great interview .
There was respect on both sides . ”
About Ben Stein
The notorious Pirate Bay BitTorrent tracker has reached yet another milestone as it serves more than 12 million peers .
The site is also throwing down a challenge :
They want every Pirate Bay peer to tell a friend - and get 20 million on the tracker soon .
It gets bigger .
And bigger .
And bigger – and more notorious .
And more popular .
Today ,
The Pirate Bay announced that they have achieved an amazing 12,000,000 peers on the tracker , surpassing the previously - amazing 10,000,000 announcement just a short while ago .
Interestingly , and particularly so for fans of private trackers , brokep announced that since 2004 , there has been a massive increase in the number of users actually seeding files , rather than just being regular peers .
In 2004 , around 20 % of the tracker population were seeds and by 2005 this had increased to 25 - 30 % .
By 2006 , the seeders had increased to an impressive 35 % and 2007 saw further gains to 40 % .
In 2008 , the seeders amount to an impressive 50 % of total tracker peers , further indication if it was needed that the desire to share clearly trumps the efforts of anti-piracy agencies .
Brokep of The Pirate Bay told TorrentFreak : “ We have more seeders than leechers now .
It was like 25 % seeders 75 % leechers [ in 2004/2005 ] , since then it ’s gradually shifted over to 50/50 ”
But a measly 12,000,000 peers is n’t enough for the Pirate Bay crew .
They want more – and more .
And we end with a call out to the community from Brokep : “ What we want you to do is to spread the word to your friends and make more people share files !
Let ’s break 15 million – and 20 ! ”
It wo n’t be long in coming .

Are You Blogging Naked ?
Did you ask yourself “ how did he know ? ” Relax , I am not trying to peek inside your private life or get in your business .
I am just using using a metaphor to both grab your attention and to make a point .
In my experience it seems to be a fairly common trait that bloggers often start a blog without any real sense of purpose or end result that they are trying to achieve .
They want to do well , they just do n’t know how well or how they are going to go about it .
They change direction often and the blog seems to have no “ mission . ”
These kinds of blogs often achieve a moderate level of success but rarely do you see this kind of blogger make it past a few hundred subscribers .
The reality is they often give up and quit blogging altogether .
Blogging Naked
If you do n’t have a “ strategic ” plan for your blog , then you are essentially “ blogging naked . ”
What I mean by a strategic plan is where do you want your blog to be in 6 months , a year , 3 years ?
How are you going to achieve these goals ?
What are the steps you are going to take ?
These are all questions you should ask yourself both when starting your blog as well as when you progress .
Every serious blogger should have a strategic plan for their blog .
My niche is the MMO niche which is clearly loaded with blogs that have no clear end goal in mind .
They exist simply to try and make some money .
They do n’t have any idea how they are going to accomplish that or even how much they plan to make , yet they blindly blog away hoping to hit it big .
Unfortunately in this niche , it is quite common to run across what I call a “ dark ” blog .
What I mean by dark is a blog that might have been started with the best of intentions , but after a month or two of blogging , the posts get further and further apart .
Eventually they grind to a halt .
The lights go out , nobody is home .
It ’s a dark blog .
Another naked blogger bites the dust .
Keep in mind it is especially important not to blog naked if you happen to be a video blogger .
Fortunately Mark is top notch .
Blog Backwards
Blogging backwards is a great idea .
When I say you want to “ blog backwards ” I am saying that you want to determine where you want to go first .
What is your end goal ?
Make 2 k a month ?
Increase 200 RSS subscribers ?
Hit 10 k visitors a week ?
Whatever the case may be you need to define your actual goal and then work backwards to determine how you are going to get there .
A well thought out strategic action plan should almost always include the factors I have listed below .
Content Creation – What ’s your mission ?
What do you intend to give to your readers ?
Why should they come back ?

You ca n’t just build a blog and expect people to start lining up to read it .
Some would argue that you are better off to be a great marketer than a great writer .
John Chow would be a perfect example .
I am sure you might be able to add to my list but these that I have listed should be considered the cornerstones of any good plan .
Course Corrections
It will to take time to find the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of your plan but that is to be expected from new bloggers .
If you monitor your success monthly then you can adjust , adapt and make changes to ensure you stay on your plan .
It would not be uncommon to make adjustments to your plan several times as you progress .
Very few of us are blessed enough to nail our goals the very first time we try .
These small setbacks are normal and should n’t derail you from your plan .
The Wright brothers crashed an untold number of planes before finding the right combination that kept them airborne .
Persistence paid off .
Most of the A - Listers you see writing today started out on other blogs and cut their teeth there before hitting it big with their current blogs .
Stick to it .
Summary
In my niche , you often read comments such as “ nobody could become the next John Chow ” or “ John got in at the right time ” or “ he could n’t do it again today ” or “ the niche is saturated . ”
I have no doubt the origin of these kinds of statements come from frustrated MMO ’ers that are not experiencing any success .
If truth be told they are likely frustrated because of their own failures .
Rather than placing the blame where it belongs , they make unfounded excuses to justify these failures .
They are Victims .
The fact is that you can make it happen , you could be the next whoever , it could be done again .
You could choose to hope that it happens to you or you could MAKE it happen for you .
Success is a Choice and it all starts with a goal and a plan to get there .
So…confession time ….. how many of you are naked right now ?
Come on , fess Up .

A video showing Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir inciting violence against Australian tourists has been made public .
The footage was taken at a sermon given by Bashir to about 300 villagers in East Java in October last year and was filmed by a Darwin - based university researcher .
In the video , Bashir urges those in the village to beat up tourists that disrespect Islamic ways , saying , " If there are infidels here , then beat them up .
Do not tolerate them " .
Later in the sermon , he likens non-Muslims to crawling " worms , snakes , maggots " .
He also says infidels ruin moral values by exposing their skin at the beach .
" Take a look at Bali " , he said .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says Bashir 's comments are not welcome .
" These remarks , these reported remarks from a speech six months ago , contain all the familiar bigotry and they are absolutely condemned , " he said .
Hillary Clinton 's chief campaign strategist met with Colombia 's ambassador to the U.S. on Monday to discuss a bilateral free - trade agreement , a pact the presidential candidate opposes .
Attendance by the adviser , Mark Penn , was confirmed by two Colombian officials .
He was n't there in his campaign role , but in his separate job as chief executive of Burson - Marsteller Worldwide , an international communications and lobbying firm .
The firm has a contract with the South American nation to promote congressional approval of the trade deal , among other things , according to filings with the Justice Department .
( See the related article . )
Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates , Mr. Penn 's campaign - consulting firm , received more than $ 10 million in payments from the Clinton campaign as of the end of February , according to federal election filings .
Mr. Penn declined to comment .
Howard Wolfson , communications director for Sen.
Clinton 's campaign , said in an email that " Mark was not there on behalf of the campaign " and referred further questions to Burson - Marsteller .
" Sen. Clinton 's opposition to the trade deal with Colombia is clear , " Mr. Wolfson added .
A Burson - Marsteller spokesman did n't return calls or emails seeking comment .

Abstract :
We define the derivative of an integer to be the map sending every prime to 1 and satisfying the Leibnitz rule .
The aim of the article is to consider the basic properties of this map and to show how to generalize the notion to the case of rational and arbitrary real numbers .
We make some conjectures and find some connections with Goldbach 's Conjecture and the Twin Prime Conjecture .
Finally , we solve the easiest associated differential equations and calculate the generating function .

This is outrageous !
How can alternative theories to evolution be taught in schools such as Intelligent Design ( tm ) but not the others ?
i.e . Were you aware that Pi is not 3.14159265 but in fact , Pi is exactly 3 ?
How can we be sure ?
Because the inerrant book we currently refer to as the Bible , says so .
1 Kings 7:23 ( New American Standard Bible )
Now he made the sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim to brim , circular in form , and its height was five cubits , and thirty cubits in circumference .
Now , if we do our biblical calculations using , C = r * 2 * Pi , in this case , C = 30 , r * 2 = 10 , which leaves only pi in question , which in this case , is clearly 30 / 10 , better known as 3 .
Yes , that ’s right , the Bible says Pi = 3 .
Without a doubt , we should scrap any theory that says
Pi is anything more or less than exactly 3 .
For heaven ’s sake , the “ scientists ” defintion of Pi is n’t even rational !
They ca n’t even properly define the number !
I like absolute answers , as the one ’s provided in the bible , that way I know the answer and do n’t have to keep memorizing new numbers , it ’s simply easier this way !
Blake 's 7 was known for its shaky sets and basic special effects
A new remake of sci - fi series Blake 's 7 could soon return to television screens , Sky One has revealed .
The satellite channel has given the green light for the development of two 60 - minute scripts for a " potential event series " .
Blake 's 7 , which originally ran on BBC
One between 1978 and 1981 , followed a gang of rebels fighting an evil federation that ruled the galaxy .
It is not yet known if and when production on the series will begin .
" The time is ripe for a revival of a show that represents the best traditions of the genre , not to mention one of the best - loved and most successful dramas of all time , " Elaine Pyke , commissioning editor for drama at Sky One , Two and Three , said .
Sky is working alongside Blake 's 7 Productions , a subsidiary of Blake 's 7 Media who owns the licence to the show .
The planned new episodes would follow recent re-workings of other sci- fi shows Doctor Who , Battlestar Galactica and Bionic Woman .
The original Blake 's 7 series featured Gareth Thomas as lead character Roj Blake and Paul Darrow as cynical - but - charming computer fraudster Kerr Avon .
In 2003 Darrow was involved in plans to make a new TV mini-series , but it fell through .
A series of Blake 's 7 radio dramas featuring Colin Salmon and Daniela Nardini were broadcast last year on BBC7 .
For 17 months we brought the message of peace , freedom , and prosperity to millions of Americans .
The response overwhelmed me : more Americans believe in liberty and the Constitution than I ever imagined .
I am deeply moved and honored by your hard work and sacrifice on behalf of our cause .
However , after much serious thought , I have decided to end my campaign for the Presidency of the United States .
It is time now to take the energy this campaign has awakened and channel it into long - term efforts to take back our country .
We have some exciting plans and projects to move the revolution forward that will come together in the next several months .
Watch for them .
I will work until my last breath on behalf of this great message .
That I promise you .
We do n’t have to live in the kind of America the two major parties have in store for us .
Together , let us continue to lay the foundations for an America worthy of our Founding Fathers .

Obama has shown an uncanny ability to take a punch , and then rear back and deliver one in return .
Barack Obama 's counterpunching style
Sen .
Barack Obama ’s instantly infamous remarks on how small - town Americans “ cling ” to their faith , their guns , and their xenophobia began drawing attention around 3:30 p.m. Friday .
Obama ’s aides went into radio silence , rebuffing requests to explain or respond while his rivals attacked him .
At 6:30 p.m. , his campaign put out a statement that , instead of explaining his words , threw the criticism back at his rivals .
Then , just before 9 that evening , the candidate himself responded during a speech in Terre Haute , Ind. , with an attack of his own , expressing incredulity that his rivals had called him “ out of touch . ”
Advertisement
“ Out of touch ?
Out of touch ?
I mean , John McCain — it took him three tries to finally figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was a problem , ” he said , while also criticizing Hillary Rodham Clinton for her vote on to make declaring personal bankruptcy harder .
“ She says I ’m out of touch ? ”
The response was signature Obama : Attack first , sort out the details later , if at all .
No apology , no immediate regret , just a sharp counterattack .
For a candidate sometimes mocked for being too soft to win a political fistfight , he has shown an uncanny ability to take a punch and then rear back and deliver one in return .
When Obama responds this way , it leaves him open to charges that he 's undermining his so - called politics of hope .
But , showing remarkable dexterity , he has a knack for using these flare - ups to pivot back to the central theme of his candidacy : that politics is broken , and he knows how to change it .
Obama , it turns out , has been a devout observer of a philosophy future President Bill Clinton laid out in 1981 .
" When someone is beating you over the head with a hammer , do n't sit there and take it , ” then - Gov. Clinton told Time magazine .
“ Take out a meat cleaver and cut off their hand . ”
Many Democrats believe their two most recent nominees , Al Gore and John F. Kerry , ignored that rule , and they are loath to nominate another candidate susceptible to being portrayed as weak .
So Obama and his inner political circle — strategist David Axelrod and campaign manager David Plouffe — have observed it religiously , dispelling an early perception that the candidate would wilt under fire from Clinton or Republicans .
Instead , when under attack , the candidate rarely acknowledges any fault — for such a move would offer critics an opening .
In the case of his San Francisco remarks , perhaps the worst gaffe of his career , he conceded Saturday only that “ if I worded things in a way that made people offended , I deeply regret that . ”
Obama ’s unexpected pugnacity also extends to include personal responses to tactical assaults , a level of sparring often left to spokespeople .
The examples are many , but the pattern first began to take shape last summer , after a debate in South Carolina at which Obama said he would personally meet foreign dictators .
The remark appeared to be a slip , and in the spin room after the debate , Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , tried to explain it away .
But the next day , Clinton told the Quad City Times , an Iowa daily , that Obama had been “ naïve and irresponsible ” to offer meetings , an attack reported on the paper ’s website .
That afternoon , Obama himself placed a call to the reporter who wrote the story .
It was Clinton , he said , who had been “ irresponsible and naïve ” to vote to authorize the war in Iraq .
And he embraced his promise to meet the hostile leaders , casting Clinton ’s reluctance — a line his campaign continued to amplify throughout the fall — as similar to the Bush administration ’s stance .
Obama has eagerly pursued other attacks .
He memorably mocked Clinton for finding evidence of untoward ambition in his elementary school writings .
When Clinton called to “ turn up the heat ” on the Republicans , Obama suggested “ more light ” instead .
In late February , reporters traveling with Obama in Ohio learned — before the story hit the wires or the blogs — from Obama ’s staff that McCain had accused the Illinois senator of ignorance of the presence of Al Qaeda terrorists in Iraq .
Obama , taking the stage at Ohio State University minutes later , responded with vigor .
" John McCain thought that he could make a clever point , " said Obama .
" I have some news for John McCain .
And that is that there was no such thing as Al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq . ”
More recently , when faced with the incendiary video of his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , attacking Clinton , followed by more video of the minister ’s criticism of America , Obama eschewed the counterattacks .
But nevertheless he hewed to a familiar course : no apology , no concession of wrongdoing .
His position was that he had n’t been in the pews for Wright ’s reported controversial statements .
Obama ’s immediate responses , the campaign quickly decided , were insufficient .
And so , just six days later , Obama sought to cast the issue in his own terms with a major speech addressing race , while ignoring Wright ’s anti-American comments .
But the most recent flap over his remarks about small - town Pennsylvanians represented a return to form as he moved first to attack Clinton and McCain .
Then came what seemed to be a departure .
In a slow - motion rollout that may have slightly prolonged the story , Obama tiptoed up to an apology before returning to his comfort zone .
On Sunday evening , with particular glee , he turned to Clinton ’s discussion of her childhood hunting .
" She 's running around talking about how this is an insult to sportsmen , how she values the Second Amendment , she 's talking like she 's Annie Oakley ! ” he said at a stop in Pennsylvania .
“ Hillary Clinton 's out there like she 's on the duck blind every Sunday , she 's packin ' a six shooter !
C'mon !
She knows better .
That 's some politics being played by Hillary Clinton .
I want to see that picture of her out there in the duck blinds . ”
Legendary actor , civil rights leader and political activist Charlton Heston passed away today , at the age of 84 .

Mr. Heston was loved by his two children , Fraser Clarke Heston and Holly Heston Rochell , and his three grandchildren , Jack Alexander Heston , Ridley Rochell and Charlie Rochell .
The Heston family issued the following statement :
“ To his loving friends , colleagues and fans , we appreciate your heartfelt prayers and support .
Charlton Heston was seen by the world as larger than life .
He was known for his chiseled jaw , broad shoulders and resonating voice , and , of course , for the roles he played .
Indeed , he committed himself to every role with passion , and pursued every cause with unmatched enthusiasm and integrity .
We knew him as an adoring husband , a kind and devoted father , and a gentle grandfather , with an infectious sense of humor .
He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith , courage and dignity .
He loved deeply , and he was deeply loved .
No one could ask for a fuller life than his .
No man could have given more to his family , to his profession , and to his country .
In his own words , “ I have lived such a wonderful life !
I ’ve lived enough for two people . ”
A private memorial service will be held .
The family has requested that , in lieu of flowers , donations be made to the Motion Picture and Television Fund :

MarketWatch
March 17 , 2008
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) — Analysts who cover broker Lehman Bros. were laying low Monday , saying they did not want to add to market speculation that the firm may be the next major brokerage under the gun .
“ All of the investment banks rely on repurchase agreements to fund a significant amount of assets .
If market participants begin to fear that another bank is facing a liquidity crisis , we could see another collapse , ” said Morningstar analyst Ryan Lentell in a research note .
“ Rumors of problems at Bear gained traction because of the bank ’s exposure to the residential mortgage market , which has been in turmoil , ” Lentell said .
“ The investment banks all have exposure to these asset classes , and as fear over further price declines in any one asset class escalates , it could lead to a run on another bank . ”
Shares of Lehman Bros. temporarily recovered some of their early losses Monday as the broader markets calmed down after being rattled by an eleventh - hour bailout of rival Bear Stearns .
But after rebounding to a smaller 14 % loss , Lehman fell back to a loss of more than 30 % .

The pound slumped to a fresh record low today , bringing more bad news for British holidaymakers as it pushes up the cost of continental breaks .
The pound hit 80.29 p , after reaching the 80 p level for the first time yesterday .
Against the dollar , the pound traded at $ 1.9806 in the afternoon .
Sterling also fell to its lowest level in 11 1/2 years against a basket of major currencies .
The pound recovered to 79.88 p against the euro in the afternoon .
While the Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter point to 5 % , as expected , and hinted at further reductions , the European Central Bank kept its rates at 4 % to keep inflation in check , which is higher in the eurozone than in Britain .
The Bank of England said in a statement accompanying the rate cut : " The disruption in financial markets could lead to a slowdown in the economy that was sufficiently sharp to pull inflation below the target .
Credit conditions have tightened and the availability of credit appears to be worsening .
While the recent depreciation in sterling will support net exports , the prospects for output growth abroad have deteriorated . "
The Bank also noted the impact of the depreciation of sterling on import costs .
While British goods have become more competitive in the eurozone , the prices of imported goods to Britain have risen as a result of the pound 's slide .
When the euro was launched in January 1999 , the single currency was worth 70.5 p and reached a low of 56.84 p against the pound in May 2000 .
The weak pound also means that cash - strapped consumers - already struggling to cope with soaring utility bills and a rising tax burden - may think twice about travelling to the continent .
Flipped the other way round , the pound now buys just under € 1.25 , down from close to € 1.50 last summer , a fall of nearly 17 % and one that will make European holidays considerably more expensive .
Sean Tipton at the Association of British Travel Agents said the rate has traditionally hovered around € 1.40 .
That means a family of four who used to spend £ 1,000 to £ 1,200 on average on a holiday , will now have to fork out about £ 120 more .
" It will be slightly more expensive but not break - the - bank more expensive , " he said .
Sterling has come under pressure after a barrage of gloomy news this week .
House prices are falling at their fastest rate since the last housing market slump in the early 1990s , consumer confidence has plummeted to its lowest level in four years and the International Monetary Fund slashed its growth forecast for the UK yesterday .
The drop in sterling has revived talk of pound - euro parity .
Tipton argued that European breaks are still better value than staying in the UK .
" One of the many reasons we travel to the eurozone is it is good value .
Going out , eating , drinking , generally spending is cheaper than in the UK , " he said .
" It will still be cheaper than the UK . "
145000 unique visitors may not seem like a lot to those in the porn industry , but it 's a lot for me , and especially for a " throwaway post " like the one on Halloween .
Getting on Digg and the front page of reddit certainly is the cause of this , but not the explanation .
The post got over 200 comments , not counting what my spam filter destroyed ; more importantly , the post went to places like metafilter , where it had over 170 comments -- more than any other post that week .
Why ?
About half of the people did n't like the article at all .
A lot said it was badly written .
( I know . )
A lot disagreed with what they thought were my points -- the same points that made the other half like the post .
There were four elements of the post that received the most attention .
Are violent films bad for kids ?
Very polarized debate .
Interestingly , the debate was always personal and negative : " watching horror movies did n't affect me . "
No one asked whether currently violent people had watched horror movies as a kid , and if it had an impact .
And no one suggested they'd be okay with taking their kid to one .
What is " torture porn ? "
Are horror movies really porn ?
To call it porn implies something -- what is the nature of that implication ?
I was surprised by the number of people whose main criticism was the photo of the stroller -- that it was n't scary .
" It 's just a stupid stroller ! "
That is an example of concrete thinking , and I 'd bet that those people like Halloween , Hotel , etc , but are not touched by them ( i.e. they go to sleep with the lights off no problem . )
I 'm not criticizing , just profiling a preference set .
Why did I refer to the parents as " obese " and " white ? "
Is that really relevant ?
I posted a comment on metafilter that is worth repeating / rephrasing here :
1. I suck at writing .
Some of the criticisms of my points are really the result of this .
Not an excuse , just an explanation .
If I wrote better , I think there would have been less disagreement .
2 . The point of the last sentence was NOT that horror movies make kids into ADHD serial killers -- that 's up for debate .
My point was that those / these kids are growing up in a family / environment where obviously there are so many negatives -- taking them to Halloween is simply an example -- that for psychiatry to be focused on utter nonsense -- food additives and ADHD -- misses the whole context of the " ADHD " child .
Psychiatry does this a lot : it focuses on the trivial because it 's the only thing it can affect .
But in doing this , it creates the social policy story that these minor issues are the causative , or at least substantive , ones .
3 . I tried to juxtapose the bad childhood of Michael Meyers with the ( IMHO ) bad childhood of these kids , not to imply they will become serial killers , but to suggest that maybe , oh , I do n't know , once in a while , how we parent affects how the kids turn out .
Just saying .
4 . The " obese white parents " comment .
You know what ?
I have no idea why I wrote that .
It 's factual , but it was a completely prejudicial remark that I now regret writing -- it was nothing less than the promulgation of stereotypes .
It highlighted things that have no relationship to the topic at hand .
4b . Except those attributes did have some relationship , otherwise it would n't have been on my mind .
I was n't born with the stereotype in my head .
I 'm going to tread carefully , and I hope you 'll appreciate what I 'm going to say : I recognize that my thoughts were wrong -- i.e. a prejudice , but they came from somewhere -- even if that somewhere is an attribution or information bias .
This speaks to the whole problem of prejudices in general , where they come from and how we combat them .
Here 's an example : when I wrote that comment , my thoughts were exactly this : " I better let everyone know they were white , or else they 're going to assume they were black . "
Think about that .
Strangely , it never occurred to me not to write they were obese -- another prejudice on my part .
It surprises and frightens me that I could have and execute thoughts so automatically , without any consideration .
It never even occurred to me that writing " obese " was in any way wrong .
5. " Torture porn . "
People took issue with it because they think porn gets defined as " what other people think is bad . "
As a working definition , porn can be anything that causes sexual excitement in the absence of the fetishized object .
Think of it like this : porn 's natural outlet is masturbation .
There 's no actual naked coed with you .
The masturbation is the end in itself .
What about when porn leads to actual sex , with , say , your wife of 15 years ?
It 's still masturbatory , in that your sexual energy is directed at the porn ( e.g. , how her hip looks like that pic , or how she moans the same way , etc . )
Your mind fantasizes around the reality of your wife , so that the wife becomes a prop for masturbation .
( This is an example , do n't yell at me . )
All of this is narcissistic , introverted .
It 's power over your own identity .
Torture porn is the same : it 's about you , and making the other simply an extension of your own affective needs .
The point is n't to kill the person ; the point is the killing .
That 's why torture porn is never about revenge , or crime , or any obvious purpose .
The purpose is the exertion of your power .
If there was a purpose to it , it would n't be masturbation .

BBC West Africa correspondent
Whilst attention has been focused on Robert Mugabe 's attempt to stay in power in Zimbabwe , elsewhere in Africa another president is quietly making moves to lengthen his time in office .
The Cameroonian president , Paul Biya , has been in power for 26 years , but members of parliament voted on Thursday to scrap presidential term limits and enable him to run for the presidency again in 2011 and stay in power until 2018 ( or beyond ) when he will be 85 .
Once before parliament , the bill to remove presidential term limits was always likely to be approved - the governing party has an overwhelming majority in parliament .
The main opposition party , the Social Democratic Front , SDF , has just 15 of the 180 and decided to boycott the debate .
The whole issue is a complete fraud .
We do not want to legitimise it by taking part
SDF 's Joseph Banadzem
When asked whether it would not be better to take part and put forward a case against amending the constitution , the leader of the SDF parliamentarians , Joseph Banadzem , told the BBC : " The whole issue is a complete fraud .
We do not want to legitimise it by taking part . "
Mr Banadzem predicts more disorder and violence in Cameroon .
" The amendment is paving the way for very difficult times in Cameroon .
" Instead of working in the efforts of the general public , the regime is only concerned about one individual - President Paul Biya - and the effort to prolong his stay in office , " he said adding that most Cameroonians oppose the change to the constitution .
Bribery
There is at least one lonely voice of disapproval amongst the governing Cameroon People 's Democratic Movement ( CPDM ) .
There have been deadly protests against the third - term issue Paul Abine Ayah , an outspoken CPDM MP , slammed the bill predicting it would set the country back 200 years .
He said money was being paid to party members to encourage them to approve the bill .
The effort to extend President Biya 's time in office is widely unpopular amongst Cameroonians many of whom feel the politicians are not doing enough to tackle the widespread poverty .
In February , some 100 demonstrators were killed by the military and police during rioting .
Although they were protesting against the high cost of living , their action was also fuelled by the speculation that presidential term limits were to be removed .
In his end of year state address , Mr Biya said having presidential term limits was unconstitutional and added that there were popular calls for him to stay in power .
It is no longer mere speculation - but the violent response from the security forces is likely to dissuade many Cameroonians from mounting any further protests .
African precedents President Biya , who came to power in 1982 , revised the constitution 12 years ago , extending the presidential term of office from five to seven years .
Mr Museveni successfully changed the constitution to allow him to run again
One of his achievements has been to oversee relative stability in a country comprising more than 200 tribes .
However past elections in Cameroon have been marred by allegations of fraud and vote rigging and it would be fair to say that Cameroonians have become increasingly disillusioned with the political process .
But the 75 - year - old is by no means the first African president to tweak the constitution in order to stay in power .
In Uganda , President Yoweri Museveni , moved past the 20 years in office landmark after parliament scrapped the two - term limit on the presidency in 2005 .
The move was controversial , especially after MPs queued up to receive around $ 3,000 in what was regarded as an attempt to bribe them to approve the move .
After term limits were removed in Chad , President Idriss Deby , a former army chief who seized power before winning two elections , said the change was not meant to benefit him personally .
In Malawi and in Zambia , former leaders Bakili Muluzi and Frederick Chiluba respectively tried and failed to change their constitutions to get a third term in office .
Nigeria 's former President , Olusegun Obasanjo , also tried it but law makers stood firm and rejected the plan .
While all eyes are currently focused on Mr Mugabe and Zimbabwe , Cameroon receives far less attention - despite a very poor human rights record and a reputation for being one of the most corrupt countries on the continent .
Observers point out that an increasingly entrenched elite which seems out of touch with the population is a recipe for instability .

cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
November 2nd , 2007
We ’ll see how clever they are when the Good Fellas show up to collect .
At some point , this thing is going to start looking less like a financial crisis and more like a mob war .
How do I know ?
Because I got a job that resulted from a decapitation strike against the computer systems of a wholly owned subsidiary of a Wall Street firm that was heavily involved with generating subprime loans and selling the resulting mortgage backed securities .
I have n’t talked about this before in public , but a core Cryptogon contributor wondered if the organizations that wound up with the toxic waste paper would eventually attempt to settle the score in a less than pleasant manner , if you know what I mean …
I wrote a candid response to him because I ’ve wanted to tell this story many times , but was afraid to do it here on Cryptogon .
After reading about this smug prick , Lawrence Lindsey , in the GATA piece below , I decided to share with all of you what I ’ve seen happen to some other smug pricks who thought they were very clever too .
This was my private response to the Cryptogon reader - contributor .
I ’ve edited the message just slightly for length and readability :
I ca n’t post this publicly .
You ’ve probably figured out by now the name of the firm I ’ve been
referring to in the Wall Street Chop Shop piece , and a certain other
post …
I ’m not explicitly saying it , but people who have been following
this probably get it .
Yes , they even dress like mobsters , and wear the pinky rings .
But here ’s a story that I ’m afraid to talk about in public .
I and several other IT guys were brought into that company to handle
the aftermath of an attack that was probably undertaken by a “ disgruntled
employee . ”
Well , we were lead to believe that it was a disgruntled
employee .
But was it ?
Here ’s what happened :
At the time , the Mother Ship was content to allow the red headed step
child to run its own systems .
As long as the paper got to where it
needed to be at the end of the month , each month , no worries , fuggetaboutit .
Someone compromised this operation at the root level , they understood
the timing and then they launched an attack that literally blew the
support columns out from underneath the entire thing THE DAY BEFORE THE
PAPER DUMP at the end of the month .
I got a call from one of the recruiters I was with on a Saturday .
He
told me that this place wanted me to show up on Monday morning .
I asked , “ For an interview ? ”
“ No .
For work .
And they said to bring hip waders and a shovel . ”
“ Holy shit , what happened ? ”
“ I do n’t know but the people I ’ve been talking to are panicking .
They ’re
at the office now ( Saturday ) . ”
Not an exact quote , but something very
close to that .
Monday morning , bosses were still white faced and panicking .
Many people
had been there over the weekend .
The place reeked of greasy nerds who’d
been sweating out hundreds of gallons of cheap coffee .
The losses were in the tens of millions of dollars .
Now , here ’s the interesting thing .
The firm did n’t call the cops .
No state or federal law enforcement were
involved .
There was no media coverage of the event at all .
Not one story
anywhere .
The firm handled the thing internally .
They brought in “ some
forensics people from New York ” to find out who did it .
If one of these
people wanted access to something , they did n’t even go to us , the IT
support and operations people .
They called the CIO and that guy , always
drunk / hungover , moved like his life was on the line .
We never heard anything about how it wound up , what they found , or what
they did about it .
The incident simply became known as , “ That thing . ”
The firm built a completely separate , parallel network infrastructure
along side the existing one .
New cabling , even .
New servers , new
routers , new client side systems .
Everything new .
Two factor
authentication , including hardware based crypto key generators .
This
became known as the “ clean ” network , the Mother Ship ’s network .
The
existing network became known as the “ dirty ” side .
Money was no object
in terms of this build out .
[ It is interesting to note that since I wrote this ,
a few months ago , the entire operation has been rolled up , all employees fired
and offices vacated .
It went down exactly the way I said it would in the
Wall Street Chop Shop piece . ]
Anyway , I do n’t want to know what “ connected ” actually means when it
comes to this firm .
I ca n’t begin to imagine what that thing does , off
the books .
That ’s why I ’m not posting this in public .
Obviously , anyone who bought that shit they were selling is going to be
pissed .
Disgruntled employee ?
When I was a boy , we called an attack like that , “ strategic information
warfare . ”
Maybe the attackers looked at the Mother Ship ’s network and
found that it was too locked down .
Someone or something tried to hurt
that firm bad and used the easiest vector to accomplish the most
financial damage .
They also committed several federal crimes to do it .
Best ,
Kevin
That was a taste of what happened when “ very clever ” was n’t clever enough .
Via : GATA :
Lindsey ’s charts went into the collateralized debt obligation problem , the asset - backed commercial paper , mortgage - backed securities .. the lot .
He said that it will “ force banks et al. to mark these products to market ( over time ) instead of their current practice of marking to model … or to myth . ”
He was n’t the least bit worried about how the hedge funds would manage because , as he said , they were very good at looking after themselves .
He appeared delighted that Wall Street had been able to unload hundreds of billions of dollars ’ worth of ( now toxic ) CDOs on the rest of the world , saying that “ we Americans were very clever ” in doing this .
Research Credit : She Knows Who
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama in a speech Tuesday addressed the controversy surrounding his former minister , using it as an opportunity to challenge Americans to take a closer look at race relations .
Speaking at Philadelphia 's National Constitution Center , the Democratic presidential candidate said he rejected racially charged comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , but he tried to explain the root of those remarks .
Wright recently retired as pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , where the senator from Illinois worships .
Some of Wright 's old sermons came under fire after a news report last week turned some of his most controversial comments into a YouTube phenomenon .
In one , the minister said America had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself .
In another , he said Sen. Hillary Clinton had an advantage over Obama because she is white .
Speaking before a relatively small , diverse crowd , Obama emphasized his upbringing as " the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas . "
CNN 's political team weighs in on Obama 's speech »
Unlike many of Obama 's campaign events -- where he generally appears onstage backed by an overflow crowd of supporters -- this time Obama took the stage alone , backed by a row of U.S. flags .
" I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible , " he said .
" It 's a story that has n't made me the most conventional candidate .
But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many , we are truly one . "
Watch Obama address the racial divide »
Obama 's speech was greeted with a handful of responses .
Some shouted , " You 're so right , " and " That 's the truth . "
But his relatively subdued demeanor seemed to be mostly reflected in the crowd as well , with most of the reaction limited to polite applause .
The senator mostly has avoided focusing on race during his campaign .
His speech comes after spending the weekend on the defensive over his former minister 's statements .
His biggest challenge Tuesday was similar to that faced by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney when he gave a speech during his GOP presidential run to reach voters unfamiliar with his Mormon faith : Obama was looking to explain his church and its worldview to voters aware only of Wright 's headline - grabbing comments .
Obama admitted he had sat in church and heard his former minister make controversial remarks .
" Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views ?
Absolutely -- just as I 'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors , priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed . "
The remarks that caused the most recent firestorm " were not only wrong but divisive , divisive at a time when we need unity , " Obama said .
Watch African - Americans react to Obama speech »
Obama said that if he knew Wright only through clips played on television and YouTube , he also would see a reason to distance himself from the minister .
" But the truth is that is n't all that I know of the man , " he said .
" As imperfect as he may be , he has been like family to me , " Obama said after describing his experience at Trinity United .
Obama insisted he was not trying to justify Wright 's comments , but drew a parallel between the minister 's remarks and those made by Clinton supporters such as Geraldine Ferraro .
" The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we 've never really worked through -- a part of our union that we have yet to perfect , " he said , describing the resentment felt by many African - Americans of Wright 's generation , who experienced segregation and systemic discrimination .
" That anger is not always productive ; indeed , all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems , " he said .
" But the anger is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races . "
Clinton and her campaign have publicly steered clear of any criticism of Obama over the issue , saying it 's one for him to address .
At an event at Philadelphia City Hall a short time after Obama 's speech , the senator from New York said that she had n't had a chance to see or read his remarks , but that she was " glad that he gave it .
It 's an important topic . "
" Issues of race and gender have been complicated through our history and have been complicated in this campaign , " she said , adding that there had been " detours and pitfalls " throughout the primary season .
Obama wrote most of the speech himself , according to his campaign .
Obama was not , as some reports placed him , in attendance the day Wright delivered the well - publicized comments , according to his campaign .
But it has been difficult for the senator to distance himself completely from the retired minister of the church where he has worshipped for two decades .
The title of Obama 's 2006 book , " The Audacity of Hope , " came from a sermon delivered by Wright , who officiated the senator 's wedding , baptized both of his children and was a spiritual adviser to his presidential campaign until Friday .
Obama 's recent move to distance himself from Wright has been lauded by some of his supporters -- and criticized by others , including black ministers who felt he had abandoned Wright .
Tuesday 's speech was a balancing act for the senator , who needed to take into consideration the views of these backers along with those of many white , working - class voters he has struggled to woo .
The latter may be decisive in next month 's Pennsylvania primary , and their support would be vital if Obama were to become the Democratic nominee .
He made a direct appeal to that demographic Tuesday amid some polls that suggest the controversy may be hurting his effort in Pennsylvania .
He told his audience that " to wish away the resentments of white Americans , to label them as misguided or even racist , without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns -- this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding . "

Oswald Gruebel , well known ex CEO of Credit Suisse Bank , confirms in an interview given to the Swiss Newspaper “ Sonntagsblick ” that the World Financial System was sharply near to a collapse Mid March when Bear Stearns collapsed .
Without intervention of the Central Banks , the System ( sic PONZISCHEME ) ) would have not survived .
He compared this moment with the CUBA Crisis .
As I can see , it is the first time that an insider spoke so clearly about the dramatic situation of our days .
One Bank collapsing , he aded , and the whole system will crash .
Meanwhile we hear that the Bank of England has to pump in 50 Billions Pounds this week , the Swiss Central Bank has to pump in 6 Billions Swiss Francs , and that Credit Suisse will present this week a quarter year loss of 2 Billions and write offs ( sic losses ) of 6 Billions Swiss Francs .

The world was divided in 2003 into countries that supported or opposed the Iraq war .
The UN was in the middle .
Here we recount the arguments for and against made by eight key players , and where they stand now .
KOFI ANNAN
The battle over Iraq in the UN Security Council raised doubts about the organisation 's role in the 21st Century .
Secretary General Kofi Annan vainly appealed for compromise and unity .
But as France , China and Russia threatened to veto a US - backed resolution authorising force against Iraq , he realised the die was cast .
The UN began instead to prepare for the humanitarian consequences of war .
In the first few months of the conflict the UN 's headquarters in Baghdad was bombed , killing its most senior official .
Mr Annan called the attack " the darkest day in our lives " .
In September 2004 , he said for the first time that the decision to go to war without a second resolution was illegal .
" I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view - from the charter point of view - it was illegal , " he told the BBC .
In his final speech as UN head , in late 2006 , he again attacked US unilateralism , saying : " No nation can make itself secure by seeking supremacy over others . "
Return to the top JOSE MARIA AZNAR Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar 's support for the Iraq war marked a realignment in Europe 's relations with the US .
A member of the UN Security Council as the preparations for war advanced , Mr Aznar stood shoulder to shoulder with the US and the UK , rather than France and Germany .
" There is nothing more dangerous than a political leader who builds castles in the air , and I believe political leaders who raise false hopes , who do n't look at the world as it is , are set to reap failure , " Mr Aznar said after a meeting with Mr Bush in February 2003 .
The next month he took part in a key pre-war summit with Mr Bush and Mr Blair in the Azores .
Huge protests occurred in August , as Spanish troops departed for Iraq .
In 2007 , Mr Aznar - whose party was beaten in the 2004 elections - acknowledged that he had over - estimated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein : " The whole world thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and they did n't , I know that now .
When I did n't know , no - one knew . "
Return to the top TONY BLAIR Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's backing for war - as the only way of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction - came to define his premiership .
In a speech before parliament on March 18 2003 , he argued that Saddam Hussein's " diplomatic dance " meant that threats were only effective if backed with force : " The only persuasive power to which he responds is 250,000 allied troops on his doorstep . "
His decision to go to war was backed in parliament but brought the biggest parliamentary rebellion ever recorded against a British government , and prompted three ministers to resign .
He has recognised that the intelligence on his decision was based was flawed but has not apologised .
In 2006 , he admitted he had struggled with his conscience over the decision to go to war , saying he would be judged by history and God .
A year later he told The Times : " If there 's anything I regret ... it is ... not having laid out for people in a clearer way what I saw as the profound nature of this struggle and the fact that it was going to go on for a generation . "
Return to the top HANS BLIX Plucked from retirement to lead the team of UN weapons inspectors sent in to Iraq , the pragmatic and calm Hans Blix asked in vain for more time to continue checking for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
His anger about the military intervention spilled over just months after the bombing began .
In a series of scathing attacks on the UK and the US , he accused them of organising the war well before the outcome of his work was known and dramatising the threat of WMD to support their campaign .
" There is evidence that this war was planned well in advance .
Sometimes this raises doubts about their attitude to the [ weapons ] inspections , " he told the Spain 's El Pais in April 2003 .
A year later , he compared the US attitude to the hunt for WMD to a " witch - hunt " , saying the US had made " monumental " and " scandalous " errors of intelligence .
His opinions have not changed .
In 2007 he said : " I think everything in Iraq after the invasion has been a tragedy .
The only positive thing I think is the disappearance of Saddam Hussein . "
Return to the top GEORGE W BUSH
The US president said he had three reasons for going to war against Iraq - to disarm the country of its WMD , to end Saddam Hussein 's support for terrorism and to free the Iraqi people .
" The attacks of September 11 2001 , show what the enemies of America did with four airplanes .
We will not wait to see what terrorists or terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction , " he said in March 2003 .
Two months into a war that his Defence Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , said would probably last no longer than six , Mr Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq were over .
" The tyrant has fallen , and Iraq is free , " Mr Bush said from an aircraft carrier off the Californian coast .
Three years later , he seemed willing to concede that the situation in Iraq could be compared to Vietnam but continued to describe it as the latest battlefield in the war on terror .
In January 2007 , he announced that an additional 20,000 US troops would be sent to Iraq to bolster the lawless regions around the capital .
Despite his administration 's acknowledgement of intelligence failures , Mr Bush has remained steadfast in his defence of his decision to go to war , saying in March 2008 : " The decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision early in my presidency ; it is the right decision at this point in my presidency ; and it will forever be the right decision . "
Return to the top SERGEI LAVROV Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations was one of the key mouthpieces for his country 's opposition to the US - led proposal to intervene militarily .
" Russia never considered war as an adequate tool to resolve the Iraqi issue , " he said .
Russia , along with France , opposed the idea of a second UN resolution to authorise the use of force .
In an address just a few days after the conflict began , he called the military action " unprovoked " and said it violated international law and the UN charter .
Russia 's anger over the war contributed to a deepening diplomatic rift between the two countries , prompting talk of a new Cold War .
Critics claim Russia 's opposition to the Iraq war was due to its oil interests in the country .
Five years on , as Russia 's Foreign Minister , Mr Lavrov continues to argue that the conflict threatens to destabilise Iraq 's immediate neighbours and the region as a whole .
He has repeatedly called on the international community to withdraw foreign troops and says strengthened Iraqi forces should be given responsibility for security .
Return to the top COLIN POWELL Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell presented the detailed and controversial evidence for going to war against Iraq to the UN in February 2003 .
He referred to spy satellite photos and intercepted conversations between Iraqi officials as he asserted that Saddam Hussein 's regime was hiding WMD : " Numerous human sources tell us that the Iraqis are moving , not just documents and hard drives , but weapons of mass destruction to keep them from being found by inspectors . "
It was a speech that would come to haunt him .
A year later he conceded that some of the information - on the country 's development of mobile labs for making biological weapons - " appears not to be ... that solid " .
In September 2005 , more than a year after he resigned as head of the State Department , he described the speech as a " blot " on his record .
" It will always be a part of my record .
It was painful .
It 's painful now , " he said .
In 2007 , he revealed that he had tried to dissuade George W Bush from intervening militarily in Iraq , a country which he now said was a state of civil war .
" I tried to avoid this war .
I took him through the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers . "
Return to the top DOMINIQUE DE VILLEPIN Former French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin led his country 's opposition to the war in Iraq , successfully blocking a second UN resolution proposed by the US and UK authorising the use of force .
In a much - quoted speech to the UN Security Council on 14 February 2003 , Mr de Villepin eloquently defended the diplomatic process : " The option of war might seem a priori to be the swiftest .
But let us not forget that having won the war , one has to build peace , " he said .
France threatened to employ its Security Council veto against a second UN resolution authorising the use of force .
This , combined with France 's rejection of a series of disarmament tests proposed by the UK , led to accusations that he was poisoning the very same process he wanted to protect .
In response , Mr de Villepin said : " It is n't a matter of according a few more days to Iraq before resorting to force , but to resolutely advance on the path of peaceful disarmament created by the inspections , which are a credible alternative to war . "
His prominent anti-Iraq role , brought huge popularity in France , and helped catapult him into the job of France 's prime minister , which he held between 2005 and 2007 .

Solar Thermal Islands : Cool Concept or Pipe Dream ?
May 26th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
I ran across this article at The Oil Drum and thought it was too tasty to pass up .
It describes a new design to help concentrated solar power ( CSP ) increase efficiency and reduce cost .
Here ’s the problem : solar thermal collectors focus the sun ’s heat onto a clear tube of fluid ( see : Intro to Solar Thermal ) .
The collectors generate the most energy when the sun ’s rays are parallel with the tube of fluid .
Since the sun moves across the sky throughout the days and seasons , it only reaches this “ sweet spot ” certain hours each day .
But , if the solar collectors could move to track the sun , their power output could increase dramatically .
Keep in mind that CSP is one of the most efficient forms of solar power .
Other solar technologies already track the sun through the sky , so why not CPS ?
The simple answer is in the clear fluid tubes : one long tube is mounted over a row of collectors , fixing the collectors into a straight line .
This design reduces cost and increases efficiency .
It also limits which direction the collectors can move .
They ca n’t tilt left - to - right towards the sun , for example , because of the rigidity of their construction .
Dr. Thomas Hinderling of CSEM ( Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique SA ) suggests that instead of moving each collector ( an expensive feat ) , why not move a platform beneath the concentrated solar farm ?
That way , in theory , all of the collectors would simultaneously generate the maximum possible amount of electricity , and you would utilize existing and inexpensive technology .
Everyone wins !
But to make it possible , you have to build a solar island .
Would n’t it be expensive to build an island ?
If something went wrong , you would endanger the entire installation .
CSEM has a solution .
They propose constructing a large round platform ( 5 km ! ) on an airtight frame , and filling the enclosed space with gas , effectively floating the bulk of the weight on air .
If you ’re having trouble visualizing that ( I know I did ) , think of it this way : they want to build a fancy air mattress to support the platform .
Using gas ensures an equal distribution of weight across the entire structure – assuming you do n’t spring a leak like my air mattress .
By controlling the pressure of the gas , you could build a flat or slightly convex surface and mount the solar collectors accordingly .
Anyone who doubts the power of pressurized gas should watch Jaws or perhaps Jumangi ( for a slightly scientific explanation ) .
In water , you would attach the platform to a floating ring and program motors to spin it in the desired direction .
This style of solar collector does n’t require a great degree of precision so no expensive equipment required .
On land you would use the same technology , but you would build a moat to float the circumference of the platform .
Water or oil in the moat would reduce the amount of energy required to spin it .
( I propose a circular rail system that it could be fueled by the steam or electricity generated by the CSP .
I ’m not an engineer ; perhaps that solution is too expensive ? )
As concepts go , this one is certainly big , but a number of problems must be overcome to make it a reality .
One potential problem could be high winds .
Could air moving over a flat membrane produce enough lift to cause damage ?
In the desert , where CSP works best , there ’s a lot of dust and sand .
In the ocean you must contend with salt water and rough seas .
How big must your platform be before it can withstand a hurricane ?
Another concern central to renewable energy development is transmission lines .
If you build these platforms in the ocean , as this article suggests , how will you transfer the heat or generated electricity to land ?
Despite technical difficulties , the promises of this concept are tempting enough to draw in investment .
A pilot project is under construction in Ras al Khaimah , a member state of the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , to work out the details .
( See picture , taken May 2008 )
If this technology proves feasible , it will be one more weapon against increasing renewable energy demands .
Hopefully these platforms will be scalable so that the cost of the platform decreases as its size increases .
For details and some rudimentary calculations , see the original article .

Congress has approved a $ 307 billion farm bill that rewards rich farmers who do not need the help while doing virtually nothing to help the world ’s hungry , who need all the help they can get .
President Bush should keep his promise to veto it and demand better legislation .
The bill is an inglorious piece of work tailored to the needs of big agriculture and championed by not only the usual bipartisan farm state legislators but also the Democratic leaders , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Every five years we get a new farm bill , and each time we are reminded that even reformers like Ms. Pelosi cannot resist the blandishments and power of the farmers .
The bill includes the usual favors like the tax break for racehorse breeders pushed by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Senate minority leader .
But the greater and more embarrassing defect is that the bill perpetuates the old subsidies for agriculture at a time when the prices that farmers are getting for big row crops like corn , soybeans and wheat have never been better .
Net farm income is up 50 percent .
The legislation preserves an indefensible program of direct payments amounting to about $ 5 billion a year that flow in good times and bad .
It raises support levels for wheat and soybeans , while adding several new crops to the list in a way that will make it easier for farmers to raid the federal Treasury even when prices go up .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Puerto Rican Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila and 12 associates face criminal charges related to the financing of three of Acevedo's campaigns , according to a federal indictment unsealed Thursday .
Acevedo , 48 , faces 19 counts , including conspiracy , making false statements and wire fraud .
He and legal adviser Luisa Inclan Bird are accused of soliciting , accepting and reimbursing illegal " conduit contributions " from Acevedo's family and staff .
Conduit contributions are those made by one person in the name of another .
In addition , " a group of Philadelphia - area businessmen solicited , accepted , and then reimbursed illegal conduit contributions from their own Philadelphia - area family members and staff " on behalf of Acevedo , a Justice Department news release said .
The charges relate to Acevedo's 1999 - 2000 and 2000 - 2002 campaigns for resident commissioner of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a nonvoting representative in the House of Representatives as well as his 2004 gubernatorial campaign .
A grand jury in San Juan returned the indictment Monday .
Acevedo was Puerto Rico's resident commissioner from 2001 until 2005 .
He has been governor -- the island 's top official -- since 2005 .
Acevedo and his associates also are accused of defrauding the Puerto Rican treasury of $ 7 million " by fraudulently pledging to abide by a voluntary public funding law " in his gubernatorial campaign , authorities said .
In exchange for the pledge , $ 7 million in public funds went to Acevedo 's campaign , according to the indictment .
Campaign finance laws require a cap on campaign spending as well as full reporting of all contributions and expenditures .
But prosecutors said the campaign conducted unreported fundraising and made unrecorded vendor payments during his 2004 campaign " to raise and spend far more than the limited amount to which they had agreed . "
Large sums of cash were used to conceal the contributions and vendor payments in a scheme involving the businessmen , authorities said .
Acevedo's charges include one count of conspiracy to violate federal election laws , two counts of making false statements to the Federal Election Commission , 12 counts of wire fraud , one count of federal program fraud , one count of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and two counts of filing a false tax return .
The wire fraud counts alone carry a penalty upon conviction of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 , authorities said .
A Justice Department spokeswoman would only say that authorities are working with the governor 's attorneys when asked if Acevedo was arrested .
" Our democratic system cannot function when public officials act as though they are above the law , " said Luis Fraticelli , special agent in charge of the FBI 's San Juan Field Office .
" Public officials must comply with the law , and those who do not comply will be held accountable . "
Puerto Rico is a self - governing commonwealth and a U.S. territory .
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and hold presidential primaries , but they 're not allowed to vote in the presidential election .
Puerto Ricans are the second - largest Latino group in the United States , with an estimated 4 million on the mainland and another 4 million on the island .
Acevedo has endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president and is a superdelegate for the Democratic candidate .
However , if Acevedo were detained , he would n't be able to attend the Democratic National Convention in August in Denver , Colorado .

Stephen Colbert does n’t let any of his guests on “ The Colbert Report ” off the hook , and he took no exception when Michelle Obama came on his show Tuesday night .
“ Everybody knows you and your husband are elitists , ” Mr. Colbert said right off the bat .
“ Tell me about your elite upbringing on the South Side of Chicago .
How many silver spoons in your mouth ? ”
“ We had four spoons , ” deadpanned Mrs. Obama during her late night talk show debut .
She added : “ And then my father got a raise at the plant , and we had five spoons . ”
“ That sounds posh , ” replied Mr. Colbert .
And he continued to flatter the potential first lady at nearly every opportunity .
“ You ’re a very good - looking lady , ” he said , comparing her style to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis .
( And , we have to say , Mrs. Obama was looking rather chic in a bright blue sleeveless boatneck dress . )
Mrs. Obama , though , did not return the compliments .
After imploring Mr. Colbert to serenade her ( to make her husband “ a little jealous ” ) — which he obliged , crooning “ L is for the way you look at me ” — Mrs. Obama said her husband “ has a better voice . ”
She also used her late - night appearance as a platform to talk about why women voters are turning to her husband .
She said that folks who pay too much attention to polls showing Hillary Rodham Clinton with a large percentage of the female vote in Pennsylvania are making “ a mistake . ”
“ Many women like myself who are independent , strong , focused , who care about family values , who know that Barack is special , that he has something unique to offer the country , and that his perspective is really gonna change the lives of working women , he understands because he ’s living with me , ” Mrs. Obama said .
Mr. Colbert asked his guest if she tires of her husband ’s campaign slogans , or if “ when he comes home , do you ever say , you know , ‘ Right now you ’re my husband , and I hope that you will change the cat litter ? ’ ”
Without skipping a beat , she replied : “ What I make sure Barack knows is that ‘ Yes , we can . ’ ”
What Mrs. Obama will not do , however , is make her own run for president someday .
“ One Obama in the White House will be enough , ” she said .
She also said she ’s “ hopeful ” that the Democratic primary will “ be over before the convention . ”
“ The Colbert Report ” is filming in Philadelphia this week , ahead of the state ’s April 22 primary .
Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter graced Mr. Colbert ’s program on Monday .
Ed Rendell , governor of Pennsylvania , will join him later this week .
All in all , Mrs. Obama held her own against Mr. Colbert , throwing in some jokes about her husband ’s ears and teeth as the host shared with her some children ’s drawings of Mr. Obama .
But there was one question she let slide .
“ Why would you want to be first lady ? ” Mr. Colbert asked .
“ As I understand it , the phone keeps ringing at 3 a.m . ”
Retailer Confirms : NZ GTA IV Same As Australian Version
Rockstar has n’t exactly been straight with the Australian public regarding how different our version of Grand Theft Auto IV is to the rest of the world ’s .
In fact , the publisher ’s been incredibly difficult .
With its integrity in doubt , gamers have been seeking their copies from overseas retailers , including our close neighbours in New Zealand .
Sadly , it looks like the NZ version is the edited Australian version .
Retailer Gameplanet NZ has sent out an email to its pre-order customers informing them of this fact .
We ’re not sure how it came across the information , just that it has .
We ’re still waiting for confirmation from Rockstar ( which has failed to return multiple emails on the subject ) , but I ’d say it ’s a safe bet both countries are out of luck .
The email from Gameplanet NZ can be found after the jump .

The Washington Post ran a story about one alleged threat entitled " Was it a terror sting or entrapment ? " , showing that the U.S. government lent material support to the wanna - be terrorists , and put violent ideas in their heads
Raw Story reports that the alleged terrorist group that is alleged to have planned to blow up Chicago 's Sears Tower was non-violent before a government informant infiltrated the group and planted violent ideas in their heads
There are numerous other instances of entrapment of peaceful or mentally incompetent people who are then arrested as " terrorists " ( see this , this and this )
One of al - Qaeda ’s top trainers in terrorism and how to hijack airplanes , who was a very close associate of Bin Laden , was an American citizen who was an operative for the FBI , the CIA , and the Army ( see also this article from one of Canada 's largest newspapers ) .
Indeed , while he was acting as an FBI informant , he smuggled Bin Laden in and out of Afghanistan , helped plan the attacks on US embassies in Africa , and apparently played a pivotal role in planning 9/11
An Al Qaeda operative very close to one of the top Al Qaeda leaders was a CIA informant
The president of Pakistan said that one of the masterminds of 9/11 was an MI6 ( British intelligence services ) agent
The former president of Italy said that U.S. and Israeli intelligence services were behind the 9/11 attack , and that that fact is widely known by the intelligence services of all of the western nations
According to intelligence officials in India , Pakistan 's military chief of intelligence wired $ 100,000 to the lead hijacker days before 9/11 ( mentioned here in a news roundup ) .
This is especially interesting because :
That particular chief of intelligence was appointed to that position with the approval of the U.S. , and the intelligence chief had held " consultations " with his U.S. counterparts at the CIA and the Pentagon during the week prior to September 11
11 of the hijackers received visas to the U.S. through a consular office where , according to the former head of that office , the CIA routinely insisted that visas be granted to terrorists , even when their visa applications should have been rejected under standard operating procedure
According to one of France 's most reputable newspapers , the CIA met with Bin Laden in an American hospital in Dubai in July 2001
And several of the hijackers apparently trained at U.S. military bases prior to 9/11
not
Note : I am not arguing that the hijackers ' names should be cleared or that they are good people who were victimized .
Anyone who took a single life on 9/11 is a murderer and a scoundrel .
I am , instead , simply asking who the true masterminds of 9/11 were , and who provided the resources to carry out the plan .
* The nephew was himself one of the planners of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing ( which is itself interesting , since an FBI informant had infiltrated the cell responsible for that bombing and

We 've all seen it on television .
The defense attorney argues his client was " entrapped " .
That is , that it was n't the defendant 's idea to commit the crime , but that the policethe idea andhim to do it .
Many of us have heard allegations that post - 9/11 arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members were based on very thin information .
Did you realize that all or virtually all of these arrests occurred due to entrapment ?
For example : But surely 9/11 was different , right ?.
Without doubt , the hijackers were bloodthirsty militant Muslims who , solely due to their crazy beliefs and dark hearts , decided to attack and kill Americans .
Right ?
Maybe .
But let 's take a look at the facts before deciding :
Given the above - described information , and the government 's history of entrapping peaceful or mentally incompetent people and placing violent ideas in their heads - and plans and resources in their hands - is it possible that any of the participants in the 9/11 attacks who weregovernment agents were entrapped by those who were ?
Scientists investigating the reasons why early humans -- the so - called hominins -- began walking upright say it 's unlikely that the need to carry children was a factor , as has previously been suggested .
Carrying babies that could no longer use their feet to cling to their parents in the way that young apes can has long been thought to be at least one explanation as to why humans became bipedal .
But University of Manchester researchers investigating the energy involved in carrying a child say the physical expense to the mother does not support the idea that walking upright was an evolutionary response to child transportation .
" Walking upright is one of the major characteristics that separates humans from their primate relatives , " said Dr Jo Watson , who carried out the research in the University 's Faculty of Life Sciences .
" Scientists have long hypothesised as to the reasons why hominins became bipedal in a relatively short space of time but the truth is we still do n't know for sure .
" One of the more popular explanations is that walking upright freed our forelimbs allowing us to carry objects , including children ; apes have no need to carry their young as they are able to grip using both hands and feet .
" Our study focused on the amount of energy required to carry 10kg loads , including a mannequin child .
Importantly , the distribution of the weight varied in each instance . "
The team monitored the oxygen consumption of seven women , all healthy individuals under the age of 30 , carrying either a symmetric load , in the form of a weighted vest or a 5 kg dumbell in each hand , or an asymmetric load , which was a single 10kg weight carried in one hand or a mannequin infant on one hip .
" Carrying an awkward asymmetric load , such as the infant on one side of the body , is the most energetically expensive way of transporting the weight , " said Dr Watson , whose research is published in the Journal of Human Evolution .
" Unless infant carrying resulted in significant benefits elsewhere , the high cost of carrying an asymmetrical weight suggests that infant carrying was unlikely to have been the evolutionary driving force behind bipedalism . "
The study , carried out with colleagues at the Universities of Sheffield and Salford and funded by the Natural Environment Research Council ( NERC ) , is part of a larger project , run by Dr Bill Sellers at The University of Manchester , which uses computer simulations to understand evolutionary processes , particularly the way in which we and other animals move .
Future plans are to extend this work to assess the energy cost of carrying in great apes .
Computer models of early hominins carrying loads will also be built to try and evaluate whether their body shape and posture -- long arms and short legs -- would have made them noticeably better or worse at carrying than present - day humans .
The research team hopes this will help build up a picture of how humans evolved to walk on two legs .
Since their livelihoods rely on consistently replicating physical motions , it 's hardly surprising that professional athletes are creatures of habit .
However , some stars take these rituals beyond their logical extremes .
Jumping over the baselines when taking the field in baseball ?
Pretty standard .
Wearing the same cup from high school on through your pro career like Mark McGwire reportedly did ?
Now we 're getting a little more peculiar .
Here are ten of our favorite truly absurd superstitions .
1. Kevin Rhomberg // MLB
Rhomberg played just 41 games in parts of three seasons with the Cleveland Indians from 1982 - 84 .
But in that short span , the outfielder managed to establish himself as possibly the big leagues ' most superstitious player ever .
Rhomberg 's most peculiar superstition was that if someone touched him , he had to touch that person back .
Although this compulsion was not as much of a liability as it might have been in basketball or football , it still led to some odd situations .
If Rhomberg was tagged out while running the bases , he'd wait until the defense was clearing the field at the inning 's end to chase down the player who'd touched him .
Rhomberg also refused to make right turns while on the field -- his logic was that baserunners are always turning left .
So if a situation forced him to make a right turn , he'd go to his left and make a full circle to get moving in the correct direction .
2. Caron Butler // NBA

When most of us want a glass of something heavily caffeinated that fluoresces green , we can just reach for a Mountain Dew .
Sadly for veteran small forward Caron Butler , he can't do the Dew whenever he wants anymore .
As Butler told Dan Steinberg of D.C. Sports Bog , during his All - American years at the University of Connecticut and his early seasons in the NBA , his game routine included guzzling a two - liter bottle of the sugary soda .
Butler would throw down half the bottle before tip - off and finish it off at halftime .
That is , until he joined the Washington Wizards in 2005 .
The Wiz forced Butler to switch to a more traditional sports drink : Water .
3. Mike Bibby // NBA

Like fellow NBA star LeBron James , Bibby was known to nervously bite and chew his nails during games .
When relegated to the bench for a breather during games with the Sacramento Kings , Bibby would obsessively pick at his nails until he stumbled across a better solution : Using fingernail clippers on the bench .
The clippers became his superstition , and whenever Bibby came to the bench for timeouts , someone would hand him a set so he could go to work on his nails .
4. Jason Terry // NBA
Getty Images
Bibby and Terry , college teammates at Arizona , started another odd superstition while playing for the Wildcats .
The restless pair slept in their uniform shorts the night before Arizona 's appearance in the 1997 NCAA championship game against Kentucky on the logic that it would make the game feel like it was starting sooner .
When Terry broke into the NBA with the Atlanta Hawks , he decided to start wearing the shorts of the next day 's opponent instead .
This ritual is required Terry to procure a pair of uniform shorts from each opposing NBA team .
Although his network of connections with equipment managers and former teammates has helped him out , it is n't fool - proof .
While playing for Dallas in the 2006 NBA Finals he had to wear Mavericks shorts before each game since he could n't find a pair of trunks from the opposing Miami Heat .
That 's not Terry 's only superstition , though .
He wears knee - high socks as a tribute to his father , which seems normal .
The catch is that Terry wears five pairs of them whenever he's on the court ; he claims the extra hosiery is more comfortable .
Like former third baseman Wade Boggs , Terry also insists on eating chicken before each game , a practice he also says started with Bibby at Arizona , making the 1997 Wildcats the most superstitious team to ever win the NCAA title .
5. Moises Alou // MLB

Most baseball players wear batting gloves to absorb some of the shock of making contact with the ball and to improve their grip on the bat .
A handful eschew gloves in favor of a barehanded approach , though , most famously outfielder Alou .
Alou did have a system for avoiding calluses and hardening his skin :
He urinated on his hands throughout the season .
Longtime New York Yankees catcher Jorge Posada also employed this superstition to aid in his gloveless approach at the plate .
The trick may be more gross than helpful , though : a 2004 piece in Slate questioned the value of this superstition since urine contains urea , a key ingredient in moisturizers that actually soften the skin .
6. Bruce Gardiner // NHL

Gardiner spent five years as a forward in the NHL , most notably with the Senators .
His superstition was even more unsettling than Alou 's : before each game , Gardiner would dip the blade of his stick in the locker room toilet .
Gardiner 's strange superstition started in his rookie reason in Ottawa in 1996 .
After going several games without a point , he asked veteran Tom Chorske for advice .
Chorske told Gardiner he was treating his stick too well and needed to teach the wood to respect him by dunking it in the toilet .
Although Gardiner was initially skeptical , after his cold streak extended for a few more games , he took Chorske 's advice .
He then got hot and started scoring , and he kept on hitting the bathroom before games .
Gardiner eventually backed off of dunking his stick regularly , but he'd still go back to the tactic to end a slump .
As he told NHL.com in 2007 , " You tape it , you dunk it , and you do n't touch it .
I 'd do anything for a couple of goals . " 
7. Ecuadorian National Soccer Team

Ecuador 's national team knew they needed help if they were to succeed at the 2006 World Cup in Germany .
Even after practicing and preparing as well as they could , they were still looking for an edge .
They found it in Tzamarenda Naychapi , a mystic who The Guardian called a " witch doctor - cum - shaman - cum - priest - type - fella , "  to help enlist the aide of supernatural spirits .
Naychapi supposedly visited each of the twelve stadiums being used in the World Cup and chased away any lingering evil spirits and worked a little magic on the pitches and goals themselves .
By all accounts the magic worked ; although Ecuador is not a traditional soccer powerhouse they defeated Poland and Costa Rica in group play to advance to the Round of 16 , where they lost to England 1 - 0 on a David Beckham goal .
8. Turk Wendell // MLB
Getty Images
The eccentric reliever pitched for four teams between 1993 and 2004 , posting some solid seasons in that span .
However , he 's most remembered for his bizarre superstitions .
Among Wendell 's more notable quirks was his requirement that he chew four pieces of black licorice while pitching .
At the end of each inning , he'd spit them out , return to the dugout , and brush his teeth , but only after taking a flying leap over the baseline .
Wendell , an avid hunter , also took the mound wearing a necklace adorned with trophies from animals he had harvested , including mountain lion claws and the teeth of wild pigs and buffalo .
When compared to these superstitions , Wendell 's other little oddities ( drawing three crosses in the dirt on the mound , always throwing the rosin bag down as hard as he could , and insisting figures in his contract end in 99 as a tribute to his jersey number ) do n't seem so strange .
9. NASCAR Drivers

Drivers have their share of superstitions , including green cars being bad luck and reservations about carrying $ 50 bills .
Possibly the most inexplicable , though , is their adamant refusal to deal with peanuts in their hulls .
Specifically , the hulls seem to bother drivers since shelled peanuts or nuts in candy bars are perfectly kosher for the track .
No one is quite sure from where this superstition springs , but it has almost certainly been around since NASCAR 's beginnings .
One theory explored by Snopes traces the tradition back to a 1937 race in Nashville in which peanut shells were sprinkled on the cars of five drivers , all of whom crashed during the race .
Another possible story holds that a member of NASCAR legend Junior Johnson 's crew was eating peanuts when an engine blew , and the blame fell on the nuts themselves .
Others claim that when racing was gaining popularity in the 1930s , mechanics would often find peanut shells from the nearby grandstands in the cylinders of engines that had failed .
10 . John Henderson // NFL
Lining up across from longtime Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Henderson would have been pretty terrifying under the best circumstances since he stands 6 ' 7 "  and weighed 335 pounds in his playing days .
The former University of Tennessee star had an even more intimidating pregame superstition during his days in Jacksonville , though :
He would have assistant team trainer Joe Sheehan slap him open - handed across the face as hard as Sheehan possibly can .
According to the Florida Times - Union , Henderson and Sheehan began the ritual during the 2003 season as a way to get Henderson amped up for the game by taking the day 's first hit in a controlled environment in the locker room .
Apparently the strategy worked , as Henderson twice made the Pro Bowl after Sheehan started unloading on him .
This video above illustrates the superstition in all its glory with some NSFW language .

Socialists say human rights not genetics should define the law
The controversial bill was passed in both the country 's National Assembly and in the Senate .
Supporters say it will speed up the process for genuine applicants and cite similar laws in other European nations .
Critics have attacked the law as racist and questioned the use of genetics as a basis for being allowed into France .
The bill passed by 282 votes to 235 in the lower National Assembly and by 185 votes to 136 in the upper Senate .
It offers prospective migrants DNA tests to prove their link to relatives already living in France .
It also requires hopeful incomers to take a language test and show they are familiar with French values .
Relatives of prospective immigrants living in France must show they have adequate income to support the newcomer .
Court challenge
The bill has been hugely controversial , prompting thousands of people to take part in street protests across the country last weekend .
The plan to offer DNA testing to would - be migrants has been the most controversial element of the new law , drawing criticism from civil rights groups and several African leaders .
Immigration Minister Brice Hortefeux dismissed the fears , saying 12 other European countries - including Denmark and the Netherlands - already had similar DNA testing procedures .
French opponents of the tests say they are reminiscent of the country 's policies under Nazi occupation , which discriminated against the Jews .
The bill 's proposals for DNA testing have already been diluted in response to some of the criticism .
Under the modified version passed by parliament , DNA tests will only be used in cases where children are applying to join mothers in France .
The tests will be voluntary rather than mandatory and will be paid for by the French government rather than by the migrant .
French test
Opponents of the bill say genetic testing is nonetheless likely to be regarded as mandatory for immigrants from certain poorer countries .
Civil rights groups warn that the DNA tests offered to prospective immigrants may effectively equate them with criminals , whose genetic records are already kept on police databases .
The opposition Socialists say human rights principles , not genetics , should determine who can get visas , and vowed to challenge the measure in the Constitutional Court .
Socialist deputy Arnaud Montebourg said : " This law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology . "
Communist lawmaker Patrick Braouezec said the law was " institutionalising xenophobia " .
An opinion poll in the daily Le Parisien showed 49 % supported the bill and 43 % were opposed .
System Of A Down Looks Into Holographic Touring
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Serj Tankian , the frontman for Los Angeles rock band System of a Down , is so serious about reducing his impact on the planet that he ’s investigating the use of holograms for virtual concerts .
It ’s not science fiction — we ’ve seen both Al Gore and Prince Charles give lectures at conferences from thousands of miles away while appearing to exist on stage .
But the technology may not yet exist to translate that experience in terms of a full - fledged rock performance .
From the article ,
“ ‘ I ’ve had an idea for a long time , which might sound a little crazy , but I really want to look into holographic touring , ’ Tankian told Billboard .
‘ I think we could reduce our need to travel if we could project ourselves into meetings and concerts .
We have the technology , and we ’re not using it right now .
It would open up a whole new world for touring — shows would n’t have to be limited to bars or clubs .
There would be no travel costs , so bands with very little money could play shows , and tickets would cost less . ' ”
Tankian has long been a supporter of the environment — having formed the grassroots organization Axis of Justice with Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello .
The group rallies musicians and music fans in the quest for peace , human rights and social equity .
Tankian is also quick to draw his inspiration from the people of New Zealand , where he owns a home .
He calls the country “ ecologically one of the most progressive places on earth . ”
But would people really groove to a holographic rock band ?
Tankian thinks the experience would n’t be too different .
“ After all , it ’s not like the audience can touch me , anyway , ” he said with a laugh .

An ancient river may have laid the canyon 's foundation .
The Grand Canyon may owe its existence to a much older gorge .
Getty
Visitors are often told that the Grand Canyon formed 6 million years ago , when the Colorado River assumed its current course .
But a new study indicates that a large chunk of the Grand Canyon may have taken its shape from a far more ancient gorge , carved out 55 million years ago by a river flowing in the opposite direction .
New dating of the canyon 's Upper Granite Gorge suggests that this older , 1,000 - metre - deep gorge may have been a rough template for the eastern third of the Grand Canyon .
The Colorado River may have later used this same gorge to begin etching out the 450 - kilometre - long Grand Canyon .
The results sketch out a dramatic history of the Colorado Plateau , which was pushed up by geological forces as long as 80 million years ago .
An old river flowed across the plateau creating this ' proto - canyon ' , and then many different streams eroded away the top 2,000 metres of the entire plateau , bringing it to its present elevation .
" We 're seeing a record of an ancestral Grand Canyon that was incised in rocks above the Grand Canyon and subsequently lowered to its present state , " says Rebecca Flowers of the University of Colorado , Boulder .
The results will be published in the May issue of Geological Society of America Bulletin1 .
Dating game
Flowers and her colleagues used a relatively new dating technique that examines levels of uranium and helium isotopes in rock samples containing the mineral apatite .
Because the test is sensitive to temperature , the team was able to estimate that rocks in the Upper Granite Gorge were exposed by erosion to cooler levels near Earth 's surface roughly 55 million years ago .
What 's more , the rim and the bottom of the canyon seemed to be roughly the same age .
This suggested that a canyon - like feature must have existed long before the area was worn down by erosion and the present - day rocks were exposed .
" I was surprised .
I did n’t believe the results at first , " says co-author Brian Wernicke , a geologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
" That canyon has survived all that erosion up until the present day . "
An old idea
Many have suspected that ancient rivers flowed across the Colorado Plateau long before the Grand Canyon formed .
The area boasts a number of deep ' paleocanyons ' that seem to have been carved by ancient waterways .
Flowers ' " study just confirms what we 've been saying for the last 20 years " , says Richard Young , a geologist at the State University of New York , Geneseo .
The Grand Canyon 's history was revised when a study that dated cave deposits released last month in Science indicated that the Colorado River may have begun incising the mile - deep canyon 20 million years ago2 .
This new study does not , however , change estimates of the Grand Canyon 's age , which is tied to that of the Colorado River .
Still some say the apatite results do not necessarily support the idea of an ancient Grand Canyon template .
ADVERTISEMENT
The dating " is a very coarse tool for identifying the position of a canyon or the shape of it " , says geologist Karl Karlstrom of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque .
" I do n't think it 's fair to call it a proto - Grand Canyon . "
The 55 million year - old proto - canyon is likely to have looked very different from the present - day Grand Canyon .
But , says Flowers , " the evidence suggests that a canyon of comparable dimension to what we have today must have existed at that time " .

British UFO ' sightings ' investigated by a secret branch of the MoD are soon to be revealed and officials are braced for a torrent of inquiries
Without warning , the orange UFO swooped toward them .
The crew of the RAF Vulcan bomber banked hard and radioed they were being chased across the Atlantic by a large mysterious object .
The incident was classified as a UFO sighting and the details were immediately locked away .
Now , 30 years later , the extraordinary encounter is among thousands of previously secret cases contained in the government 's ' X - Files ' that officials are to release in their entirety .
The cases , many from a little - known defence intelligence branch tasked with investigating UFO claims , will be published by the Ministry of Defence to counter what officials say is ' the maze of rumour and frequently ill - informed speculation ' surrounding Whitehall and its alleged involvement with Unidentifed Flying Objects .
The public opening of the MoD archive will expose the once highly classified work of the intelligence branch DI55 , whose mission was to investigate UFO reports and whose existence was denied by the government until recently .
Reports into about 7,000 UFO sightings investigated by defence officials - every single claim lodged over the past 30 years - are included in the files , whose staged release will begin in spring .
The decision to release Whitehall 's full back - catalogue of UFO investigations was taken last month after the Directorate of Air Space Policy , the government agency responsible for filtering sensitive reports , gave its permission to publish the biggest single release of documents in MoD history .
Now the government fears a repeat of the unprecedented demand and the website crash experienced by the French national space agency in March when it released its own UFO files .
Government IT experts are believed to have drawn up contingency plans to avoid a repeat scenario when Britain 's dossiers are finally made public .
Among the first tranche of UK cases will be the official government files into the famous Rendlesham incident , dubbed ' Britain 's Roswell ' after the US incident when a flying saucer is said to have crash - landed in the New Mexico desert 60 years ago .
On a foggy night in 1980 several witnesses reported a UFO apparently landing in Rendlesham Forest , Suffolk .
Statements claimed the craft was covered in markings similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics and aliens emerged from it .
Although a man later confessed to having staged the incident as a hoax , the files will clear up continuing speculation as to whether radiation was detected at the site after the event .
Another case reported to the intelligence branch DI55 - Britain 's version of the ' Men In Black ' - chronicles a series of reports sent to RAF Scampton , Lincolnshire , by the crew of a Vulcan bomber on exercise over the Bay of Biscay early on 26 May 1977 .
According to documents seen by The Observer , five crewmen , including the captain , co-pilot and navigators , watched ' an object ' approach their aircraft at 43,000 ft above the Atlantic .
The mysterious craft then appeared to turn and follow their precise course from a distance of four miles .
Initially , the crew said the object resembled landing lights ' with a long pencil beam of light ahead ' but as it turned towards them the lights suddenly went out leaving a diffuse orange glow with a bright fluorescent green spot in its bottom right - hand corner .
Then , according to signals sent back to Scampton , the crew noted a mystery object ' leaving from the middle of the glow on a westerly track ... climbing at very high speed at an angle of 45 degrees ' .
The Vulcan 's navigator recorded interference on his radar screen from the direction of the UFO which continued for 45 minutes as the plane headed back to Britain .
On return to the UK , the camera film from the aircraft 's radar was examined by RAF intelligence .
They found a ' strong response ' from the direction of the sighting .
The UFO was captured as ' an elongated shadow ' of a ' large - sized ' object travelling at a similar height to the Vulcan .
An intelligence report sent to the MoD the same day says the crew ' were unable to offer a logical explanation for the sighting ' .
Although hailed as the complete disclosure of the UK's UFO files , questions are likely to remain over whether all available information will be made public .
Despite the Vulcan sighting being investigated by DI55 , no details remain in the file indicating what they found or what became of the radar film .
The disclosures are more likely , claim some experts , to lend credence to the theory that such UFO incidents were , rather than alien visitations , military activities such as missile launches , testing of prototype aircraft and other activities during the Cold War .
David Clarke , a lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University and author of Flying Saucerers : A Social History of UFOlogy , said : ' Something was definitely going on , but really these files show that the government did not know either .
This release will be a source of disappointment or vindication for some , and embarrassment for others .
' Conspiracy theorists who believe that the various governments of the world are hiding secrets about the " reality " of aliens will see this as another whitewash effort by the MoD and will probably continue their self - sustaining " campaign for the truth " , when the truth will in fact now be " out there " . '
UFO researcher Joe McGonagle said : ' There will always be a hard core who believe these files were prepared for release and that there is a secret department within the military who has a separate stash of files that have not been disclosed . '
UFOs remain one of the most popular subjects for Freedom of Information requests and the release is certain to generate a massive response from the public when the files are placed in the National Archives .
Clarke , who has lodged hundreds of FoI requests , recently discovered that the government was considering destroying the 24 files created by DI55 because they were contaminated by asbestos .
Not only were the UFO records polluted , but a total of 63,000 files estimated at between six to 12 million pages - most of them classified as secret - were facing the same fate .
Having admitted the existence of the problem to Clarke , the MoD opted to instigate a £ 3 m project digitally to scan the files before they were destroyed .
Scanning of the 24 contaminated UFO files owned by DI55 was completed last year , although it is understood that names of officials in the reports will be removed .
Although the government remains reticent to discuss its intelligence work on UFOs , it is known that DI55 has been hot on the trail of flying saucers since the Sixties .
Experts admit that they work closely with the security services MI5 , MI6 and GCHQ to collect and assess evidence of potential threats to Britain .
The decision by the UK to open its files could lead to the US government following suit .
A group of former pilots and government officials recently urged the Pentagon to reopen investigations into claims of UFO sightings .

In the sentence in the article above : ' Although the government remains reticent to discuss ...' , we should have said reluctant , not reticent .
This has been corrected .
The European Parliament recently passed a proposal to treat Internet censorship by repressive regimes as a trade barrier .
The proposal , submitted by Jules Maaten of the rightist Dutch VVD party , passed on a 571 - 38 vote .
Maaten describes it as an " unusual , but effective way " to promote freedom of expression on the Internet .
The initiative targets countries that have enacted heavy restrictions what their citizens can do and see online .
First and foremost on the list is China and its " great firewall . "
The Chinese government is well known for blocking certain phrases and web sites from view within its borders , and has also turned its attention to RSS feeds .
The country also " encourages " bloggers to register with the government .
" The ' Great Chinese Firewall ' should be seen as an international trade barrier , " Maaten said according to Livre .
" In addition to American companies like Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft , European Internet companies like Wanadoo , Telecom Italia , and France Telecom have to unwillingly censor their services in authoritarian states . "
The American companies named by Maaten have been criticized for their willingness to go along with the Chinese government 's censorship requirements .
In early 2006 , executives from those companies were hauled before Congress to answer questions about their business practices in China , while Yahoo has apologized for withholding information from congressional investigators looking into the company 's disclosure of dissident e-mails .
Amnesty International has also been critical of Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo 's dealings in China .
If adopted , Maaten 's proposal would require the EU to classify any Internet censorship as a barrier to trade , and would require that the issue be raised in any trade negotiations .
Economic sanctions and trade restrictions have been used in the past as means of getting countries to change their policies , but this is one of the first proposals to tie trade to ' Net censorship .
The measure will now go to the European Council for consideration .

Mr. Whitson taught sixth - grade science .
On the first day of class , he gave us a lecture about a creature called the cattywampus , an ill - adapted nocturnal animal that was wiped out during the Ice Age .
He passed around a skull as he talked .
We all took notes and later had a quiz .
When he returned my paper , I was shocked .
There was a big red X through each of my answers .
I had failed .
There had to be some mistake !
I had written down exactly what Mr. Whitson said .
Then I realized that everyone in the class had failed .
What had happened ?
Very simple , Mr. Whitson explained .
He had made up all the stuff about the cattywampus .
There had never been any such animal .
The information in our notes was , therefore , incorrect .
Did we expect credit for incorrect answers ?
Needless to say , we were outraged .
What kind of test was this ?
And what kind of teacher ?
We should have figured it out , Mr. Whitson said .
After all , at the every moment he was passing around the cattywampus skull ( in truth , a cat 's ) , had n't he been telling us that no trace of the animal remained ?
He had described its amazing night vision , the color of its fur and any number of other facts he could n't have known .
He had given the animal a ridiculous name , and we still had n't been suspicious .
The zeroes on our papers would be recorded in his grade book , he said .
And they were .
Mr. Whitson said he hoped we would learn something from this experience .
Teachers and textbooks are not infallible .
In fact , no one is .
He told us not to let our minds go to sleep , and to speak up if we ever thought he or the textbook was wrong .
Every class was an adventure with Mr. Whitson .
I can still remember some science periods almost from beginning to end .
On day he told us that his Volkswagon was a living organism .
It took us two full days to put together a refutation he would accept .
He did n't let us off the hook until we had proved not only that we knew what an organism was but also that we had the fortitude to stand up for the truth .
We carried our brand - new skepticism into all our classes .
This caused problems for the other teachers , who were n't used to being challenged .
Our history teacher would be lecturing about something , and then there would be clearings of the throat and someone would say ``cattywampus . ''
If I 'm ever asked to propose a solution to the problems in our schools , it will be Mr. Whitson .
I have n't made any great scientific discoveries , but Mr. Whitson 's class gave me and my classmates something just as important : the courage to look people in the eye and tell them they are wrong .
He also showed us that you can have fun doing it .
Not everyone sees the value in this .
I once told an elementary school teacher about Mr. Whitson .
The teacher was appalled .
`` He should n't have tricked you like that , '' he said .
I looked that teacher right in the eye and told him that he was wrong .
French vineyard owners are returning to a slower pace of life by starting to export their wine by sailing boat - a method last used in the 1800s - to reduce their carbon footprint .
Later this month 60,000 bottles from Languedoc will be shipped to Ireland in a 19th - century barque , saving 18,375 lb of carbon .
Further voyages to Bristol , Manchester and even Canada are planned soon afterwards .
The three - mast barque Belem , which was launched in 1896 , the last French merchant sailing vessel to be built , will sail into Dublin following a voyage from Bordeaux that should last about four days .
The wines will be delivered to Bordeaux by barge using the Canal du Midi and Canal du Garonne , which run across southern France from Sète in the east , via Béziers in Languedoc .
Each bottle will be labelled : ' Carried by sailing ship , a better deal for the planet . '
Although the whole process will end up taking up to a week longer than a flight , it is estimated it will save 4.9 oz of carbon per bottle .
Frederic Albert , founder of the shipping company Compagnie de Transport Maritime à la Voile ( CTMV ) , said : ' My idea was to do something for the planet and something for the wines of Languedoc .
One of my grandfathers was a wine - maker and one was a sailor . '
With French wine exports booming following a number of difficult years , Albert said some 250 producers in Languedoc alone were keen to use his ships .
The 170ft Belem , which was first used to transport chocolate from South America and is named after a Brazilian port , is the first of seven planned to be working by 2013 .
Seven private investors have contributed 70 per cent of the business 's start - up costs of £ 40 m .
Bank loans have provided the rest .
' There is a lot of interest in green investments in France , ' said Albert .
Ships will return to France with an equivalent tonnage of crushed glass for recycling into wine bottles at factories in Bordeaux and Béziers .
Despite the time involved in transporting it , the wine should also remain relatively cheap , at between € 7 and € 20 a bottle .
Albert said he would make sure that only the greenest wines would travel by sea .
' We chose the best wine in the area , but it must also be made in a sustainable way , using as many natural products as possible , ' he said , adding that delivery times to Ireland and Britain had been calculated using historic charts .
' We had someone who studied a century of weather conditions to work them out , ' he said .
Albert said his fleet would also be used for advertising in the ports they sailed to .
He said : ' There will be tastings on board .
The Belem can hold around 100 guests , so there will be plenty of room for importers to promote their wines . '
While the French are pioneering the export of wine by sailing ship , the British have already started moving it via canal .
Last October Tesco started ferrying wine by barge from Liverpool to Manchester along the Manchester Ship Canal .
The move took 50 lorries off the road every week and cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent , Tesco claimed .
Tesco's new cargo service involves three journeys a week , delivering an estimated 600,000 litres of wine on each journey along the 40 - mile stretch of the canal .
The containers of wine from Australia , California , Chile and Argentina are then transported to a bottling site half a mile away , where they are packed for Tesco supermarkets across Britain .
The authorities called in a locksmith to open the gate , but they were unable to move the deadbolts to open the front doors of the temple .
They tried to use a “ jaws of life ” tool , normally used to remove people trapped in cars after accidents , to open the doors .
But the doors were too tightly constructed , Captain Caver said .
Finally , a SWAT team was called to apply brute force .
As the team broke down the doors , about 57 men from the church stood in a circle around the building to bear witness , Captain Caver said .
The sect members sank to their knees in prayer , some sobbing , and one young man rushed to intervene .
He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of interfering with a public servant but has been released on bond .
Inside , the three - story temple held hints about possible under - age marriage rites , but no answer to what had happened to the 16 - year - old who called the authorities .
The authorities found shredded documents , but could not determine when they had been destroyed .
The state also found beds on the top floor of the temple , where authorities suspect that older men had sex with under - age girls , court documents released on Wednesday said .
In one rumpled bed , authorities found a long strand of hair , the affidavit states .
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , or F.L.D.S. , which bought the ranch in Eldorado , about 45 miles south of here , in 2003 , is mostly concentrated in southern Utah and northern Arizona .
Law - enforcement officials say the group , which has perhaps 10,000 members , broke from the Mormon Church more than a century ago and has no link today .
It was with some trepidation that I went into the cellar this week to take some meter readings in order to find out how the solar panels we had fitted on our house exactly a year ago have been performing .
Was the hefty sum of £ 8,500 we forked out last year a good investment or a waste of money ?
Well , the news is better than I had expected .
We , a family of four , have produced 92 % of our electricity usage from the roof of a century - old terraced house in south - east London - laying to rest the idea that Britain is not sunny enough for solar power .
It also disproves any suggestion this sort of technology only works in state - of - the - art , modern detached houses .
Not only will we not pay for any electricity , we should get a rebate of about £ 50 once a payment from the so - called renewables obligation ( RO ) scheme , which rewards microgeneration schemes with cash , is included .
In all , the saving for the past year will be around £ 500 , giving a return on our investment of 6 % , which is not subject to tax .
Next year , when the payments from the RO scheme will double for photovoltaic ( PV ) solar installations , we will get about £ 150 back , giving a total return of 7 % .
That will rise further if energy prices continue to climb - which is likely after oil prices hit yet another high this week .
There is an important caveat here .
I received a 50 % grant for the system from the government 's low - carbon buildings programme - the total cost of buying and installing the panels was £ 17,000 .
Unfortunately , the government is so pathetic at supporting low - carbon technologies that it last year cut the maximum grant to £ 2,500 because the scheme was so popular .
As a result , demand has collapsed to the extent that the small company that fitted my system has gone out of business .
That means your return on a system purchased now will be lower - little more than 3 % for one like mine this year , rising to close on 4 % when the RO payments increase next year .
Still , 4 % that is not taxable is comparable to a building society account that you do pay tax on .
What is particularly annoying about all this is that in Germany , where a proper system of support has boosted volumes - the Germans kitted out 130,000 houses with solar PV last year , while the UK managed less than 300 - costs have fallen dramatically and a system like mine would only cost about £ 9,000 without a grant .
Our system works by producing power - up to 3 kilowatts - during the day and exporting much of it to the grid because we are out at work and school most days .
It 's fun to watch our old - fashioned meter spinning backwards when the sun is shining .
We get 12 p per kilowatt hour ( kwh ) for what we export , though we pay more for what we import in the evenings .
But the RO payment of £ 105 makes up the difference .
Mind you , in Germany , we would get about 35 p / kwh .
No wonder the Germans have gone mad for PV .
We are now with npower , although Scottish and Southern Energy offers a flat 18p / kwh including the RO payment which , in terms of sheer simplicity , has to be a winner , although my 12 p plus RO is equivalent to around 18 p .
They also fit an export meter for free whereas npower estimates our exports at 50 % of what we produce .
I will soon have a new meter fitted because none of the power companies likes the idea of them turning backwards .
I left Powergen last year because the npower deal was the best on the market .
Powergen , you may not be surprised to hear , was really difficult about my going .
It could n't grasp that my meter had gone backwards and unilaterally added 4,000 kwh ( a year 's consumption ) to our final bill - daylight robbery , if you will pardon the pun .
I had to really battle with them to get a final refund .
This whole thing can be a hassle so make sure you choose the right supplier at the outset to avoid having to change .
Just as exciting as our solar output was the fact that , at the same time as fitting the panels , we took a bunch of measures in the house to cut our electricity consumption .
We changed every bulb in the house ( except the fridge and microwave ) to low - energy ones , and replaced our ageing fridge and freezer .
Meanwhile , our electric oven packed up last summer , so we replaced it with a gas one , figuring that generating heat with gas was probably a lower - carbon solution than doing it with electricity .
The upshot is that we cut our electricity use from 4,000 kilowatt hours a year over the previous five years to a tad under 3,000 kwh , a reduction of 25 % .
As our 3 kw peak solar panels produced 2,730 kwh over the year , we only used about 250 kwh of electricity from the grid .
The PV system is not even on a south - facing roof - it faces south - east - and is at a shallower angle than would be ideal .
But still it performed well , and will go on doing so for decades .
The estimate of panel " degradation " , or loss of performance , is said to be 0.5 % a year , so negligible .
People seem fixated with asking how many years the system will take to pay back .
I could answer the question at the current yield of 6 % , but that is up to 7 % next year , so the payback time will shorten .
And if oil prices continue to rise , pushing up electricity prices , my yield will rise and the payback will shorten .
So it is impossible to predict .
But all that misses the point .
The system represents an improvement to the house that saves money .
So it should generate a higher sale value if I move .
People do n't ask what the payback time is of a new kitchen or bathroom - also home improvements - so why do they ask about a carbon - saving technology ?
What has been interesting is the effect it has had on us as a family .
You might think generating your own power would make you relaxed about leaving lights on or the TV on standby .
But the contrary is true .
It has woken us all up to the realities of energy use .
The computer , TV , lights , everything , we now turn off at the wall when they are not in use .
We have some of those remote control switches to turn off wall sockets that are hard to get to .
In future when we go on holiday , we will empty the fridge and freezer and switch them off .
The challenge now is to raise that 92 % figure to 100 % .
The tumble dryer has long gone , and I feel that hair - dryer use may be excessive .
But in a family with two girls , that may prove a struggle .
However , I have my eye on the electric toothbrushes next !
We are also turning our attention to our use of gas .
Last year , our boiler packed up ( it was an expensive year ! ) so we fitted a new , condensing one which will use less gas .
And I am going to double the thickness of the loft insulation .
Longer term , I plan to fit a solar thermal system which should provide between 50 % and 70 % of our hot water .
Then it would probably be worth plumbing a hot - water feed into the dishwasher and washing machine rather than using cold water heated by electricity .
If any readers have views on this , please let me know .
The aim is to see how little energy a fairly average Victorian terraced house can use and what the costs involved are .
So far , it has been about £ 10,000 to achieve the electricity savings mentioned above .
The additional loft insulation will be a few hundred pounds .
A solar thermal system will be about £ 3,500 .

I am always on the hunt for new financial tools that can help us reach our goals .
One of these goals includes retiring early .
Or , at least , we are certainly trying to get to that point .
We already have two different investment accounts we are using to help us retire early .
But , I am always looking for new ways to diversify our portfolio .
So , when I recently heard about an investing app called Acorns , my interest was peaked .
Acorns Initial Set -Up
When you first sign up for Acorns , you have to choose your initial monthly plan .
I chose to go with the lowest plan , which is only $ 1 per month .
The Lite plan only offers a taxable investment account .
Which was fine for us because we already have some Roth IRA accounts that we max out .
The next plan up is the Personal $ 3 per month account .
This one adds a checking account and an IRA option .
And the last plan on the tier is the Family plan at $ 5 per month .
This one adds the option to open investment accounts for your kids as well as everything offered on the other two plans .
But , since this was just another investment option for us and we already have all of the other types of accounts , the cheapest option is what we went with .
Once you set up your account , you can choose how much you would like to contribute and how often .
We are n’t investing a ton into this account since it is just for diversification purposes .
Plus , we wanted to see how it performed first before we bumped up any contributions .
What is Rounding - Up ?
After the initial set up , you will be informed of their rounding - up technique .
You have the option to attach a checking account and credit card to this feature .
And this is exactly what we did .
We just wish we would have been able to attach more than one of each the the account .
But that might be a possibility on the higher tiered accounts .
Either way , once you have external accounts connected to your Acorns account , they will begin the rounding - up process .
Every time you make a purchase , Acorns will round the purchase up to the next whole dollar .
Once you reach $ 5 in round - up money , that will be transferred from your initial funding account into your Acorns investment account .
But , you have the opportunity to increase your round - up ’s even higher , if you choose to .
You can add a multiplier of 2x , 3 x or 10 x what each round - up is .
We chose to add the 3 x multiplier to our account .
This means that each time we make a purchase and a round - up happens , Acorns multiplies that number by 3 .
And that is the amount that will be taken out of our initial funding account to be put into the Acorns account .
And for one more extra bonus , you can choose how much you want Acorns to invest from any whole dollar purchases .
We chose the highest amount which is an extra $ 1 .
But since we have the 3 x multiplier on , it means we are actually investing an extra $ 3 per purchase on any whole dollar purchase made .
How Acorns Invests ?
When you choose the regular taxable investment account , there are only a few options for how your money is invested .
You can choose between 5 different portfolio options :
Conservative – 20 % each of 5 different Government and / or Corporate Bond ETF’s
– 20 % each of 5 different Government and / or Corporate Bond ETF ’s Moderately Conservative – 4 % Med Company Stocks ; 24 % Large Company Stocks ; 12 % International Company Stocks ; 18 % Short Term USD Bond ; 42 % US Aggregate Bond
– 4 % Med Company Stocks ; 24 % Large Company Stocks ; 12 % International Company Stocks ; 18 % Short Term USD Bond ; 42 % US Aggregate Bond Moderate – 2 % Small Company Stocks ; 5 % Medium Company Stocks ; 35 % Large Company Stocks ; 18 % International Company Stocks ; 12 % Short Term USD Bond ; 28 % US Aggregate Bond
– 2 % Small Company Stocks ; 5 % Medium Company Stocks ; 35 % Large Company Stocks ; 18 % International Company Stocks ; 12 % Short Term USD Bond ; 28 % US Aggregate Bond Moderately Aggressive – 38 % Large Company Stocks ; 10 % each of Treasury Bonds and Corporate Bonds ; 4 % Vanguard Emerging Market ETF ; 8 % Vanguard REIT ETF ; 14 % Vanguard Small Cap ETF ; 16 % Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF
– 38 % Large Company Stocks ; 10 % each of Treasury Bonds and Corporate Bonds ; 4 % Vanguard Emerging Market ETF ; 8 % Vanguard REIT ETF ; 14 % Vanguard Small Cap ETF ; 16 % Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF Aggressive – 5 % Small Company Stocks ; 10 % Medium Company Stocks ; 55 % Large Company Stocks ; 30 % International Company Stocks
Each of these options will be based on your risk tolerance and your time horizon .
You do n’t get to choose the individual funds that are in each option though .
These are already pre-chosen for you .
Which can make things a bit easier , if you prefer more of a hands off investing option .
Acorns will suggest which investment option is the best for you based on what information you filled out in your profile .
But , ultimately , you get to decide which one suits you best .
And if you decide that you want to change to a different portfolio option , it is extremely easy to do so with the click of a button .
Acorns Summary
Overall , we have had a good experience with Acorns so far .
The platform is extremely easy to set up and use .
Plus , they have a lot of smaller articles to help guide you along your way with investing .
Even though we ca n’t pick and choose our individual investments , we have been happy with the performance so far .
And , Acorns has made it super easy to help diversify our retirement portfolio without much work from us .
We love the round - up feature because I do n’t have to think about it .
Money just automatically gets transferred in whenever we make purchases .
Acorns is great if you are just getting started with investing and have a difficult time remembering to fund your account .
Or if you do n’t want to be that involved with your investment account .
You want to just set it and forget it .
But , if you prefer a more hands on approach , there are plenty of other options that will suit you better .
No matter which investment platform or app you go with , make sure it is a good fit for you first .
Because if the investment strategy you are using does n’t work for your life , then you wo n’t use it to maximum effectiveness .
Which , ultimately , defeats the purpose .
Have you tried Acorns as an investment strategy yet ?
What are your thoughts on the platform and performance ?

[ This essay — a blistering attack on paper money and an embrace of gold and silver as the money of a free society — is part of a larger pamphlet on government written in 1786 .
It appears in the Complete Writings of Thomas Paine , edited by Philip Foner , Citadel Press , 1945 , pp. 404 .
Mises.org is the source of its first - time appearance online ]
I remember a German farmer expressing as much in a few words as the whole subject requires ; " money is money , and paper is paper . "
All the invention of man cannot make them otherwise .
The alchemist may cease his labors , and the hunter after the philosopher 's stone go to rest , if paper can be metamorphosed into gold and silver , or made to answer the same purpose in all cases .
Gold and silver are the emissions of nature : paper is the emission of art .
The value of gold and silver is ascertained by the quantity which nature has made in the earth .
We cannot make that quantity more or less than it is , and therefore the value being dependent upon the quantity , depends not on man .
Man has no share in making gold or silver ; all that his labors and ingenuity can accomplish is , to collect it from the mine , refine it for use and give it an impression , or stamp it into coin .
Its being stamped into coin adds considerably to its convenience but nothing to its value .
It has then no more value than it had before .
Its value is not in the impression but in itself .
Take away the impression and still the same value remains .
Alter it as you will , or expose it to any misfortune that can happen , still the value is not diminished .
It has a capacity to resist the accidents that destroy other things .
It has , therefore , all the requisite qualities that money can have , and is a fit material to make money of — and nothing which has not all those properties can be fit for the purpose of money .
Paper , considered as a material whereof to make money , has none of the requisite qualities in it .
It is too plentiful , and too easily come at .
It can be had anywhere , and for a trifle .
There are two ways in which I shall consider paper .
The only proper use for paper , in the room of money , is to write promissory notes and obligations of payment in specie upon .
A piece of paper , thus written and signed , is worth the sum it is given for , if the person who gives it is able to pay it , because in this case , the law will oblige him .
But if he is worth nothing , the paper note is worth nothing .
The value , therefore , of such a note , is not in the note itself , for that is but paper and promise , but in the man who is obliged to redeem it with gold or silver .
Paper , circulating in this manner , and for this purpose , continually points to the place and person where , and of whom , the money is to be had , and at last finds its home ; and , as it were , unlocks its master 's chest and pays the bearer .
But when an assembly undertakes to issue paper as money , the whole system of safety and certainty is overturned , and property set afloat .
Paper notes given and taken between individuals as a promise of payment is one thing , but paper issued by an assembly as money is another thing .
It is like putting an apparition in the place of a man ; it vanishes with looking at it , and nothing remains but the air .
Money , when considered as the fruit of many years ' industry , as the reward of labor , sweat and toil , as the widow 's dowry and children 's portion , and as the means of procuring the necessaries and alleviating the afflictions of life , and making old age a scene of rest , has something in it sacred that is not to be sported with , or trusted to the airy bubble of paper currency .
By what power or authority an assembly undertakes to make paper money , is difficult to say .
It derives none from the Constitution , for that is silent on the subject .
It is one of those things which the people have not delegated , and which , were they at any time assembled together , they would not delegate .
It is , therefore , an assumption of power which an assembly is not warranted in , and which may , one day or other , be the means of bringing some of them to punishment .
I shall enumerate some of the evils of paper money and conclude with offering means for preventing them .
One of the evils of paper money is that it turns the whole country into stock jobbers .
The precariousness of its value and the uncertainty of its fate continually operate , night and day , to produce this destructive effect .
Having no real value in itself it depends for support upon accident , caprice , and party ; and as it is the interest of some to depreciate and of others to raise its value , there is a continual invention going on that destroys the morals of the country .
It was horrid to see , and hurtful to recollect , how loose the principles of justice were left , by means of the paper emissions during the war .
The experience then had should be a warning to any assembly how they venture to open such a dangerous door again .
As to the romantic , if not hypocritical , tale that a virtuous people need no gold and silver , and that paper will do as well , it requires no other contradiction than the experience we have seen .
Though some well - meaning people may be inclined to view it in this light , it is certain that the sharper always talks this language .
There are a set of men who go about making purchases upon credit , and buying estates they have not wherewithal to pay for ; and having done this , their next step is to fill the newspapers with paragraphs of the scarcity of money and the necessity of a paper emission , then to have a legal tender under the pretense of supporting its credit , and when out , to depreciate it as fast as they can , get a deal of it for a little price , and cheat their creditors ; and this is the concise history of paper money schemes .
But why , since the universal customs of the world has established money as the most convenient medium of traffic and commerce , should paper be set up in preference to gold and silver ?
The productions of nature are surely as innocent as those of art ; and in the case of money , are abundantly , if not infinitely , more so .
The love of gold and silver may produce covetousness , but covetousness , when not connected with dishonesty , is not properly a vice .
It is frugality run to an extreme .
But the evils of paper money have no end .
Its uncertain and fluctuating value is continually awakening or creating new schemes of deceit .
Every principle of justice is put to the rack , and the bond of society dissolved .
The suppression , therefore , of paper money might very properly have been put into the act for preventing vice and immorality .
The pretense for paper money has been that there was not a sufficiency of gold and silver .
This , so far from being a reason for paper emissions , is a reason against them .
As gold and silver are not the productions of North America , they are , therefore , articles of importation ; and if we set up a paper manufactory of money , it amounts , as far as it is able , to prevent the importation of hard money , or to send it out again as fast it comes in ; and by following this practice we shall continually banish the specie , till we have none left , and be continuously complaining of the grievance instead of remedying the cause .
Considering gold and silver as articles of importation , there will in time , unless we prevent it by paper emissions , be as much in the country as the occasions of it require , for the same reasons there are as much of other imported articles .
But as every yard of cloth manufactured in the country occasions a yard the less to be imported , so it is by money , with this difference , that in the one case we manufacture the thing itself and in the other we do not .
We have cloth for cloth , but we have only paper dollars for silver ones .
As to the assumed authority of any assembly in making paper money , or paper of any kind , a legal tender , or in other language , a compulsive payment , it is a most presumptuous attempt at arbitrary power .
There can be no such power in a republican government : the people have no freedom — and property no security — where this practice can be acted : and the committee who shall bring in a report for this purpose , or the member who moves for it , and he who seconds it merits impeachment , and sooner or later may expect it .
Of all the various sorts of base coin , paper money is the basest .
It has the least intrinsic value of anything that can be put in the place of gold and silver .
A hobnail or a piece of wampum far exceeds it .
And there would be more propriety in making those articles a legal tender than to make paper so .
It was the issuing base coin , and establishing it as a tender , that was one of the principal means of finally overthrowing the power of the Stuart family in Ireland .
The article is worth reciting as it bears such a resemblance to the process practiced in paper money .
Brass and copper of the basest kind , old cannon ; broken bells , household utensils were assiduously collected ; and from every pound weight of such vile materials , valued at four pence , pieces were coined and circulated to the amount of five pounds normal value .
By the first proclamation they were made current in all payments to and from the King and the subjects of the realm , except in duties on the importation of foreign goods , money left in trust , or due by mortgage , bills or bonds ; and James promised that when the money should be decried , he would receive it in all payments , or make full satisfaction in gold and silver .
The nominal value was afterwards raised by subsequent proclamations , the original restrictions removed , and this base money was ordered to be received in all kinds of payments
As brass and copper grew scarce , it was made of still viler materials , of tin and pewter , and old debts of one thousand pounds were discharged by pieces of vile metal amounting to thirty shillings in intrinsic value .
( Leland 's History of Ireland , vol. iv. p. 265 . )
Had King James thought of paper , he needed not to have been at the trouble or expense of collecting brass and copper , broken bells , and household utensils .
The laws of a country ought to be the standard of equity , and calculated to impress on the minds of the people the moral as well as the legal obligations of reciprocal justice .
But tender laws , of any kind , operate to destroy morality , and to dissolve , by the pretense of law , what ought to be the principle of law to support , reciprocal justice between man and man — and the punishment of a member who should move for such a law ought to be death .
When the recommendation of Congress , in the year 1780 , for repealing the tender laws was before the Assembly of Pennsylvania , on casting up the votes , for and against bringing in a bill to repeal those laws , the numbers were equal , and the casting vote rested on the speaker , Colonel Bayard .
" I give my vote , " said he , " for the repeal , from a consciousness of justice ; the tender laws operate to establish iniquity by law . "
But when the bill was brought in , the House rejected it , and the tender laws continued to be the means of fraud .
If anything had or could have a value equal to gold and silver , it would require no tender law ; and if it had not that value it ought not to have such a law ; and , therefore , all tender laws are tyrannical and unjust and calculated to support fraud and oppression .
Most of the advocates for tender laws are those who have debts to discharge , and who take refuge in such a law , to violate their contracts and cheat their creditors .
But as no law can warrant the doing an unlawful act , therefore the proper mode of proceeding , should any such laws be enacted in future , will be to impeach and execute the members who moved for and seconded such a bill ; and put the debtor and the creditor in the same situation they were in , with respect to each other , before such a law was passed .
Men ought to be made to tremble at the idea of such a bare - faced act of injustice .
It is in vain to talk of restoring credit , or complain that money cannot be borrowed at legal interest ; until every idea of tender laws is totally and publicly reprobated and extirpated from among us .
As to paper money , in any light it can be viewed , it is at best a bubble .
Considered as property , it is inconsistent to suppose that the breath of an assembly , whose authority expires with the year , can give to paper the value and duration of gold .
They cannot even engage that the next assembly shall receive it in taxes .
And by the precedent ( for authority there is none ) , that one assembly makes paper money , another may do the same , until confidence and credit are totally expelled , and all the evils of depreciation acted over again .
The amount , therefore , of paper money is this , that it is the illegitimate offspring of assemblies , and when their year expires , they leave a vagrant on the hands of the public … .
Paper money is like dram - drinking , it relieves for a moment by deceitful sensation , but gradually diminishes the natural heat , and leaves the body worse than it found it .
Were not this the case , and could money be made of paper at pleasure , every sovereign in Europe would be as rich as he pleased .
But the truth is , that it is a bubble and the attempt vanity .
Nature has provided the proper materials for money : gold and silver , and any attempt of ours to rival her is ridiculous … .
Paper money appears at first sight to be a great saving , or rather that it costs nothing ; but it is the dearest money there is .
The ease with which it is emitted by an assembly at first serves as a trap to catch people in at last .
It operates as an anticipation of the next year 's taxes .
If the money depreciates , after it is out , it then , as I have already remarked , has the effect of fluctuating stock , and the people become stock - jobbers to throw the loss on each other .
If it does not depreciate , it is then to be sunk by taxes at the price of hard money ; because the same quantity of produce , or goods , that would procure a paper dollar to pay taxes with , would procure a silver one for the same purpose .
Therefore , in any case of paper money , it is dearer to the country than hard money , by all the expense which the paper , printing , signing , and other attendant charges come to , and at last goes into the fire .
Suppose one hundred thousand dollars in paper money to be emitted every year by the assembly , and the same sum to be sunk every year by taxes , there will then be no more than one hundred thousand dollars out at any one time .
If the expense of paper and printing , and of persons to attend the press while the sheets are striking off , signers , etc. be five percent . , it is evident that in the course of twenty years ' emissions , the one hundred thousand dollars will cost the country two hundred thousand dollars .
Because the paper maker 's and printer 's bills , and the expense of supervisors and signers , and other attendant charges will in that time amount to as much as the money amounts to ; for the successive emissions are but a recoinage of the same sum .
But gold and silver require to be coined but once , and will last a hundred years ( better than paper will one year ) and at the end of that time be still gold and silver .
Therefore , the saving to government , in combining its aid and security with that of the bank in procuring hard money , will be an advantage to both , and to the whole community .
The case to be provided against , after this , will be that the government do not borrow too much of the bank , nor the bank lend more notes than it can redeem ; and , therefore , should anything of this kind be undertaken , the best way will be to begin with a moderate sum , and observe the effect of it .
The interest given the bank operates as a bounty on the importation of hard money , and which may not be more than the money expended in making paper emissions .

The senators warn that the situation is getting critical
The civilian nuclear energy deal between the two countries has been delayed because of opposition from India 's communist parties .
The parties provide key support to PM Manmohan Singh 's minority government .
They argue that the accord would give the US undue influence over India 's foreign and nuclear policy .
Under the terms of the deal , India would get access to US civil nuclear technology and fuel , in return for opening its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection .
But its nuclear weapons sites would remain off - limits .
The deal will also eventually need to be approved by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , as well as by the 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade .
' Difficult to ratify '
The delegation of three US senators arrived in Delhi on a day - long visit after monitoring Pakistan 's elections .
" Time is of the essence , " Joseph Biden , one of the senators , said , urging India to confirm its support for the nuclear deal .
The left - wing parties have been protesting against the nuclear deal
The visiting Americans say the deal is running out of time because of the tight legislative agenda for 2008 ahead of November 's US presidential elections .
" If we do n't have the deal back with us clearly prior to the month of July , it will be very difficult to ratify , " Mr Biden said .
Whatever the merits of the deal , passing it through Congress after July would be harder because of " the mechanics on which our system functions " , he said .
Mr Biden also said it was " highly unlikely " the next president would be able to authorise the same deal , if it did not reach Congress in time .
" It will be renegotiated , " Mr Biden said .
" It is critical , if India want that deal , they move on relatively soon , within a matter of weeks , '' he said .
Mr Biden and senators John Kerry and Chuck Hagel met Prime Minister Singh on Wednesday to express their concerns over the issue .
India tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998 and consequently is banned from buying fuel for atomic reactors and related equipment .
The deal has already been pronounced dead by some analysts because of India 's domestic political rivalries .

As the House of Representatives takes the time it needs to negotiate a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , the White House has launched a public assault on the legislative body .
The administration claims that the House has endangered the country by letting the Protect America Act ( PAA ) expire and should pass the bill already approved by the Senate .
The Senate bill , however , is unconstitutional and contains immunity for the telecommunications companies that aided the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is urging the House to continue to stand strong for the Constitution .
In a February 22nd letter to the House Permanent Select Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes , Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell made several misleading claims .
A corrective statement was released by the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding the cooperation of “ private partners ” the following day .
Here , the ACLU refutes some of the administration ’s arguments .
The Administration claims that :
FISA 's requirements , unlike those of the Protect America Act and the bipartisan Senate bill , impair our ability to collect information on foreign intelligence targets located overseas .
… " because of the hurdles under FISA 's emergency authorization provisions and the requirement to go to the FISA Court within 72 hours , our resource constraints limit our use of emergency authorizations to certain high - priority circumstances and cannot simply be employed for every foreign intelligence target ” and that " our intelligence professionals need to be able to obtain foreign intelligence from foreign targets with speed and agility . "
The Facts :
The NSA and CIA have unfettered authority to wiretap at will outside the United States .
FISA only regulates domestic spying .
No matter what , in an emergency situation , the government can begin a wiretap immediately .
Probable cause is a very low evidentiary threshold , so if the government does not have enough of a justification to obtain a judge ’s approval ( within 72 hours ) there is probably not a very good reason for them to believe there ’s an emergency in the first place .
Let ’s not forget that this push to amend FISA started because the administration claimed that there was a simple “ foreign to foreign ” fix needed .
There is substantial agreement that a FISA warrant should not be needed to intercept communications between foreigners in foreign countries .
Since July , the administration and DNI have consistently asked for a mile under the guise of an inch .
If the foreign to foreign fix is all that is needed , it would easily pass with overwhelming bipartisan and bicameral cooperation .
The fact is the administration wants Congress to legalize the warrantless domestic wiretapping program that was disclosed over two years ago ( to the outrage of many in Congress , it should be noted ) and to make sure the phone companies emerge from their role in the program without a scratch .
The Administration claims that :
The FISA Court requires a showing of probable cause before it will authorize surveillance and satisfying the probable cause requirement will result in unacceptable gaps and delays in monitoring communications of foreign terrorists overseas .
… " it makes no sense to require a showing of probable cause for surveillance of overseas foreign targets who are not entitled to the Fourth Amendment protections guaranteed by our Constitution . "
The Facts :
Wrong again .
In an interview last year with PBS ’s “ Frontline , ” James Baker , head of the Justice Department 's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review , said the following on the ability of FISA applications to move quickly : Frontline : “ So you 're saying FISA can move very rapidly . ”
Baker : “ Very rapidly .
Extremely rapidly .
I just want to explain that the reason we do it that way is because we 're under a 72 - hour clock , and we do n't want to start the clock running sooner than we need to .
It is challenging to finish these applications within 72 hours , so we do n't want to start the clock one minute sooner than we need to .
It 's just a very practical decision .
...
“ The point is , there 's been no loss of foreign intelligence information .
That 's the key thing .
...
The American people have not been put at any risk because of this process going on .
The collection was not ready until it was ready , and once it was ready , we went and got the attorney general 's approval .
I 'm not saying that we can always do it in one minute , but we can do it pretty quick , and we know how to do it , and we 've done it many , many times . ”
The Administration claims that :
… “ we have lost intelligence information this past week as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Congress ' failure to act . "
The Intelligence Community and Department of Justice have worked over the past week with our private partners – whose assistance is essential to our intelligence collection efforts – to mitigate this problem caused by Congress ' failure to act , but we have nonetheless missed intelligence information that we could have been collecting to protect the country .
The Facts :
The day after writing the letter to Congress cited above , Mukasey and McConnell backtracked and admitted that telecom cooperation with surveillance under existing orders is continuing .
The fact that there is no FISA backlog , as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said , is not challenged by the administration .
Security experts Rand Beers , Richard Clarke , Don Kerrick , and Suzanne Spaulding wrote a letter to Mukasey and McConnell chastising them for their misleading statements about a loss of intelligence : “ For new targets that are somehow not covered by the existing authorizations , the FISA court can issue an order , which the telecom companies are legally obliged to follow .
Telecommunications companies will continue to cooperate with lawful government requests , particularly since FISA orders legally compel cooperation with the government . ”
Any delays or loss of intelligence rests squarely on the shoulders of the president who refused to sign another extension of the Protect America Act .
The administration ca n’t have it both ways .
It can not flatly refuse to extend a law and then blame Congress for the consequences .
The Administration claims that :
… " [e ] ven prior to the expiration of the Protect America Act , we experienced significant difficulties in working with the private sector because of the continued failure to provide liability protection for such companies . "
According to a statement from the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence : " [ A ] lthough our private partners are cooperating for the time being , they have expressed understandable misgivings about doing so in light of the on - going uncertainty and have indicated that they may well discontinue cooperation if the uncertainty persists …
Even with the cooperation of these private partners under existing directives , our ability to gather information concerning the intentions and planning of terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets will continue to degrade because we have lost tools provided by the Protect America
Act that enable us to adjust to changing circumstances . "
The Facts :
If the government is having trouble compelling its “ private partners ” to help in its intelligence gathering , it is most likely because the government is asking them to do something that is not authorized under the law .
These companies would have no choice but to comply with a legal directive .
Any lack of cooperation or “ loss of tools ” the administration is bemoaning is its own fault .
The fact is plain and simple : a warrant compels cooperation and provides immunity .
If the government ca n’t come up with the probable cause it needs to satisfy the FISA court , then these “ private partners ” are probably correct to not go ahead with the administration ’s wink and nod yet again .

A two - year - old girl was branded a thief by Woolworths staff after she helped herself to a pic ' n ' mix sweet during a shopping trip
Isra Khan was with her mother Aishah , 23 , when she grabbed the 20 p false tooth - shaped sweet from a shelf and popped it into her mouth .
But within moments a member of staff at the store in Blackburn , Lancashire had stormed over to Mrs Khan and , in front of stunned customers , said : ' That 's theft . '
An incredulous Mrs Khan was then forced to listen to a stern lecture about the health and safety rules of buying confectionary and pay for the sweet .

Sweet tooth : Isra Khan was accused of theft during a shopping trip to Woolworths with her mother to buy a colouring book
Mrs Khan , a college student from Blackburn , said : ' I can't believe the way this staff member behaved .
' Anyone would have thought we had stolen the crown jewels but the fact is my daughter was simply doing what a lot of other kids often do .
' I'm sure a lot of little children interfere with stock in a shop when they are running around - no matter how much we tell them not to touch things sometimes they are too young to understand .
' I hardly think the loss of a 20 p sweet is going to make much of difference to Woolworths ' business . '
The incident occurred when mrs Khan was in Woolworths in The Mall , Blackburn , with her three children to buy a colouring book .

Scene of the ' crime ' : The Woolworths store in The Mall , Blackburn .
Isra 's mother , Aishah , accused staff there of ' a total over - reaction '
She said : ' We were just walking passed the pick ' n ' mix section and Isra picked one up .
' At first I thought that it was in a wrapper and she could put it back .
But it was in her mouth and I was n't about to make her take it out .
' She 's only two .
She did n't know that what she was doing was wrong and that when you look at the sweets you can't just take one .
' Then a member of staff came over and said , " That 's theft " in front of all the other customers .
I could n't believe what I was hearing - I was humiliated .
' If this man had come over politely and asked me to pay for it , fine , but it was like Isra had stolen something really valuable .
' The fact is he was making a song and dance over a 20 p sweet .
Obviously I agreed to pay for it - but they went really over the top .
' I 've got three children aged three and under and you can't have your eyes on each of them every second .
' It must have happened lots of times before with the sweets all being open like that . '
Mrs Khan , who is doing a social science degree at Blackburn College , said she regularly shops in Woolworths to buy household items and children 's presents .
Scroll down for more ...
The ' evidence ' :
The 20 p fake teeth sweets that attracted Isra 's attention .
Mrs Khan is now demanding an apology from Woolworths
' When I take the children out , it 's a treat for me and I do n't expect this , ' she added .
' But I wo n't be going back until I get some kind of apology for Woolworths . '
A spokesman for the store said : ' Pic n' mix is sold in all Woolworths stores for 69 p per 100g .
' For health and safety reasons all confectionery and food products must be paid for before being consumed .
' The prevention of theft or loss of stock is a priority .
' Whilst we understand the temptations our pic ' n ' mix may hold with young children , the responsibility lies with the adult accompanying them to ensure they are appropriately supervised . '
Chris Allen , head of trading standards with Darwen Council , said : ' Ultimately , it is the parent 's responsibility to keep an eye on their child .
' But we all know that young children may not yet understand what they are doing is wrong , and we would hope anything like this could be dealt with reasonably .
' If someone feels that they have been badly treated , we would always encourage them to complain to the company . '
US chemists have published the shortest synthesis to date of oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , the anti-influenza drug which is also used to treat bird flu .
Barry Trost and Ting Zhang , at Stanford University , California , think their synthesis might provide an alternative route for making the drug commercially .
Oseltamivir , marketed by Swiss - based healthcare company Roche , is currently synthesised from shikimic acid - a compound found in the Chinese star anise flower .
Many synthetic chemists have published recipes to make the drug from other starting materials , in case supplies of shikimic acid ca n’t meet global demand .
Trost and Zhang used a commercially available starting lactone and took just eight reaction steps to get to the active ingredient ( - ) - oseltamivir .
The overall yield of the process was 30 per cent - better than any other syntheses so far , the researchers say .
But the process would have to be scaled up to produce much larger quantities for commercial production - a possibility that would take some time to investigate .
’ I believe our synthesis is a reasonable one to seriously evaluate for commercialisation , ’ Trost says .
’ We are not patenting the synthesis and I believe it should be scalable . ’
The cost of the starting lactone should be low , he adds , as butadiene and acrylic acid are its ultimate precursors .
’ I do hope that commercial places will look seriously into using it , but I have made no effort to contact any .
With the publication of our work , time will tell what happens next . ’
A Roche spokeswoman told Chemistry World that the majority ( two - thirds ) of their shikimic acid starting material was now made by bacterial fermentation - a process no cheaper than extracting the material from star anise , but more reliable .
Roche can make 400 million treatment courses of Tamiflu a year .
’ At present , supply of Tamiflu exceeds demand , so Roche has tailored production accordingly .
We have the capacity to ramp up production if needed , ’ she said .

Last month a US court ruled that border agents can search your laptop , or any other electronic device , when you 're entering the country .
They can take your computer and download its entire contents , or keep it for several days .
Customs and Border Patrol has not published any rules regarding this practice , and I and others have written a letter to Congress urging it to investigate and regulate this practice .
But the US is not alone .
British customs agents search laptops for pornography .
And there are reports on the internet of this sort of thing happening at other borders , too .
You might not like it , but it 's a fact .
So how do you protect yourself ?
Encrypting your entire hard drive , something you should certainly do for security in case your computer is lost or stolen , wo n't work here .
The border agent is likely to start this whole process with a " please type in your password " .
Of course you can refuse , but the agent can search you further , detain you longer , refuse you entry into the country and otherwise ruin your day .
You 're going to have to hide your data .
Set a portion of your hard drive to be encrypted with a different key - even if you also encrypt your entire hard drive - and keep your sensitive data there .
Lots of programs allow you to do this .
I use PGP Disk ( from pgp.com ) .
TrueCrypt ( truecrypt.org ) is also good , and free .
While customs agents might poke around on your laptop , they 're unlikely to find the encrypted partition .
( You can make the icon invisible , for some added protection . )
And if they download the contents of your hard drive to examine later , you wo n't care .
Be sure to choose a strong encryption password .
Details are too complicated for a quick tip , but basically anything easy to remember is easy to guess .
( My advice is at tinyurl.com/4f8z4n . )
Unfortunately , this is n't a perfect solution .
Your computer might have left a copy of the password on the disk somewhere , and ( as I also describe at the above link ) smart forensic software will find it .
So your best defence is to clean up your laptop .
A customs agent can't read what you do n't have .
You do n't need five years ' worth of email and client data .
You do n't need your old love letters and those photos ( you know the ones I 'm talking about ) .
Delete everything you do n't absolutely need .
And use a secure file erasure program to do it .
While you 're at it , delete your browser 's cookies , cache and browsing history .
It 's nobody 's business what websites you 've visited .
And turn your computer off - do n't just put it to sleep - before you go through customs ; that deletes other things .
Think of all this as the last thing to do before you stow your electronic devices for landing .
Some companies now give their employees forensically clean laptops for travel , and have them download any sensitive data over a virtual private network once they 've entered the country .
They send any work back the same way , and delete everything again before crossing the border to go home .
This is a good idea if you can do it .
If you can't , consider putting your sensitive data on a USB drive or even a camera memory card : even 16GB cards are reasonably priced these days .
Encrypt it , of course , because it 's easy to lose something that small .
Slip it in your pocket , and it's likely to remain unnoticed even if the customs agent pokes through your laptop .
If someone does discover it , you can try saying : " I do n't know what 's on there .
My boss told me to give it to the head of the New York office . "
If you 've chosen a strong encryption password , you wo n't care if he confiscates it .
Lastly , do n't forget your phone and PDA .
Customs agents can search those too : emails , your phone book , your calendar .
Unfortunately , there 's nothing you can do here except delete things .
I know this all sounds like work , and that it 's easier to just ignore everything here and hope you do n't get searched .
Today , the odds are in your favour .
But new forensic tools are making automatic searches easier and easier , and the recent US court ruling is likely to embolden other countries .
It 's better to be safe than sorry .

At least 1,500 people were defrauded Spanish police have arrested 87 Nigerians suspected of defrauding at least 1,500 people in a postal and internet lottery scam .
The arrests were made in and around Madrid in an operation co-ordinated with the FBI .
Police said millions of euros were taken from the victims , most of them in the United States and European Union .
Those targeted were wrongly told they had won a lottery and asked to send a payment before prize money could sent .
Thousands of letters and e-mails , most in ungrammatical English , were sent out to prospective victims every day , police said .
The faked documents asked them to make an initial payment of 900 euros ( $ 1,400 , £ 720 ) in taxes or administrative costs .
The scam is estimated to have netted around 20 million euros , but the actual sum could be many times that , say police .
Anglican bishop
Police said the number of those defrauded could run into many thousands , as most of them probably failed to report the crime out of embarrassment .
Police estimate that only one in 1,000 recipients of the letters needed to fall for the fraud for it to make a profit .
An Anglican bishop was among those duped , according to Spanish officials .
The operation to track down the gang began in May 2007 when a huge number of identical letters destined for addresses in the US was discovered at Madrid 's Barajas airport .
Police confiscated hundreds of computers , mobile phones and 60,000 letters in a raid on more than 30 homes and businesses .
Law enforcement officers also seized a suitcase full of fake $ 100 notes which they say was used to convince some victims who came to Spain in person to collect their " prize money " .

CalTech graduate student Virgil Griffith built a search tool that traces IP addresses of those who make Wikipedia changes .
Photo : Jake Appelbaum
On November 17th , 2005 , an anonymous Wikipedia user deleted 15 paragraphs from an article on e-voting machine - vendor Diebold , excising an entire section critical of the company 's machines .
While anonymous , such changes typically leave behind digital fingerprints offering hints about the contributor , such as the location of the computer used to make the edits .
In this case , the changes came from an IP address reserved for the corporate offices of Diebold itself .
And it is far from an isolated case .
A new data - mining service launched Monday traces millions of Wikipedia entries to their corporate sources , and for the first time puts comprehensive data behind longstanding suspicions of manipulation , which until now have surfaced only piecemeal in investigations of specific allegations .
Wikipedia Scanner – the brainchild of Cal Tech computation and neural - systems graduate student Virgil Griffith – offers users a searchable database that ties millions of anonymous Wikipedia edits to organizations where those edits apparently originated , by cross-referencing the edits with data on who owns the associated block of internet IP addresses .
Inspired by news last year that Congress members ' offices had been editing their own entries , Griffith says he got curious , and wanted to know whether big companies and other organizations were doing things in a similarly self - interested vein .
" Everything 's better if you do it on a huge scale , and automate it , " he says with a grin .
This database is possible thanks to a combination of Wikipedia policies and ( mostly ) publicly available information .
The online encyclopedia allows anyone to make edits , but keeps detailed logs of all these changes .
Users who are logged in are tracked only by their user name , but anonymous changes leave a public record of their IP address .
Share Your Sleuthing !
Cornered any companies polishing up their Wikipedia entries ?
Spotted any government spooks rewriting history ?
Try Virgil Griffith 's Wikipedia Scanner yourself , then submit your finds and vote on other readers ' discoveries here .
The organization also allows downloads of the complete Wikipedia , including records of all these changes .
Griffith thus downloaded the entire encyclopedia , isolating the XML - based records of anonymous changes and IP addresses .
He then correlated those IP addresses with public net - address lookup services such as ARIN , as well as private domain - name data provided by IP2Location.com .
The result : A database of 34.4 million edits , performed by 2.6 million organizations or individuals ranging from the CIA to Microsoft to Congressional offices , now linked to the edits they or someone at their organization 's net address has made .
Some of this appears to be transparently self - interested , either adding positive , press release - like material to entries , or deleting whole swaths of critical material .
Voting - machine company Diebold provides a good example of the latter , with someone at the company 's IP address apparently deleting long paragraphs detailing the security industry 's concerns over the integrity of their voting machines , and information about the company 's CEO 's fund - raising for President Bush .
The text , deleted in November 2005 , was quickly restored by another Wikipedia contributor , who advised the anonymous editor , " Please stop removing content from Wikipedia .
It is considered vandalism . "
A Diebold Election Systems spokesman said he'd look into the matter but could not comment by press time .
Wal - Mart has a series of relatively small changes in 2005 that that burnish the company 's image on its own entry while often leaving criticism in , changing a line that its wages are less than other retail stores to a note that it pays nearly double the minimum wage , for example .
Another leaves activist criticism on community impact intact , while citing a " definitive " study showing Wal - Mart raised the total number of jobs in a community .
As has been previously reported , politician 's offices are heavy users of the system .
Former Montana Sen. Conrad Burns ' office , for example , apparently changed one critical paragraph headed " A controversial voice " to " A voice for farmers , " with predictably image - friendly content following it .
Perhaps interestingly , many of the most apparently self - interested changes come from before 2006 , when news of the Congressional offices ' edits reached the headlines .
This may indicate a growing sophistication with the workings of Wikipedia over time , or even the rise of corporate Wikipedia policies .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told Wired News he was aware of the new service , but needed time to experiment with it before commenting .
The vast majority of changes are fairly innocuous , however .
Employees at the CIA 's net address , for example , have been busy – but with little that would indicate their place of apparent employment , or a particular bias .
One entry on " Black September in Jordan " contains wholesale additions , with specific details that read like a popular history book or an eyewitness ' memoir .
Many more are simple copy edits , or additions to local town entries or school histories .
One CIA entry deals with the details of lyrics sung in a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode .
Griffith says he launched the project hoping to find scandals , particularly at obvious targets such as companies like Halliburton .
But there 's a more practical goal , too :
By exposing the anonymous edits that companies such as drugs and big pharmaceutical companies make in entries that affect their businesses , it could help experts check up on the changes and make sure they 're accurate , he says .
For now , he has just scratched the surface of the database of millions of entries .
But he 's putting it online so others can look too .
The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation , which runs Wikipedia , did not respond to e-mail and telephone inquiries Monday .

21 Ruby Tricks You Should Be Using In Your Own Code
By Peter Cooper
Writing for Ruby Inside , I get to see a lot of Ruby code .
Most is good , but sometimes we forget some of Ruby 's shortcuts and tricks and reinvent the wheel instead .
In this post I present 21 different Ruby " tricks , " from those that most experienced developers use every day to the more obscure .
Whatever your level , a refresh may help you the next time you encounter certain coding scenarios .
Note to beginners :
If you 're still learning Ruby , check out my Beginning Ruby book .
2009 Update :
This post was written in early 2008 and looking back on it , there are a couple of tricks that I would n't recommend anymore - or to which extra warnings need to be added .
I 've added paragraphs like this where necessary .
Enjoy ! :-)
1 - Extract regular expression matches quickly
A typical way to extract data from text using a regular expression is to use the match method .
There is a shortcut , however , that can take the pain out of the process :
email = " Fred Bloggs < fred@bloggs.com > " email . match (/ <(.*? )> /) [ 1 ] email [/ <(.*? ) > /, 1 ] email . match (/ ( x ) / ) [ 1 ] email [/ ( x ) / , 1 ] email [ / ( [ bcd ] ) .*? ( [ fgh ] ) /, 2 ]
Ultimately , using the String # [ ] approach is cleaner though it might seem more " magic " to you .
It 's also possible to use it without including an extra argument if you just want to match the entire regular expression .
For example :
x = ' this is a test ' x [ / [ aeiou ] .+?[ aeiou ] / ] # => ' is i'
In this example , we match the first example of " a vowel , some other characters , then another vowel . "
2 - Shortcut for Array#join
It 's common knowledge that Array #* , when supplied with a number , multiplies the size of the array by using duplicate elements :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ] * 3 == [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 ]
It 's not well known , however , that when given a string as an argument Array # * does a join !
%w{ this is a test } * " , " h = { : name => " Fred " , :age => 77 } h . map { | i | i * " = " } * " n "
3 - Format decimal amounts quickly
Formatting floating point numbers into a form used for prices can be done with sprintf or , alternatively , with a formatting interpolation :
money = 9.5 " %.2 f " % money
4 - Interpolate text quickly
The formatting interpolation technique from # 3 comes out again , this time to insert a string inside another :
" [ %s ] " % " same old drag "
You can use an array of elements to substitute in too :
x = %w{ p hello p } " < %s >%s</%s > " % x
5 - Delete trees of files
Do n't resort to using the shell to delete directories .
Ruby comes with a handy file utilities library called FileUtils that can do the hard work :
require ' fileutils ' FileUtils . rm_r ' somedir '
Be careful how you use this one !
There 's a FileUtils.rm_rf too..
6 - Exploding enumerables
* can be used to " explode " enumerables ( arrays and hashes ) .
" Exploding " is sort of an implicit on - the - fly conversion from an array to regular method arguments .
We 'll let the examples do the talking :
a = %w{ a b } b = % w{ c d } [ a + b ] [* a + b ]
a = { : name => " Fred " , :age => 93 } [ a ] [* a ]
a = %w{ a b c d e f g h } b = [ 0 , 5 , 6 ] a .
values_at (* b ) . inspect
7 - Cut down on local variable definitions
Instead of defining a local variable with some initial content ( often just an empty hash or array ) , you can instead define it " on the go " so you can perform operations on it at the same time :
( z ||= [ ] ) << ' test '
2009 Update :
This is pretty rancid , to be honest .
I 've changed my mind ; you should n't be doing this :)
8 - Using non-strings or symbols as hash keys
It 's rare you see anyone use non-strings or symbols as hash keys .
It 's totally possible though , and sometimes handy ( and , no , this is n't necessarily a great example ! ) :
does = is = { true => '
Yes ' , false => '
No ' } does [ 10 == 50 ] is [ 10 > 5 ]
9 - Use ' and ' and ' or ' to group operations for single liners
This is a trick that more confident Ruby developers use to tighten up their code and remove short multi-line if and unless statements :
queue = [ ]
% w{ hello x world }. each do | word | queue << word and puts " Added to queue " unless word .
length < 2 end puts queue .
inspect
2009 Update :
Be careful here - this one can sting you in the butt if your first expression returns nil even when it works .
A key example of this is with the puts method which returns nil even after printing the supplied arguments .
10 - Do something only if the code is being implicitly run , not required
This is a very common pattern amongst experienced Ruby developers .
If you 're writing a Ruby script that could be used either as a library OR directly from the command line , you can use this trick to determine whether you 're running the script directly or not :
if __FILE__ == $ 0 end
11 - Quick mass assignments
Mass assignment is something most Ruby developers learn early on , but it 's amazing how little it 's used relative to its terseness :
a , b , c , d = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
It can come in particularly useful for slurping method arguments that have been bundled into an array with *:
def my_method (* args ) a , b , c , d = args end
If you want to get really smart ( although this is more ' clever ' than truly wise ) :
def initialize ( args ) args .
keys .
each { | name | instance_variable_set " @ " + name .
to_s , args [ name ] } end
12 - Use ranges instead of complex comparisons for numbers
No more if x > 1000 && x < 2000 nonsense .
Instead :
year = 1972 puts case year when 1970 ..
1979 : " Seventies " when 1980 .. 1989 : " Eighties " when 1990 .. 1999 : " Nineties " end
13 - Use enumerations to cut down repetitive code
Rubyists are often keen to remove repetition - often espousing " DRY " ( Do n't Repeat Yourself ) .
You can take this to extremes using Ruby 's enumerators to perform similar operations multiple times .
Consider requiring multiple files , for instance :
%w{ rubygems daemons eventmachine }. each { | x | require x }
14 - The Ternary Operator
Another trick that 's usually learned early on by Ruby developers but rarely in less experienced developers ' code is the " ternary operator . "
The ternary operator is not a fix - all , but it can sometimes make things tighter , particularly in view templates .
puts x == 10 ? " x is ten " : " x is not ten " LOG .
sev_threshold = ENVIRONMENT == : development ?
Logger :: DEBUG : Logger :: INFO
15 - Nested Ternary Operators
It can be asking for trouble but ternary operators can be nested within each other ( after all , they only return objects , like everything else ) :
qty = 1 qty == 0 ? ' none ' : qty == 1 ? ' one ' : ' many ' ( qty == 0 ? ' none ' : ( qty == 1 ? ' one ' : ' many ' ) )
16 - Fight redundancy with Ruby's " logic " features
I commonly see methods using this sort of pattern :
def is_odd ( x ) if x % 2 == 0 return false else return true end end
Perhaps we can use a ternary operator to improve things ?
def is_odd ( x ) x % 2 == 0 ? false : true end
It 's shorter , and I 've seen that pattern a lot ( sadly ) but you should go one step further and rely on the true / false responses Ruby 's comparison operators already give !
def is_odd ( x ) x % 2 != 0 end
Sometimes , though , you want to explicitly convert implicit true / false scenarios into explicit true / false results :
class String def contains_digits ? self [/\d/ ] ?
true : false end end
If we had n't done this , you 'd get back either nil or the first matched digit rather than true or false .
17 - See the whole of an exception 's backtrace
def do_division_by_zero ; 5 / 0 ; end begin do_division_by_zero rescue => exception puts exception .
backtrace end
18 - Allow both single items AND arrays to be enumerated against
[* items ]. each do | item | end
19 - Rescue blocks do n't need to be tied to a ' begin '
def x begin rescue end end
def x rescue end
20 - Block comments
I tend to see this in more ' old - school ' Ruby code .
It 's surprisingly under -used though , but looks a lot better than a giant row of pound signs in many cases :
puts " x " puts " z "
2009 Update : Curiously , I 've not seen any significant uptake of block comments in Ruby but ..
I do n't use them myself either anymore .
I suspect with column editing and keyboard shortcuts in common text editors , the motivation here has lessened .
21 - Rescue to the rescue
You can use rescue in its single line form to return a value when other things on the line go awry :
h = { :age => 10 } h [ : name ]. downcase h [ : name ]. downcase rescue " No name "

Intriguingly , the first post was another Ruby trick that I forgot to include above , so check that out too .
It was no ordinary life for a young girl : living among scholars in the hallowed halls of Jordan College and tearing unsupervised through Oxford 's motley streets on mad quests for adventure .
But Lyra 's greatest adventure would begin closer to home , the day she heard hushed talk of an extraordinary particle .
Microscopic in size , the magical dust -- discovered in the vast Arctic expanse of the North - - was rumored to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes .
But there were those who feared the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it .
Catapulted into the heart of a terrible struggle , Lyra was forced to seek aid from clans , ' gyptians , and formidable armored bears .
And as she journeyed into unbelievable danger , she had not the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win , or to lose , this more - than - mortal battle ...

WSJ
-- Study after study shows that most of today ’s multi-millionaires made their wealth themselves , as opposed to inheriting it from their parents .
PNC Wealth Management recently polled 1,500 Americans with $ 500,000 or more in investible assets and found that 69 % of respondents made most of their fortune through work , business ownership or investments .
Only 6 % made their wealth by inheriting it , while 25 % made it through a combination of inheritence and earnings ( see chart above ) .
Other examples ( also from WSJ ) :
1. According to a study of Federal Reserve data conducted by NYU professor Edward Wolff , for the nation ’s richest 1 % , inherited wealth accounted for only 9 % of their net worth in 2001 , down from 23 % in 1989 .
( The 2001 number was the latest available . )
2. According to a study by Prince & Associates , less than 10 % of today ’s multi-millionaires cited “ inheritance ” as their source of wealth .
3 . A study by Spectrem Group found that among today ’s millionaires , inherited wealth accounted for just 2 % of their total sources of wealth .
Each of these stats measures slightly different things , yet they all come to the same basic conclusion : Inheritance is not the main driver of today ’s wealth .
The reason we ’ve had a doubling in the number of millionaires and billionaires over the past decade ( even adjusted for inflation ) is that more of the non-wealthy have become wealthy .
So it ’s not just that the same old rich folks are getting richer .
The more - important shift is that the rich are getting more numerous .

Yet another dull cubicle of a hotel room is n’t really turning your crank , huh ?
Not providing the creative inspiration you want to go forth and experience the world ?
Maybe you need to take a look at some of the more unusual places to stay around the world .

Read our disclosure .
Here is a sordid collection of places you can visit around the world with a variety of price ranges .
These joints will surely take your travel stories and adventures to new levels .
United States
Located in the Ozarks ( Arkansas ) , you can spend the night in this is natural living cave .
( I saw other cave accommodations in my search for the bizarre and exciting , but this one seems to be the real deal as opposed to being blasted out ) .
The pictures look spectacular , and you are surely staying in the lap of luxury here .
Or at least the lap of a big dark hole .
Average cost : $ 1,000
I ’m not sure what else there is to see in Cottonwood Idaho , but this place surely is tops on the list .
The owners ( dog lovers — can you tell ? ) built the world ’s largest beagle to be the bed & breakfast joint for you to write home about .
It ’s a friendly looking dog and all , but I ca n’t help but be reminded of the Trojan Horse .
At the very least , it brings new meaning to “ sleeping in the dog house ”  .
Average cost : $ 100
Located in the scuba diving Mecca of Key Largo , Florida , this hotel caters to a niche market : scuba divers .
Exclusively .
You have to scuba dive to the front door of this hotel , 21 feet under the sea .
It is the original undersea lodge , as others have cropped up here and there since this innovative place was built .
Built – or sunk , depending on how you look at it .
They offer underwater wedding packages , and “ limited room service ”  ( duh — they have to scuba dive it in ! ) .
But the real hook for me : “ unlimited diving ”  ; I should hope so !
Average cost : $ 350 +
Canada
Just in case anybody living in warmer climes was wondering , Canadians do n’t live in igloos !
But here at the Ice Hotel in Quebec , Canada , they do .
It is absolutely amazing what you can do with walls and furniture when you are n’t relegated to boring materials like drywall and plaster .
The construction of the Ice Hotel changes each year , and is truly art .
Everything — absolutely everything — is made of ice .
They say it ’s surprisingly warm inside , but I ca n’t help but think that sleeping on a giant block of ice is n’t exactly toasty .
It ’s only open from January through March ( when it starts to melt ) , so space fills up quickly .
Average cost : $ 300 - 475 , but you can find promotions for as little as $ 150
Japan
We all know the Japanese are years ahead of North America in terms of wackiness , and they ’re a little short on space too .
Couple these two facts , and you have the Asakusa Capsule Hotel .
It looks more like a submarine than anything else ; absolutely miniscule capsules stacked on top of one another for rooms .
They cater to budget travelers ( you are n’t exactly paying for a lot of space ) , and on the site they say “ single travelers welcome ”  .
That ’s good , because I do n’t think you could fit a party of two in there , no matter how well they know each other .
Rooms come complimentary with a panic button .
Ahh — home sweet home .
Average cost : $ 30
Sweden
In English , this means Otter Inn , which is an apt description for this floating underwater hotel in Stockholm , Sweden .
Show up , and they ’ll paddle you 1 km out to the middle of a lake where a small out - house looking contraption floats on the water .
Then they drop you off and you ’re left to enjoy your own private island .
Your living space is n’t limited to the outhouse and surrounding deck however — the bedroom is actually below , 10 feet under the water .
They too have “ limited room service ”  — go figure .
But at least you get to sleep in your own little aquarium ; except this time you ’re in the aquarium and the fish are on the outside .
Gives you a whole new level of respect for your goldfish .
Average Cost : $ 250-350
Amsterdam
Located in Harlingen , Amsterdam , this is just what it sounds : an operational harbour crane .
It is located right on the quay , and inside is a luxury room for two .
Its height varies with the sea levels , but can range from 17 - 49 metres high .
And why on earth would you like to sleep in a crane ?
Well , the view is surprisingly spectacular .
But the real reason : you get to jump in the cockpit and play with the fully operational crane !
This is truly a toy for boys .
The same company also offers a converted lifeboat and lighthouse as alternate accommodations .
They are generally booked up to five months in advance , so if flirting with the construction industry and playing with big toys is up your alley , book early .
Average Cost : $ 500
France
Like so many weird and wacky hotels , the Hotel Everland is installation art at its best .
It is actually a mobile hotel , but do n’t get any pictures of trailer parks in your mind here : it uses its mobility to set up in some of the most amazing places .
Currently it is in Paris , France , and you have to see the site to believe where it actually sits and what your view looks like .
Check in and check out times are pretty stringent though ( no sleeping in and lounging about in your jammies for the morning ) — it is actually a museum by day .
Average Cost : unknown , but I suspect if you have to ask you may be barking up the wrong tree
Austria
Here ’s another one for the budget - minded : you get to sleep in a giant concrete sewage pipe .
Yup , you read it right .
Initially I wondered why anybody would sleep in such an atrocity , and after researching the piece I still feel that way .
The only saving grace I could see is its location : on the Danube , near Linz .
The sewage pipe - rooms are located on a campground , and the facilities are basic at best .
Washrooms are a short walk away .
What I ca n’t get over is , if you want to stay on a campground , why not just bring a tent ?!
Average Cost : ( this is the clincher for a budget traveler and possibly makes the whole idea okay ) : Pay as you wish system
New Zealand
If you are a Lord of the Rings fan , you may be rushing to Otorohanga , New Zealand to stay here .
The world ’s first ( first ?
There are more ? )
Hobbit Motel is located in Woodlyn Park , and is an exact replica of the hobbit homes you saw in the movies .
The inside is considerably more contemporary ( which actually detracts from the idea in of staying in hobbit accommodations in my mind ) , but at least it ’s comfortable and you do n’t have to crouch everywhere you go .
At Woodlyn Park , you can also stay in a plane , a ship , or a train if hobbits are n’t your thing .
Average Cost : $ 135
Panama
This spectacular hotel is in Panama City , Panama and if you are a nature and bird - watching enthusiast this should send you into fits of ecstasy .
Your accommodations take the form of an old radar tower and afford 360 degree views high over top of the rainforest .
Your room is made up of a 30ft high dome , with an upper level bedroom full of windows , and a lower level living space perfect for observing birds high in the forest canopy .
They do warn you to bring earplugs if you do n’t wish the birds to be your alarm clock at first light .
Average Cost : $ 105-220
This is by no means a complete cross-section of the wonderful and bizarre places you can stay around the world .
If none of these speak to you but you think there may be something wacky enough to get you to pack your bags , here are a few places to start looking :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of individuals filing for bankruptcy surged during the first - quarter as American households struggled to stay on top of debt , according to a report released Wednesday .
The American Bankruptcy Institute said that consumer bankruptcy filings increased 27 % nationwide in the first three months of the year , compared with the same period last year .
In March alone , 86,165 individuals filed for consumer bankruptcy - a 13 % increase over the 76,120 cases filed in February .
" Bankruptcies are rising due to the heavy burden of household debt and growing mortgage problems , " said ABI Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano .
" We expect this trend to continue through 2008 . "
The ABI found that nearly 32 % of all consumer bankruptcy cases were Chapter 13 filings , which is available to individuals with regular income and calls for budgeting some of the debtor 's future earnings to pay off creditors .
The Weapons System Program Office at Hill is at fault .
The documents spelling out the contents of the materials to be burned , according to a Hill press release , " were not readily accessible . "
So , instead of taking the time to track down the paperwork , officials callously threw it on the fire , and Utahns be damned .

Like many institutions and individuals , Shell , the oil giant , is trying to divine what lies ahead in a world with limited energy options , a fast - growing energy appetite , and a climate system almost assuredly disrupted should carbon dioxide emissions from today ’s fuels of choice continue their seemingly inexorable rise .
Earlier this month , the company ’s forecasters produced two energy scenarios for the next two generations , which they call “ the world of scramble ” and the “ world of blueprints . ”
Scenarios can be a useful thought experiment .
In 2002 , I wrote about a report , “ Great Transition , ” that envisaged more possible futures , ranging from Eco Communalism to Fortress World . ”
Exercises aside , the real future will likely be a messy mix similar to the present — just more so .
There ’ll be instability , poverty , overpopulation , and pollution in some places ( they tend to go hand in hand , as in Haiti ) and wealth , order , and efficiency in others ( think Stockholm or Portland ) .
But it does n’t hurt to aspire , and to try to test which institutions , technologies , habits and norms ( personal , communal , global ) can be nudged in a direction most people would define as progress .
Again , that is the goal of Dot Earth ( slide show ) , both this blog and a set of stories I plan to write in coming months .
So let ’s see what Shell ’s energy futures look like .
Here are excerpts from a transcript of a video the company created to illustrate these two possible paths ( links added by me ) .
SCRAMBLE WORLD .
In the Scramble world , events outpace actions .
Security of energy supply and fears of losing economic ground shape decision - making .
For the next 10 years , people from all walks of life join in the debate about energy and climate change .
But no one seems truly wedded to action on a large scale .
Governments generally choose solutions that are politically straightforward , and local .
They prefer to rely on indigenous energy sources .
So coal makes a big comeback in some regions , despite its higher emissions .
Drivers stay with liquid fuels .
With oil becoming harder to find and produce , biofuel use grows rapidly .
Energy efficiency improves only gradually .
Trading in emissions credits remains patchy and ineffective .
Without a meaningful price , business lacks direction for technology investments to improve emissions management .
In the Scramble world , no one is prepared to change the status quo .
Dealing with today ’s problem takes priority .
By the 2020s , life has become volatile and uncertain .
Energy availability is often tight .
Severe weather events are blamed on a lack of previous action on climate change .
The public cries out .
And governments in the different regions respond in different ways – but without consistency or cohesion .
Eventually a new , more positive phase emerges .
Enforced steps to reduce energy demand gradually have an effect .
… Individual , local efforts to promote renewable energy sources start to pay off .
Renewables become well enough established , and on a large enough scale , to be competitive .
Greenhouse gas emissions eventually begin to fall in the Scramble world .
But the earlier periods of economic volatility , and the legacy of high emissions , continue to have an impact .
Because events outpaced actions , major work will still be needed after 2050 to achieve real sustainability .
WORLD OF BLUEPRINTS .
The world of Blueprints shows what can happen when actions outpace events .
Groups of seemingly disconnected people in California –- venture capitalists , farmers , politicians –- collaborate around opportunities for profitable action on climate change .
Publics put international pressure on governments for change .
Smart investments in modern facilities improve air pollution , energy efficiency , and greenhouse gas emissions all at the same time .
This is n’t a sudden outbreak of altruism .
It ’s a recognition of shared interests , new opportunities for profitable business , and the benefits of taking action before it ’s forced by circumstances .
In the world of Blueprints , local actions spread and join up –- like the C40 megacities pact of mayors and others , experimenting and sharing good practices around carbon emissions , transport and energy efficiency .
During the next decade , the Blueprints world is diverse .
Different parts use different approaches to promote energy efficiency , and technology development .
Some choose taxes .
Others use mandates .
Some look for voluntary action by businesses and consumers .
The most successful approaches spread .
However , the diversity makes life difficult for investment .
Pressure is created on local , national and international authorities to harmonize arrangements better .
With harmonization comes widespread adoption of good efficiency practices .
Trading schemes for carbon dioxide emissions rights begin to cover a critical mass of industry sectors in a critical mass of countries .
The ball is rolling .
Meaningful carbon dioxide pricing gives people and organizations more incentive to improve their energy efficiency and invest in technologies , paving the way to carbon capture and storage after 2020 .
Meanwhile , transport is becoming “ greener ” through growth in hybrids and later full - electric vehicles .
Biofuels play a role alongside traditional oil products .
By the 2040s , the Blueprints world sees renewable energy technologies compete on price against fossil fuels , which are well managed with carbon capture and storage .
So carbon emissions are well advanced on a downward path by mid century .
It ’s been a bumpy journey for some .
But collaboration , successful carbon policies , and faster technology deployment have all contributed to a more sustainable world than Scramble .
… At Shell , both scenarios help us in making our choices and preparing to face uncertainty .
Traditionally ,
Shell uses its scenarios without expressing a preference for one over another .
However , in a break with tradition , in our view , from the two scenarios , the Blueprints outcomes offer the best hope for a sustainable future , whether or not they arise exactly in the way we describe .
We are convinced they are possible with the right combination of policy , technology and commitment from governments , industry and society globally .
But achieving them will not be easy and time is short .
Is there any merit to trying to create blueprints ?
Managed development strikes many as a “ new world order ” that stifles human freedom .
But on a finite planet with a shared atmosphere and oceans , does n’t traditional free enterprise , by its nature , guarantee harm to the commons ?
Gus Speth , the dean of Yale ’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies , has a new book out ( on my reading table but only nibbled at so far ) , arguing that traditional capitalism is at fundamental odds with sustainable development .
In Common Wealth , Jeff Sachs , the economist who heads Columbia ’s Earth Institute , addresses related themes in outlining ways to avoid something looking like the “ fortress world ” I mentioned above .
But Indur Goklany ’s book ,
The Improving State of the World , says trajectories are already pointed in the direction of ever more prosperity , so , in essence , why mess with a good thing ?
[ UPDATE 4/19 : Indur wrote to say this is an oversimplified distillation .
I have added his full note in the comment string below .
I ’ll be doing a sit - down interview with him later this spring . ]
What ’s your desired scenario for the next few decades for the planet , your town , your life ?
What ’s the scenario you feel is most likely ?
During our days as photo lovers we frequently find that people want to know what filters we carry when we create images in the field .
The information listed below provides a starting place for filters you might consider when your photography takes you outdoors .
Polarizing Filter : A polarizing filter has been considered a sky - darkening filter for many years ; photographers also know that it can be used to remove reflections from shiny surfaces .
For outdoor photographers , shiny surfaces include bodies of water and shiny foliage .
Youve probably heard that polarizing filters are used at a 90 - degree angle to the sun , if you wish to use them at their maximum effect .
To find this angle , stand with your back to the sun and extend your arms straight out from your shoulders .
The direction to which each arm is pointing will provide maximum polarization .
Naturally , you will receive some benefit from the polarizing filter if the angle between your camera and the sun is less than 90 degrees .
How much benefit youll receive depends on this angle .
The easiest way to see the effect of this filter is to face toward the direction you wish to photograph and hold the filter up to your eye .
View the scene while turning the filter , and you will see the effect it will have on your photograph .
We use the Cokin P - size filter system because we can leave the Cokin filter holder on the camera lens while viewing the scene .
Additionally , using this system means we only have to purchase one set of filters , which keeps our expenses down and our camera bag lighter .
Warming Filters :
The 81 - series filters are warming filters .
These filters add warmth to a scene in small increments .
The series includes 81 , 81A , 81B , 81C , 81D , and 81 EF .
The 81 filter provides the least warmth ; the 81 EF filter provides the most warmth .
( The 81 filter adds very little to a scene , so we dont recommend using it . )
This series of filters is designed to counteract the blue / cyan colors frequently seen in the sky , by adding the opposite color to your image .
Because the sky contains both blue and cyan ( blue - green ) , these filters are a combination of red and yellow dyes .
Unfortunately , the combination of blue and cyan varies with the time of day , season of the year , location and altitude .
This variation in color creates a problem for filter manufacturers : they cannot make a set of filters to meet a definite condition because the conditions are always changing .
As a result of these inconsistencies , each filter manufacturer has created an 81 - series of filters that is consistent within their brand but usually cannot be substituted into another manufacturers filter series .
What this means for you is simple : buy one manufacturers brand , and stay with it .
Buy the largest size you need and use step - up rings to adapt the filters to your smaller lenses , or buy a set of filters from a manufacturer such as Cokin that can be used with a filter holder on every lens you own .
We have screw - on glass filters for our lenses .
We prefer B+W , Tiffin , or Hoya ; the filters made by Canon and Nikon are great , too , if you can find the ones you need .
We dont carry the whole set of warming filters .
We put an 81A filter on each lens we own and carry an 81B in the largest size well need , along with step - up rings to adapt the filter to our smaller lenses .
We use this filter frequently because we find ourselves photographing early in the day and / or in shadows , which means a blue cast is present on our scene .
The 81A filter helps to remove this blue color cast .
Combining an 81A and 81B will give you the same warming properties as an 81C without carrying an additional filter .
Carrying the 81D and / or 81 EF probably isnt necessary , unless you find yourself creating images frequently in overcast or shaded light .
Having said that the reflected sky light is variable , we might need or want another warming filter besides the 81A .
Also , we might wish to emphasize the cool blue light of the early morning .
We can remove the 81A filter to allow more blue light to record on our film , or we might add a warmer filter , such as an 81B or 81C .
The decision to allow more blue light to be recorded on our film brings up another topic that well save for another month : film choice .
By now youve probably heard that each color transparency film has its own color palate .
Some films emphasize the warmer ( red , orange , yellow ) part of the visible spectrum ; other films emphasize the cooler ( blue , green , violet ) part of the spectrum .
Thus , using the warming filters becomes a creative endeavor that includes consideration of the film well be using and the final color rendition we wish to include in our image .
Split Neutral Density Filters :
Our last set of filters includes a one - stop split neutral - density filter and a two - stop neutral - density filter .
These filters must be rectangular filters that fit into a filter holder for rectangular filters , such as the Cokin P - style filter holder .
Round split neutral - density filters that screw onto the camera lens are worthless .

Late one April night , the first of Sarah Valenzuela ’s twins arrived with little trouble , but the second stayed put .
Though the baby was not in distress , Kaiser Permanente perinatologist Hamid Safari attached a vacuum extractor to the boy ’s head to draw him out .
Again and again he tugged , but still the baby would not come .
He vigorously shook the vacuum , up and down , side to side , according to government documents and hospital incident reports .
It took 90 minutes and six tries -- the last with Safari on his knees , pulling .
Horrified staffers -- and the boy ’s father -- looked on as baby Devin finally emerged .
His skin was a bloodless white , his neck elongated and floppy .

His spinal cord had been severed .
Safari lashed out at a nurse .
“ What did you do to that baby ?
I gave you a good baby , ” he said , according to a complaint letter the nurse sent to her union representative .
Staffers at the Fresno birthing center were devastated and angry -- and not just because of the twin lost that night in 2005 .
Over the years , doctors and nurses repeatedly had complained to higher - ups -- including Kaiser ’s top medical officer in Northern and Central California -- about problems they saw in Safari ’s skills and behavior , according to interviews and documents .

This is a story not just of tragic medical outcomes , but of a health plan that did not prevent them .
A year before Devin ’s death , the doctor had waited more than three hours to do a Caesarean section even though the baby girl was in distress and her family said they had been pleading for the procedure , according to interviews and government records .
She was severely deprived of oxygen and died months later .
As far back as 2002 , a physician review committee at the hospital concluded that Safari provided “ inappropriate ” care and that his “ conduct needed significant improvement , ” according to a lawsuit later filed by two of his peers .
Still , the doctor continues to work at Kaiser Fresno , practicing under restrictions that staffers say have not been explained to patients .

Regulators acted only recently .
This July , the state Department of Managed Health Care fined Kaiser a record $ 3 million for its haphazard handling of complaints and physician errors throughout the state .
Officials said in an interview that the Safari matter played a significant role in their decision to investigate the HMO ’s practices .
Late last month , the state medical board accused Safari of gross negligence , seeking to revoke or suspend his license .
The board also has faulted Kaiser , the nation ’s largest HMO with 6.5 million members in California .
The health plan made the board ’s investigation of Safari “ protracted and difficult ” by providing incomplete medical records , a spokeswoman said .
Kaiser did not allow senior officials to be interviewed for this story -- and warned staffers at Kaiser Fresno not to talk , several said .
In a statement , hospital administrator Susan Ryan said the HMO has cooperated with the medical board and is “ committed to ensuring the safety of our patients . ”

In July 2005 -- three months after Devin ’s death -- Kaiser imposed its restrictions on Safari , barring him from performing vaginal deliveries and requiring him to be monitored by another physician or an advanced - practice nurse , Ryan said .
The restrictions became permanent in April 2007 .
Kaiser and other hospitals typically do not notify patients of such actions , officials said .
Safari , 49 , declined to comment .
His lawyer , Stephen D. Schear , said the accusations are “ completely unwarranted ” and that Safari intends to challenge the medical board ’s action in a hearing .
Safari , he said , has the support of many at the hospital and in his department .
“ If you ’re doing thousands of high - risk deliveries over the years , it ’s almost inevitable that there ’s going to be some unfortunate cases where children die , where things do n’t go right , ” Schear said .
“ You ’re talking about one minute maybe where he pulled too hard to try to extract this baby .
. . .
Just look at his whole record , 10 years . ”

But doctors and other staffers allege that Devin ’s death was the culmination of Safari ’s troubles , not a fluke .
“ We do not feel that our perinatologist is competent , ” reads an August 2005 petition signed by eight of Safari ’s peers , about half of the ob - gyn department .
“ Over and over again he put our patients at risks and most recently with the undeniably terrible outcome . ”
Kaiser was “ misleading our patients and the public ” by advertising that it had a perinatalogist on staff even though his practice was restricted , said the petition , which was addressed to the hospital ’s medical director .
The petition , complaint letters , depositions and other documents used in preparation of this story are part of the ongoing lawsuit by the two doctors and arbitration cases against Kaiser , or have been provided to state regulators investigating Kaiser and Safari .

Dr. Gilbert Moran , one of the doctors who sued Kaiser and its affiliated Permanente Medical Group , alleges that they punished him and others who complained , rather than address their legitimate concerns .
“ I ’ve been telling these guys for years that he was going to kill someone , ” said Moran , the former ob - gyn chief .
“ And no one would listen . ”
Misjudgments , mistakes
In 1997 , Kaiser ’s Fresno hospital needed more obstetricians but was having difficulty finding specialists willing to live and work in the Central Valley .

A staff physician recommended Safari , a former classmate from the Tehran University Faculty of Medicine in Iran , who had just completed a fellowship in perinatology at Los Angeles County - USC Medical Center .
That training qualified him to treat high - risk pregnant women .
Without its own perinatologist , Kaiser had been forced to send such women to outside doctors and hospitals , often at enormous cost .
Safari arrived that August .
Within months , staff members began to file complaints to Moran , alleging that Safari was rude and inappropriate .
“ Dr. Safari let everybody know in no uncertain terms that since he was hired as the perinatologist that his intelligence level exceeded everybody ’s , ” said a nurse who , like several other staffers , insisted on anonymity because she feared for her job .
Advertisement
As time went by , staffers allege , they began to notice that the specialist also was making misjudgments and mistakes .
But Safari resisted criticism , they said .
After the ob - gyn department ’s quality committee ordered him to work on his deficiencies in 2002 , Safari “ adamantly refused to follow the committee ’s plan , stating that general OBGYN ’s cannot tell a specialist , perinatologist , what to do , ” according to a pending lawsuit filed in May by Moran and a colleague , Dr. Robert Rusche .
The suit does not name Safari as a defendant but seeks damages from Kaiser and the Permanente Medical Group , alleging the HMO retaliated against them for drawing attention to Safari .
In court papers , the defendants have denied the allegations .
The hospital called in Kaiser ’s regional chief of perinatology , who reviewed Safari ’s charts and sided with the committee , the suit said .

One of the cases involved a woman with possible pre-eclampsia -- characterized by high blood pressure and swelling that can lead to serious complications , according to Schear , Safari ’s attorney .
A review by physician peers found that she should have been hospitalized , he said .
In a second case , they cited Safari ’s failure to detect a potentially risky condition in which twins had markedly different weights , he said .
The review process was driven by Safari ’s enemies , principally Moran , and the cases cited did not involve harm to patients , Schear said .
Even so , Safari followed the committee ’s instructions , he said .
“ Peer review can be used in an unfair way to go after a doctor that people want to go after , ” he said .
“ No doctor is perfect . ”
Some of Safari ’s colleagues agreed .
Advertisement
“ Dr. Safari has been scrutinized way beyond what a person in similar circumstances would have happen to them , ” said Dr. Thomas Kulterman , a Safari supporter .
Moran said Safari ’s performance made him a target , and it did not improve with time or scrutiny .
Repeatedly during 2002 and 2003 , Moran and Rusche complained to Dr. Varoujan Altebarmakian , the hospital ’s chief physician , and others that Safari ’s “ unsafe ” treatment of patients “ clearly fell below any accepted standard of care , ” according to the doctors ’ lawsuit .
Altebarmakian told them the situation “ would be taken care of , ” the suit said .

Little need to question
Tanella Bessard knew nothing about Safari when she first saw him in October 2003 .
She had grown up under the HMO ’s care .
Her children were born at Kaiser hospitals , the second with a congenital heart defect .
So when Bessard became pregnant with her third child , she heeded her Kaiser doctor ’s advice to consult Safari , the hospital ’s sole perinatalogist .
In mid-January , when she was about 32 weeks pregnant , Bessard was hospitalized for early contractions .
Safari ordered shots to halt the labor and other steroid injections to develop her baby ’s lungs , then allowed her to return to work , she said .
Advertisement
“ I did n’t have a lot of reason to question him , ” said Bessard , now 33 .
“ He seemed to stay in tune with me and what my concerns were . ”
On Jan. 28 , when the baby was several weeks shy of full term , Bessard ’s contractions became unstoppable , according to interviews and deposition transcripts .
She was admitted to the hospital , and by 10 p.m. Safari noted drops in the baby ’s heart rate after the contractions peaked .
Such “ late decelerations ” can signal a reduced oxygen supply to the baby and , if prolonged , can cause critical harm .
Bessard ’s mother , Lanell Brown , said she was watching the fluctuating lines on the fetal monitor with growing concern .
She and Bessard pushed Safari to do a Caesarean section , but he resisted , they alleged .
Bessard ’s baby , Paris , ultimately was delivered by C - section just past 1 a.m. -- more than three hours after the late decelerations began .
By that time , the pH of Paris ’ umbilical cord -- an indicator of a baby ’s oxygen level before birth -- was 6.8 .
Advertisement
This level is “ almost incompatible with life , it is so bad , ” said Dr. Khalil Tabsh , chief of obstetrics at UCLA ’s medical school , who spoke generally and did not review Bessard ’s records .
“ Babies that are born with 6.8 , they either are dead or they are in deep trouble . ”
In her first months , Paris required oxygen and had seizures .
“ She did n’t do the normal things that children would do at her age , ” Brown said .
Paris died that November , not yet 10 months old .
The county coroner attributed her death to chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis -- respiratory diseases -- but did not address whether it was related to birth trauma .
Bessard filed an arbitration claim , which Kaiser settled for an undisclosed amount .
The HMO requires arbitration in legal disputes , a mandate that keeps all legal filings and their resolution confidential and out of public view .
Advertisement
In a deposition reviewed by The Times , Safari testified that it was Bessard who resisted his recommendation for a C - section .
“ He changed everything around , ” she said in an interview , “ which really blew me out of the water . ”
A financial settlement with Kaiser , reached in October 2005 , gave Bessard little solace , she said .
That ’s why she asked her lawyer to refer her allegations to the state medical board .
Nearly two years later , when the board accused Safari of gross negligence , it cited his failure to do an “ immediate Caesarean section . ”
Instead , officials said , he waited more than two hours to call for one and then took “ some 50 minutes to deliver the infant . ”

Another warning
About the time of the Bessard birth , tensions within the birthing center were escalating , according to memos and interviews .
In early 2004 , Safari ’s “ behavior became irrational and included threatening to starve himself , light himself on fire , and to call CNN to witness his plight , ” said Moran ’s suit , which refers to Safari as “ Dr. X . ”
Schear , Safari ’s attorney , said his client never said he would burn himself , but did threaten to go on a hunger strike to protest harassment by his boss , Moran .
Other physicians complained that Moran played favorites , he said .
Advertisement
In May 2004 , medical director Altebarmakian removed Moran as ob - gyn chief , citing his arrogance and his department ’s dysfunction in a follow - up letter .
At the time of his removal , Moran contends in his suit , he warned Altebarmakian that if something was n’t done , Safari “ would again permanently harm one of Kaiser ’s patients . ”
In December of that year , Moran had his meeting with Dr. Robbie Pearl , Permanente ’s top physician for Northern and Central California , to discuss Moran ’s concerns about Altebarmakian .
According to his notes made at the time , Moran said he warned Pearl about Safari , and Pearl said he was “ well aware ” of the situation , including Safari ’s threats to harm himself .
Devin , the twin boy , died in the delivery room four months later , and the case is now key to the medical board ’s complaint against Safari .
Tabsh , UCLA ’s obstetric chief , said that in his 35 years of practice he ’d never heard of a full - term baby ’s spinal cord being severed during a vacuum procedure .
Advertisement
“ Everybody that was involved in it was literally sick , ” said one nurse , who also spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ She was begging for a C - section . ”
Another nurse , the one allegedly blamed by Safari for Devin ’s death , questioned why no one had investigated whether Safari was threatening his colleagues .
In her July 2005 letter of concern given to her union representative , she described him as repeatedly “ harassing ” her about the event .
“ Those of us who did the right thing and came forward to speak up against Dr. Safari when he was in the wrong feel very threatened , ” the veteran nurse wrote .
Schear said Safari threatened no one and had safely performed about 200 vacuum deliveries .

“ It stinks .
It just stinks .
You ’re looking at one minute of this guy ’s career and you ’re going to cream him .
It ’s very dramatic - sounding , ‘ Oh , the poor baby broke his neck . ’
It ’s not something where you want to destroy a good and excellent perinatalogist ’s reputation . ”
Today , Valenzuela and her husband , Randy Ramirez , both 37 , decline to say much about what happened .
Valenzuela said she can’t discuss her arbitration settlement , and that they are afraid talking about Devin will make life unbearable again .
“ Words ca n’t even describe it , ” Ramirez said .
Sarah ’s sister , Helen Valenzuela , recalled that Sarah “ cried for a year ” after Devin ’s death .

Helen still remembers a nurse emerging from the delivery room , crying .
Later , she said , she confronted Safari in the hallway : “ You murdered my nephew ! ”
“ He told me to ‘ Calm down , or we ’re going to have you removed , ’ ” she said .
Near dawn , hours after Devin ’s death , Helen said she was in the room when Safari sat on the side of Sarah ’s bed and unburdened himself .
“ ‘ Nothing like this has ever happened to me before , ’ ” she recalled him saying .

Futile to complain
As staffers traded details about the case , Moran and Rusche recall wondering why it had n’t been promptly discussed by the hospital ’s ob - gyn quality review committee -- a practice they called routine in serious cases .
The doctors separately looked at Valenzuela ’s medical records and Rusche brought his concerns to his supervisors .
In July , hospital officials took action by limiting Safari ’s scope of practice .
But they also took aim at the messengers , Moran and Rusche , for violating patient privacy restrictions by reviewing the records .
Advertisement
Moran was suspended for two weeks without pay , had his salary cut by $ 20,000 a year and was denied a year - end bonus , while Rusche was suspended for one week without pay and denied a bonus , according to their disciplinary letters .
Both men challenged the discipline but got nowhere , their suit alleges .
It was their right to view the records , they contend , as quality committee members .
And Moran said he had treated Valenzuela after her delivery .
In the months that followed , the hospital administration chastised the eight obstetricians who submitted the petition warning administrators about Safari in August 2005 .
In a staff memo , Altebarmakian wrote that a petition “ targeting an individual practitioner is counterproductive and discourages the cooperative , harmonious and respectful work environment that the medical group expects and encourages . ”
Several staffers began to sense that it was futile -- not to mention risky -- to complain .
Advertisement
“ It looks like nothing changes , ” said one veteran nurse .
“ I do n’t know who protected him .
I do n’t know who came to bat for him .
But he ’s still there . ”
Rusche recalls the moment he decided he ’d had enough .
A new patient had come in , and Rusche deemed her high - risk -- a decision that ensured she would be sent to Safari .
“ To me , I had crossed the line there , ” he said .
“ It all of a sudden hit me what the heck I had just done . ”
In January 2006 , he and Moran gave up on resolving matters internally .
They took their complaints to the medical board , just as Bessard ’s lawyer had done earlier .

Rusche retired last year and has traveled the country in a motor home .
Moran now works for Kaiser in Bakersfield , 100 miles from his home , and sees his family on his days off .
Safari is a “ really good physician ” with a lengthy track record of doing “ very difficult deliveries , ” said Dr. Daryoush Razi , a fellow student from the Tehran medical school who now heads the ob - gyn department ’s quality committee .
“ I trust him with treating my family . ”
Earlier this year , he and 10 other doctors signed a letter of support for Safari .
Several were new to the department , but three had apparently changed their minds after signing the protest petition in 2005 .

He is “ an asset to our department , ” the letter said .
