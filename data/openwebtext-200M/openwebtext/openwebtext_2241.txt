Well , it could , but in most cases where it would be confusing , the compiler will give you a warning .
Personally , I try to use some naming convention for variables to minimize the risk of confusion .

These can not be modelled in ( purely ) functional languages , can they ?
How ?
Almost by definition , the answer is " no " , I think ? ( : ( I guess I should let the real language experts answer this , but it 's Saturday , and I do n't have anything better to do right now .
I trust I 'll get my fingers slapped if I write something stupid ) .
At least it 's difficult .
Haskell uses ' monads ' , to clearly mark where the code has side - effects .
This allows the compiler to trust that all code outside of the monad is pure .
Other languages can use the fact that these operations are contained within the runtime , and can optimize them .
Felix * does this , for example ; I do n't know about Concurrent ML .
I believe that when Felix participated in the Language Shootout , its compiler reduced the concurrency benchmark down to a function that did nothing **.
This does n't mean that Felix models " fibres " as being pure , but as long as the effect of the impurity is understood , a smart compiler can sometimes eliminate it , or at least simplify it significantly .
I guess this is sort of a grey area . (:
It is partly connected to the fact that most of the surroundings are pure , and very well understood .
Erlang can , for example , decide to pass a pointer rather than copy a message , since there are no user - level operations that can mess with the low - level representation of the message .
There was once a paper suggesting that a gen_server : call ( ) could be reduced to a function call , under certain circumstances ( http://www.erlang.se/workshop/2002/Stenman.pdf), but it suggested dynamic checking to ensure that the conditions were met , since it would be difficult to do statically in Erlang .
( OHaskell not only performs this check statically , it enforces it : http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~nordland/ohaskell/)
Erlang 's approach is fairly pragmatic .
It has basically tried to make sure that all non-pure operations can be modeled using spawn , send and receive , but the only parts of an erlang program that the compiler can trust to be free from side - effects are clause heads , the left hand side of an expression ( pattern matching ) , and guard expressions .
Every ( non - guard ) function call can potentially result in a side - effect .
Some BIFs are also known to be pure and can be optimized by the compiler .

Adults lie constantly to kids .
I 'm not saying we should stop , but I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why .
There may also be a benefit to us .
We were all lied to as kids , and some of the lies we were told still affect us .
So by studying the ways adults lie to kids , we may be able to clear our heads of lies we were told .
I 'm using the word " lie " in a very general sense : not just overt falsehoods , but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids .
Though " lie " has negative connotations , I do n't mean to suggest we should never do this — just that we should pay attention when we do . [ 1 ]
One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is how broad the conspiracy is .
All adults know what their culture lies to kids about : they 're the questions you answer " Ask your parents . "
If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982 or what the atomic weight of carbon was , you could just tell him .
But if a kid asks you " Is there a God ? " or " What 's a prostitute ? " you 'll probably say " Ask your parents . "
Since we all agree , kids see few cracks in the view of the world presented to them .
The biggest disagreements are between parents and schools , but even those are small .
Schools are careful what they say about controversial topics , and if they do contradict what parents want their kids to believe , parents either pressure the school into keeping quiet or move their kids to a new school .
The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so only by discovering internal contradictions in what they 're told .
It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation .
Here 's what happened to Einstein : Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true .
The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies : it was a crushing impression . [ 2 ] I remember that feeling .
By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt from end to end .
That 's why movies like The Matrix have such resonance .
Every kid grows up in a fake world .
In a way it would be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated as a bunch of evil machines , and one could make a clean break just by taking a pill .
Protection
If you ask adults why they lie to kids , the most common reason they give is to protect them .
And kids do need protecting .
The environment you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the streets of a big city .
That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie .
It 's certainly not a bad lie to tell , to give a baby the impression the world is quiet and warm and safe .
But this harmless type of lie can turn sour if left unexamined .
Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn till age 18 .
To mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse .
That 's an extreme example , of course ; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes national news .
But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia .
The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in .
And it seems great for 10 year olds .
I liked living in suburbia when I was 10 .
I did n't notice how sterile it was .
My whole world was no bigger than a few friends ' houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in .
On a log scale I was midway between crib and globe .
A suburban street was just the right size .
But as I grew older , suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake .
Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20 , but it 's often frustrating at 15 .
This is too big a problem to solve here , but certainly one reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed for 10 year olds .
What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them in suburbia ?
A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3 year old daughter " saw too much . "
Off the top of my head , that might include : people who are high or drunk , poverty , madness , gruesome medical conditions , sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness , and violent anger .
I think it 's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year old .
I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even then .
I would n't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I saw .
It would be too frightening .
A lot of the things adults conceal from smaller children , they conceal because they'd be frightening , not because they want to conceal the existence of such things .
Misleading the child is just a byproduct .
This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to kids .
But because the lies are indirect we do n't keep a very strict accounting of them .
Parents know they 've concealed the facts about sex , and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more .
But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in .
Combine this with the confidence parents try to instill in their kids , and every year you get a new crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world .
Do n't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world ?
Actually this seems to be a recent innovation , no more than about 100 years old .
In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings .
They could see they were n't as strong or skillful as the village smith .
In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we do now , but the lies implicit in an artificial , protected environment are a recent invention .
Like a lot of new inventions , the rich got this first .
Children of kings and great magnates were the first to grow up out of touch with the world .
Suburbia means half the population can live like kings in that respect .
Sex ( and Drugs )
I 'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York .
I 'd worry less about what they 'd see , and more about what they 'd do .
I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan , and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded .
They seemed to have lost their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried more drugs than I 'd even heard of .
The reasons parents do n't want their teenage kids having sex are complex .
There are some obvious dangers : pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases .
But those are n't the only reasons parents do n't want their kids having sex .
The average parents of a 14 year old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases .
Kids can probably sense they are n't being told the whole story .
After all , pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as much a problem for adults , and they have sex .
What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex ?
Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it 's probably inborn .
But if it 's inborn it should be universal , and there are plenty of societies where parents do n't mind if their teenage kids have sex — indeed , where it 's normal for 14 year olds to become mothers .
So what 's going on ?
There does seem to be a universal taboo against sex with prepubescent children .
One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that .
And I think this is the main reason parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having sex .
They still think of them as children , even though biologically they 're not , so the taboo against child sex still has force .
One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs : that it can cause great pleasure .
That 's what makes sex and drugs so dangerous .
The desire for them can cloud one 's judgement — which is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the already wretched judgement of a teenage kid .
Here parents ' desires conflict .
Older societies told kids they had bad judgement , but modern parents want their children to be confident .
This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in their place , but it has the side effect that after having implicitly lied to kids about how good their judgement is , we then have to lie again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they believed us .
If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs , it would be : the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy judgement .
People with twice your experience still get burned by them .
But this may be one of those cases where the truth would n't be convincing , because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is believing you have good judgement .
When you 're too weak to lift something , you can tell , but when you 're making a decision impetuously , you 're all the more sure of it .
Innocence
Another reason parents do n't want their kids having sex is that they want to keep them innocent .
Adults have a certain model of how kids are supposed to behave , and it 's different from what they expect of other adults .
One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed to use .
Most parents use words when talking to other adults that they would n't want their kids using .
They try to hide even the existence of these words for as long as they can .
And this is another of those conspiracies everyone participates in : everyone knows you 're not supposed to swear in front of kids .
I 've never heard more different explanations for anything parents tell kids than why they should n't swear .
Every parent I know forbids their children to swear , and yet no two of them have the same justification .
It 's clear most start with not wanting kids to swear , then make up the reason afterward .
So my theory about what 's going on is that the function of swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult .
There 's no difference in the meaning of " shit " and " poopoo . "
So why should one be ok for kids to say and one forbidden ?
The only explanation is : by definition . [ 3 ]
Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for adults ?
The idea of a foul - mouthed , cynical 10 year old leaning against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth is very disconcerting .
But why ?
One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we 're programmed to like certain kinds of helplessness .
I 've several times heard mothers say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children 's mispronunciations because they were so cute .
And if you think about it , cuteness is helplessness .
Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby , ineffectual limbs .
It 's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect helpless creatures , considering human offspring are so helpless for so long .
Without the helplessness that makes kids cute , they 'd be very annoying .
They 'd merely seem like incompetent adults .
But there 's more to it than that .
The reason our hypothetical jaded 10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying , but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early .
To be jaded you have to think you know how the world works , and any theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty narrow one .
Innocence is also open - mindedness .
We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn .
Paradoxical as it sounds , there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of knowledge .
If you 're going to learn that the world is a brutal place full of people trying to take advantage of one another , you 're better off learning it last .
Otherwise you wo n't bother learning much more .
Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent , and I do n't think this is a coincidence .
I think they 've deliberately avoided learning about certain things .
Certainly I do .
I used to think I wanted to know everything .
Now I know I do n't .
Death
After sex , death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about to kids .
Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos .
But why do we conceal death from kids ?
Probably because small children are particularly horrified by it .
They want to feel safe , and death is the ultimate threat .
One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the death of our first cat .
Over the years , as we asked for more details , they were compelled to invent more , so the story grew quite elaborate .
The cat had died at the vet 's office .
Of what ?
Of the anaesthesia itself .
Why was the cat at the vet 's office ?
To be fixed .
And why had such a routine operation killed it ?
It was n't the vet 's fault ; the cat had a congenitally weak heart ; the anaesthesia was too much for it ; but there was no way anyone could have known this in advance .
It was not till we were in our twenties that the truth came out : my sister , then about three , had accidentally stepped on the cat and broken its back .
They did n't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat heaven .
My parents never claimed that people or animals who died had " gone to a better place , " or that we 'd meet them again .
It did n't seem to harm us .
My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my grandfather .
She said they 'd been sitting reading one day , and when she said something to him , he did n't answer .
He seemed to be asleep , but when she tried to rouse him , she could n't .
" He was gone . "
Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep .
Later I learned it had n't been so neat , and the heart attack had taken most of a day to kill him .
Along with such outright lies , there must have been a lot of changing the subject when death came up .
I can't remember that , of course , but I can infer it from the fact that I did n't really grasp I was going to die till I was about 19 .
How could I have missed something so obvious for so long ?
Now that I 've seen parents managing the subject , I can see how : questions about death are gently but firmly turned aside .
On this topic , especially , they 're met half - way by kids .
Kids often want to be lied to .
They want to believe they 're living in a comfortable , safe world as much as their parents want them to believe it . [ 4 ]
Identity
Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group and want their kids to feel it too .
This usually requires two different kinds of lying : the first is to tell the child that he or she is an X , and the second is whatever specific lies Xes differentiate themselves by believing . [ 5 ]
Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity is one of the stickiest things you can tell them .
Almost anything else you tell a kid , they can change their mind about later when they start to think for themselves .
But if you tell a kid they 're a member of a certain group , that seems nearly impossible to shake .
This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated lies parents tell .
When parents are of different religions , they 'll often agree between themselves that their children will be " raised as Xes . "
And it works .
The kids obligingly grow up considering themselves as Xes , despite the fact that if their parents had chosen the other way , they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys .
One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved .
The truth is common property .
You can't distinguish your group by doing things that are rational , and believing things that are true .
If you want to set yourself apart from other people , you have to do things that are arbitrary , and believe things that are false .
And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary and believing things that are false , and being regarded as odd by " outsiders " on that account , the cognitive dissonance pushing children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous .
If they are n't an X , why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs and customs ?
If they are n't an X , why do all the non -Xes call them one ?
This form of lie is not without its uses .
You can use it to carry a payload of beneficial beliefs , and they will also become part of the child 's identity .
You can tell the child that in addition to never wearing the color yellow , believing the world was created by a giant rabbit , and always snapping their fingers before eating fish , Xes are also particularly honest and industrious .
Then X children will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be honest and industrious .
This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions , and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful and the bizarre .
The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick , and the useful half is the payload . [ 6 ]
Authority
One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain power over them .
Sometimes these lies are truly sinister , like a child molester telling his victims they 'll get in trouble if they tell anyone what happened to them .
Others seem more innocent ; it depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power , and what they use it for .
Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children .
Usually their motives are mixed .
For example , a father who has an affair generally conceals it from his children .
His motive is partly that it would worry them , partly that this would introduce the topic of sex , and partly ( a larger part than he would admit ) that he does n't want to tarnish himself in their eyes .
If you want to learn what lies are told to kids , read almost any book written to teach them about " issues . " [ 7 ] Peter Mayle wrote one called Why Are We Getting a Divorce ?
It begins with the three most important things to remember about divorce , one of which is :
You should n't put the blame on one parent , because divorce is never only one person 's fault .
[ 8 ] Really ?
When a man runs off with his secretary , is it always partly his wife 's fault ?
But I can see why Mayle might have said this .
Maybe it 's more important for kids to respect their parents than to know the truth about them .
But because adults conceal their flaws , and at the same time insist on high standards of behavior for kids , a lot of kids grow up feeling they fall hopelessly short .
They walk around feeling horribly evil for having used a swearword , while in fact most of the adults around them are doing much worse things .
This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions .
The more confident people are , the more willing they seem to be to answer a question " I do n't know . "
Less confident people feel they have to have an answer or they 'll look bad .
My parents were pretty good about admitting when they did n't know things , but I must have been told a lot of lies of this type by teachers , because I rarely heard a teacher say " I do n't know " till I got to college .
I remember because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of a class .
The first hint I had that teachers were n't omniscient came in sixth grade , after my father contradicted something I 'd learned in school .
When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite , my father replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about — that he was just an elementary school teacher , after all .
Just a teacher ?
The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill - formed .
Did n't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught ?
And if not , why were they the ones teaching us ?
The sad fact is , US public school teachers do n't generally understand the stuff they 're teaching very well .
There are some sterling exceptions , but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank academically near the bottom of the college population .
So the fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible shows what a job the system must have done on my brain .
School
What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies .
The most excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to learn .
The problem is , a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the curriculum in the name of simplification .
Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various powerful groups want kids to be told .
The lies are rarely overt .
Usually they consist either of omissions or of over - emphasizing certain topics at the expense of others .
The view of history we got in elementary school was a crude hagiography , with at least one representative of each powerful group .
The famous scientists I remember were Einstein , Marie Curie , and George Washington Carver .
Einstein was a big deal because his work led to the atom bomb .
Marie Curie was involved with X - rays .
But I was mystified about Carver .
He seemed to have done stuff with peanuts .
It 's obvious now that he was on the list because he was black ( and for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman ) , but as a kid I was confused for years about him .
I wonder if it would n't have been better just to tell us the truth : that there were n't any famous black scientists .
Ranking George Washington Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science , but about the obstacles blacks faced in his time .
As subjects got softer , the lies got more frequent .
By the time you got to politics and recent history , what we were taught was pretty much pure propaganda .
For example , we were taught to regard political leaders as saints — especially the recently martyred Kennedy and King .
It was astonishing to learn later that they 'd both been serial womanizers , and that Kennedy was a speed freak to boot .
( By the time King 's plagiarism emerged , I 'd lost the ability to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people . )
I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them lies , because practically everyone who has anything to say about it has some kind of spin to put on it .
Much recent history consists of spin .
It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts like that .
Probably the biggest lie told in schools , though , is that the way to succeed is through following " the rules . "
In fact most such rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently .
Peace
Of all the reasons we lie to kids , the most powerful is probably the same mundane reason they lie to us .
Often when we lie to people it's not part of any conscious strategy , but because they 'd react violently to the truth .
Kids , almost by definition , lack self - control .
They react violently to things — and so they get lied to a lot . [ 9 ]
A few Thanksgivings ago , a friend of mine found himself in a situation that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie to kids .
As the roast turkey appeared on the table , his alarmingly perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted to die .
Foreseeing disaster , my friend and his wife rapidly improvised : yes , the turkey had wanted to die , and in fact had lived its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner .
And that ( phew ) was the end of that .
Whenever we lie to kids to protect them , we 're usually also lying to keep the peace .
One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up thinking horrible things are normal .
It 's hard for us to feel a sense of urgency as adults over something we 've literally been trained not to worry about .
When I was about 10 I saw a documentary on pollution that put me into a panic .
It seemed the planet was being irretrievably ruined .
I went to my mother afterward to ask if this was so .
I do n't remember what she said , but she made me feel better , so I stopped worrying about it .
That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old .
But we should understand the price .
This sort of lie is one of the main reasons bad things persist : we 're all trained to ignore them .
Detox
A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called " oxygen debt . "
His body switches to an emergency source of energy that 's faster than regular aerobic respiration .
But this process builds up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break down , so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while to recover .
We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt .
We were told a lot of lies to get us ( and our parents ) through our childhood .
Some may have been necessary .
Some probably were n't .
But we all arrive at adulthood with heads full of lies .
There 's never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all the lies they told you .
They 've forgotten most of them .
So if you 're going to clear these lies out of your head , you 're going to have to do it yourself .
Few do .
Most people go through life with bits of packing material adhering to their minds and never know it .
You probably never can completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid , but it 's worth trying .
I 've found that whenever I 've been able to undo a lie I was told , a lot of other things fell into place .
Fortunately , once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new resource you can use to figure out what lies you were told .
You 're now one of the liars .
You get to watch behind the scenes as adults spin the world for the next generation of kids .
The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are from a neutral observer .
When I left high school I was , I thought , a complete skeptic .
I 'd realized high school was crap .
I thought I was ready to question everything I knew .
But among the many other things I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in my head .
It 's not enough to consider your mind a blank slate .
You have to consciously erase it .
Notes
[ 1 ] One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we think .
If you look at what adults told children in the past , it 's shocking how much they lied to them .
Like us , they did it with the best intentions .
So if we think we 're as open as one could reasonably be with children , we 're probably fooling ourselves .
Odds are people in 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we are at some of the lies people told 100 years ago .
I can't predict which these will be , and I do n't want to write an essay that will seem dumb in 100 years .
So instead of using special euphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions , I 'm just going to call all our lies lies .
( I have omitted one type : lies told to play games with kids ' credulity .
These range from " make - believe , " which is not really a lie because it 's told with a wink , to the frightening lies told by older siblings .
There 's not much to say about these : I would n't want the first type to go away , and would n't expect the second type to . )

[ 3 ]
If you ask parents why kids should n't swear , the less educated ones usually reply with some question - begging answer like " it 's inappropriate , " while the more educated ones come up with elaborate rationalizations .
In fact the less educated parents seem closer to the truth .
[ 4 ]
As a friend with small children pointed out , it 's easy for small children to consider themselves immortal , because time seems to pass so slowly for them .
To a 3 year old , a day feels like a month might to an adult .
So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would to us .
[ 5 ] I realize I 'm going to get endless grief for classifying religion as a type of lie .
Usually people skirt that issue with some equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual standards for truth .
But because I can't predict which lies future generations will consider inexcusable , I can't safely omit any type we tell .
Yes , it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion in 100 years , but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it .
[ 6 ] Unfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well as good ones .
For example , there are certain qualities that some groups in America consider " acting white . "
In fact most of them could as accurately be called " acting Japanese . "
There 's nothing specifically white about such customs .
They 're common to all cultures with long traditions of living in cities .
So it is probably a losing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as part of its identity .
[ 7 ]
In this context , " issues " basically means " things we 're going to lie to them about . "
That 's why there 's a special name for these topics .
[ 8 ] Mayle , Peter , Why Are We Getting a Divorce ? , Harmony , 1988 .
[ 9 ]
The ironic thing is , this is also the main reason kids lie to adults .
If you freak out when people tell you alarming things , they wo n't tell you them .
Teenagers do n't tell their parents what happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend 's house for the same reason parents do n't tell 5 year olds the truth about the Thanksgiving turkey .
They 'd freak if they knew .
Thanks to Sam Altman , Marc Andreessen , Trevor Blackwell , Patrick Collison , Jessica Livingston , Jackie McDonough , Robert Morris , and David Sloo for reading drafts of this .
And since there are some controversial ideas here , I should add that none of them agreed with everything in it .

But even with all that there ’s more – there ’s the Game ’s new Live Page , which is the thing we ’re really excited about and want to let you know about this week .
The Live Page does two cool things :
First , it serves up news about the game – so that ’s news about updates and the kind of stuff you ’d expect on criteriongames.com , but it ’s also news about what ’s happening in the game – so , expect to find news about what you ’ve done in Paradise City as well as about what ’s happening online , like when we hit the 100 millionth crash , for example .
Secondly ( and this is the really , really cool bit ) , it ’s where we can , using the Game Calendar , create what we ’re calling ‘ Live Broadcast Gameplay ’ .
This is how it works :
If you check out the Game Calendar , you ’ll see certain dates on it are ringed .
These represent ‘ Live Events ’ that will occur on that day .
In the news panel on the Live Page there ’ll be a corresponding story telling you about what ’s happening on those days .
So , for example :
Saturday 12th July 2008 – Prize Cars Weekend
Where for one day , if you go online we ’ll let you try out all of the Carbon and XS Cars ( that are normally available only when you complete the offline game ) for you to test drive in races and Freeburning .
As this shows – it really allows us to mix up the game , and we ’ve got a schedule packed with cool events that stretch out through the summer .
This breaks down as :
Test Drive Tuesdays
Every Tuesday , we ’re going to mix things up online by focusing the game around a specific set of cars .
For a whole day , your online junkyard will look radically different .
This coming week ( Tuesday 15th July 2008 ) will see only Speed Boost cars online .
Face Off Thursdays
Every Thursday , we ’re going to mix up racing ( both ranked and unranked . )
Everyone ’s junkyard will be as normal , but in races we ’ll supply a certain set of cars to race in .
This will really level the playing field in racing .
The other great thing about Live Events is that it allows us to award our players with all kinds of cool stuff .
So , starting in a few weeks ’ time :
Graduation Weekends
In these , we ’ll let you try out new cars and new liveries for a whole weekend .
Over the course of the weekend , you ’ll be able to test drive our vehicle of choice , and if you want to keep it , then we ’ll set up an online challenge for you to complete .
The first such event will be our “ Mount Olympus ” event in which you ’ll get to test drive the new Hunter Olympus , and , if you win an Online Road Rage event in it , you ’ll get to keep it forever .
We ’ll be running multiple Graduation Weekends that will introduce even more vehicles and for those players who participate in all of them , there ’ll be a special prize .
So there you go – more exciting and innovative stuff from Criterion Games .
Now , let ’s see what we can come up with for Week # 4 !

I ’ve seen a lot of sad things in American politics in my lifetime — the resignation of a president who became a national disgrace after he oversaw a campaign of break - ins and cover-ups , another who circumvented the Constitution to trade arms for hostages , and yet is now hailed as national hero .
And those paled to what we have seen in the last seven years — flagrant disregard for the Constitution , the launching of a " pre-emptive " war on false pretenses , and discussions about torture and other shocking abuses inside the White House inner sanctum .
But now it ’s come to this : A new low that I never imagined was even possible .
President Bush went on foreign soil today , and committed what I consider an act of political treason : Comparing the candidate of the U.S. opposition party to appeasers of Nazi Germany — in the very nation that was carved out from the horrific calamity of the Holocaust .
Bush ’s bizarre and beyond - appropriate detour into American presidential politics took place in the middle of what should have been an occasion for joy :
A speech to Israeli ’s Knesset to honor that nation ’s 60th birthday .
But here ’s what he said :
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) –
In a particularly sharp blast from halfway around the world , President Bush suggested Thursday that Sen. Barack Obama and other Democrats are in favor of " appeasement " of terrorists in the same way U.S. leaders appeased Nazis in the run-up to World War II .
" Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , " said Bush , in what White House aides privately acknowledged was a reference to calls by Obama and other Democrats for the U.S. president to sit down for talks with leaders like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" We have heard this foolish delusion before , " Bush said in remarks to the Israeli Knesset .
" As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American Senator declared : ‘ Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
As a believer in free speech , I think Bush has a right to say what he wants , but as a President of the United States who swore to uphold the Constitution , his freedom also carries an awesome and solemn responsibility , and what this president said today is a serious breach of that high moral standard .
Of course , there are differences of opinion on how America should handle Iran , and that ’s why we ’re having an election here at home , to sort these issues out — hopefully with respect and not with emotional and inaccurate appeals .
Not only is the president ’s comment a gross misrepresentation of Barack Obama ’s stance on the issue , but ironically , it comes just a day after his own Secretary of State , Robert Gates , said of Iran : " We need to figure out a way to develop some leverage . . . and then sit down and talk with them . "
Is Gates a Nazi appeaser - type , too ?
And Bush has been hardly consistent on this point , either .
Look at his own dealings with oil - rich Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , linked to deadly terror attacks like Pan Am Flight 103 .
But what Bush did in Israel this morning goes well beyond the accepted confines of American political debate , When the president speaks to a foreign parliament on behalf of our country , his message needs to be clear and unambiguous .
Our democracy may look messy to outsiders , and we may have our disagreements with some sharp elbows thrown around , but at the end of the day we are not Republicans or Democrats or liberals or conservatives .
We are Americans .
And you , Mr. Bush , are the leader of us all .
To use a diplomatic setting on foreign soil to score a cheap political point at home is way beneath your office , way beneath your country , and way beneath the people you serve .
You have been handed an office once uplifted to great heights by fellow countrymen from Washington to Lincoln to Roosevelt to Eisenhower , and have plunged it so deeply into the Karl - Rove - and - Rush - Limbaugh - fueled world of political destruction and survival of all costs that have lost all perspective — and all sense of decency .
To travel to Israel and to associate a sitting American senator and your possible successor in the Oval Office with those who at one time gave comfort to an enemy of the United States is , in and of itself , an act of political treason .
In another irony , this comes from an administration that has already committed such grave abuses that its former officials are becoming fearful of traveling overseas , lest they be arrested for war crimes .
Despite the alleged crimes and misdemeanors of the Bush administration , the Democrats who control the House have until now been restrained in their use of the impeachment process , hoping that the final eight months of our American nightmare can pass by quickly .
Indeed , one has to wonder how much of Bush ’s outrageous statement this morning arose from fear — fear that a President Obama will go after his wrongdoing in 2009 .
Today , it ’s a whole new ballgame .
I believe this treacherous statement by a U.S. president in Israel is a signal to the Democrats in the House in Washington , that it ’s time to play its Constitutional role in ending this trauma , before even greater acts against the interest of America are wrongly committed in our name .

For this splendid audience , I considered six scenarios for how the long - run might drastically differ from the world we see before our eyes :
1 . A return to Malthus , noting that wages cannot forever exceed the marginal cost of producing labor .
Perhaps we are in for a massive population increase , if only of robots .
2. Robin Hanson ’s exponential growth , which means a huge burst of growth sometime " soon " — maybe really good drugs , uploads , or nanotechnology ?
3 . Most of the economy becomes health care costs .
4. Energy becomes very cheap , destruction is easy , deterrence is difficult , power decentralizes , and we retreat to medieval - style fortresses .
5 . People become more and more interested in " vivid " experiences , such as they obtain in museums , going to date movies , or spending lots on higher education .
This sounds so lame , but it ’s pretty close to reality now .
6 . Wealthier economies boost human optimism and thus asset markets become increasingly vulnerable to bubbles .
# 4 is pessimistic , I am not sure the others are , at least not in the proper " all things considered " sense .
If # 1 is on its way , make sure you own some capital ( as Robin Hanson points out ) , you will be very wealthy then .
Your evaluation of # 1 may depend on your view of Derek Parfit ’s population conundrums .
There will be lots of rich people and also lots of poor people .
Over dinner I pressed the claim that very few people or organizations are capable of stating what they are actually good at .

Metaclasses in Python 3.0 [ 1 of 2 ]
by Michele Simionato
August 9 , 2008
Summary
This is the English translation of an article I wrote some time ago for Stacktrace : http://stacktrace.it/articoli/2008/01/metaclassi-python-3000/
For convenience , I have split it in two posts .
Advertisement
I heard for the first time the word " metaclass " in 2002 , when I begun studying Python .
I was very active in the Python newsgroup then , and I received from David Mertz an invitation to write a joint paper about metaclasses .
That was my very first paper outside Physics and since then I have had a particular affection for the subject .
At the time the topic was hot since the metaclass mechanism had been just reformed ( that was around the time Python 2.2 came along ) .
Nowadays the subject is still hot since with Python 3.0 coming in October we will have another reform of the metaclass mechanism .
The reform is for the better .
I could not miss the occasion to write something about it .
The sweeet changes
Here I assume my readers to be familiar with metaclass programming in Python , at least as it is intended from Python 2.2 to Python 2.6 .
If you need to refresh your memory , my advice is to give a look to the metaclass trilogy David and I wrote for IBM DeveloperWorks , Metaclass programming in Python , parts 1 , 2 e 3 .
A metaclass is nothing else than a subclass of the builtin metaclass type : >>> class DoNothingMeta( type ) : # a silly metaclass ... pass A metaclass can be instantiated by specifying a string ( the name ) , a tuple of classes ( the bases ) and a dictionary ( the dic ) : >>> C = DoNothingMeta( ' C ' , ( object , ) , {} ) The metaclass instance is a class named C , with parent object and an empty dictionary .
In Python 3.0 everything remains the same : the only change is in the syntactic sugar .
In Python 2.2 + you have at your disposition the so - called __metaclass__ hook and that the previous line can be written also as >>> class C( object ) : __metaclass__ = DoNothingMeta
In Python 3.0 + instead , you can use a somewhat nicer syntax : >>> class C( object , metaclass=DoNothingMeta ) : pass
The important thing to notice is that in Python 3.0 you can write >>> class C( object ) : __metaclass__ = DoNothingMeta but the hook is not recognized : Python 3.0 will just add a __metaclass__ attribute to your class , but the attribute will not be treated in any special way and in particular your class will not be magically converted in an instance of the metaclass : the class of C will stay type and not DoNothingMeta : >>> type(C ) is DoNothingMeta False
This is potentially risky when porting code from Python 2.X to Python 3.0 .
I guess the 2to3 tool will give some warning , but I have not tried it yet .
If anybody who knows read this post , feel free to comment .
The hot changes
The syntactic changes , however useful , are still cosmetics .
The substantial change between Python 2.2 and Python 3.0 is semantic : in Python 3.0 the dictionary passed to the metaclass can be replaced with a generic object with a __setitem__ method .
In particular , you can pass to a metaclass an ordered dictionary instead of a ordinary dictionary .
That means that it is possible to keep the order of the declarations in the class body , a much desired feature for metaclass practictioners .
For instance , suppose we want to define a Book class with fields title and author ( in that order ) .
In Python 2.2 we would be forced to repeat the names of the fields : class Book Python 22 ( object ) : title = ' varchar ( 128 ) ' author = ' varchar ( 64 ) ' order = [ ' title ' , ' author ' ]
The order list is redundant and annoying , but you cannot get rid of it in traditional Python , otherwise you would miss the relative ordering of title and author .
In Python 3.0 instead , the order list can be avoided , provided we use an ordered dict .
At the moment I am writing this is not clear if an ordered dict class will enter in the standard library of Python 3.0 , therefore I will give a simple implementation here : from collections import Mapping class odict ( Mapping ) : " A simple implementation of ordered dicts without __delitem__ functionality " def __init__ ( self , alist =None ) : self .
_inner = {} # inner dictionary self .
_keys = [ ] # the dictionary keys in order if alist : for k , v in alist : self [ k ] = v def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : return self ._inner[key ] def __setitem__ ( self , key , value ) : self._inner[key ] = value self._keys.append(key ) def __iter__( self ) : return iter(self._keys ) def __len__( self ) : return len( self._keys ) def __repr__( self ) : return ' { %s} ' % list ( self.items ( ) )
I am deriving here from the Mapping Abstract Base Class provided by the collections module , which takes the place of the traditional UserDict .
DictMixin class .
Talking about the ABCs would take too long and I will leave that for a future post .
The relevant thing to say for what concerns dictionaries is that the dictionary interface has changed in Python 3.0 : the methods .iterkeys ( ) , .itervalues ( ) and .iteritems ( ) were removed and the methods .keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( ) now return views instead of lists .
Again , I have no time to discuss views right now , but you can look at the relevant PEP .
We still need to tell the metaclass to use an odict instead of dict .
To this aim , Python 3.0 recognizes a special ( class ) method __prepare__ ( mcl , name , bases ) returning the would be class dictionary .
Therefore it is enough to add a suitable __prepare__ to the metaclass : class MetaBookExample ( type ) : @classmethod def __prepare__ ( mcl , name , bases ) : return odict ( ) def __new__ ( mcl , name , bases , odic ) : cls = super ( ) .
__new__( mcl , name , bases , dict ( odic ) ) cls.odic = odic return cls
The tricky point here is that the __new__ method must convert the class " dictionary " returned by __prepare__ into a regular dictionary ( this explains the dict ( odic ) expression ) .
If your __prepare__ method does not return an instance of dict and you do not override __new__ properly , you will get an error .
For instance in this example if you do not override __new__ you will get a TypeError : type ( ) argument 3 must be dict , not odict when you try to instantiate the metaclass .
If you do things correctly , instead , class BookExample ( metaclass=MetaBookExample ) : " An example " title = ' Varchar ( 128 ) ' author = ' Varchar ( 64 ) ' you may verify that the order of the class attributes is preserved : >>> BookExample.odic # this is an odict instance {[ ( ' __module__ ' , ' __main__ ' ) , ( ' __doc__ ' , ' An example ' ) , ( ' title ' , ' Varchar ( 128 ) ' ) , ( ' author ' , ' Varchar ( 64 ) ' ) ] }
We see here that the metaclass is also passing a couple of implicit magic attributes __module__ and __doc__ to the class .
This is the usual behavior even in Python 2.2 + so it should not come as a surprise to you .
Keeping the order of class attributes can be useful for the builders of Object Relation Mappers ( SQLAlchemy anyone ? ) , since it becomes possible to match the order of the columns in the database with the order of the column attributes at the Python level .
In the second part of this article I will give a pedagogical example of what you can do with Python 3.0 metaclasses , by implementing a clever ( not necessarily in a good sense ) record system .
Stay tuned !

Park benches of the future could be made from computers of the past .
Scientists in China have developed a new recycling method that makes a strong construction material out of printed circuit boards ( PCBs ) , which had been thought to be worthless .
As more electrical and electronic equipment has become obsolete , the issue of electronic - waste removal has intensified , say Zhenming Xu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and colleagues .
PCBs account for about 3 percent by weight of all electronic waste , Xu says .
Although metals from the circuit boards , such as copper and aluminum , are recycled , landfill disposal has been the primary method for treating their nonmetallic materials , which have been difficult to recycle , the paper says .
The new process pulverizes the non-metallic parts of the circuit boards , adds a little resin , then hot presses them into useable plates .
Being almost as strong as reinforced concrete , the recycled material makes a good substitute for wood the researchers write in the July 15 issue of Environmental Science & Technology .
It could be used to make sewer grates , fences and park benches .
" There is no doubt that the technique has potential in the industry for recycling nonmetallic materials of PCBs , " Xu said .
The 1.42 - metre ( 4'8 " ) tall gymnast was part of the women 's gymnastic team which won gold and then took an individual gold medal in the uneven bars at the Beijing Olympics .
If correct , that would make her 14 instead of 16 and under the competition rules , gymnasts must be aged 16 in the year an Olympics takes place in order to qualify to compete .
The rules were put into place to avoid exploiting younger gymnasts , who have more flexible bodies .
Chinese officials say He Kexin 's passport and birth certificate list her as being born on January 1 , 1992 - which would make her 16 - years - old .
When asked about her age recently , He Kexin was quoted as saying : " My real age is 16 , I do n't care about what other people say , it 's none of their business . "
Stryde Hax claims to work for the US - based Intrepidus Group , a provider of information security consulting services .
His findings have been meticulously laid out in his blog with links and screenshots to prove and preserve his findings .
" Much of the coverage regarding Kexin 's age has only mentioned ' allegation ' of fraud , and the IOC has ignored the matter completely .
I believe that these primary documents , issued by the Chinese state , directly available from China by clicking on the links above rise to a level of evidence higher than ' allegations ' , " he writes .
" How official are these documents ?
Pretty dang official - they were issued by the General Administration of Sport of China . "
Among the points listed in the mission statement of the General Administration of Sport - the country 's peak sports body - is the following : " fighting against drug use and other unfair competition measures " .
Asked about the age controversy earlier this month , IOC President Jacques Rogge said it was not his organisation 's job to check the age of athletes .
" The IOC relies on the international federations , who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes , " he said .
Stryde
Hax posted his findings on his blog and then put out a call on Digg , a leading social news aggregator website , for others to join in the hunt for more examples - a process known as crowd sourcing .
And at least one other Digg user - a person called Karate3409 - has found corroborating evidence .
Karate3409 uncovered a cached web page on the city of Chengdu Sports Bureau 's website listing He Kexin 's birthday as January 1 , 1994 .
The original is no longer visible and returns a " Template Error " message .
Stryde Hax 's discoveries support earlier reports regarding He Kexin 's age .
Several bloggers have previously found links to news stories and photo captions - in both English and Chinese published last year and earlier this year - which refer to He as being aged 13 .
One cached version of a story published in May this year refers to her as being aged 14 .
Many of the original links and some of the cached results have since been removed .
He was at the centre of another controversy earlier this week when she edged out an American competitor for the gold medal in the women 's apparatus after a panel of judges - including Australia 's Helen Colagiuri - invoked a complicated tie - break formula used for the first time to decide an Olympic competition .
Allegations have been made that two other Chinese gymnasts , Jiang Yuyuan and Yang Yilin , have also had their ages altered in order to allow them to compete .
Yay !
Fireworks !
Howdy , folks who somehow still read my blog !
It 's been a while !
Let me tell you : a whole lot has happened since we last spoke , and I hope to catch you up with all of it .
But first , it 's the 4th of July .
And you know what that means , right ?
Fireworks .

When I was a kid , the mythical fireworks destination was spoken only in hushed tones behind the shadowiest of schoolyard simulated tugboat play - structures : Blackjack Fireworks .
Located up in Vancouver , WA ( where , like , anything is illegal , even , like , this firecracker that can blow up a medium - sized turkey , totally the same one that did you - know - what to Jimmy No- Pinky ! ) , I 'd always long to go every summer .
A couple years ago , an enterprising businessman had a great idea : " let 's take that giant empty gravel lot across the street from Blackjack — the one they do n't own — and open our own competing fireworks tent ! " TNT on the left .
Blackjack on the right .
And lo , the war of the fireworks stands began .
Here 's what it 's like driving there today .

Click to viewWhen you need something done quickly , efficiently , and without any software overhead , the command line is where it 's at .
It was the first way humans told computers what to do , but as graphics became increasingly important , the command line , or terminal , became an insiders ' secret weapon .
But with the right commands and a little bit of know - how , anyone can get things done from a text - only interface .
Let 's take a look at 10 commands and tricks that make the terminal more accessible , and more powerful , on any system .

Note : Mac OS X and Linux users have robust command line interfaces baked right into their systems .
To get to them , head to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal in Finder .
It varies in Linux , depending on your distro and interface , but a " terminal " can usually be found in an " Accessories " or " Utilities " menu panel .
Windows users are best served by installing and configuring Cygwin , a Unix emulator , which we 've detailed in a three part series .

10 . Customize your prompt
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
If you 're going to spend any time at the terminal , or want to start doing so , it should be a welcoming place .
To go beyond green or white on black , check out this Ask Lifehacker response , in which Gina runs through a few simple ways to change the colors , and the greeting message , on your prompt for Windows , Mac , or Linux systems .
9 . Force an action with sudo !! ( " bang bang " )
Advertisement
You already know that prefixing a command with sudo makes your system execute it with superuser privileges .
But when you forget to sudo , the !!
or " bang bang " comes to the rescue .
When you 've perfectly crafted a long command that does exactly what you need , hit Enter , and d'oh — you do n't have sufficient access privileges — you can sudo !! to repeat the last command with superuser privileges .
It 's the ultimate nerd triumph : " Oh , you did n't like that command ?
Well , then sudo !! "
8. Create whole directory trees with mkdir
When it comes to organizing music , pictures , documents , or other media , nested folders become a necessary annoyance — as in right - clicking , choosing " New Folder " and then naming and clicking through each of " The Beatles - > White Album -> Disc 1 . "
It 's far easier from the terminal , as the Codejacked blog points out :
mkdir The Beatles \White Album \Disc 1
Some terminal users have to add a \ before spaces , but you get the idea .
If you 're a Vista user who 's just not down with Cygwin , you can still pull this off with the md tool in command line .
Advertisement
7 . Filter huge lists with grep
Some terminal commands spit back a bit too much information , and that 's where grep comes in .
Need to manually kill a faltering Thunderbird ?
Punch in ps aux | grep bird , and you 'll get back the specific number to kill .
Need to know which files do n't have your company name in them ?
grep -v DataCorp *.doc .
Programmer Eric Wendelin explains grep more in - depth .
Advertisement
6. RTFM with man ( and more )
Advertisement
Let 's say a program , or web site , has just asked you to run a command to unlock or enable something , but you 'd like to know just a little more before jumping in .
Add man before the command ( as in man ssh ) and you 'll get manual - style pages detailing how to use the command .
Bit too much material to process ?
Try whatis for a brief description , -- help after the command for basic usage , or any of these other command - line learning tools .
5 . Manage processes with top
Most systems have a tool to view " tasks " or " running programs , " but they usually hide the true guts of what your system 's doing from you .
The Hackszine blog points out that Mac and Linux users can harness the power of the built - in top command to track and kill runaway processes making your system unstable .
There 's also ps - aux for a single - screen , non-updating look at what 's bugging your computer .
Advertisement
4 . Master wget for powerful file - grabbing
Advertisement
The wget command has been around since before there was all that much stuff to actually yank from the net , but this extensible , multi- purpose tool has lots of great uses these days .
You can mirror entire web sites locally , resume huge downloads on the flakiest of connections , download the same file every hour to keep tabs on a project , and do much , much more with wget .
It 's one of those elegantly simple tools that 's only as powerful as your creativity .
3 . Get way beyond system searching with find
Once again , programmer Eric Wendelin offers real - world examples of how powerful a command line tool like find can be in , well , finding files and directories that match the smallest criteria you can imagine .
Want a list of every HTML file that references the hexidecimal color # FF0000 ( red ) ?
find can totally do that for you .
As Wendelin points out , find , by itself , is about as convenient and powerful as a total - system searcher like Google Desktop or Quicksilver , but piped into and out of other tools like grep , it 's a powerhouse .
For a more pared - down look at some of find 's powers , check out this tutorial at Debian / Ubuntu Tips & Tricks .

2 . Set up powerful backups with rsync
Advertisement
You can spend a lot of money and time hunting down a perfect backup app that works with all your systems just the way you want .
Or you can spend a few minutes learning the basics of rsync , the flexible , powerful command that makes one folder ( on your system ) look like another ( where you back up ) .
To put it simply , rsync is a cross-platform , completely free Time Machine , if you use it right .
Luckily , Gina 's already shown us how to do that .
1 . See your most - used commands with history , make aliases for them
Advertisement
Once you 're comfortable with the terminal and getting good use from it , you might notice some of the more useful commands require an astute memory and typo - free typing — unless you make them shorter and easier .
Start off by copying and pasting this command ( on one line ) :
history|awk '{print $ 2} ' |awk ' BEGIN { FS= " | " } {print $ 1} ' |sort|uniq - c|sort -r
It will return a ranked list of your most commonly - entered commands using your command history — and you can start creating aliases to shorten them and make them easy to remember .
Or you could search through your recently - used commands with as - you - type results for quick - fire repeats .
Advertisement
While these 10 commands are generic and applicable on all systems with a Unix - like terminal , Mac OS X offers a few Mac - specific tools .
Here are useful command line tricks for Mac users .

We love to have some CLI fun around here , and we know our savvier readers have tons of cool terminal hacks and tricks that are new to us .
So , please — share the knowledge and spread the wealth in the comments .
The impact was only a matter of seconds in coming , but those seconds felt like minutes .
This was n't how it was meant to be .
It was n't how I had imagined it during my years as a Central line train driver .
We talk of " jumpers " ; workmates tell of blurry images flashing in front of them , of the shock of the impact .
I was n't expecting to see a young man in jeans and a summer shirt waiting for death , looking me in the eye .
As I hit the emergency brake , I was thinking , " Please , get out of the way .
Now .
Please let it be a prank . "
Youngsters on the track are a regular event , though no less frightening for that , and for train drivers it 's something we learn to live with .
But this was n't a typical game of " chicken " : he was n't laughing and he was n't with friends .
When it became clear he was n't going to move out of the way , I closed my eyes , covered my face and held my breath .
By the time we were stationary , four of my eight cars were in the platform and I was on autopilot .
I told the passengers there would be a delay in opening the doors due to an " incident " , and was calling the line controller for assistance when I heard a tap on my cab door .
A smart man inquired , " Do you know there 's a person under your train ? "
I looked at the blood on the windscreen momentarily before assuring him that , yes , I was aware .
He paused for a heartbeat , looked at his watch and said , " So , how long before we get on the move again ? "
I was to look back on this exchange with amusement and also , strangely , comfort : in the midst of the horror , normality was briefly restored by a commuter asking for alternative travel arrangements .
I 'd advised the passengers to stay where they were and not to try to open the doors because we were n't fully in the platform ; amazingly , they all complied .
I walked back through the carriages opening the adjoining doors and shouting : " Please leave the train , and leave the station as quickly as possible ! "
Terrorist attacks were still very much on people 's minds , and as each carriage emptied I looked to the next , seeing anxious faces through the windows .
No one tried to leave until I opened the doors .
Only a few asked the reason , none complained .
I was hugely impressed .
The next few hours were a blur of activity as the body was removed and service restored : station staff , police , firefighters , the emergency support unit and trauma counsellors all came and went in a smooth , well - practised exercise .
I was reassured that it was n't my fault , that there was nothing I could have done ; it was his choice .
All of which I knew , but it was good to hear from someone else .
As a child of the enlightenment , a rationalist and an atheist , I was sure I would n't be unduly affected by the death of a person unknown .
I was told I 'd need some time off in case of post - traumatic stress ; I agreed to counselling to assess my fitness to resume work , but was convinced this would be a formality .
My return to work was speedy and for weeks I was seemingly unaffected .
But in August a policeman came to brief me before the inquest and to show me the pictures .
The unknown person now had a name , a family and a tragic story .
Henrik Alexandersson had moved from Sweden to find work in London ; he was successful and popular , but had been unwell .
For some reason , he 'd convinced himself his illness was Aids - related and that week he had gone for a check - up to find out the truth .
By that Saturday , he could bear to wait no longer : he called his parents in such a state of distress that they booked a flight to London ( arriving just hours too late . )
He left a suicide note , and headed off for his fateful meeting with me .
Had he waited a day longer , he would have learned that the tests were negative .
I left work and went home in the full realisation that perhaps I am not such a rationalist after all , because I sobbed my heart out in the arms of my partner .
A year has passed now , but I can still see Henrik standing on the track , awaiting the inevitable .

I have an announcement I would like to make : I am a coward .
No , seriously .
Hiding in trees is what I am all about .
The brave ones went off to be paladins and stuff .
Me , I stuck to my roguish ways , stayed in the shadows , tried not to be noticed , and every now and then , I ’d poke my head out and trick some unsuspecting customer into hiring me for a gig .
This is how I operated my business .
And it actually worked decently well .
No one is expecting a sneak - attacked by a copywriter .
It ’s the perfect disguise .
I appeared , fully geared up , resume and references in hand , charm at the ready , to certain select clients I had decided beforehand would be amenable to my proposal .
It was a very roguish way to go about things .
It is also REALLY cowardly .
You ca n’t be a wuss and run your own business .
I had a little wake - up call on this the other day .
I ’ve asked the good Men with Pens to make me a website ( and a new blog , so consider this your first announcement that Rogue Ink will be relocating shortly ) , and Harry came up with a banner for me .
It is quite possibly the coolest thing that ever happened to life .
I had a small orgasm just looking at it .
It is entirely possible that I threatened to kiss Harrison , just for being the mastermind behind it .
I immediately forwarded the thing to twenty of my favorite people , and every single one of them wrote back saying , “ Dude .
What kind of virgin did you sacrifice to which unholy gods to get this banner ? ”
Look .
Is n’t it awesome ?
Okay .
So we have established that it is , in fact , awesome .
I went to bed all excited about it , dreaming blissfully of my beauteous website - to - be , and woke up in the morning with that strange feeling of doubt and guilt and possible impending doom that usually accompanies a Coyote - Ugly sort of morning - after .
I had doubts about the banner .
I suspected it was perhaps the kind of cool banner that you take home one night only to discover the next morning that he is not a good banner , he is not good for you , and he stole twenty bucks from you for whiskey .
I was gazing at the banner , which was still blissfully sleeping , looking beautiful , wondering when it was going to wake up and be a very , very bad idea .
Why ?
Because I am a coward .
I came up with some reasons why the banner was a bad idea .
That my clientele would n’t like it , that it was too aggressive , that I could n’t pull it off .
All of this was complete and utter bullshit , though .
I was scared the banner was a bad idea because I knew it would get me noticed .
Note to everyone :
You are TRYING to get noticed .
This is a good thing .
If you have roguish tendencies like me , screw them .
Consider this your biggest con .
You are playing the role of someone who loves the spotlight , in order to serve the greater you .
You have to ride the dragon , baby .
Get some balls and just do it .
Get out there .
Ride the Dragon .
Or the Purple Cow .
I just read Seth Godin ’s book Purple Cow .
Yes , I know everyone else has already discovered the magic of Seth Godin .
I am coming a little late to this party .
Why do n’t we all just celebrate my arrival and let it go , shall we ?
Excellent .
At any rate , Purple Cow .
Fun name .
Good little book .
If he ’d put it out in paperback I might have bought it .
I am not questioning the lack of paperback , for I know Seth Godin works in strange and mysterious ways his wonders to publish , I just do n’t like hardbacks and I am too broke to afford them .
So instead , I sat in one of the big cushy chairs at Barnes and Noble and read the thing cover to cover .
The Purple Cow theory , in essence , is that nobody needs normal .
Everyone wants exceptional , extraordinary , remarkable .
So freakin’ cool they wet themselves .
So why was I afraid of the banner ?
Because it was a Purple Cow .
And you have to be a special kind of rogue to ride a Purple Cow .
Seth mentions this , actually , that there are few people becoming extraordinary because it ’s scary to become extraordinary .
Which it is .
It most certainly is .
It ’s also really freakin’ cool .
An Anecdote From My Geeky Youth .
And Adulthood .
When I was sixteen , I learned to swordfight .
I was really good at it .
Naturally good , born - to - it kind of good .
Nobody had expected me to be any good at it initially , since I was tiny , blond , and a chick , so there I was on the sidelines , stealthily beating everyone , systematically .
There was a tournament at the culmination of our training , and I almost did n’t participate in it , because I was incredibly fearful that I would lose , and that all of the acclaim I ’d been getting by staying on the sidelines and only showing up to be awesome would all go away .
I did go to the tournament .
And I won .
It was glory on a stick and wrapped in bacon .
That victory led to a lot of things .
The fact that I am a swordfighter has always been one of the things that made me stand out , made me get noticed .
It was what I wrote my college entrance essay on , and it was the reason one of the admittance counselors noticed me and wanted me at University of Chicago .
It ’s a great icebreaker at parties .
It ’s a good thing to talk to hardware store guys about .
They always remember me .
That ’s the chick who swordfights .
You ca n’t BUY branding like that .
Swords have done good work for me , all my life .
And I was afraid of a banner that touted this brand that has always worked for me .
That ’s just dumb .
It ’s unforgettable .
It ’s exciting and daring and memorable .
And I ’d be a damn fool not to keep using it , scary as the idea is .
There is a moral to this story .
Harrison was very sweet about the whole Tei - is - being - a- wuss thing , and quoted Polonius at me .
I will not do this to you , because I believe in wielding Shakespeare in a wrathful manner , not a comforting one .
The moral of the story , therefore , does not come out of the Bard ’s mouth , it comes out of mine :
Do not be a wuss .
It is bad for you .
Thank you .

Ride the Purple Cow .
More than a century after being cut from the official roster , golf is making a triumphant return to the Summer Olympics in Rio .
Rugby , too — which has n't been on the program since 1924 — is an Olympic sport again .
The International Olympic Committee has slashed a number of sports over the years , not all of which have gotten a second chance at gold medal glory .
Here are 10 of them .
1. TUG OF WAR
Unlike some of other discontinued Olympic sports , tug of war had a fair amount of staying power ; it made the program for every Olympics between 1900 and 1920 .
The sport was played in pretty much the same way you remember it from your grade - school field days , but it was also a magnet for Olympic controversies .
The 1904 gold medal - winning American squad was ostensibly representing the Milwaukee Athletic Club , which was terrific until further research established that the team was actually composed of ringers recruited from Chicago .
Scandal struck again at the 1908 Games when the American squad protested that the police boots worn by the British pullers from the Liverpool Police team were equipped with illegal cleats for extra traction .
When the protest failed , the American pullers left the Games in a huff .
All told , the British teams grabbed five medals to the Americans ' three before the sport fell off the program following the 1920 Games .
2. CRICKET
Cricket made both its Olympic debut and swan song at the second modern Games , held in 1900 in Paris .
( Organizers originally wanted to have a cricket tournament at the 1896 Games , but the event did n't draw enough entries . )
Things got off to a rough start when the Belgian and Dutch teams withdrew from the field prior to the start of play , leaving just a British touring team , the Devon and Somerset Wanderers , to take on the French Athletic Club Union 's squad .
The teams apparently were n't even aware they were playing in the Olympics ; they thought the two - day match was just a part of the World 's Fair Paris was hosting at the time .
According to one contemporary report , the teams squared off in a cycling arena fit for 20,000 spectators but had only a dozen soldiers as an audience .
The English side won the match and received silver medals and miniature Eiffel Towers for their trouble ; the French team got bronze medals .
Everyone returned home without knowing they had been Olympians , and it was n't until the IOC sat down to make a comprehensive record of the Games in 1912 that the two squads received official recognition as gold and silver medalists in cricket .
The sport never returned to the Games .
3. BASQUE PELOTA
The Paris Games of 1900 saw more than one sport make its sole Olympic appearance ( at least officially ) .
Basque pelota , a sport with ancient roots in which teams of two players use a curved basket to fling a ball against a wall in a racquetball - like game , made the Olympic program for Paris .
Unfortunately , like cricket , participation was a bit of a downer ; only two teams showed up .
The duo from Spain , where the sport enjoys great popularity , beat a French pair in the sole Olympic Basque pelota match to claim the gold medals .
The final score of the match is lost to history .
4. CROQUET
Like cricket and Basque pelota , croquet only saw action at the 1900 Paris Games before fading into Olympic oblivion .
The host Frenchmen made the most of the opportunity , though ; they claimed all seven medals awarded in the sport .
Records are sketchy , but it would seem that across the three events , nine of the 10 competitors were French , which probably facilitated their dominance .
5. ROQUE
Give yourself 50 bonus points if you know what roque is .
The sport is a croquet variant played with short mallets on a hard rolled - sand court with a wall off of which players can bank the balls .
The sport 's official rules tout it as " the most scientific outdoor sport in existence , "  but it did n't hold up so well at the Olympics .
Roque debuted at the 1904 Games in St. Louis , Americans swept the medals , and the sport promptly disappeared .
6. JEU DE PAUME
Jeu de paume , or " real tennis , "  is a tennis precursor that was originally played without racquets — players hit the ball with their hands .
By the 1908 Games in London , the sport had evolved to the point where small racquets played a key role , but the largely indoor variant remained separate from what we think of as tennis , which was also played at the Games under the name " lawn tennis . " 
American railroad scion Jay Gould II claimed the gold , and Charles Sands , who won the gold in golf in 1900 , competed but lost in the first round .
" Real tennis "  made a brief reappearance as a demonstration sport at the 1924 Games before fading away .
7. LACROSSE
Despite lacrosse 's relative popularity in the English - speaking world , it never really caught on as an Olympic sport .
It made the program in the 1904 and 1908 Games , and since only five teams combined entered the event over the two Games , every team that played won a medal .
Canada won both golds and a bronze ( they sent two teams in 1904 ) , while American and British teams claimed the two silvers , respectively .
Lacrosse was a demonstration sport at the 1928 , 1932 , and 1948 Games , but it never regained its medal status ( though lacrosse players and enthusiasts are working hard to change that ) .
8. RACKETS
If you have n't noticed a pattern yet , it 's worth pointing out that if you hosted an early set of Games , you could pretty much railroad whatever sport you wanted to onto the program to help your countrymen get medals .
The rackets competition at the 1908 Games in London was no exception ; every single entrant was British .
The sport itself is very similar to squash , which originated as an offshoot of rackets in the 19th century , and remains popular in the UK .
The seven - man all - British field included John Jacob Astor V of the famed Astor family ; he won a gold in doubles and a bronze in singles competition .
9. POLO
Apparently the Olympics could never quite figure out how to handle polo , as it popped on and off the program throughout the first 40 years of the modern Games .
Polo was a medal sport at five different Games , with competitions appearing in 1900 , 1908 , 1920 , 1924 , and 1936 .
Only the British team competed in all of these Games and won a total of six medals , including three gold .
10 . WATER MOTORSPORTS
Motorboat racing first appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1900 Games , and in 1908 it received full medal status .
Captains in three classes were set to race five laps around an eight - nautical - mile course in the only Olympic event to ever involve motors .
However , the English weather did n't feel like complying and whipped up a ferocious gale .
Two boats entered each class , but due to the terrible weather , boats started to fill with water , ran aground , suffered engine problems , and had to quit .
As a result , only one boat finished each race , meaning that the only Olympic water motorsports medals ever handed out were gold .
The British boat Gyrinus won two of the races .
Some days I fall victim to the green noise syndrome ; I ’m so overloaded by the green options all around me I do n’t know where to go .
Bath and cleaning products are one place I always thought I had it right .
If I buy the organic , I ’m good to go .
Or am I ?
I just learned last week that in March , Seventh Generation , Method , and other companies that produced green cleaning products were under scrutiny by the Organic Consumers Association .
When testing around a hundred “ cosmetic , personal care and household cleaning formulas , [ the Association ] found that nearly 50 % of them contained detectable levels of 1,4 - dioxane , which is known to cause cancer in lab animals . ”
Method , Planet Ultra and Seventh Generation ’s “ natural ” dish cleaning products were among those products that tested positive .
All manufacturer ’s who tested for 1,4 were asked to remove their “ organic ” and “ natural ” labels or they ’d face a lawsuit .
Just when I thought I was cleaning consciously , I have to go through another round of making change in my lifestyle .
My confusion about what to buy got even greater this week when I found out California was taking more “ organic ” companies to court .
Avalon ( Alba ) , Nutribiotic and Whole Foods are all facing penalties for producing products containing 1,4 - dioxane , too .
Present in most common bath / body / cleaning products , 1,4 - dixoane is not only a carcinogen but has been shown to cause liver and kidney damage simply by “ breathing , ingesting ” or touching it .
If you ’re wondering , like I was , who is a safe choice to buy these days , Burt ’s Bees , Clorox Green Works and Dr. Bronner ’s all tested 1,4 free .
See the results of the 1,4 test here .
Overweight mothers give birth to offspring who become even heavier , resulting in amplification of obesity across generations , said Baylor College of Medicine researchers in Houston who found that chemical changes in the ways genes are expressed -- a phenomenon called epigenetics -- could affect successive generations of mice .
" There is an obesity epidemic in the United States and it's increasingly recognized as a worldwide phenomenon , " said Dr. Robert A. Waterland , assistant professor of pediatrics -- nutrition at BCM and lead author of the study that appears in the International Journal of Obesity .
" Why is everyone getting heavier and heavier ?
One hypothesis is that maternal obesity before and during pregnancy affects the establishment of body weight regulatory mechanisms in her baby .
Maternal obesity could promote obesity in the next generation . "
Waterland and his colleagues studied the effect of maternal obesity in three generations of genetically identical mice , all with the same genetic tendency to overeat .
One group of mice received a standard diet ; the other a diet supplemented with the nutrients folic acid , vitamin B12 , betaine and choline .
The special ' methyl supplemented ' diet enhances DNA methylation , a chemical reaction that silences genes .
" We wanted to know if , even among genetically identical mice , maternal obesity would promote obesity in her offspring , and if the methyl supplemented diet would affect this process , " said Waterland .
" Indeed , those on the regular diet got fatter and fatter with each generation .
Those in the supplemented group , however , did not . "
" We think DNA methylation may play an important role in the development of the hypothalamus ( the region of the brain that regulates appetite ) , " said Waterland .
" Twenty years ago , it was proposed that just as genetic mutations can cause cancer , so too might aberrant epigenetic marks -- so called ' epimutations . '
That idea is now largely accepted and the field of cancer epigenetics is very active .
I would make the same statement for obesity .
We are on the cusp of understanding that , " he said .
Waterland is also a researcher at the USDA / ARS Children 's Nutrition Research Center at BCM and Texas Children 's Hospital .
Others who contributed to this research include Kajal Tahiliani , Marie - Therese Rached and Sherin Mirza of Baylor College of Medicine and the USDA / ARS Children 's Nutrition Research Center in Houston and Michael Travisano of the University of Minnesota in St. Paul .
Funding for this work came from the National Institutes of Health , the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
When it comes to discussing the Second Amendment , liberals check at the door their ability to think rationally .
In discussing the importance of any other portion of the Bill of Rights , liberals can quote legal precedent , news reports , and exhaustive studies .
They can talk about the intentions of the Founding Fathers .
And they will , almost without exception , conclude the necessity of respecting , and not restricting , civil liberties .
So why do liberals have such a problem with the Second Amendment ?
Why do they lump all gun owners in the category of " gun nuts " ?
Why do they complain about the " radical extremist agenda of the NRA " ?
Why do they argue for greater restrictions ?
Why do they start performing mental gymnastics worthy of a position in Bush 's Department of Justice to rationalize what they consider " reasonable " infringement of one of our most basic , fundamental , and revolutionary -- that 's right , revolutionary -- civil liberties ?
Why do they pursue these policies at the risk of alienating voters who might otherwise vote Democrat ?
Why are they so dismissive of approximately 40 % of American households that own one or more guns ?
And why is their approach to the Second Amendment so different from their approach to all the others ?
Well , if conversations on this blog about the issue of guns are in any way indicative of the way other liberals feel , maybe this stems from a basic misunderstanding .
So , allow me to attempt to explain the Second Amendment in a way that liberals should be able to endorse .
No .
1 : The Bill of Rights protects individual rights .
If you 've read the Bill of Rights -- and who among us has n't ?
-- you will notice a phrase that appears in nearly all of them : " the people . "
First Amendment :
... the right of the people peaceably to assemble
Fourth Amendment :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects ...
Ninth Amendment :
... shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
Tenth Amendment :
... are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .
Certainly , no good liberal would argue that any of these rights are collective rights , and not individual rights .
We believe that the First Amendment is an individual right to criticize our government .
We would not condone a state - regulated news organization .
We certainly would not condone state regulation of religion .
We talk about " separation of church and state , " although there is no mention of " separation of church and state " in the First Amendment .
But we know what they meant .
The anti-Federalists would not ratify the Constitution without a Bill of Rights ; they intended for it to be interpreted expansively .
We know the Founding Fathers intended for us to be able to say damn near anything we want , protest damn near anything we want , print damn near anything we want , and believe damn near anything we want .
Individually , without the interference or regulation of government .
So why , then , do liberals stumble at the idea of the Second Amendment as an individual right ?
Why do they talk about it as a collective right , as if the Founding Fathers intended an entirely different meaning by the phrase " the right of the people " in the Second Amendment , when we are so positively clear about what they meant by the exact same phrase in the First Amendment ?
If we can agree that the First Amendment protects not only powerful organizations such as the New York Times or MSNBC , but also the individual commenter on the internet , the individual at the anti-war rally , the individual driving the car with the " Fuck Bush " bumper sticker , can we not also agree that the Second Amendment 's use of " the people " has the same meaning ?
But it 's different !
The Second Amendment is talking about the militia !
If you want to " bear arms , " join the National Guard !
Right ?
Wrong .
The United States Militia Code :
(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able - bodied males at least 17 years of age and , except as provided in section 313 of title 32 , under 45 years of age who are , or who have made a declaration of intention to become , citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard .
( b) The classes of the militia are —
(1 ) the organized militia , which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia ; and
( 2 ) the unorganized militia , which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia .
Aside from the fact that the National Guard did not exist in the 1700s , the term " militia " does not mean " National Guard , " even today .
The code clearly states that two classes comprise the militia : the National Guard and Naval Militia , and everyone else .
Everyone else .
Individuals .
The People .
No .
2 : We oppose restrictions to our civil liberties .
All of our rights , even the ones enumerated in the Bill of Rights , are restricted .
You can't shout " Fire ! " in a crowd .
You ca n't threaten to kill the president .
You can't publish someone else 's words as your own .
We have copyright laws and libel laws and slander laws .
We have the FCC to regulate our radio and television content .
We have plenty of restrictions on our First Amendment rights .
But we do n't like them .
We fight them .
Any card - carrying member of the ACLU will tell you that while we might agree that some restrictions are reasonable , we keep a close eye whenever anyone in government gets an itch to pass a new law that restricts our First Amendment rights .
Or our Fourth .
Or our Fifth , Sixth , or Eighth .
We complain about free speech zones .
The whole country is supposed to be a free speech zone , after all .
It says so right in the First Amendment .
But when it comes to the Second Amendment ... You could hear a pin drop for all the protest you 'll get from liberals when politicians talk about further restrictions on the manufacture , sale , or possession of firearms .
Suddenly , overly broad restrictions are " reasonable . "
The Washington D.C. ban on handguns -- all handguns -- is reasonable .
( Later this year , the Supreme Court will quite likely issue an opinion to the contrary in the Heller case . )
Would we tolerate such a sweeping regulation of , say , the Thirteenth Amendment ?
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
What if a politician -- say , a Republican from a red state in the south -- were to introduce a bill that permits enslaving black women ?
Would we consider that reasonable ?
It 's not like the law would enslave all people , or even all black people .
Just the women .
There 's no mention of enslaving women in the Thirteenth Amendment .
Clearly , when Lincoln wanted to free the slaves , he did n't intend to free all the slaves .
And we restrict all the other Amendments , so obviously the Thirteenth Amendment is not supposed to be absolute .
What 's the big deal ?
Ridiculous , right ?
We 'd take to the streets , we 'd send angry letters to our representatives in Washington , we 'd call our progressive radio programs to quote , verbatim , the Thirteenth Amendment .
Quite bluntly , although not literally , we'd be up in arms .
( Yeah , pun intended . )
And yet ... A ban on all handguns seems reasonable to many liberals .
Never mind that of 192 million firearms in America , 65 million -- about one third -- are handguns .
This hardly seems consistent .
No .
3 : It 's not 1776 anymore .
When the Founding Fathers , in their infinite wisdom , drafted the Bill of Rights , they could not have imagined machine guns .
Or armor - piercing bullets ( which are not available to the public anyway , and are actually less lethal than conventional ammunition ) .
Or handguns that hold 18 rounds .
A drive - by shooting , back in 1776 , would have been a guy on a horse with a musket .
Of course , they could n't have imagined the internet , either .
But do we question the right of our gracious host , Markos , to say whatever the hell he wants on his blog ?
( The wisdom , perhaps , but not the right . )
Similarly , the Founding Fathers could not have imagined 24 - hour cable news networks .
When they drafted the First Amendment , did they really mean to protect the rights of Bill O'Reilly to make incredibly stupid , and frequently inaccurate , statements for an entire hour , five nights a week ?
Actually , yes .
They did .
Bill O'Reilly bilious ravings , and Keith Olbermann 's Special Comments , and Bill Moyer 's analysis of the corruption of the Bush Administration , and the insipid chatter of the entire cast of the Today show are , and were intended to be , protected by the First Amendment .
We liberals are supposed to understand that just because we do n't agree with something does n't mean it is not protected .
At least when it comes to the First Amendment .
But as for the Second Amendment ?
When discussing the Second Amendment , liberals become obtuse in their literalism .
The Second Amendment does not protect the right to own all guns .
Or all ammunition .
It does n't protect the right of the people as individuals .
Liberals will defend the right of Cindy Sheehan to wear an anti-war T - shirt , even though the First Amendment says nothing about T - shirts .
They will defend the right of citizens to attend a Bush rally wearing an anti-Bush button , even though the First Amendment says nothing about buttons .
They will defend the rights of alleged terrorists to a public trial , even though , when writing the Sixth Amendment , the Founding Fathers certainly could not have imagined a world in which terrorists would plot to blow up building with airplanes .
The notion of airplanes would have shocked most of them ( with the possible exception of Thomas Jefferson .
He was always inventing things . )
No .
4 : It 's not like you can use it anyway .
Fine , you say .
Have your big , scary guns .
It 's not like you actually stand a chance in fighting against the United States government .
The Army has bigger , badder weapons than any private citizen .
Your most deadly gun is no match for their tanks , their helicopters , their atom bombs .
Maybe two hundred years ago , citizens stood a chance in a fight against government , but not today .
The Second Amendment is obsolete .
Tell that to the USSR , held at bay for about six years by pissed off Afghanis with WWI rifles .
Tell that to the Iraqi " insurgents " who are putting up a pretty good fight against our military might with fairly primitive weapons .
The Second Amendment is obsolete ?
What other rights might be considered obsolete in today 's day and age ?
No Soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the Owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .
When was the last time a soldier showed up at your door and said , " I 'll be staying with you for the indefinite future " ?
I 'm guessing it 's been a while .
But of course , were it to happen , you 'd dust off your Third Amendment and say , " I do n't think so , pal . "
And you 'd be right .
And has n't our current administration made the Sixth Amendment obsolete ?
In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense .
Shall we ask all of those " unlawful combatants " whether the Sixth Amendment still applies ?
The President merely has to categorize you as an " unlawful combatant , " and whoosh !
No more rights to a speedy and public trial , an impartial jury , or even knowledge of the charges and identification of the witnesses who will testify against you .
With one fell swoop of the pen , the President can suspend your Sixth Amendment rights .
Since it has no effect , whenever the President feels like it , why do we even need the Sixth Amendment anymore ?
What about the Twenty - Sixth Amendment ?
How much use does that get ?
The right of citizens of the United States , who are eighteen years of age or older , to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age .
We all know the youth vote is typically pretty abysmal .
Those lazy kids can barely get out of bed before noon , let alone get themselves to the voting booth .
If they 're not going to use their Twenty - Sixth Amendment rights , should n't we just delete the damn thing altogether ?
Of course not !
I voted when I was eighteen , and I was proud to do so .
In fact , most liberals will argue for greater enfranchisement .
They support the rights of convicted felons to vote .
Liberals are all about getting out the vote and rocking the vote .
They sit at tables at their local farmer 's market , trying to register new voters .
They make calls to likely voters , even offering to give them a lift to the polling station .
For liberals , the Twenty - Sixth Amendment ( for teens ) , the Fifteenth Amendment ( for blacks ) , and the Nineteenth Amendment ( for women ) barely scratch the surface .
But the Second Amendment ?
Crickets .
Or , worse , loud calls for greater restrictions .
More laws .
Less access .
Regulate , regulate , regulate -- until the Second Amendment is nearly regulated out of existence because no one needs to have a gun anyway .
And that , sadly , is the biggest mistake of all .
Because , to paraphrase a recent comment by mlandman :
The Second Amendment is not about hunting or even guns anymore than the First Amendment is about quill pens and hand - set type .
We do not quibble about the methods by which we practice our First Amendment rights because that is not the point .
And red herring arguments about types of ammunition or handguns versus rifles ( even scary looking ones ) are just that -- red herrings .
They distract us from what is at the true meaning of the Second Amendment .
And that brings me to my final point .
No .
5 : The Second Amendment is about revolution .
In no other country , at no other time , has such a right existed .
It is not the right to hunt .
It is not the right to shoot at soda cans in an empty field .
It is not even the right to shoot at a home invader in the middle of the night .
It is the right of revolution .
Let me say that again :
It is the right of revolution .
Consider the words of that most forward thinking of Founding Fathers , Thomas Jefferson :
The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government .
Tyranny in government .
That was Mr. Jefferson 's concern .
And he spoke from experience , of course .
He knew the Revolutionary War was not won with hand - painted banners or people chanting slogans .
It was a long and bloody war of attrition where the colonials took on the biggest military machine in the world .
And we all know how that turned out .
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it , and to institute new government .
To alter or abolish the government .
These are not mild words ; they are powerful .
They are revolutionary .
Mr. Jefferson might never have imagined automatic weapons .
But he probably also never imagined a total ban on handguns either .
The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it .
We talk about the First Amendment as a unique and revolutionary concept -- that we have the right to criticize our government .
Does it matter whether we do so while standing on a soapbox on the corner of the street , or on a blog ?
No .
Because the concept , not the methodology , is what matters .
And the Second Amendment is no different .
We liberals tend to get bogged down in the details at the expense of being able to understand , and appreciate , the larger idea .
The Second Amendment is not about how much ammunition is " excessive . "
Or what kinds of guns are and are not permissible .
We should have learned by now that prohibition is ineffective .
That 's why we repealed the Eighteenth Amendment , prohibiting the " manufacture , sale , or transportation of intoxicating liquors . "
It did n't work .
That 's why our War on Drugs has been such an utter failure .
Prohibition does not prevent people from smoking pot ; it just turns pot smokers into criminals .
( And what would our hemp - growing Founding Fathers think of that ? )
And so it is with gun laws .
They certainly do n't prevent gun crimes .
A total ban on handguns in DC has hardly eliminated violent crimes in DC .
Although it may be correlation , rather than causation , crime tends to be lower in areas with more guns .
After Florida and Texas passed concealed carry laws , crime rates went down .
So .
What is the point ?
Is this a rallying cry for liberals to rush right out and purchase a gun ?
Absolutely not .
Guns are dangerous when used by people who are not trained to use them , just as cars are dangerous when driven by people who have not been taught how to drive .
No , this is a rallying cry for the Constitution .
For the Bill of Rights .
For all of our rights .
This is an appeal to every liberal who says , " I just do n't like guns . "
This is an appeal to every liberal who says , " No one needs that much ammunition . "
This is an appeal to every liberal who says , " That 's not what the Founding Fathers meant . "
This is an appeal to every liberal who says , " Columbine and Virginia Tech prove we need more laws . "
This is an appeal to every liberal who supports the ACLU .
This is an appeal to every liberal who has complained about the Bush Administration 's trading of our civil liberties for the illusion of greater security .
( I believe I ’ve seen a T - shirt or two about Benjamin Franklin ’s thoughts on that . )
This is an appeal to every liberal who believes in fighting against the abuses of government , against the infringement of our civil liberties , and for the greater expansion of our rights .
This is an appeal to every liberal who thinks , despite some poor judgment on the issues of , say , slavery or women 's suffrage , the Founding Fathers actually had pretty good ideas about limiting government power and expanding individual rights .
This is an appeal to every liberal who never wants to lose another election to Republicans because they have successfully persuaded the voters that Democrats will take their guns away .
This is an appeal to you , my fellow liberals .
Not merely to tolerate the Second Amendment , but to embrace it .
To love it and defend it and guard it as carefully as you do all the others .
Because we are liberals .
And fighting for our rights -- for all of our rights , for all people -- is what we do .
Because we are revolutionaries .

The Crown of the Sun
Credit & Copyright : Hartwig Luethen
Explanation : During a total solar eclipse , the Sun 's extensive outer atmosphere , or corona , is an inspirational sight .
The subtle shades and shimmering features of the corona that engage the eye span a brightness range of over 10,000 to 1 , making them notoriously difficult to capture in a single picture .
But this composite of 28 digital images ranging in exposure time from 1/1000 to 2 seconds comes close to revealing the crown of the Sun in all its glory .
The telescopic views were recorded near Kochenevo , Russia during the August 1 total solar eclipse and also show solar prominences extending just beyond the edge of the eclipsed sun .
Remarkably , features on the dark near side of the New Moon can also be made out , illuminated by sunlight reflected from a Full Earth .
Recently , the two men who want to be next president of the United States appeared in a televised two - hour forum on faith , hosted by megachurch minister Rick Warren .
Religion has been problematic for both candidates in their campaigns .
Barack Obama 's pastor , Rev. Jeremiah
Wright , made controversial , conspiracy - laden statements about AIDS and racism , while John McCain ’s spiritual advisor Rod Parsley claimed that America 's " divine purpose " is to destroy Islam , which he considers a " false religion . "
Still , it 's not hard to see why the pair participated :
The so - called Faith Forum had important political implications , as both candidates court conservative Christian voters .
Yet the bigger story is another , lesser - known debate — one that transcends faith or politics .
The debate , slated for April 18 in Philadelphia , was arranged by ScienceDebate 2008 , a bipartisan group of Nobel laureates and other scholars who want to bring science to the fore of public discussion .
The idea of a science debate is supported by virtually every scientific organization in the country , including the National Academy of Sciences .
The reason you probably have n't heard about the Science Debate is that it did n't happen .
None of the candidates accepted .
They found time for other public forums , including the Faith Forum , and a " Compassion Forum , " but when it came to science — the very engine that drives America 's technology — the candidates were conspicuously silent .
Discussions of faith and compassion are fine , but solutions to the serious problems facing our nation and indeed the planet can only be found in science .
It ’s not clear why the candidates did n’t participate .
Perhaps they felt that they were n't well - versed enough in science to really discuss it , lest the forum turn into an embarrassing , gaffe - riddled version of " Jeopardy ! "
Perhaps they think science is n’t sexy , and assumed that they should focus on more fundamental issues like the Iraq war , energy shortages , and the economy .
What they do n't seem to understand is that science underlies all those issues , and many more .
America needs a science - literate president now more than ever .
Both Obama and McCain are intelligent people , but neither seems to recognize the importance of science to the future of our country .
The point is not to ask the candidates to explain Faraday 's law of induction , or know the difference between mitosis and meiosis , but a basic understanding of what science is , and how it works , is essential to creating good laws and public policy .
It 's not too late ; Obama and McCain can still have a Science Debate before the election if they realize how important science is .
After all , our energy and environmental problems ca n’t be solved with hot air .

( CNN ) --
The California Supreme Court struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage Thursday , saying sexual orientation , like race or gender , " does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights . "
Gay couple John Lewis , left , and Stuart Gaffney celebrate outside the California Supreme Court on Thursday .
In a 4 - 3 120 - page ruling issue , the justices wrote that " responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individual 's sexual orientation . "
" We therefore conclude that in view of the substance and significance of the fundamental constitutional right to form a family relationship , the California Constitution properly must be interpreted to guarantee this basic civil right to all Californians , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples , " Chief Justice Ronald George wrote for the majority .
The ruling takes effect in 30 days .
Watch what the ruling means »
Several gay and lesbian couples , along with the city of San Francisco and gay rights groups , filed a lawsuit saying they were victims of unlawful discrimination .
A lower court ruled San Francisco acted unlawfully in issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
The ruling surprised legal experts because the court has a reputation for being conservative .
Six of its seven judges are Republican appointees .
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said he is " profoundly grateful " for the decision and for the court 's " eloquence " in its delivery .
" After four long years , we 're very , very gratified , " he said .
Shannon Minter , attorney for one of the plaintiffs in the case , the National Center for Lesbian Rights , called the ruling " a moment of pure happiness and joy for so many families in California . "
" California sets the tone , and this will have a huge effect across the nation to bringing wider acceptance for gay and lesbian couples , " he said .
Neil Giuliano , president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , issued a statement saying , " Today 's ruling affirms that committed couples , gay and straight , should not be denied the duties , obligations and protections of marriage .
...
This decision is a vital affirmation to countless California couples -- straight and gay -- who want to make and have made a lifelong commitment to take care of and be responsible for each other . "
Groups opposing same - sex marriage also reacted strongly to the ruling .
" The California Supreme Court has engaged in the worst kind of judicial activism today , abandoning its role as an objective interpreter of the law and instead legislating from the bench , " said Matt Barber , policy director for cultural issues for the group Concerned Women for America , in a written statement .
" So - called ' same - sex ' marriage is counterfeit marriage .
Marriage is , and has always been , between a man and a woman .
We know that it's in the best interest of children to be raised with a mother and a father .
To use children as guinea pigs in radical San Francisco - style social experimentation is deplorable . "
The organization said that a constitutional marriage amendment should be placed on the November ballot and that national efforts should be made to generate a federal marriage amendment .
" The decision must be removed from the hands of judicial activists and returned to the rightful hands of the people , " Barber said .
A constitutional amendment initiative specifying that marriage is only between a man and a woman is awaiting verification by the secretary of state 's office after its sponsors said they had gathered enough signatures to place it on the statewide ballot .
The parties cannot appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , Herrera said , as federal courts do not have jurisdiction over the state laws .
" This is the final say , " he said .
In a dissenting opinion , Associate Justice Marvin Baxter wrote that although he agrees with some of the majority 's conclusions , the court was overstepping its bounds in striking down the ban .
Instead , he wrote , the issue should be left to the voters .
In 2004 , San Francisco officials allowed gay couples in the city to wed , prompting a flood of applicants crowding the city hall clerk 's office .
The first couple to wed then was 80 - year - old Phyllis Lyon and 83 - year - old Dorothy Martin , lovers for 50 years .
" We have a right just like anyone else to get married to the person we want to get married to , " Lyon said at the time .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom called the ruling a victory not just for the city " but for literally millions of people .
...
What the court did is simply affirm their lives . "
CNN 's Ted Rowlands reported that " huge cheers " went up in San Francisco when the ruling was announced .
In California , a 2000 voter referendum banned same - sex marriage , but state lawmakers have made two efforts to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed .
Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed both bills .
" I respect the court 's decision and as governor , I will uphold its ruling , " Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued Thursday .
" Also , as I have said in the past , I will not support an amendment to the constitution that would overturn this state Supreme Court ruling . "
Massachusetts legalized same - sex marriages in 2004 , and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed .
However , then - Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners ' home state .
Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts , Rhode Island or New Mexico may marry in the state , unless the marriage partners say they intend to relocate to Massachusetts after the marriage .
New Hampshire , Vermont , New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions , and California has a domestic - partner registration law .
More than a dozen other states give gay couples some legal rights , as do some other countries .
Check the law in different states »
" It 's a throwaway line , but I think it 's true :
As California goes , so goes the rest of the nation , " Newsom said .
" And I do n't think people should be paranoid about that .
...
Look what happened in Massachusetts a number of years ago .
Massachusetts is doing just fine .
The state is doing wonderfully . "
The state law in question in the case , which consolidated six cases , was the Defense of Marriage Act , Proposition 22 .
Oral arguments in March lasted more than three hours .
" There can be no doubt that extending the designation of marriage to same - sex couples , rather than denying it to all couples , is the equal protection remedy that is most consistent with our state 's general legislative policy and preference , " the ruling said .
" Accordingly , in light of the conclusions we reach concerning the constitutional questions brought to us for resolution , we determine that the language of Section 300 limiting the designation of marriage to a ' union between a man and a woman ' is unconstitutional , and that the remaining statutory language must be understood as making the designation of marriage available to both opposite - sex and same - sex couples . "
Newsom compared the ruling to the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Virginia case overturning that state 's ban on interracial marriage .
" This is about civil marriage .
This is about fundamental rights , " he said .
The ruling may make the same - sex marriage issue more important in November elections .
Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain supports " traditional " marriage but opposes a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , saying individual states should decide the issue .
He also backs some legal benefits for same - sex couples .
Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton both oppose same - sex marriage but support civil unions .
They also oppose a constitutional ban .

The last few weeks have been base - heavy ones in the news .
The Pentagon ’s provisional Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC ) list , the first in a decade , was published to domestic screams of pain .
It represents , according to the Washington Post , “ a sweeping plan to close or reduce forces at 62 major bases and nearly 800 minor facilities ” in the United States .
The military is to be reorganized at home around huge , multi-force “ hub bases ” from which the Pentagon , in the fashion of a corporate conglomerate , hopes to “ reap economies of scale . ”
This was front page news for days as politicians and communities from Connecticut ( the U.S. Naval Submarine Base in Groton ) and New Jersey ( Fort Monmouth ) to South Dakota ( Ellsworth Air Force Base ) cried bloody murder over the potential loss of jobs and threatened to fight to the death to prevent their specific base or set of bases ( but not anyone else ’s ) from closing — after all , those workers had been the most productive and patriotic around .
These closings — and their potentially devastating after - effects on communities — were a reminder ( though seldom dealt with that way in the media ) of just how deeply the Pentagon has dug itself into the infrastructure of our nation .
With over 6,000 military bases in the U.S. , we are in some ways a vast military camp .
But while politicians screamed locally , Donald Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon never thinks less than globally ; and , if you throw in the militarization of space , sometimes even the global has proven too small a framework for its presiding officials .
For them , the BRAC plans are just one piece of a larger puzzle that involves the projection of American power into the distant lands that most concern us .
After all , as Chalmers Johnson has calculated in his book , The Sorrows of Empire , our global Baseworld already consists of at least 700 military and intelligence bases ; possibly — depending on how you count them up — many more .
Under Rumsfeld ’s organizational eye , such bases have been pushed ever further into the previously off - limits “ near abroad ” of the former Soviet Union ( where we now probably have more bases than the Russians do ) and ever deeper into the Middle Eastern and Caspian oil heartlands of the planet .
The Bush administration ’s fierce focus on and interest in reconfigured , stripped down , ever more forward systems of bases and an ever more powerfully poised military “ footprint ” stands in inverse proportion to press coverage of it .
To the present occupants of the Pentagon , bases are the equivalent of imperial America ’s lifeblood and yet basing policy abroad has , in recent years , been of next to no interest to the mainstream media .
Strategic Ally
Just in recent weeks , however , starting with the uproar over the economic pain BRAC will impose ( along with the economic gain for those “ hubs ” ) , bases have returned to public consciousness in at least a modest way .
This month , for instance , the Overseas Basing Commission released a report to the President and Congress on the “ reconfiguration of the American military overseas basing structure in the post - Cold War and post - September 11 era . ”
The report created a minor flap by criticizing the Pentagon for its overly ambitious global redeployment plans at a time when “ [ s ] ervice budgets are not robust enough to execute the repositioning of forces , build the facilities necessary to accommodate the forces , [ and ] build the expanding facilities at new locations ? ”
In other words , the global ambitions of the Pentagon — and the soaring budgets that go with those ambitions — are beyond our means ( not that that means much to the Bush administration ) .
The report ’s criticism evidently irritated Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and so the report , already posted at a government website , was promptly taken down after the Defense Department claimed it contained classified information , especially “ a reference to ongoing negotiations over U.S. bases in Bulgaria and Romania . ”
( As it happened , the Federation of American Scientists had posted the report at its own site , where it remains available to all , according to Secrecy News . )
Perhaps in part because of BRAC and the Commission report , numerous bits and pieces of Pentagon basing plans — even for normally invisible Romania and Bulgaria — could be spied in ( or at the edge of ) the news .
For instance , last week our man in Kabul , President Hamid Karzai , came calling on Washington , amid some grim disputes between “ friends . ”
On the eve of his departure , reacting to a New York Times ’ article about a U.S. Army report on the torture , abuse and murder of Afghan prisoners in American hands , he essentially demanded that the Bush administration turn over Afghan prisoners , both in - country and in Guantánamo , to his government , and give it greater say in U.S. military operations in his country .
For anyone who has followed the Bush administration , these are not just policy no - no ’s but matters verging on faith - based obsession .
Having with dogged determination bucked the International Criminal Court , an institution backed by powerful allies , Bush officials were not about to stand for such demands from a near non-nation we had “ liberated ” and then stocked with military bases , holding areas , detention camps , and prisons of every sort .
Not long after Karzai made this demand , “ an American official alarmed at the slow pace of poppy eradication ” leaked to the New York Times a cable written from our Kabul embassy to Secretary of State Rice on May 13 indicating that his weak leadership — previously he had only been lauded by administration officials — was responsible for Afghanistan ’s rise to preeminence as the model drug - lord - state of the planet .
( “ Although President Karzai has been well aware of the difficulty in trying to implement an effective ground [ poppy ] eradication program , he has been unwilling to assert strong leadership , even in his own province of Kandahar . ” )
And then , of course , State Department officials publicly came to his defense .
On arrival in the U.S. , he found himself refuting this charge rather than on the offensive demanding the rectification of American wrongs in his country .
At a White House welcoming ceremony , our President promptly publicly denied Karzai the Afghan prisoners and any further control over American military actions in his country .
As in Iraq , the Bush administration ’s working definition of “ sovereignty ” for others is : Stay out of our way .
( “ As I explained to [ President Karzai ] , that our policy is one where we want the people to be sent home [ from Guantánamo ] , but , two , we ’ve got to make sure the facilities are there — facilities where these people can be housed and fed and guarded . ” )
But the Afghan president was granted something so much more valuable — this was , after all , the essence of his trek to the U.S. — a “ strategic partnership ” with the United States which he “ requested . ”
( The actual language : “ Afghanistan proposed that the United States join in a strategic partnership and establish close cooperation . ” )
Great idea , Hamid !
And quite an original one .
Of course , the term is ours , not Karzai’s , and we already have such “ partnerships ” with numerous nations including Japan , Germany , and Greece .
But Afghanistan is none of the above .
The “ partners ” in this relationship are the country that likes to think of itself as the planet ’s “ sole superpower ” — its global “ sheriff , ” the “ new Rome , ” the new imperial “ Britain ” ( Britain itself now being a distinctly junior partner providing a few of the “ native ” troops so necessary for our Iraqi adventure ) — and the country that , in the UN ’s Human Development Report 2004 , was ranked the sixth worst off on Earth , perched just above five absolute basket - case nations in sub-Saharan Africa .
This is the equivalent of declaring a business partnership between a Rockefeller and the local beggar .
In the somewhat vague , four - page Joint Declaration of the United States - Afghanistan Strategic Partnership issued by the two partners while Karzai was in Washington , along with the usual verbiage about spreading democracy and promoting human — perhaps a typo for “ inhuman ” — rights in Afghanistan and throughout the Central Asian region , there were these brief lines :
“ It is understood that in order to achieve the objectives contained herein , U.S. military forces operating in Afghanistan will continue to have access to Bagram Air Base and its facilities , and facilities at other locations as may be mutually determined and that the U.S. and Coalition forces are to continue to have the freedom of action required to conduct appropriate military operations based on consultations and pre-agreed procedures . ”
The Afghans may get no prisoners and not an extra inch of control over U.S. military movements — note that “ continue to have the freedom of action required ?
based on ?
pre-agreed procedures ” — but they do get to give , which is such an ennobling feeling .
What they are offering up is that “ access ” to Bagram Air Base “ and facilities at other locations . ”
( The language is charming .
You would think that the Americans were at the gates of the old Soviet air base waiting to be let in , not that it was already fully occupied and a major American military facility . )
Nothing “ permanent , ” of course , especially since Afghan students in recent protests over mistreated Korans at Guantánamo were also complaining about American bases in their country ; and no future treaties , since Karzai might have a tough time with parliament over that one .
Afghans tend to be irrationally touchy , not to say mean - spirited , on national sovereignty issues .
( Think of the Soviet occupation . )
Just a simple , honestly offered “ request ” and a “ joint declaration ” — somebody must have been smoking one — that quietly extends our rights to base troops in Afghanistan until some undefined moment beyond the end of time .
Spanning the World
Base news has been trickling in from the ? stans of Central Asia — formerly SSRs of the old Soviet Union — as well .
After the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan , for instance , we rushed an official into the country — no , not the Secretary of State to celebrate the spread of democracy , but our globe - trotting Secretary of Defense , who hustled into that otherwise obscure land just to make sure that Ganci Air Base ( named not for some Kyrgyzstani hero , but for Peter Ganci , the New York City fire chief killed in the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks ) in the capital of Bishkek was still ours to use ( as it is ) .
In the Uzbekistan of grim , authoritarian Islam Karimov , our ally in the war on terror ( who received his third visit from Rumsfeld in 2004 ) , the Bush administration , we ’re told , is wrestling with a most difficult problem in the wake of a government massacre of demonstrators : bases versus values ( John Hall , “ U.S. wrestles with bases vs. values in Uzbekistan , ” Richmond Times - dispatch , May 29 ) .
After all , while the White House values the spread of democracy , the Pentagon considers Camp Stronghold Freedom , the former Soviet base we now occupy there —
“ The air - conditioned tents at the base ?
are laid out on a grid , along streets named for the thoroughfares of New York : Fifth Avenue , Long Island Expressway , Wall Street . ” — to be valuable indeed .
And then there ’s that handy matter of stowing away prisoners .
Uzbekistan is one of the places where the U.S. has reportedly been practicing “ extraordinary rendition ” — the kidnapping of terrorist subjects and the dispatching of them to countries happy to torture them for us .
Here ’s a guess : whether Karimov ( to whom the Chinese leadership gave a giant smooch last week ) remains in office or not , in the modern “ Great Game ” in Central Asia expect us to remain in the aptly named Camp Stronghold Freedom .
( I ’d like to see someone try to pry us out . )
In Africa this last week , there was news too .
The Bush administration was promising to pour ever more “ soldiers and money into its anti-terrorism campaign [ there ] , including in Algeria and chaotic Nigeria , both oil - rich nations where radical Islam has a following . ” ( “ Oil - rich ” is the key phrase in that sentence , in case you missed it . )
“ The new campaign , ” writes Edward Harris of AP , “ will target nine north and west African nations and seek to bolster regional cooperation . ”
American officials , calling for a “ budgetary increase ” for anti-terror military aid to the area , are now evidently comparing the vast “ ungoverned ” desert expanses of the Sahara “ to Afghanistan during Taliban rule , when Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaida terror group thrived . ”
Talk about ambition .
Quick , someone report them to the Overseas Basing Commission before anything else happens !
While the Pentagon is planning to shut - down bases all over the U.S. , it ’s like a shopaholic .
It just ca n’t help itself abroad .
Rumors of future base openings are multiplying fast — base workers from Connecticut , New Jersey , and South Dakota take note for future travel planning — in the impoverished former Warsaw Pact lands of Southeastern Europe , which are also conveniently nearer to the oil heartlands of the planet than our old Cold War bases in places like Germany .
UPI , for instance , reported last week that the Pentagon was eyeing bases on Romania ’s scenic Black Sea coast and that the Romanians ( whose plans for a world class , Disney - style Dracula theme park seem to have fallen through ) were eager to be of well - paid service in the war on terror .
Then a Romanian general confirmed that base negotiations were indeed well along : “ General Valeriu Nicut , head of the strategic planning division for the Romanian general staff , said on Wednesday after an international military conference on security issues that the U.S. would set up two military bases in Romania within one year . ”
He was promptly demoted for his efforts .
( Perhaps it was as a result of Rumsfeld ’s pique . )
No one on either side is denying , however , that base negotiations are underway .
Meanwhile in neighboring Bulgaria , the Defense minister was claiming that the U.S. would soon occupy three bases in that land and the Deputy Defense Minister , chairing the talks none of us knew were going on between the two countries , “ told journalists that Washington is also interested in placing storehouses , ” assumedly to be filled with pre-positioned military supplies , there too .
Earlier in the year , the U.S. head of NATO forces had spoken of the possibility of our occupying five bases in Bulgaria — and all of them ( so far ) are hanging onto their jobs .
To the Southeast , there were yet more basing rumors in a volatile area where , last week , a massive 1,700 kilometer - long pipeline bringing Caspian oil from Baku in the former SSR of Azerbaijan to Ceyhan in Turkey via the former SSR of Georgia , was officially opened for business .
The pipeline , as Pepe Escobar of Asia Times pointed out , is little short of a “ sovereign state ” ; its route , carefully constructed to cut both Russia and Iran out of the Caspian oil loop , ends “ right next door to the massive American airbase at Incirlik ” in Turkey .
The presidents of all three countries attended the opening ceremonies in Baku , while an Azerbaijan newspaper reported that the “ U.S. and Azerbaijani governments on April 12 agreed on the deployment of U.S. military bases ?
Under the agreement , the U.S. forces will be deployed in Kurdamir , Nasosnaya and Guyullah .
Various types of aircraft will be deployed at all the three bases , which have runways modernized for U.S. military needs . ”
The report was promptly denied by the Azerbaijani defense ministry , which under the circumstances probably means little .
In neighboring Georgia , our goals have been somewhat more modest .
With U.S. military trainers already in and out of the country to help bring Georgian forces up to speed in the war in terror , and — thanks to the Rose Revolution — a friendly government in place ( the salaries of whose top officials are now “ supplemented ” by a fund set up by George Soros ) , a push had been on to rid the country of its last two Russian military bases .
This week an agreement to vacate them by 2008 was announced .
Bases in Iraq : 2003 -2005
And mind you , all of the above was just the minor basing news of the week .
The biggest news had to do with Iraq .
Bradley Graham of the Washington Post published a rare piece in our press on American bases in that country ( Commanders Plan Eventual Consolidation of U.S. Bases in Iraq ) .
As a start , he revealed that , at the moment , the “ coalition ” has a staggering 106 bases in the country , none with less than 500 troops on hand , and that figure does n’t even include “ four detention facilities and several convoy support centers for servicing the long daily truck runs from Kuwait into Iraq . ”
With just over 160,000 coalition troops on hand in Iraq that would mean an average of about 1,600 to a base .
Of course , some of these bases also house Iraqi troops , various Iraqis needed by U.S. forces — translators , for instance , who , when living outside such bases , are being killed off by insurgents at what seems to be a ferocious rate — and some of the hordes of contractors “ reconstructing ” the country , including the thousands and thousands of hired guns who have flooded in and are constantly at risk .
Some American bases like Camp Anaconda , spread over 15 square miles near Balad ( with two swimming pools , a first - run movie theater , and a fitness gym ) or Camp Victory at the Baghdad International Airport , are vast Vietnam - style encampments , elaborate enough to be “ permanent ” indeed .
It is , by the way , a mystery of compelling proportions that American journalists , more or less trapped in their hotels when it comes to reporting on Iraqi Iraq ( given the dangers of the situation ) , have seemed no less trapped when it comes to reporting on important aspects of American Iraq .
We know , for instance , that even a year and a half ago the American base construction program was already in “ the several billion dollar range , ” and such bases had long been at the heart of Bush administration dreams for the region ; yet since April 2003 there have been only a few very partial descriptions of American bases in Iraq in the press — and those are largely to be found in non-mainstream places or on - line .
Given what ’s generally available to be read ( or seen on the TV news ) , there is simply no way most Americans could grasp just how deeply we have been digging into Iraq .
Take , for instance , this description of Camp Victory offered by Joshua Hammer in a Mother Jones magazine piece :
“ Over the past year , KBR contractors have built a small American city where about 14,000 troops are living , many hunkered down inside sturdy , wooden , air - conditioned bungalows called SEA ( for Southeast Asia ) huts , replicas of those used by troops in Vietnam .
There ’s a Burger King , a gym , the country ’s biggest PX — and , of course , a separate compound for KBR workers , who handle both construction and logistical support .
Although Camp Victory North remains a work in progress today , when complete , the complex will be twice the size of Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo — currently one of the largest overseas posts built since the Vietnam War . ”
There has not , to my knowledge , been a single descriptive article in a major American paper during our two - year occupation of Iraq that has focused on any one of the American bases in that country and I do n’t believe that the American public has any idea — I certainly did n’t — that there were at least 106 of them ; or , for that matter , that some of them already have such a permanent feel to them ; that they are , in essence , facts - on - the - ground long before any negotiations about them might begin with a “ sovereign ” Iraqi government .
In any case , Graham reports that , according to the latest Pentagon plans , we would focus our Iraqi bases — once called “ enduring camps , ” now referred to as “ contingency operating bases ” ( but never , never use the word “ permanent ” ) — into four “ hubs ” ( “ BRAC for Iraq ” ) , none too close to major population centers — “ the four are Tallil in the south , Al Asad in the west , Balad in the center and either Irbil or Qayyarah in the north . ”
“ Several officers involved in drafting the consolidation plan said it entailed the construction of longer - lasting facilities at the sites , including barracks and office structures made of concrete block instead of the metal trailers and tin-sheathed buildings that have become the norm at bigger U.S. bases in Iraq .
“ The new , sturdier buildings will give the bases a more permanent character , the officers acknowledged .
But they said the consolidation plan was not meant to establish a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq ?
The new buildings are being designed to withstand direct mortar strikes , according to a senior military engineer . ”
This plan is being presented — hilariously enough — as part of a “ withdrawal ” strategy .
It seems we are ( over what will have to be interminable years ) planning to turn the other 100 or so bases over to the Iraqi military ( itself a bit of a problematic concept ) .
For this , of course , “ no timetable exists . ”
Once the massive bulk of bases are let go , only those 4 ( or — see below — possibly 5 ) bases will remain to be dealt with ; and , in that distant future , while maintaining “ access ” to our former Iraqi strongholds , we will withdraw to our bases in Kuwait from which we will practice what one colonel interviewed by Graham termed “ strategic overwatch . ”
( Given the intensifying insurgency in Iraq , this seems like nothing short of a Pentagon pipe dream . )
The future of a fifth base , the Camp Victory complex , headquarters of the U.S. military in Iraq , remains “ unresolved . ”
After all , who would n’t want to keep a massive complex on the edge of the Iraqi capital , though the military has proven incapable thus far of securing even the road that runs from Camp Victory ( and Baghdad International Airport ) into downtown Baghdad and the Green Zone .
Today , it is the “ deadliest road in Iraq , ” perhaps the most dangerous stretch of highway on the planet , which of course says something symbolic about the limits of the Pentagon ’s plans to garrison the globe .
Naturally , these four ( or five ) bases are n’t “ permanent , ” even if they are about to be built up to withstand anything short of an atomic blast and have the distinct look of permanency .
The problem is , as Maj .
Noelle Briand , who heads a basing working group on the U.S. command staff , commented to Graham , “ Four is as far as we ’ve gone down in our planning . ”
The word “ permanent ” cannot be spoken in part because all of the above decisions have undoubtedly been taken without significant consultation with the supposedly sovereign government of Iraq with whom the Pentagon is undoubtedly just dying to have one of those strategic partnerships as well as a “ status of forces agreement ” or SOFA .
The SOFA is considered a future necessity since it would essentially give American troops extraterritoriality in Iraq , protecting them from prosecution for crimes committed and offering them impunity in terms of actions taken .
No Iraqi government , however , could at present negotiate such an agreement without losing its last shred of popularity .
Still , congratulations to Graham for giving us an important , if somewhat encoded , version of the Bush administration ’s latest basing plans for Iraq .
But here ’s the catch , these “ latest ” Pentagon plans look suspiciously like some rather well - worn plans , now over two years old .
Unfortunately , our media has just about no institutional memory .
As it happens , though , I remember — and what I remember specifically is a New York Times front - page piece , Pentagon Expects Long - Term Access to Four Key Bases in Iraq , by Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt that was published on April 19 , 2003 , just as the Bush administration ’s Iraq
War seemed to be successfully winding down .
Since next to nothing else of significance on the subject was written until Graham ’s piece came out last week , it remains a remarkable document as well as a fine piece of reporting .
It began :
“ The United States is planning a long - term military relationship with the emerging government of Iraq , one that would grant the Pentagon access to military bases and project American influence into the heart of the unsettled region , senior Bush administration officials say .
“ American military officials , in interviews this week , spoke of maintaining perhaps four bases in Iraq that could be used in the future : one at the international airport just outside Baghdad ; another at Tallil , near Nasiriya in the south ; the third at an isolated airstrip called H - 1 in the western desert , along the old oil pipeline that runs to Jordan ; and the last at the Bashur air field in the Kurdish north . ”
Let ’s just stop there and consider for a moment .
In April 2003 , the Pentagon was looking for long - term “ access ” to four bases ; at the end of May 2005 , it ’s revealed that the Pentagon is looking for long - term “ access ” to ? four bases .
After two years and billions of dollars worth of base construction , the general distribution of these bases remains relatively unchanged .
In fact , the base chosen for the Shiite South at Tallil remains the same .
One of the four bases mentioned in the Times ’ account of 2003 , at Baghdad International Airport , now Camp Victory , is the “ unresolved ” fifth base in the Post ’s 2005 account ; in the West , H - 1 has been replaced by Al Asad in the same general area ; in the Kurdish North , Bashur ( 2003 ) has been replaced by either Qayyarah or Irbil , approximately 50 kilometers to the south ; and Balad , north of Baghdad , is assumedly the non-urban version of the 2003 Airport choice .
In other words , between 2003 and 2005 , the numbers and the general placement of these planned bases seems to have remained more or less the same .
“ In Afghanistan , and in Iraq , ” Shanker and Schmitt wrote , “ the American military will do all it can to minimize the size of its deployed forces , and there will probably never be an announcement of permanent stationing of troops .
Not permanent basing , but permanent access is all that is required , officials say . ”
This was , of course , at a moment when Bush administration neocons expected to draw down American forces rapidly in a grateful , liberated land .
Shanker and Schmitt then put the prospective Iraqi bases into a larger global context , mentioning in particular access to bases in Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Romania , and Bulgaria , and adding :
“ [ T ] here has been a concerted diplomatic and military effort to win permission for United States forces to operate from the formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe , across the Mediterranean , throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa , and across Central Asia , from the periphery of Russia to Pakistan ’s ports on the Indian Ocean .
It is a swath of Western influence not seen for generations . ”
Three days after the Shanker / Schmitt report was front - paged , Donald Rumsfeld strongly denied it was so at a Pentagon news conference reported in the Washington Post ( U.S. Wo n’t Seek Bases in Iraq , Rumsfeld Says ) by Bradley Graham .
His piece began :
“ Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said yesterday the United States is unlikely to seek any permanent or ‘ long - term ’ bases in Iraq because U.S. basing arrangements with other countries in the region are sufficient ?
?
I have never , that I can recall , heard the subject of a permanent base in Iraq discussed in any meeting , ’ Rumsfeld said ?
?
The likelihood of it seems to me to be so low that it does not surprise me that it ’s never been discussed in my presence — to my knowledge . ' ”
And , for the next two years , that was largely that .
The Times has n’t seriously revisited the story since , despite the fact that their original front - page piece was groundbreaking .
You would think it a subject worth returning to .
After all , despite everything that ’s happened between May 2003 ( “ Mission Accomplished ! ” ) and the present disastrous moment in Iraq , the Pentagon is still planning on those four bases .
Coincidence ?
Who knows , but might it not be worth at least a blip on the inside pages somewhere ?
An Empire of Bases
As the Overseas Basing Commission indicated in their recent report , such global basing plans are nothing if not wildly ambitious and sure to be wildly expensive ( especially for a military bogged down in fighting a fierce but not exactly superpower - sized enemy in one part of a single Middle Eastern country ) .
When we take the bits and pieces of the global - base puzzle that have sprung up like weeds between the cracks in recent weeks and try to put them together into a map of the Pentagon ’s globe , it looks rather like the one described by Shanker and Schmitt in 2003 .
Begin with those prospective bases in Romania and Bulgaria ( and while you ’re at it , toss in the ones already in existence in the former Yugoslavia ) ; make your way southeastwards past “ Pipelineistan , ” keeping your eye out for our Turkish bases and those possible future ones in Azerbaijan ; take in the 4 or 5 bases we ’d like to hang onto in the embattled Iraqi heartland of the Middle East ( not to speak of the ones we already control in Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain and elsewhere in the region ) ; take a quick glance at “ oil - rich ” North Africa for a second , imagining what might someday be nailed down there ; then hop over base - less Axis of Evil power Iran and land at Bagram Air Base ( do n’t worry , you have “ access ” ) or any of the other unnamed ones in Afghanistan where we now have a long - term foothold ; do n’t forget the nearby Pakistani air bases that Gen.
Pervez Musharraf has given us access to ( or Diego Garcia , that British “ aircraft carrier ” island in the Indian Ocean that ’s all ours ) ; add in our new Central Asian facilities ; plot it all out on a map and what you have is a great infertile crescent of American military garrisons extending from the old Soviet - controlled lands of Eastern Europe to the old Soviet SSRs of Central Asia , reaching from Russia ’s eastern border right up to the border of China .
This is , of course , a map that more or less coincides with the Middle Eastern and Caspian oil heartlands of the planet .
Put in historical terms , in the last decade - plus , as the pace of our foreign wars has picked up , we ’ve left behind , after each of them , a new set of bases like the droppings of some giant beast marking the scene with its scent .
Bases were dropped into Saudi Arabia and the small Gulf emirates after our first Gulf War in 1991 ; into the former Yugoslavia after the Kosovo air war of 1999 ; into Pakistan , Afghanistan , and those former Central Asian SSRs after the Afghan war of 2001 ; and into Iraq after the invasion of 2003 .
War in Iraq , in turn , has spawned at least 106 bases of various sizes and shapes ; while a low - level but ongoing guerilla conflict in Afghanistan has produced a plethora of fire bases , outposts , air bases , and detention centers of every sort .
It ’s a matter of bases and prisons where there is opposition .
Just bases where there is n’t .
This , it seems , is now the American way in the world .
Most Americans , knowing next to nothing about our global bases or the Pentagon ’s basing policies , would undoubtedly be surprised to learn that ours is an empire of bases .
In fact , our particular version of military empire is perhaps unique : all “ gunboats , ” no colonies .
Nothing has been of more concern to the Pentagon - centered Bush administration abroad than bases , or of less concern to our media at home .
Despite two years of catastrophic setbacks , the ambitions of the Bush White House and the Pentagon evidently remain remarkably unchanged and wildly ambitious — and , I suspect , the rule of inverse media interest still holds .

老けたくない、いつまでも。永遠の美を手に入れるにはどうすべきか。
それをずっと考えていました。
そして、丁寧にコツコツとケアを毎日積み重ねる必要があるとわかりました。
シワを予防する食べ物とは？
加齢によって出来るシワは、実は、日常の食生活を改善することにより、予防することができます。
クリームやジェルを塗ってお肌の保湿を心がけることも重要ですが、体の酸化が原因でお肌へのダメージにより出来るシワは、コラーゲンや、抗酸化物質の生成を促すビタミンが多く含まれている食事に変えるだけで、シワを未然に防ぐ事が出来ます。
では、ビタミンが多く含まれている食品は、どのような物があるのか、そして、その効能について、以下にまとめます。
シワを予防するために毎日摂取したい食品は、ブルーベリーです。
ブルーベリーは他の食品と比べて、抗酸化物質が特に豊富に含まれているフルーツです。その為、老化による乾燥や角質に抵抗する若々しいお肌の育成と、酸化による細胞へのダメージへの抵抗力が付きますので、シワの予防になる食品です。
また、ブルーベリーは、煙や汚染された外気、科学物質などの有害な外気からお肌を守ってくれる効果もありますので、美肌を保つ為には、欠かせない食材です。さらに、ブルーベリーを食べる事により、糖尿病の予防や、コレステロール値が高い方への抑制効果、痩身効果もありますので、マルチな健康食材と言う事ができます。
ブルーベリーの食べ方は、ヨーグルトに混ぜたり、ブルーベリーケーキにしたり、ブルーベリージュースで飲んだり、色々な食べ方がありますので、飽きずに毎日食べる事が出来ます。
そして、他にもシワを予防する事が出来る食べ物で有名な物が、トマトやいちご、グアバ、キューイ、パパイヤ、スイカ、桃、サクランボ、ブドウ、ザクロ、ピンクグレープフルーツ、ラズベリー、赤パプリカ、ラディッシュ、紫タマネギなどです。
これらには、多くのビタミンＣが含まれていますので、抗酸化作用が強く、皮膚のコラーゲンの生成を促進しています。

肌荒れ・くすみが気になったら、腸内環境をチェック
中々治らない吹き出物や、化粧ノリが悪い、肌がくすんで暗く見える。
原因はストレスだったり、寝不足だったりと様々な原因が挙げられると思います。
たくさんある原因の一つとして、腸内環境が乱れている可能性があります。
実は腸内環境が悪いと腸内活動が滞り、排便がされにくくなります。
すると、便がたまり身体の毒素が排出されなくなることによって
肌に吹き出物が出たりくすんだりする原因になります。
では、腸内環境をよくするにはどうすればよいのかと言うと、
腸内を善玉菌で増やしてあげればよいのです。
腸内細菌では善玉菌・悪玉菌・日和見菌の三つの菌が存在しており
善玉菌が多いと腸内環境は健康に保たれ、
悪玉菌が多いと腸内環境が悪くなります。
日和見菌は量が多い方に変わる菌なので、
善玉菌を少し増やしてあげると日和見菌は味方になってくれます。
この三つの菌の良い割合が２：１：７になります。
肌トラブル軽減の理由が、善玉菌は身体には必須ビタミンである
「 ビタミ ンB郡 」 「ビタミ ンK」を生成するため 。
この二つのビタミンは、むくみやくま・くすみを抑えてくれる
美肌には嬉しい効果のあるビタミンだからです。
それでは、腸内を善玉菌で増やすには善玉菌が喜んでくれるエサとなる食品を摂取し届けてあげるのです。そのエサとなる食品が「発酵食品 」「食物繊維 」 「オリゴ糖」です。
発酵食品では、納豆・キムチ・ぬか漬け・チーズやヨーグルトなどが挙げられます。食物繊維では、野菜はもちろん、きのこや切干大根・干し野菜といった乾物が食物繊維が豊富です。オリゴ糖は、大根に含まれてたり、にんにくや玉ねぎにもフラクトオリゴ糖といって含まれています。
オリゴ糖はシロップなどで販売されていたりするので、ヨーグルトに混ぜて摂取するとさらに効果もアップしますね。発酵食品のチーズやヨーグルトは動物性で食べ過ぎるとカロリーも高いので、植物性の納豆やキムチをオススメします。この納豆とキムチは相乗効果も発揮し、減塩効果にもなるので最強の組み合わせと言えますね。
ぜひ、身体の中からキレイになって美肌を目指しましょう。

Tyler Colman , reporting for The New York Times :
A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and generates about 5.2 pounds of carbon - dioxide emissions when it travels from a vineyard in California to a store in New York .
A 3 - liter box generates about half the emissions per 750 milliliters .
Switching to wine in a box for the 97 percent of wines that are made to be consumed within a year would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two million tons , or the equivalent of retiring 400,000 cars . [ … ]
What ’s more , boxed wine is superior to glass bottle storage in resolving that age - old problem of not being able to finish a bottle in one sitting .
Once open , a box preserves wine for about four weeks compared with only a day or two for a bottle .
Boxed wine may be short on charm , but it is long on practicality .

Capcom has promised that Resident Evil 5 is not about to shy away from gore in a bid to get a lower age certification .
We ’re never going to create a gore - free Resident Evil title to try and get a lower rating as it ’s a game about the horror experience and gore is part of that , ” said Rhys Cash , Capcom UK ’s research and planning manager .
We ’re primarily about making great games and if it ’s appropriate to the title we wo n’t shy away from making a 15 + or 18 + title . ”
He also stated that despite factors like the popularity of DS and Wii leading the industry away from adult titles to some extent , those consoles can still support 18 + titles :
As we ’ve shown with Resident Evil 4 Wii and Resident Evil : Umbrella Chronicles there ’s still a market for more mature titles even on these formats . ”
There ’s no reason why an appropriate adult title should be seen as something to be shied away from .
What I do see publishers moving away from is titles whose only raison d’tre is ‘ adult themes ’ and only goal is to shock , ” Cash added .
Welcome to Lighting 101
Lighting is Not Hard
It 's Not Even Expensive
Professional Photographers Have Started Here
( Photo by Strobist reader Ken Brown )
Or Maybe You Just Want to Amp Your Instagram
( Photo by Strobist reader Benny Smith )
Learning how to light is one of the coolest doors you can walk through as a photographer .
literally means writing with light .
More than anything else , light determines the way your photos look and feel .
To be in control of the light is to be in control of what you are saying with your photos .
This entry level lighting course was developed to teach the skills I learned in the process of completing over 10,000 assignments as a working photojournalist .
Here , you 'll learn the basics of using off - camera flash to create beautiful light and professional - looking photos .
Lighting 101 , 102 and 103 are all completely free .
And the gear required to turn your small flash into a wireless studio is very inexpensive compared to the cost of your camera .
This is not a course for iPhone photographers .
You 'll need a real camera that gives you control of the shutter and aperture settings , and has a hot shoe to accept a flash on top .
Almost any DSLR or mirrorless camera will be fine .
You 'll also need to have a basic understanding of how f/ stops and shutter speeds work — and the effects that they each have on your photos .
If you have ever used your camera in manual mode ( where you are in control of both the f / stop and the shutter speed ) you 'll be fine .
And that 's it .
If you already have a flash , we 'll show you how to tell if it is right for off - camera lighting .
( It 's probably fine . )
If not , we 'll show you a solid , inexpensive choice for beginners .
The same goes for the related gear you 'll need to turn your flash into a wireless studio .
More on that in a minute .
You are not alone .
Hundreds of new people start Lighting 101 every day — over four million so far .
Some have go on to become professional photographers .
Many simply use what they learn to make beautiful photos of family and friends , or the other various communities that surround them .
If they can do it , you can do it .
Lighting is not difficult , and it need not be technical .
At Strobist we teach an intuituve approach to lighting .
Honestly , it 's more like cooking than it is like math class .
Now that we have digital cameras , you 'll get instant feedback on the results of a change in your lighting .
This is a fantastic advantage , compared to when I first learned this stuff as a photojournalist back in the 1980s .
That efficient visual feedback loop will help you to learn faster , and your lighting will quickly become intuitive .
In short , no worries .
This stuff is easy .
Sure , like anything else , lightingbe expensive .
But it does n't have to be .
A professional quality lighting kit , that will last you for the rest of your life , can be had for a couple hundred bucks .
We 'll even show you how to make lighting modifiers for free out of household items .
See the photo up top ?
Strobist reader Sam Simon , who not so long ago was just as new at this as you are now , used a shoe box and some paper to create the light for that portrait .
It 's the location and the quality of the light that is most important , not how much you spend .
By getting your flash off - camera , your images become more three - dimensional , more textured and more professional looking .
All of the photos on this page were made by Strobist readers working with small flashes .
Not so long ago , those people were exactly where you are now .
Strobist reader Ken Brown , who made the photo above , started his lighting journey at Strobist .
Even while just starting out , he made this photo of a gullwing Mercedes by putting two small , bare flashes on the front seats .
This was a very cool trick : he lit the car , while at the same time using the car itself as a lighting modifier .
Building on the basics he learned here , Ken has gone on to create lighting techniques of his own .
He now makes sophisticated photos of exotic cars using a single flash and multiple exposures to light different parts of the vehicle .
We 'll give you a good foundation .
Where you take it from there is entirely up to you .
Lighting can be the difference between snapshots and art .
Any 13 - year - old schoolgirl already knows to rotate her face and her phone to exploit the best light available for a selfie .
Understanding how to create beautiful lightwill take your photos to a new level .
Learning how to light is easy , inexpensive and fun .
And you can take it as far as you want .
I long time ago , I was exactly where you are right now .
You 're about to take an exciting step that will make a huge difference in your photos .
Are you ready ?
Let 's go .

Bush Lied , Thought It Was Funny and Killed 1M +
Bush Lied , Knew He Was Lying , Thought It Was Funny , and Killed Over a Million People

By David Swanson
Borrowing heavily from Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's articles of impeachment , but adding and removing bits and pieces , here 's a case against the current occupant of the White House :
In his conduct while President of the United States , George W. Bush , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II , Section 3 of the Constitution " to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " intentionally misled Congress to obtain authorization for the use of force against Iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization to commit US troops to combat .
Long before the March 19 , 2003 , invasion of Iraq , a wealth of intelligence informed the President and those under his direction and control that Iraq 's stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons had been destroyed well before 1998 and that there was little , if any , credible intelligence that showed otherwise .
As reported in the Washington Post in March of 2003 , in 1995 , Saddam Hussein 's son- in - law Hussein Kamel had informed U.S. and British intelligence officers that " all weapons — biological , chemical , missile , nuclear were destroyed . "
In September 2002 , the Defense Intelligence Agency issued a report that concluded : " A substantial amount of Iraq 's chemical warfare agents , precursors , munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of Operation Desert Storm and UNSCOM actions … [ T ] here is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether Iraq has - or will - establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities . "
The main source of the President 's claims that Iraq was producing biological weapons was an informant code - named Curveball by his German interrogators , who had informed the Bush Administration that Curveball was not " psychologically stable , " was a heavy drinker , had had a mental breakdown , was " crazy , " and was " probably a fabricator . "
On or about September 12 , 2001 , former terrorism advisor Richard Clarke personally informed the President that neither Saddam Hussein nor Iraq was responsible for the September 11th attacks .
On September 18 , Clarke submitted to the President 's National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice a memo he had written in response to George W. Bush 's specific request that stated : ( 1 ) the case for linking Hussein to the September 11th attacks was weak ; ( 2 ) only anecdotal evidence linked Hussein to al Qaeda ; ( 3 ) Osama Bin Laden resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein ; and ( 4 ) there was no confirmed reporting of Saddam Hussein cooperating with Bin Laden on unconventional weapons .
Ten days after the September 11th attacks the President received a President 's Daily Briefing which indicated that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11th attacks and that there was " scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda . "
In Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summary No. 044-02 , issued in February 2002 , the United States Defense Intelligence Agency cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein - Al Qaeda conspiracy : " Saddam 's regime is intensely secular and is wary of Islamic revolutionary movements .
Moreover , Baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control . "
The October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) gave a " Low Confidence " rating to the notion of whether " in desperation Saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with Al Qaeda . "
The CIA never informed the President that there was an operational relationship between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein ; on the contrary , its most " aggressive " analysis contained in " Iraq and al - Qaeda - Interpreting a Murky Relationship " dated June 21 , 2002 , was that Iraq had had " sporadic , wary contacts with al Qaeda since the mid-1990s rather than a relationship with al Qaeda that has developed over time . "
The October 2002 NIE concluded that " Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States , fearing that exposure of Iraqi involvement would provide Washington a stronger case for making war .
Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable . "
This statement was not included in the declassified shortened version of the NIE that was used to mislead the Congress .
Other changes to the declassified version included removing dissenting paragraphs and footnotes , and removing phrases such as " We judge that ... " and " We assess that ... " and " Although we have little specific information on Iraq 's CW stockpile ... " in order to transform speculation into fact .
Other phrases were added in the declassification process , including the phrase " including potentially against the U.S. homeland . "
Notwithstanding the absence of evidence proving that weapons stockpiles existed and in direct contradiction to substantial evidence that showed they did not exist , the President and his subordinates and agents made numerous false representations claiming with certainty that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons that it was developing to use to attack the United States , including these :
(1) " In defiance of the United Nations , Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons , and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons . "
Speech of President Bush , October 5 , 2002 .
(2) " All the world has now seen the footage of an Iraqi Mirage aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas .
Iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the Security Council .
A UAV launched from a vessel off the American coast could reach hundreds of miles inland . "
Statement by President Bush from the White House , February 6 , 2003 .
Despite overwhelming intelligence in the form of statements and reports filed by and on behalf of the CIA , the State Department and the IAEA , among others , which indicated that the claim was untrue , the President , and those under his direction and control , made numerous representations claiming and implying through misleading language that Iraq was attempting to purchase uranium from Niger in order to falsely buttress its argument that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program , including :
(1) " The regime has the scientists and facilities to build nuclear weapons , and is seeking the materials needed to do so . "
Statement of President Bush from White House , October 2 , 2002 .
(2) " The [ Iraqi ] report also failed to deal with issues which have arisen since 1998 , including : . . attempts to acquire uranium and the means to enrich it . "
Letter from President Bush to Vice President Cheney and the Senate , January 20 , 2003 .
(3) " The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "
President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address , January 28 , 2003 .
Despite overwhelming evidence in the form of reports by nuclear weapons experts from the Energy , the Defense and State Departments , as well from outside and international agencies which assessed that aluminum tubes the Iraqis were purchasing were not suitable for nuclear centrifuge use and were , on the contrary , identical to ones used in rockets already being manufactured by the Iraqis , the President , and those under his direction and control , persisted in making numerous false and fraudulent representations implying and stating explicitly that the Iraqis were purchasing the tubes for use in a nuclear weapons program , including the following :
(1) " Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high - strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . "
President Bush 's State of the Union Address , January 28 , 2003 .
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on Whether Public Statements Regarding Iraq By U.S. Government Officials Were Substantiated By Intelligence Information , which was released on June 5 , 2008 , concluded that :
(1) " Statements by the President and Vice President prior to the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraq 's chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence community 's uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing . "
(2) " The Secretary of Defense 's statement that the Iraqi government operated underground WMD facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information . "
(3) Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Jay Rockefeller concluded : " In making the case for war , the Administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted , or even non-existent .
As a result , the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed . "
Notwithstanding the complete absence of intelligence analysis to support a claim that Iraq posed an imminent or urgent threat to the United States and the intelligence community 's assessment that Iraq was in fact not likely to attack the United States unless it was itself attacked , President Bush , both personally and through his agents and subordinates , made , allowed and caused to be made repeated false representations to the citizens and Congress of the United States implying and explicitly stating that such a dire threat existed , including the following :
(1) " States such as these [ Iraq , Iran and North Korea ] and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
By seeking weapons of mass destruction , these regimes pose a grave and growing danger .
They could provide these arms to terrorists , giving them the means to match their hatred .
They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States .
In any of these cases , the price of indifference would be catastrophic . "
President Bush 's State of the Union Address , January 29 , 2002 .
(2) " The history , the logic , and the facts lead to one conclusion : Saddam Hussein 's regime is a grave and gathering danger .
To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence .
To assume this regime 's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble .
And this is a risk we must not take . "
Address of President Bush to the United Nations General Assembly , September 12 , 2002 .
(3) " On its present course , the Iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency .
. . . it has developed weapons of mass death . "
Statement of President Bush at White House , October 2 , 2002 .
(4) " Today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by Iraq .
A dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons .
We will not permit Saddam Hussein to blackmail and / or terrorize nations which love freedom . "
Speech by President Bush to Prague Atlantic Student Summit , November 20 , 2002 .
(5) " But the risk of doing nothing , the risk of the security of this country being jeopardized at the hands of a madman with weapons of mass destruction far exceeds the risk of any action we may be forced to take . "
President Bush Meets with National Economic Council at White House , February 25 , 2003 .
While the President noticeably avoided the word " imminent , " which might have prompted requests for evidence , he frequently used equivalent phrases , such as " on any given day , " " before the day of horror can come , before it is too late to act , " " the danger is already significant , and it only grows worse with time , " " each passing day could be the one , " etc .
In furtherance of his fraudulent effort to deceive Congress and the citizens of the United States into believing that Iraq and Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat to the United States , the President allowed and authorized those acting under his direction and control , including Vice President Richard B. Cheney , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and Lewis Libby , who reported directly to both the President and the Vice President , among others , to pressure intelligence analysts to tailor their assessments and to create special units outside of , and unknown to , the intelligence community in order to secretly obtain unreliable information , to manufacture intelligence , or to reinterpret raw data in ways that would support the Bush administration 's plan to invade Iraq based on a false claim of urgency despite the lack of justification for such a preemptive action .
Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke said on " Good Morning America " in 2004 that on September 12 , 2001 , " The President in a very intimidating way left us - me and my staff - with the clear indication that he wanted us to come back with the word that there was an Iraqi hand behind 9/11 . "
Vice President Richard Cheney made several unprecedented visits to the CIA to pressure analysts .
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , at an August 2002 meeting of the Defense Intelligence Agency , criticized the CIA for not finding a link between Hussein and Al Qaeda .
Robin Raphel , a veteran of the State Department 's Foreign Service , David Dunford , a State Department Middle East specialist , Richard Kerr , former deputy director of the CIA , Kenneth Pollack , a Clinton Administration National Security official , and Paul Pillar , retired CIA agent , are among those who have testified to White House pressure on intelligence analysts to make a case for war on Iraq .
This determination to fix the facts around the policy of invasion is also documented in the minutes of a July 23 , 2002 , meeting hosted by the Prime Minister of Britain Tony Blair , known as the Downing Street Minutes , and in a related collection of British memos .
Further evidence of the President 's intention to make war a first , rather than a last , resort and to mislead the Congress and the public , is found in the British minutes of a January 31 , 2003 , White House meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair , at a time when their public statements included claims of working to preserve peace .
During this meeting , the President proposed a number of possible ways to manufacture an excuse for war , including suggesting that the United States paint U2 reconnaissance aircraft with UN colors and try to get them shot at .
The President agreed to pressure the United Nations for a resolution authorizing war , but said that he would launch a war regardless of the outcome .
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on Whether Public Statements Regarding Iraq By U.S. Government Officials Were Substantiated By Intelligence Information , which was released on June 5 , 2008 , concluded that :
" Statements by the President and the Vice President indicating that Saddam Hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the United States were contradicted by available intelligence information . "
Notwithstanding his knowledge that neither Saddam Hussein nor Iraq was in any way connected to the September 11th attacks , the President allowed and authorized those acting under his direction and control , including Vice President Richard B. Cheney and Lewis Libby , who reported directly to both the President and the Vice President , and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , among others , to pressure intelligence analysts to alter their assessments and to create special units outside of , and unknown to , the intelligence community in order to secretly obtain unreliable information , to manufacture intelligence or reinterpret raw data in ways that would further the Bush administration 's goal of fraudulently establishing a relationship not only between Iraq and al Qaeda , but between Iraq and the attacks of September 11th .
Further , despite his full awareness that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had no relationship to the September 11th attacks , the President , and those acting under his direction and control have , since at least 2002 and continuing to the present , repeatedly issued public statements deliberately worded to mislead , words calculated in their implication to bring unrelated actors and circumstances into an artificially contrived reality thereby facilitating the systematic deception of Congress and the American people .
Thus the public and some members of Congress , came to believe , falsely , that there was a connection between Iraq and the attacks of 911 .
This was accomplished through well - publicized statements by the Bush Administration which contrived to continually tie Iraq and 911 in the same statements of grave concern without making an explicit charge :
( 1 ) " [ If ] Iraq regimes [ sic ] continues to defy us , and the world , we will move deliberately , yet decisively , to hold Iraq to account …
It 's a new world we 're in .
We used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy .
On that tragic day , September the 11th , 2001 , we found out that 's not the case .
We found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable .
And therefore we must do everything we can -- everything we can -- to secure the homeland , to make us safe . "
Speech of President Bush in Iowa on September 16 , 2002 .
(2) " With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons , our own options to confront that regime will narrow .
And if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies , then the attacks of September 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors . "
March 6 , 2003 , Statement of President Bush in National Press Conference .
(3) " The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11 , 2001 -- and still goes on .
That terrible morning , 19 evil men -- the shock troops of a hateful ideology -- gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions .
They imagined , in the words of one terrorist , that September the 11th would be the ' beginning of the end of America . '
By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields , terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nation 's resolve , and force our retreat from the world .
They have failed . "
May 1 , 2003 , Speech of President Bush on U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln .
(4) " Now we 're in a new and unprecedented war against violent Islamic extremists .
This is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will .
These are the people that attacked us on September the 11th and killed nearly 3,000 people .
The stakes are high , and once again , we have had to change our strategic thinking .
The major battleground in this war is Iraq . "
June 28 , 2007 , Speech of President Bush at the Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island .
Notwithstanding his knowledge that there was no credible evidence of a working relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda and that the intelligence community had specifically assessed that there was no such operational relationship , the President , both personally and through his subordinates and agents , has repeatedly falsely represented , both explicitly and implicitly , and through the misleading use of selectively - chosen facts , to the citizens of the United States and to the Congress that there was and is such an ongoing operational relationship , to wit :
(1) " We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high - level contacts that go back a decade .
Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq .
These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year , and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks .
We 've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb - making and poisons and deadly gases . "
September 28 , 2002 , Weekly Radio Address of President Bush to the Nation .
( 2 ) " [ W ]e we need to think about Saddam Hussein using al Qaeda to do his dirty work , to not leave fingerprints behind . "
October 14 , 2002 , Remarks by President Bush in Michigan .
(3) " We know he 's got ties with al Qaeda . "
November 1 , 2002 , Speech of President Bush in New Hampshire .
(4) " Evidence from intelligence sources , secret communications , and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists , including members of al Qaeda .
Secretly , and without fingerprints , he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists , or help them develop their own . "
January 28 , 2003 , President Bush 's State of the Union Address .
(5) " The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11 , 2001 — and still goes on .
. . .
[ T ]he liberation of Iraq . . . removed an ally of al Qaeda . "
May 1 , 2003 , Speech of President Bush on U.S. S. Abraham Lincoln
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on Whether Public Statements Regarding Iraq By U.S. Government Officials Were Substantiated By Intelligence Information , which was released on June 5 , 2008 , concluded that :
(1) " Statements and implications by the President and Secretary of State suggesting that Iraq and al - Qa'ida had a partnership , or that Iraq had provided al - Qa'ida with weapons training , were not substantiated by the intelligence . "
(2) " The Intelligence Community did not confirm that Muhammad Atta met an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in 2001 as the Vice President repeatedly claimed . "
In order to fulfill the requirements of the Congressional Authorization to Use Force , the President was required to submit to Congress his determination that :
" ( 1 ) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either ( A ) will not adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq or ( B ) is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq ; and
" ( 2 ) acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorist and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 . "
On March 18 , 2003 , President George Bush sent a letter and a report to Congress stating that he had made those determinations .
The evidence shows that the President knew his assertions in this letter and report to be false .
At a January 31 , 2003 , White House press conference with Tony Blair , at which Bush and Blair did not mention their discussion of how to manufacture excuses for war , but rather claimed to be working for peace , a reporter asked " Do you believe that there is a link between Saddam Hussein , a direct link , and the men who attacked on September the 11th ? "
President Bush replied : " I ca n't make that claim . "
Congress relied on the false information provided to it by the President of the United States .
Congress provided the President with the authorization to use military force that he requested .
As a consequence of the fraudulent representations made to the Congress , the United States Armed Forces , under the direction of George W. Bush as Commander in Chief , pursuant to Section 3 of the Authorization for the Use of Force which President Bush requested , invaded Iraq and occupy it to this day , at the cost of 4,116 lives of US service men and women , injuries to over 30,000 of our troops , the deaths of over 1,000,000 innocent Iraqi civilians , the destruction of Iraq , and a long term cost of $ 2 to $ 3 trillion of taxpayers ' money .
President Bush 's misrepresentations to Congress to induce passage of a use of force resolution are subversive of the Constitutional system of checks and balances , destructive of Congress ' sole prerogative to declare war under Article I Section 8 of the Constitution , and therefore constitute a High Crime .
An even greater offense by the President of the United States occurs in his capacity as Commander in Chief , because he knowingly placed the men and women of the United States Armed Forces in harms way , jeopardizing their lives and their families ' future , for reasons the President knew to be fraudulent .
In all of these actions and decisions , President George W. Bush has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and Commander in Chief , and subversive of constitutional government , to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States and of those members of the Armed Forces who put their lives on the line pursuant to the falsehoods of the President .
Wherefore , President George W. Bush , by such conduct , is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office .

Edwards Admits Sexual Affair ; Lied as Presidential Candidate A " Nightline " Exclusive : Edwards says he cheated , but did not father child .
August 8 , 2008  -- John Edwards admitted to ABC News in an interview with Bob Woodruff Friday ( WATCH THE INTERVIEW ) that he repeatedly lied about an extramarital affair with a 42 - year old campaign employee , but strenuously denied being involved in paying the woman hush money or fathering her newborn child .
The former Democratic U.S. senator from North Carolina said he would be willing to take a paternity test and divulge the results publicly .
" Two years ago I made a very serious mistake , a mistake that I am responsible for and no one else .
In 2006 , I told Elizabeth about the mistake , asked her for her forgiveness , asked God for his forgiveness .
And we have kept this within our family since that time . "
Edwards , 55 , said he told his entire family about the affair after it ended in 2006 , and that his wife Elizabeth , who has incurable breast cancer , was " furious " but that their marriage would survive .
The couple have three children , Cate , 25 , Emma , 9 , and Jack , 7 .
When he confessed his affair to his wife , " she was mad , " Edwards said .
" She was angry , " he said .
" I think ' furious ' would be a good way to describe it .
She did n't understand .
We both went through a process of trying to figure out how it happened , why it happened . "
Late Friday evening , Elizabeth Edwards posted a message on her blog , saying that she and her children will stand by Edwards .
" Our family has been through a lot .
Some caused by nature , some caused by human weakness , and some – most recently – caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences , " she wrote on her blog .
" None of these has been easy .
But we have stood with one another through them all .
Although John believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now , when the door closes behind him , he has his family waiting for him . "
She too , denied in the blog post that Hunter 's child was fathered by her husband .
Edwards told ABC
News that he met secretly with former lover Rielle Hunter as recently as last month in a California hotel room at her request because " she was having some trouble , she just wanted to talk . "
" I wanted her not to tell the public what had happened , " he said at another point .
" Very simple .
That 's the reason I went . "
Edwards contacted ABC News and requested that he be interviewed about the allegations .
He agreed before the interview to place no limitations on the questions he would be asked , but limited the amount of time he would be questioned .
He declined to clarify exactly when the relationship began or ended but said it was over before he announced his campaign for the presidency on Dec. 28 , 2006 .
" I think my family is entitled to every detail , " Edwards said .
" They 've been told every detail … I think beyond the basics …
I think that 's where it stops in terms of the public because I think everything else is within my family and those privacy boundaries out to be respected . "
A series of dramatic allegations revolving around the affair have been reported by the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer .
The most serious of those allegations is that Hunter has been receiving hush money through the Edwards campaign in order to keep her quiet .
In the interview , Edwards denied knowing anything about any support being provided to Hunter or to Andrew Young , the former Edwards campaign aide who has said that he , not Edwards , is the child 's father .
If any such support was being provided , Edwards insisted , " I had nothing to do with any money being paid , and no knowledge of any money being paid , and if something was paid , it was n't being paid on my behalf . "
Edwards ' 2008 national finance chairman Fred Baron said late Friday that he had provided " assistance " to Hunter and others without Edwards ' knowledge .
In a statement emailed to ABC News , Baron said that he " decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own . "
" I did this of my own volition without the instruction or suggestion of anyone , and made a conscious decision not to tell anyone , including John Edwards , that assistance was provided .
The assistance was offered and accepted without condition .
This is now and shall always remain a private matter between these individuals and me . "
Edwards said he knows he could not be the father based on the timing of the baby 's birth on February 27 , 2008 .
A grainy photo that appears to show Edwards holding a child was published recently in the National Enquirer , which claimed that the baby was Rielle Hunter 's child Frances Quinn .
Edwards said he could n't make " sense " of the photo .
" I do n't know if that picture is me , " Edwards said .
" It could well be .
It looks like me .
I do n't know who that baby is .
I have no idea what that picture is . "
Pressed to clarify whether the child in the picture was Hunter 's child , Edwards suggested that the tabloid may have digitally altered the picture , but also noted the frequency with which politicians hold babies .
" Do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years ?
I mean it happens all the time . "
Edwards was asked again about the meeting .
" Are you saying you do n't remember holding that child of Miss Hunter ? "
" I 'm saying you asked me about that photograph .
I do n't know anything about that photograph , I do n't know who that baby is .
I do n't know if the picture has been altered , manufactured , if it 's a picture of me taken some other time , holding another baby … I have no idea .
I was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken I can tell you that . "
Edwards finally told Woodruff that he did not remember a baby being present at the meeting last month in California .
Edwards blamed the affair on the adulation surrounding his remarkable rise into presidential politics .
" I went from being a senator , a young senator to being considered for vice president , running for president , being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure .
All of which fed a self - focus , an egotism , a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want .
You 're invincible .
And there will be no consequences . "
According to friends of Hunter , Edwards met her at a New York city bar in 2006 .
His political action committee later paid her $ 114,000 to produce campaign website documentaries despite her lack of experience .
Edwards said the affair began during the campaign after she was hired .
Hunter traveled with Edwards around the country and to Africa .
When the National Enquirer first reported the alleged Edwards - Hunter affair last October 11 , Edwards , his campaign staff and Hunter vociferously denounced the report .
" The story is false , it 's completely untrue , it 's ridiculous , " Edwards told reporters then .
He repeated his denials just two weeks ago .
Edwards today admitted the National Enquirer was correct when it reported he had visited Hunter at the Beverly Hills Hilton last month .
Edwards made a point of telling Woodruff that his wife 's cancer was in remission when he began the affair with Hunter .
Elizabeth Edwards has since been diagnosed with an incurable form of the disease .
Edwards was asked whether he loved Hunter .
" I'm in love with one woman , " he responded .
" I 've been in love with one woman for 31 years .
She is the finest human being I have ever known . "
The former senator was asked why his wife was not by his side as he made the admissions about his affair to ABC News .
" I have seen these public figures who bring their wives along when they say they 've done something wrong ; confessing some wrong and the wife -- they bring their wives to stand beside them I guess , to show support … Elizabeth did n't do anything wrong .
I … did n't ask for her to be here .
I asked for her not to be here .
Uh , this is my responsibility ; my alone .
I have to be the man and take responsibility . "
Earlier in the interview , Edwards described his experiences in personal , visceral terms .
" I am imperfect , " he said .
" And anybody , anybody watching this broadcast or who hears about this who wants to beat me up for this , they should have at it .
The truth is -- you can't possibly beat me up more than I have already beaten myself up . "

Enlarge By Gerald Herbert , AP Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej looks on as President Bush signs a guest book upon his arrival by at the Government House in Bangkok , Thailand , on Wednesday .
BANGKOK  President Bush will express his " deep concerns " over China 's record on human rights and religious freedom on the eve of his trip to Beijing for the Olympic Games .
" The people of China deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings , " Bush will declare in a speech here Thursday , according to an advance text released by the White House .
" So America stands in firm opposition to China 's detention of political dissidents , human rights advocates , and religious activists . "
Before the speech , Bush had said he was reluctant to mix politics with the Olympics , saying he wanted to show respect for his Chinese hosts and to simply enjoy the Games as a sports fan .
He repeatedly said he " did n't need the Olympics " to speak candidly in private to China 's leaders about his human rights concerns .
Brad Adams , Asia director for the activist group Human Rights Watch , called the speech " a welcome reversal ...
Politics are intrinsically involved in the Olympics .
To buy into the notion that this is just a sporting event is just silly .
Beijing was awarded the Olympics as a political gesture " to a rising economic power .
Even in the speech , Bush will emphasize that he is n't looking for a spat with the communist leadership in Beijing : " We speak out for a free press , freedom of assembly , and labor rights not to antagonize China 's leaders , but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for China to develop its full potential , " Bush will say .
" And we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs , but to allow the Chinese people to express theirs . "
" Ultimately , " Bush will say , " only China can decide what course it will follow . "
Sharon Hom , executive director of Human Rights in China , said Bush 's comments demonstrate " some leadership .
No one was saying no to China . "
But she added that it's also Bush 's " balancing act , " saying he 'll go to the Olympics " but I 'll be critical outside China . "
Hours after delivering the speech Thursday , Bush will fly to Beijing for the Games .
Separately , White House press secretary Dana Perino said on Wednesday the U.S. would protest China 's decision to deny a visa for former Olympic speed skater Joey Cheek , who was planning to travel to Beijing to urge that the Chinese government help make peace in the war - torn Darfur section of Sudan .
" We are taking the matter very seriously , " Perino said .
" We would hope that they would change their minds . "
Bush is making his ninth — and perhaps last — trip to Asia as president with stops in South Korea , Thailand and China .
At press conference Wednesday in Seoul with South Korean President Lee Myung Bak , Bush said that North Korea could leave the " axis of evil " and shed its pariah state status if dictator Kim Jong
Il came clean on his country 's nuclear weapons programs and ended human rights abuses .
" It 's his choice to make , " Bush said .
TUESDAY : Prayers , protests greet Bush in S. Korea
The United States has offered to remove North Korea from its list of countries that sponsor terrorism as early as this coming weekend .
But Bush said North Korea must meet " many more obligations " before the United States erases it from the terrorism blacklist , primarily its commitment to verify the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program .
Bush said he was encouraged that North Korea had destroyed the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant in June .
" That 's kind of the ultimate verification , is n't it ? " he said .
But Bush said the reclusive Stalinist state still needed to disclose more information about its plutonium and uranium enrichment programs and what it was doing to end them .
" They 've got a lot to do , " he said .
In his 2002 state of the union message , Bush labeled North Korea , Iran and Saddam Hussein 's Iraq members of the " axis of evil . "
On Wednesday , Bush said , " My hope is that the ' axis of evil ' list no longer exists .
That 's my hope , for the sake of peace .
And it 's my hope for the sake of our children . "
Appearing with Lee Wednesday , Bush also urged the U.S. Congress to ratify a free trade agreement his administration negotiated with South Korea last year .
The deal would end duties on 95 % of consumer and industrial products the countries sell each other within three years and end most other tariffs within 10 years .
Opponents , including the AFL - CIO and other labor unions , say the deal will destroy American jobs .
" I am worried about the protectionist signals coming out of the U.S. Congress , " Bush said .
" Let Congress , people in Congress , declare one way or the other whether they 're for open markets and free and fair trade . "

The push toward electronic medical records has made storing personal health information in a locked filing cabinet in your doctor 's office an outmoded guarantee of confidentiality .
Today , patients can gather their jumbled health information — hospital visits , drug prescriptions and health insurance plans — and manage them through a number of different online services , including Google Health , Microsoft 's HealthVault and AOL co-founder Steve Case 's Revolution Health .
Privacy advocates , however , point out that even though these companies are storing sensitive medical information , they are not bound by the strict data sharing and protection laws that govern the health care industry .
The 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) regulates how health care entities , such as insurance companies and hospitals , exchange an individual 's health information , but the law does not apply to personal health record storage services , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
Because there are no laws that directly protect a user 's online health information , all of the vendors who sell weight scales and / or blood glucose and pressure monitors that can send data directly to services like HealthVault set their own privacy policies , which means some will be weaker than others .
" There is n't anyone to regulate the security and privacy of the personal health information records , " says Deven McGraw , director of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology , a nonprofit Washington , D.C. –based public advocacy group that focuses on the impact of technology on individual rights .
" It is not a very good landscape for consumers in regards to very sensitive health information . "

Then he typed up a menu ( “ a fun amalgamation of somewhat bumbling nouvelle - Italian recipes ” ) , put together a wine list , and submitted both to Wine Spectator–along with the $ 250 fee .
The list was approved and given an Award of Excellence ( see screenshot ) .
Then Goldstein decided to add a twist .
To the tape :
Itâ€™s troubling , of course , that a restaurant that doesnâ€™t exist could win an Award of Excellence .
But itâ€™s also troubling that the award doesnâ€™t seem to be particularly tied to the quality of the wine list , even by Wine Spectatorâ€™s own standards .
Although the main wine list that I submitted was made up of fairly standard Italian - focused selections , Osteria Lâ€ ™Intrepidoâ€™s â€œreserve wine listâ€ was largely chosen from among the lowest - scoring Italian wines in Wine Spectator over the past 20 years .
Click through for the list complete with WS annotations and scores .
Reached by phone today , Goldstein said that he also presented this information at the annual meeting of the American Association of Wine Economists in Portland over the weekend .
“ I did n’t have any empirical evidence of the quality of the restaurants other than my own impressions , ” he said .
“ I wanted to see what the standards of the Awards of Excellence were .
The results speak for themselves . ”
His experience will be part of an academic paper he is working on about standards for wine awards .
In 2003 , Amanda Hesser explored the Wine Spectator restaurant awards in a piece in the Times entitled “ A Wine Award That Seems Easy to Come By . ”
She concluded that the 3,573 restaurants that year grossed Wine Spectator $ 625,275 .
But the annual application fee then was $ 175 as opposed to the $ 250 that Goldstein and others paid for their application fee this year .
Iraq is casting a long shadow over the US presidential race , and with relative calm in the country the candidates are debating how fast US troops should quit Iraq .
Senator Barack Obama ’s 16 - month timetable for withdrawal has the backing of Iraqi leaders , and the Bush administration itself now endorses a “ time horizon ” for troop cuts .
But absent from the debate has been any discussion of the fate of nearly 21,000 prisoners held in Iraq by US forces .
Obama and his Republican rival Senator John McCain ought to start talking now about what to do with detainees in US military custody in Iraq .
The US - led Multinational Force - Iraq ( MNF ) has claimed the authority to hold the detainees under successive UN Security Council Resolutions , the last of which expires at the end of the year .
Prospects for a status - of - forces agreement ( SOFA ) and related pacts that might fill the legal void are clouded by the Bush administration ’s lame duck status .
The detainees – all Iraqis , save for a small number of foreigners – are effectively denied their basic right not to be held indefinitely without charge or trial .
Many are young men rounded up in mass , arbitrary arrests .
They are promised a review of their cases every six months , though the MNF has told Human Rights Watch reviews are more frequent in practice .
Yet on average , detainees remain in custody for more than 300 days , according to MNF figures as of May .
The detainees , divided between a remote prison near Basra and a smaller one near Baghdad ’s airport , have little access to relatives , who in many cases cannot afford to visit or fear reprisal .
Although about a tenth of detainees face charges in an Iraqi criminal court ; the vast majority are never charged .
The MNF has argued that the detainees are held as imperative security threats , and are not entitled to criminal due process .
International law does indeed allow for administrative detention , but the United States has not even met the basic requirements for holding people under such circumstances .
The cases are reviewed by military panels , with no meaningful access to legal counsel and no judicial review – both of which detainees are entitled to under international law .
There are 360 children among the detainees , down from 500 in May .
Many have been held for months , and some for more than a year , often without access to the educational services provided to children at one MNF facility .
Those children referred to trial by the MNF are held at an Iraqi facility described by the UN as so overcrowded it threatens the children ’s health .
Few would dispute that the conditions of US military detention have improved since the images of shocking abuse that emerged in 2004 from the Abu Ghraib prison .
It ’s also clear that , however vigorous MNF attempts to expedite detainee releases this population is not going anywhere soon .
The outgoing head of US detainee operations estimated in June that 10,000 people had been released through expanded review procedures introduced in September 2007 , yet the overall population is only slowly falling from its peak near 26,000 in 2007 .
Britain , Washington ’s principal partner in the invasion of Iraq , has all but ended its role as a jailer in Iraq – Foreign Office officials say UK forces now have two detainees in the country – leaving the US military as the face of foreign military detention in Iraq .
In the wrangle over a bilateral agreement that would govern the presence of US troops in Iraq , the meaning of Iraqi sovereignty looms large .
Much of Iraq ’s political class rejects the idea of an open - ended US military presence ( no easy sell ahead of provincial elections scheduled for this year ) , advocating a short - term agreement and possible negotiations with the next administration .
The Bush administration appears to accept that possibility .
All parties to this debate should back up their rhetoric about Iraqi sovereignty by ending the legal vacuum in which the MNF holds detainees .
A step in that direction would be a US - Iraqi agreement to bring the status of these detainees in line with international human rights law and the laws of war for conflicts like the one in Iraq .
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which Iraq has ratified , requires among other things that detainees face a judge promptly , and have prompt access to legal counsel and family members .
Such a commitment should encourage the Iraqi authorities to improve their own poor record on detention and abuse of detainees .
The United States should also release at once detainees unlikely to be charged , and transfer others against whom there is evidence for criminal proceedings to Iraqi courts – with the safeguard that no one should be transferred there if they are at risk of abuse .
The US presidential candidates are now jockeying to claim victory for their Iraq plans .
Both should commit to ending the legal limbo of detention in Iraq , by upholding international legal standards in Iraq and restoring justice to the thousands wrongly held .

Beliefs that our bodies need detoxification , that drinking lots of water can flush away toxins and help jump start a weight loss diet , and that “ life coaches ” calling themselves nutritionists are licensed health professionals , all came together for one woman with heartbreaking results .
Even water is not harmless .
As the BBC reports :
Woman left brain damaged by detox
A woman has been awarded more than £ 800,000 after she suffered permanent brain damage while on a detox diet .
The High Court heard Dawn Page , 52 , began vomiting uncontrollably after starting The Amazing Hydration Diet .
Mrs Page , from Oxfordshire , later had an epileptic seizure which damaged her memory , speech and concentration .
Her nutritionist Barbara Nash has denied any wrongdoing and the High Court ratified the settlement without mention of liability ... when she started vomiting Mrs Nash told her it was a normal part of the detoxification process ...
Her husband Geoff , 54 , said ... his wife had previously tried several other diets and had been told to drink four pints of water a day by Mrs Nash ...
' Nonsense ' .
Detox diets are based on the theory that toxins from " unhealthy " food and drink build up in the body and can lead to health problems .
Purging those toxins - through restricted diets , lots of water or using particular supplements - is meant to leave people feeling better and , often , thinner ...
Dr Andrew Wadge , of the Food Standards Agency , has branded detox regimes " nonsense " and said the body has its own system of getting rid of toxins - the liver .
Dieticians are regulated by law in the UK , but nutritionists and nutritional therapists are not ...
As the Times added :
Mrs Nash , who calls herself a “ nutritional therapist and life coach ” , denies any fault and the settlement was concluded without admission of liability .
Mrs Nash ’s insurance company will pay the damages .
In September 2001 Mrs Page paid Mrs Nash £ 50 for an initial consultation .
She said that she was advised to drink four pints of mineral water per day as well as the tea and other fluids that she normally drank .
After a few days she started vomiting but was allegedly assured by Mrs Nash that it was “ all part of the detoxification process ” .
Mrs Page , who weighed 12 stone ( 76kg ) , was even urged to increase her water intake to six pints a day and cut her salt intake further ...
The credentials of her nutritionist and life coach , according to the Guardian , came from a diploma from the College of Natural Nutrition in Tiverton , Devon .
You ’ll note that the college offers diplomas in complementary medicine .
Its latest newsletter even warns of the dangers of invisible WiFi and electromagnetic radiation .
Seeking medical and health advice from your own trusted healthcare provider , rather than a third party whose credentials , expertise and interests you do n’t know , is a valuable take - home lesson .
This cautionary note applies for us , too , and those faceless life coaches and wellness coaches that call from wellness programs or health advisors on the internet .
There ’s a lot of woo out there .
A computer has been stolen from the constituency office of Communities Secretary Hazel Blears , it was revealed today .
The machine contained material from the Department for Communities and Local Government and details relating to her constituency work .
It was taken from her office in Salford 's Working Class Movement Library on Saturday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A Government spokesman stressed that no personal details were among the departmental information .
" There was a break - in at the constituency office of Hazel Blears on the afternoon of Saturday , June 14 .
Hazel was not there at the time , " a spokesman said .
" The thief broke in through a window , triggering the building 's security alarm .
A PC ( personal computer ) was stolen .
Nothing else was taken .
" We understand the building 's security staff arrived within minutes .
" The PC was primarily used for Hazel 's constituency business and contained some details of her constituency work .
" The PC also contained some material from the department .
None of the departmental material included sensitive personal data about the public or would be of use to criminals .
" The PC did not contain any secret or top secret information and the contents of the PC are protected and clearly this is now subject to a routine police investigation . "
The Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said : " The news that a Government minister may have been directly responsible for the loss of data relating to extremism is extremely alarming .
It comes after a series of security breaches over which Government appears not to have regained control .
" The Government must urgently clarify what happened in this case .
If Hazel Blears has breached security rules in relation to material she has handled , Parliament must be told exactly how and why this has occurred . "

The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Cabinet ministers have just ticked off their civil servants about security lapses , but now Hazel Blears shows that the rot starts at the top .
" This is the third breach of secrecy in a week .
The Government has to get a grip on the slap - dash culture of sloppiness that threatens national security . "
Last week a Cabinet Office official was suspended and an investigation launched after secret papers featuring details of al - Qa'ida and security in Iraq were left on a train .
And the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is to be called before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee after Treasury papers relating to plans to tackle funding for global terrorism were also found on a train .
A defiant President Robert Mugabe yesterday vowed he would ' go to war ' if he lost the presidential run -off due to take place in less than two weeks .
Describing the opposition as ' traitors ' , he claimed Zimbabwe would never ' be lost ' again .
Speaking at the burial of a veteran of the independence war , Mugabe said he would never accept the Movement for Democratic Change taking over .
' It shall never happen ... as long as I am alive and those who fought for the country are alive , ' he said .
' We are prepared to fight for our country and to go to war for it . '
The threat was seen as an angry response to the pressure mounting on the government from other African leaders over the regime 's harassment of the MDC leadership and supporters in the run up to the 27 June election .
Yesterday , MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was arrested again and held for three hours as he tried to campaign in the countryside .
There was also a stand - off between lawyers and police in Harare 's high court before Tsvangirai 's deputy , Tendai Biti , finally appeared before a judge .
Earlier , according to opposition lawyer Lewis Uriri , police had told the judge , Justice Ben Hlatshwayo , that they did not think his order to produce Biti in court was genuine .
A handcuffed Biti eventually told reporters that he was ' fine ' .
Police said he faced treason charges - which carries the death penalty - stemming from a document they claim was a blueprint for regime change .
He is also accused of spreading false information for releasing the opposition 's own tally from the first vote in March .
With the MDC leadership under constant harassment , voters being beaten and killed and what amounts to a curfew in some MDC rural strongholds , the likelihood of the 27 June run-off taking place in any meaningful way seems remote .
Even if the 9,231 polling stations open , there is a shortage of officers prepared to risk monitoring them .
The number of international observers the government intends to let in remains unclear .
Although the first of the 400 monitors for the Southern African Development Community have arrived , they have yet to be accredited by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission , whose own status is weakening - a memo from police chief Faustino Mazango , leaked to the Zimbabwean Independent newspaper , ordered his officers to take charge of the ' whole voting process ' .
Police had been , he said , ' too docile ' during the March poll .
Rini Chipfunde , director of the leading independent monitoring group , the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , said the authorities were creating an environment in which only police , soldiers and ruling party officials would be present at polling stations in rural areas .
' People will be too terrified to vote , ' she said .
' Others may be bussed in by the ruling party to cast their ballots under the watchful eye of police officers . '
Sources across Zimbabwe have reported an increasing number of roadblocks manned by militias and war veterans , effectively cutting people off and creating a dusk - to - dawn curfew .
James McGee , US ambassador in Harare , said 30,000 potential MDC voters had fled their constituencies .
Mugabe has already ordered charities to stop work , leaving millions struggling to find food in the collapsed economy .
A total of 67 people have been killed and tactics familiar from past state violence campaigns are returning - sticks rolled with barbed wire , whippings and arson .
The internationally - touted ' third way ' - a Government of National Unity - has been met with stiff opposition from the military , Zanu - PF and many in the opposition who want no truck with Mugabe .
Andrea Sibanda , of Matabeleland Freedom Party said : ' Whoever is floating the idea of GNU with Mugabe and Zanu - PF must be coming from another planet .
How does one unite with them when their hands are dripping with blood of their kith and kin ? '
In an interview with The Observer , Jabulani Sibanda , the Zimbabwe Liberation War Veterans Association chairman , also ruled out a national unity government .
He said : ' We do not want the West interfering in the affairs of the country and so we are going to vote for total independence .
As long as we have a government voted for by the people , there is no problem .
In fact , we are still to take more farms because there are some white farmers protected by party heavyweights holding on to land that belongs to the black majority . '

On December 19 , 2006 , Alexander Hatcher received about $ 15,000 in disability payments from Social Security .
Diagnosed as bipolar and schizophrenic , Hatcher was off his meds and homeless , and the money was a dangerous windfall .
He took two friends , female prostitutes , to buy cigarettes , clothes , booze and drugs .
The trio traveled to the Downtowner Inn , a motel on the southwest side of downtown .
One of the women took cash and was supposed to pay for a week .
Sometime after sunrise , after a night of smoking crack , Hatcher and his friends left the room to resupply .
According to a police report , it was raining .
The group returned to the motel and encountered the manager , who demanded payment because the woman had paid for only one night .
Frightened , the prostitutes returned to the streets and Hatcher went back to his room .
The manager called the police .
Hatcher believes he called his mother , who told him to barricade himself inside the room .
( His mother does not remember the phone call ) .
He moved some furniture in front of the door and began filling the bathtub .
By the time officers began knocking , water overflowed on the bathroom floor and Hatcher would not open the door .
Officers burst in , and , according to the police report , they found the bed , dresser , coffee table and chairs broken .
Water had damaged the carpet and sheetrock .
Hatcher was arrested for criminal mischief and booked into Harris County Jail .
It only got worse from there .
For whatever reason , Hatcher did n't receive medication for the first three months of his stay , which made him , if anything , more out of control .
Put in general population , Hatcher , who is openly gay , soon gained a reputation for causing problems ( deserved ) and for being infected with the HIV virus ( not true ) .
Other inmates called him a faggot and coward and threatened to beat him up , and when Hatcher complained , the guards shuffled him from cell block to cell block , still within the general population .
A mug shot from May 2007 shows he was seriously injured in jail .
His right eye is cut and swollen , resulting in permanent damage to his eyesight .
Hatcher was a spitter , a screamer , a scratcher and was put on suicide watch at least once .
When he was locked in a solitary cell , he threw his own excrement on deputies , detention officers , nurses and psych techs .
He managed to rack up five additional felonies against him — ranging from assault to harassment of a public servant — when he kept getting into fights with the deputies in the jail .
" No one had ever seen a case where a client picks up that many cases , " said Mark Hochglaube , the court - appointed attorney who initially handled Hatcher 's case .
Workers inside the jail who talked to the Houston Press on the condition of anonymity describe Hatcher as an inmate who fell through the cracks of a troubled jail system , his mental state deteriorating without the proper medication .
His charges , they say , are as much the jail 's failing as Hatcher's .
The state prosecuted Hatcher on one of the assault charges in July and he was convicted .
The jury , during the punishment phase , heard about the four other ­infractions .
Alexander Hatcher got sentenced to 53 years in prison .
As his mom puts it : Murderers do n't get sentences that long .
" They said I acted like I was the devil , " Hatcher , 51 , said through a speaker box in the jail visitation room at 1200 Baker St. " I do n't know if I did or did n't , but I was n't in the right state of mind .
I 'm a very sick ­person . "

Right now , the Harris County Jail has just finished another bout of being investigated by the federal government .
Twice this summer , investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice went to the jail , and two deputies have been fired for lying about their role in an inmate 's death .
In that case , a deputy used a choke hold on an inmate who was injured and died .
A supervisor wrote a false report about the death .
" We 've presented that case to the grand jury , and I think there 's a better than 50/50 chance that they 'll be indicted , " says Mike Smith , chief deputy at the jail .
The Justice Department wo n't comment about what prompted the investigation , but a spokeswoman said that investigators are part of a team that examines jails to protect the " constitutional rights of pretrial detainees and inmates . "
The jail was the target of another investigation when Hatcher arrived .
It started in summer 2005 , when lawyers at Advocacy , Inc. , an advocate group for people who are disabled and mentally ill , received high numbers of calls from inmates complaining about not receiving their medication .
The lawyers started an investigation .
Officials at the jail initially tried to deny access to Advocacy , Inc. , so the group sued the county .
Before the lawsuit went to trial , an agreement was reached with the sheriff 's department .
Investigators from Advocacy were allowed to enter the jail unannounced , and were given access to inmates and jail records .
Investigators found the jail in disarray .
For instance , the sheriff 's department employed mental health workers through a contract with the Mental Health Mental Retardation Authority of Harris County .
But it was discovered that mentally ill inmates were placed in solitary cells for extended periods without medical care or visits from MHMRA doctors .
" People who are mentally ill , when they are separated , they tend to deteriorate more , which means a longer stay in jail , " says Sarah Guidrey , a managing attorney with Advocacy , Inc .
The jail had one cell block for mentally ill inmates — beds for 27 males and 26 females — and there were also ten cells known as rubber rooms , designed for inmates in fits of psychosis .
Some of the rubber rooms were filled with unwanted office furniture .
By the time Hatcher was booked , the fallout from the investigation was resulting in changes in the jail .
More psychologists and psychiatrists and social workers , as well as nurses and pharmacists , were added to the jail staff .
Space for mentally ill inmates was expanded from one cell block to four , taking up half the second floor with room for about 200 inmates .
Walls were painted creamy white and a soft emerald green .
Uniforms for the guards were changed to polo shirts and cargo pants , designed to comfort mentally ill inmates who associated cop uniforms with pain .
About $ 1 million was spent on structural changes , including a nurse 's station inside one of the cell blocks , so meds would n't have to be brought over from the medical unit .
Caging was added to the upper floors , so , as one deputy put it , " inmates wo n't take a head dive , which some have tried . "
The jail signed a contract with the Harris County Psychiatric Center to provide 24 additional beds outside the jail .
" We 're still going in , but it 's amazing all the changes that have occurred in the last year and a half , " Guidry says .
" They 've been in more rapid speed than I ­anticipated . "
A new Mental Health Unit was also formed , with deputies and detention officers given training in mental illness and paid an extra $ 150 a month .
An emphasis was placed on defusing situations verbally instead of physically .
Workers who talked to the Press agree that the changes are positive but that problems still exist .
For instance , inmates are sometimes placed in solitary cells for punishment , instead of medical need , they say .
" That 's where Alexander really hit the wall , " one worker says .

Florence Hatcher sometimes blames herself for her son's troubles .
When Hatcher was nine , Florence sent him to California to live with an aunt who had no children .
The Hatchers ' home in Galveston was too crowded with eight other children , and Florence thought Alexander would enjoy the change .
He did .
For almost eight years , her son flourished in California .
At 16 , he took a job as a bank teller .
A year later , his father was injured on his job at a Galveston shipyard .
The amount of disability money the family received increased with the number of children living in the household .
Florence , now 70 , made her son move back to Texas .
" He always faulted me for doing that , " Florence says .
" He always said , ' For $ 37 you made me come back ? ' "
The Moody Foundation in Galveston gave Hatcher a scholarship when he graduated high school , and he spent his freshman and sophomore years at Prairie View A&M .
Police busted Hatcher for the first time when he was 19 , during a trip home from Prairie View , when he was caught with a group of guys stealing clothes from a Foley 's department store .
" We had rolled back down to Galveston , and my problem is , I want to be accepted , " Hatcher says .
" I had come to terms that I do n't have any friends unless I have something . "
Florence hired an attorney and the charge was eventually dropped .
Hatcher was arrested again seven years later for breaking into an office building , and he was sentenced to probation .
One evening , not long after the arrest , Hatcher attended a party where he danced all night , which he loved to do .
Walking back to his family 's house , he stepped in a pothole , twisted his leg and fell .
Thinking he was not injured , Hatcher continued home .
By the time he reached the house , his knee had swollen enormously and Florence drove him to the emergency room .
A ligament in his knee was damaged , and Hatcher required surgery .
The recovery was long , and Hatcher spent most of the time in a hospital bed and slipped into a deep depression .
Hatcher told a nurse about visions and suicide , and he was examined by a hospital psychiatrist .
At 29 , Hatcher was diagnosed as bipolar and schizophrenic .
He moved in and out of mental hospitals in Galveston over the next several years .
" They drilled me so much that when I felt like I was going to have an episode , I should go to the hospital .
So that 's what I did , " Hatcher says .
" When I get off my medication , I go through these hills .
Everyone is after Alexander , and I 'm very , very careless with myself .
I 'm just really off the chain .
Once I get my medicine , I stabilize , and I can take care of myself . "
Encouraged by his doctors , Hatcher moved out of his parents ' house into ­government - subsidized housing , the Magnolia Homes in Galveston .
Hatcher soon stopped taking his medication , and was found by Galveston police in the parking lot of the apartments , screaming as loud as he could .
" They said I was going to harm somebody , that I was talking about I was going to kill all the babies , " Hatcher says .
" Something about the babies , the little babies .
So they arrested me . "
Hatcher was arrested for criminal mischief , and instead of jail , a judge sent Hatcher to Austin State Hospital , which serves patients with mental illness .
Two years later , doctors released Hatcher and he returned to Galveston .
Florence says her son started hanging out with the wrong people , and Hatcher began using cocaine and crack .
In 1993 , he was arrested for possession of cocaine and sentenced to 15 years in state prison .
He served six before being released on parole .
His father 's health deteriorated while Hatcher was away , and the day of his release , Hatcher returned to Galveston with plans to move back with his family .
He told his father he wanted to find work and help out .
The next day , his father died .
Hatcher 's older brother died of a heart attack a couple years later , and shortly after , a younger brother died of complications from AIDS .
" I can't say he 's ever recovered , " Florence says .
In 2005 , Hatcher became involved with the New Start program in Houston .
The program , funded by MHMRA , is designed as a drug rehab program for people with mental illness .
He attended classes daily and had access to doctors who established a steady regimen of meds .
For more than a year , Hatcher thrived at New Start .
He was provided an apartment with other patients .
Hatcher 's mother visited when she could , and she once attended an outdoor barbecue for the patients .
In February 2006 , Hatcher 's doctor filled out paperwork for Hatcher to receive a discounted fare on Metro buses .
The doctor listed Hatcher 's disability — schizophrenia and paranoia — as permanent .
A few months later , Hatcher rode the bus across town to Acres Homes to attend a party for his cousin 's 105th birthday .
Hatcher beams a smile in photographs taken by his mother .
" It was beautiful at New Start , " Hatcher says .
" I was a great asset , as well as it was a great asset to me .
I knew that I was somebody , and very important .
They just give you so much good affirmation . "
That winter , Hatcher filed a complaint against a woman living at his apartment complex , because he believed she was beating other patients .
After a shouting match with the women , Hatcher was asked to leave his apartment .
A few weeks later , he headed for the Downtowner Inn .
_____________________
Each inmate entering the jail goes through a lengthy interview process with five different screeners .
Inmates are asked questions about their medical and mental health history .
The process , which can take as long as a day , is described by jail officials as a safety net designed to keep sick inmates out of general population .
Hatcher , whose mental illness had been documented for 21 years , was passed from screener to screener without as much as a speed bump .
After months without medication , Hatcher was transferred to the new psychiatric unit , after a deputy saw him talking to a wall , asking for a glass of water .
Some cells in the psych unit have nothing more than a hole in the floor for a toilet , and Hatcher 's cell sometimes had no running water .
When the hole clogged with paper , his urine and feces created a slop that covered the floor .
According to a worker inside the jail who agreed to talk to the Press , nurses and psych techs started ignoring Hatcher 's calls for help .
The worker says Hatcher weighed " about 100 pounds sopping wet , " and looked extremely ill .
Nurses reported Hatcher sticking his arm out of a slot in the door and trying to grab them as they walked by .
Still unable to get attention , Hatcher began scooping up the muddy mixture in his cell and flinging it at anyone who walked by , hitting several officers in the face and mouth .
A psych tech entered Hatcher 's cell to clean , and according to an officer 's report — who was second to enter the cell —
Hatcher hit the tech in the face , causing his head to jerk back .
The deputy and psych tech grappled with Hatcher and slipped to the floor , splashing in urine and feces .
The deputy filed a complaint , and Hatcher was charged with felony assault .
There were other fights with guards .
One started when Hatcher would not turn over his towel to a deputy on laundry day , and another time , Hatcher went after a nurse in the medical unit and had to be subdued .
According to Major Don McWilliams , the jail 's inspector general , Hatcher gathered 111 " caution texts , " disciplinary write - ups not serious enough for state charges .
McWilliams says it 's unusual for an inmate to be charged with as many felonies as Hatcher , but he added that the incidents " were not good situations . "
" Alexander has been a real problem since he hit the door here , " McWilliams says .
" We really do n't want Alexander to stay in here any longer than is absolutely necessary .
We 'd like to send him on to the state .
He is a chronically , labor - intensive , pain in the ass . "
In October 2007 , Hatcher was sent to Rusk State Hospital for 120 days .
Records from the hospital show that he was admitted as paranoid and delusional .
After a few weeks , his condition improved .
Hatcher says the workers at Rusk " did n't hold a grudge against you tomorrow for something you did yesterday . "
Doctors prescribed Invega , Cogentin and Klonipin — psychotropic drugs — and Hatcher stabilized , eventually given a job cleaning tables in the hospital 's cafeteria .
Since returning to Harris County Jail in February of this year , Hatcher 's disciplinary record has been clean .
" When I first saw him , I stood way away from the door , and he could n't understand why .
I told him , ' Mr. Hatcher , you 're not really a nice person . '
He did hit those people , he did all those things , " a worker at the jail says .
" Now , some of the assaults were provoked , because it 's like they do n't understand , or they do n't care that these people are mentally ill . "
_____________________
According to Mike Smith , the chief deputy at the jail , about 1,900 of the jail 's 11,000 inmates are provided with psychotropic drugs , making the jail the largest provider of mental health services in the state .
But dealing with mental illness as a larger issue , Smith says , is not the jail 's job .
" I wish they could get their mental health care somewhere else , but that 's not my call , " Smith says .
" They get caught doing some petty - ass crime , they get stuck in jail and this is where they get their treatment .
They get pretty leveled out , and what do we do with them ?
I can't hold them after their charge runs out , so we dump them back on the street . "
Mentally ill inmates are treated similarly to other inmates , Smith says , and if a crime is committed in jail , the inmate must face the consequences .
" I have high blood pressure , that does n't excuse me from knocking the crap out of you .
I got to keep that under control , " he says .
The same attitude is taken with deputies who break the rules , Smith says , pointing to the recent deputy firings as an example .
" We 're not saying none of this ever happens , that would be naive , but a lot of this is blown out of proportion , " Smith says .
" These complaints become more and more outlandish .
We 've had people say , ' I was hurt , ' and I say , ' How 'd you get hurt ?
Where 'd you get hurt ?
You do n't have any signs of it . '
They 'll go , ' Oh well , fuck you , ' and we 'll never see them again . "
Hatcher was definitely hurt in jail .
He now wears black , jail - issued glasses for the damage to his eyes , which required treatment at Ben Taub Hospital .
It 's unclear which incident caused those injuries , but Hatcher filed a grievance with the jail in March , shortly after the first assault charges were filed .
" He beat me in facial parts , kick , and used unprofessional slander towards me , " Hatcher wrote .
However , one of the workers at the jail who talked to the Press said that the deputies , as easy as they are to vilify , are a necessary evil — even more so in the mental health unit .
A mental health worker can be disciplined for as little as raising his voice to an inmate , and if a patient becomes aggressive , deputies are needed .
" All they have is intimidation .
If they do n't intimidate someone into complying , we are all screwed , " the worker says .
However , the worker says that the line is often crossed .
And in Hatcher 's case , the physical force might have been necessary , but was often excessive .
" He could have had bruises from being subdued and bruises from the handcuffs , " the worker says .
" But all the facial stuff , what was that about ? "
Still , " I can understand the deputies because none of us are safe if they can't get control , " the worker says .
" I do n't care if the sheriff 's department treated him terribly .
I do n't care if they trumped up the charges .
I do n't care if the world fell apart in here .
Between the attorney and the court , someone should have made sense of it .
The court should have done better than that . "

Mark Hochglaube , Hatcher 's court - appointed attorney , planned to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity .
" There are moments he is totally out of control .
And that 's why , to me , the insanity defense was accurate .
Even though he might be sane on Tuesday , he could be insane on Wednesday and then go back to being sane on Thursday .
His mental illness was that volatile . "
Hatcher was examined by the state in summer 2007 by Dr. Matthew Leddy , a MHMRA psychiatrist .
Leddy said in his professional opinion , Hatcher was competent to stand trial .
A second evaluation by an outside doctor was ordered by the court , at Hochglaube 's request .
Dr. Joe Peraino , a private - practice pyschiatrist , examined Hatcher and said he was incompetent for trial .
During a conference call between the attorneys and doctors , Hochglaube says , Leddy agreed that it would be best to send Hatcher to Rusk before trial .
( Leddy refused to comment on the case , citing patient confidentiality . )
Prosecutors started offering plea deals to Hochglaube , and the best , he says , was a ten - year sentence .
" My thought was that I might be able to beat one or two of these charges , but I probably was n't going to beat every single one .
And it was 25 to life on each one , " Hochglaube says .
" We started filling out the plea paperwork , but then Alexander did n't want it .
It may sound like I had a lot of influence over him , but the reality was that I did n't .
He was a very difficult person to communicate with . "
Hatcher became disillusioned with Hochglaube and fired him .
Hatcher called his mother and asked her to contact James M. Sims , a longtime defender in Harris County , and for $ 7,000 , Sims took the case , also arguing the insanity defense .
" Peraino said that at the time of the series of crimes , [ Hatcher ] was criminally insane , " Sims says .
" Based upon that , I had no choice but to try it .
I 'd be derelict as a lawyer if I ignored that . "
Sims consulted George Parnham before the trial , because Parnham , who defended Andrea Yates , the mother who drowned her five children in a bathtub and who on retrial was found not guilty by reason of insanity , often takes on criminal insanity cases .
He currently has a client in Louisiana who stabbed herself and her child after a pastor told her that psych medications were not necessary .
The insanity defense is used in about 1 percent of felony cases in Texas , and the defendant wins about 20 percent of the time , according to Parnham .
He believes that the defense can actually be used too often .
" What I 'm opposed to is lawyers using criminal insanity as a throw - down , when there appears to be no other defense , " Parnham says .
" It hurts our credibility . "
The defense appeared to have merit in Hatcher 's case , Parnham told Sims , especially since Hatcher had a long , documented history of mental ­illness .
Still , winning the case would be difficult , and one of the hardest aspects of a case , Parnham says , is convincing jurors that defendants are n't faking .
He gave Sims a questionnaire to hand out to potential jurors .
Questions included :
" How do you feel about psychiatrists and psychologists ? "
" Do you consider yourself liberal ?
Conservative ?
Moderate ? "
" Have you , your spouse , or relative ever been under the care of a psychiatrist , psychologist , or other mental health professional ? "
According to Sims , the first juror he questioned said , " I do n't believe in criminal insanity . "
In July of this year , Hatcher was examined by state doctors again and was found to be competent , and a couple days later , Hatcher 's trial began .
The assault charge the state chose to prosecute was based on a complaint filed in September 2007 , when Hatcher was waiting to be transferred to Rusk .
The defense was minimal .
According to Hatcher , Sims told him to " act retarded . "
The sole witness for Hatcher was Peraino , who had evaluated Hatcher again several months before the trial .
Peraino would not comment about the case , but in a letter written to Judge Susan Brown , who presided over the case , Peraino wrote :
" [ Hatcher ] appeared to be in a similar mental state to that upon discharge from Rusk State Hospital with the exception of being depressed .
He did not admit to having the delusions he previously reported ... ( " I have powers and visions .
My dream is to become an international star for a third world country ... I come from royalty from South Africa ... kings and queens ..
My dream is become [ sic ] the first Black African American Pope " ) . "
The letter continued , " He was , however , likely extremely psychotic at the time of his initial offense and continued to be psychotic during the jail period prior to the Rusk placement .
He was either not medicated or inappropriately medicated during the period prior to placement at Rusk .
In sum , it is highly likely that he was insane during the period he incurred the six offenses . "
The prosecution was stronger .
Two MHMRA doctors testified that Hatcher was not criminally insane .
Hatcher says that he was never examined by the doctors who testified , but Hochglaube and prosecutor Ryan Patrick believe that he was .
" I 've never seen those doctors before , God knows I 've never did , " Hatcher says .
" Unless I was in that bad condition that I do n't remember . "
Deputies and detention officers who witnessed the assault also told the jury what happened .
Jurors were shown pictures of the deputy , who received scratches on his neck during the fight .
On July 10 , 2008 , Hatcher was found guilty , and during the punishment phase of the trial , the jury was presented information about Hatcher 's other charges , along with his prior record .
According to Sims , it was the jury foreman who declined to sentence Hatcher to life .
" You look at Alexander 's record .
He 's had a long history of problems with the law .
I mean , nothing serious in terms of murder , assaults or that nature , but a lot of sort of stupid stuff .
And he's had a long history of mental illness , " Hochglaube says .
" In my heart I believe that 53 years was not justice . "
_____________________
When Hatcher returned to Harris County Jail , he says he saw one of the deputies he had fought with months earlier .
The deputy told Hatcher , " I hope you have n't made any plans for the future . "
Hatcher returned to his cell , and as soon as he had the chance he called his mother .
Florence had n't been able to make it to the trial , because she could n't find a ride .
" I said , ' Fifty - three years ?!
People that murder people do n't get 53 years . '
He told me , ' I do n't know , mama . '
Well , I do n't know , " Florence says .
" In 53 years I 'll be gone .
That 's all I pray , that God do let me live , because he would be lost .
He do n't have nobody but me . "
Florence has seen her son a couple times since his arrest .
She moved to a small house on the east side of Houston about a year ago , but she can rarely travel to downtown .
A problem with Florence 's phone line sometimes keeps her from accepting Hatcher 's collect calls .
During his first nine months in jail , Hatcher sent his mother letters almost daily , many of them illegible .
When she could read the writing , Florence made little sense of its meaning .
In a letter from January 2007 , Hatcher writes , " I will enter into Divine Words Seminary in California .
I made this vow to God .
I may be the first Roman Catholic Missionary Priest in the Joseph and Hatcher family .
I feel the Happiness will come when working with the 3rd World County in South Africa . "
" Alexander is the most religious person , I guess .
I should tell him he needs to start praying different , " Florence says .
" He has n't been a bad , bad person , but he has done a lot of things .
He 's even done things to me , but he 's my child , and I can't throw him away . "
Hatcher 's case is set for appeal , but it could be months or years before the case reaches trial .
Sims has bowed out as Hatcher 's attorney , and the court has appointed another lawyer to handle the case .
While Hatcher is waiting for transfer to state prison , he says he 's receiving his medication prescribed at Rusk , and there 've been no problems since returning to the jail .
In fact , Hatcher has little recollection of his time prior to Rusk .
He wears a yellow jumpsuit , the sign of a maximum - security inmate .
No longer in the psychiatric unit , Hatcher stays in a solitary cell .
In mid-sentence , Hatcher will sometimes lean back and look up , take a deep breath and swallow , then continue speaking .
There 's often a paranoid tone in his voice , and he sometimes alludes to liver cancer that doctors say he does n't have .
" I can not complain .
I go through it every once in a while , but I 'm just here , " Hatcher says .
" To be honest with you , I do n't know how all this happened .
But it had to have been something I did that was against the rules of Harris County Jail . "

I know how hard you work , and I want to make sure that all your hard - earned money that you deposit at a bank stays safe and sound .
Last week the mortgage bank IndyMac was taken over by the FDIC because it was no longer solvent , and some bank depositors are going to lose 50 % of their money .
But here is what is so sad .
No one should have lost one penny .
Those who are going to lose money either did not take the time to learn about the FDIC insurance rules for full coverage , or they assumed that the bank teller who told them their money was safe knew what he or she was talking about .
Big mistake .
And it happens all the time .
Did you catch the report of the gentleman who had $ 230,000 on deposit at IndyMac ?
He was concerned that he might not have full FDIC insurance , but a bank teller had told him it was no problem .
She said that even though the FDIC offers full repayment up to $ 100,000 per account at a bank , all he had to do was open a few different accounts at that bank , each with $ 100,000 of insurance , and all his money would be safe if anything happened to the bank .
WRONG WRONG WRONG .
The teller could n’t have been more wrong .
So since there are so many who obviously are listening to people who you think know but in fact they do not I decided that I better make sure you have the RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT information concerning FDIC insurance and how it works .
The Rules For FDIC Insurance
The rule is that the combined assets of all accounts that are in one person ’s name can not exceed $ 100,000 .
It ’s $ 100,000 per depositor per bank .
Not $ 100,000 per account .
Now that IndyMac is out of business the gentleman in the story above will get the first $ 100,000 back .
That indeed is fully insured by the FDIC .
But the additional $ 130,000 is not covered by the FDIC insurance program .
The somewhat good news for this man is that in this case ( which is not usual ) the FDIC plans to pay back at least 50 % of deposit amounts that exceed the $ 100,000 limit .
So for this man he will get $ 65,000 of the $ 130,000 that was not insured that is the good news .
The bad news is that for now he is out $ 65,000 of what he thought was safe money all because he listened to the teller .
This poor man , and all the others ( 10,000 ) who have lost money at IndyMac could have avoided this financial heartache if they took the time to make sure they knew the rules .
I have said this so many times :
What happens to your money directly affects the quality of your life .
It does n’t have an impact on the bank teller ’s life , or a financial advisor ’s life or an insurance agent ’s life .
It matters to you , and only you .
Get Busy Taking Care of Your Money
Now many people think that all they can have in one bank is just $ 100,000 if they are to be insured .
However you can have more in certain situations as long as you follow the rules .
1. Accounts in Just One Name
If you have an account (s ) in just one name at any one bank , make sure you keep less than $ 100,000 in total at that bank in just your name .
That ’s what I do .
And please do n’t make the mistake of investing $ 100,000 at Big Bank ’s branch in downtown and then another $ 100,000 at its branch out at the mall , or even in a different state .
It does n’t work that way .
The FDIC will say you have $ 200,000 at one bank .
It counts money you have at different branches , no matter what state the branch is in , as being at the same bank .
So just open different accounts at different banks .
So to be absolutely clear , as long as the total amount of money you deposit in any number of accounts in just your name at one bank totals less than $ 100,000 your money is fully insured by the FDIC .
Example :
YOU CAN HAVE
A checking account with $ 10,000 in it
A savings account with $ 80,000 in it
A $ 10,000 CD
--------------------------------------------
TOTAL : $ 100,000 = Fully insured .
Again you can have as many individual accounts at one bank that you want as long as the total of all those accounts do not total more than $ 100,000
YOU CANNOT HAVE
A checking account with $ 100,000 in it
A savings accounts with $ 100,000 in it
A $ 100,000 CD .
---------------------------
Total : $ 300,000 .
Fully Insured : $ 100,000 .
( So $ 200,000 is NOT INSURED . )
Hillary Clinton Embraces the “ Politics of Fear ”
Cross posted on Grizzly Groundswell
Democrats have for years accused Republicans of using the politics of fear .
Whenever a Republican brings up the issue of national defense and keeping the country safe you can rest assured that a Democrat will accuse him of using scare tactics .
It does n’t matter to them if this is a real issue or not .
The Democrat race is about “ hope ” and “ change ” and who Democrats feel can best provide both .
That is until now .
Now that Hillary is in trouble and people evidently feel as though Obama is the best candidate to provide “ change ” and “ hope ” Hillary has decided to use the “ politics of fear ” that I thought she was opposed to .
Her new add being run in Texas shows two children sleeping at night peacefully while the narrator states the following :
“ It ’s 3 a.m. , and your children are safe and asleep .
But there ’s a phone in the White House , and it ’s ringing .
Something ’s happening in the world .
Your vote will decide who answers that call .
Whether it ’s someone who already knows the world ’s leaders , knows the military — someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world . ”
At this point , we see our first adult , a concerned mother , opening the door and peering into her children ’s bedroom .
“ It ’s 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep , ” the narrator repeats .
“ Who do you want answering the phone ? ”
The answer to that question is Hillary according to the ad .
So much for the Democrats being above the politics of fear .
There is no more dangerous Clinton than a wounded , frightened , and cornered Clinton .
It is now time for the Clinton ’s to pull out all the stops and suddenly the “ politics of fear ” are acceptable and palatable to them .
Hillary Clinton has abandoned her message of change and is now embracing politics as usual .
This is hardly the change that Democrat voters are looking for .
Or is it ?
Is the change that Democrat voters are looking for merely a change in parties in the white house ?
That seems to be the question that the Clinton campaign must be asking themselves .
Once they win the nomination they would be able to switch back to the message of change .
Until she wins the nomination however , politics as usual , and the politics of fear are perfectly acceptable to her .
The lamestream media told you :
Smoking is so bad it should be outlawed everywhere , and a private establishment should not be allowed to allow smoking even within its own private walls .
The Uninvited Ombudsman notes however that :
The American Academy of Physicians and Surgeons has released a report that indicates nonsmoking persons of normal weight have the highest lifetime medical costs .
Politicians and others usually list the funding of prevention and chronic disease management programs as a key method of achieving cost containment .
Smoking and obesity are most frequently mentioned as risk factors to target .
In the long run , however , removing these risk factors would probably increase medical costs -- even assuming that preventive interventions cost nothing .
Using a simulation model , researchers found that never - smokers of normal weight actually incurred higher lifetime medical costs than obese nonsmokers .
Smokers of normal weight had the lowest costs .
Life years gained through prevention are not lived in full health .
Reduction of risky behavior resulted in substituting expensive , chronic diseases of aging for cheap , lethal ones .
In other news , Japan passed a law to outlaw flabbiness , but the belief that it will reduce medical costs may lead to overmedication and increased medical costs .

On Tuesday , Senator Barack Obama did his best to reclaim for Democrats the idea of partnerships between government and grass - roots religious groups  and except for six little words he did a very smooth job .
First , he recalled his own community service in Chicago , noting that it had been church supported .
Then he reminded listeners that it was President Bill Clinton who signed landmark legislation widening the role religion - based groups could play in government - financed programs , and Al Gore who in 1999 first proposed a full - scale religion - based initiative .
While Mr. Obama acknowledged President Bush ’s promise to “ rally the armies of compassion ” through such an initiative , he maintained that the promise had gone unfulfilled because of too little financing and too much partisanship  and that he , Barack Obama , would not only carry out but also expand what Mr. Bush had pledged .
He was two - thirds of the way through his remarks when he inserted the six words with the potential to put his whole effort at risk .
Speaking “ as someone who used to teach constitutional law , ” he spelled out “ a few basic principles ” to reassure listeners that such partnerships between religious groups and the government would not endanger the separation of church and state .
I lost all faith in the American democratic system and its media when President Bush initiated a false war against Iraq and got away with it .
This time , the U.S. media and Bush Administration are lying about a different war — the one between Georgia and Russia .
To understand the complex nature of this conflict , a brief review of history is necessary .
Throughout its long history , Georgia , the country , has had difficult relations with Russia and its other neighbors , including the ethnically different Ossetians .
Georgians and Ossetians did not always get along .
In one instance , Georgian leaders asked the Russian tsar for permission to enslave the Ossetians .
The answer was no .
During the Russian Revolution , Georgia seceded from the Russian Empire and sided with Mensheviks ( tsarists ) , thereby starting a conflict with the Ossetians and killing about 5,000 of them until Bolsheviks intervened and forcefully returned Georgia under Russia ’s control .
During Stalin ’s rule , Georgia ( Stalin ’s homeland ) was assigned some of the Ossetian and Abkhazian territory together with their historic inhabitants .
As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the early 1990s , Georgia declared its independence without any resistance from Russia .
However , when South Ossetia and Abkhazia tried to declare their independence from Georgia , they were greeted by a brutal military campaign aimed at keeping these tiny regions under Georgian control .
Unfortunately for Georgia , it had to live with their de-facto independence due to strong resistance from these breakaway regions and Russia ’s intervention .
Long story short , Russia became the only third party peacekeeper , albeit a biased one , in this conflict until now .
In 2008 , the United States and Europe recognized Kosovo ’s independence from Serbia despite Russian and Serbian opposition .
Russia warned the United States that this is a dangerous precedent that could ignite the old conflict between Georgians and Ossetians , who might seek independence according to the Kosovo ’s scenario .
Meanwhile , Georgia being lead by charismatic , pro-Western president Mr. Saakashvilli sought to join NATO and the EU .
However , Georgia ’s unresolved territorial disputes with South Ossetia and Abkhazia formally precluded its membership in NATO .
Mr. Saakashvilli could resolve this conflict in two ways : ( a ) officially recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia ’s de-facto independence from Georgia or ( b ) drive out or physically exterminate all Ossetians and Abkhazians because they would never again want to live peacefully under Georgia ’s control .
On August 8 of this year , Mr. Saakashvilli , probably inspired by his famous countrymen , Joseph Stalin ( who allegedly said “ no people , no problem ” ) chose plan ( b ) by secretly launching the blitzkrieg - styled , all - out offensive on South Ossetia and Russian peacekeepers .
The date of the attack was chosen strategically — right before the Olympic Games .
Judging by captured Georgian military maps , Saakashvilli hoped to capture most of South Ossetia in one day and make Russia ’s military response ( if any followed ) look contrary to the peaceful spirit of the Olympiad .
According to numerous Georgian statements quoted even in the U.S. media , they were assured to receive American military support in the case of Russian military retaliation .
This raises an important question .
What did Bush promise to Saakashvilli so as to embolden him to carry out a military attack that would likely provoke a retaliatory response from a giant , nuclear - armed , Russian military ?
As we learned from the Iraq debacle , the U.S. news media is not interested in asking uneasy questions .
On the contrary , U.S. news channels neglect to mention that the Georgian attack has cost over 1,600 Ossetian lives and prefer to give the bulk of attention to Georgian claims without checking them for accuracy .
The Ossetian accounts of Georgian atrocities , such as carpet bombing of the Ossetian capital , raping , execution of civilians by running them over with tanks , and throwing grenades in the basements where civilians were hiding , failed to make it in to the U.S. news reports as well .
The fact that Mr. Saakashvilli has a spotty democratic record and that the U.S. government has spent over $ 40 million of American taxpayers ’ money on arming and training Georgia ’s military has also escaped the American news reports .
On the contrary , Russia ’s military response to Georgia ’s initial offensive on the South Ossetian population is instead portrayed as an aggression against a small , democratic , and piece loving nation of Georgia that also happens to be an American ally .
Even worse , a statue of Joseph Stalin still proudly stands in the main square of the city of Gori in Georgia , reminding all of us whose bloody legacy Presidents Saakashvilli and Bush are really carrying out .
While the American media acts as the propaganda tool for the U.S. and Georgian presidents known for their dishonesty , the regular people of South Ossetia , Abkhazia , Georgia , Russia , and the United States have much to lose from this conflict .
It would be nice if the violence in Georgia ended as soon as possible , but it will not end until the United States puts pressure on Georgia to recognize South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence from Georgia as the United States did for Kosovo .
Until then , the Russians are forced to defend Abkhazians and Ossetians militarily by weakening Georgia as much as possible in order to preempt any future attacks from Georgians .
Any attempt by the U.S. government to back Georgia militarily may provoke a war between nuclear armed Russia and the United States .
So , how many of you are willing to die in a nuclear holocaust for yet another blunder committed by the Bush Administration and left unquestioned by the American media ?

Following yesterday ’s news that Google has invested more than $ 10 million in geothermal R&D , the Australian government has announced a A$ 50 million ( US $ 43.5 million ) project to tap into the nation ’s geothermal energy .
It ’s an avalanche of hot rock investments .
Aussie authorities estimate that just 1 percent of the nation ’s untapped geothermal energy could produce 26,000 years worth of clean electricity , Reuters reports .
The $ 50 million Geothermal Drilling Program will be doled out as grants to the geothermal industry to defray the cost of drilling deep wells .
Australia currently gets nearly 80 percent of its energy from dirty coal but the government has set a goal of getting 20 percent of the nation ’s energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
A report released this week by the Australian Geothermal Energy Association estimates than a A $ 12 billion ( $ 10.36 billion ) investment would yield 2,200 megawatts of installed geothermal capacity , satisfying about 40 percent of the government ’s clean energy goal .
The investment is part of larger shift going on Down Under .
The new Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol earlier this year ( leaving the U.S. as the sole developed nation yet to do so ) and has made clean energy a priority for Australia , which is the world ’s leading coal exporter .
The country is also a large uranium exporter , but Resources Minister Martin Ferguson recently said that while mining should continue for export , Australia itself does n’t need the nuclear power .
“ The position of the Government is very clear :
We will not support nuclear power in Australia because we do n’t need to , ” Mr Ferguson told ABC Radio .
Instead , Ferguson is pushing geothermal hard .
Unlike other renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar , geothermal energy is capable of providing base - load energy , not subject to intermittent winds or a setting sun .
This sort of base - load capacity could directly replace coal - fired power plants .

Christine Hodder had lodged two formal complaints , one in 2001 and another a few months before she died , about bullying and harassment by several officers and had twice been on stress leave .
In a five - page complaint dated February 20 , 2005 , which has been made public , Christine Hodder said she felt she had never been accepted there because she was a woman .
" In the past six years I have been badly treated as other staff members collectively bullied , belittled and intimidated me , " she said .
" The staff in this station has constantly alienated and attacked my character and physical appearance since my arrival . "
" Every high - ranking ambulance person I spoke to was quite happy off the record to say this is really , really bad … and told me that they do n't see that much is going to happen [ change ] , " Mr Hodder told the Herald .
" This is why it nearly took me as well … I 've only just survived . "
... In July , 2005 , the chief executive of the NSW Ambulance Service , Greg Rochford , wrote to Mr Hodder and said an investigation had been completed .
The letter , also made public , reveals the service began the investigation three days before Christine Hodder died and found a culture of male dominance ...
It recommended staff receive training in workplaces free of harassment and bullying , that the service should explore how to change the behaviour of staff , and that no female officer be appointed to Cowra for six months .
No officer was disciplined .
No officer who made Christine Hodder 's life a fucking misery was , anyway .
The one colleague who took Christine 's side and provided evidence that her victimization by other male colleagues was ignored by management , Phil Roxburgh , was bullied just for supporting her .
So , in truth , an officer was " disciplined " — the one who tried to do right thing .
We would all do well to remember this story the next time we are silent in the presence of bigotry , harassment , bullying , whether it takes the form of sexism or racism or homophobia or any kind of hostile bias .
Just not doing it yourself is not enough .
We 've got to be
We make a difference in this world , for good or ill .
There is no neutral .
There is no Switzerland .
There is only saying no to the indignities one human visits upon another — prejudice , hatred , humiliation and pain — or saying yes .
And silence , the craven averting of one 's gaze so the offense may take place out of view , is not a no .
It is not ambiguous .
It is a yes .
Yes , go ahead , just do n't do it to me .
It is a permission , and a plea .
I 'll sacrifice her if you 'll let me on my merry way .
We routinely cede our expectations of goodness for guarantees of safety , but only our own , and we can no longer fool ourselves that men like these are aberrations ; they are , in the void of unyielding solidarity our self - interest has left , inevitabilities .
There is no neutral .
You 're in or you 're fucking out .
I 'm all in .
And I 'm so sorry , Christine .
RIP .

It was only after a rather extensive session of blubbing that I was able to start in on a post , not that I 've got much brilliant to say , aside from : FUCK .
The piece tells the story of an Australian woman who was subjected to such intensive , long - term bullying at her job as the only female ambulance officer at her station , that she committed suicide , leaving behind a husband and three - year - old daughter .
Almost certainly , there will have been other contributing factors ( untreated depression , as one possible example ) , but the abuse she sustained at the hands of her co-workers , and the indifference of management , over six years is just unimaginable :

In the wake of Russia ’s planting a flag on the seabed under the North Pole , in preparation for a claim that their continental shelf includes the Pole , it ’s expected that the question of who controls what up there will be increasingly urgent .
The PDF map “ identifies known claims and agreed boundaries , plus potential areas that might be claimed in the future . ”
Canada ’s claim to the entire Arctic Ocean up to the North Pole east of 141° W is mentioned in the notes but not depicted , for example ; what we mainly see is territorial waters , exclusive economic zones , and claimed continental shelves .

Someone recently asked me how the game industry lost the attention war .
Paradoxically , interactive entertainment has never been more popular or lucrative , but the game industry — narrowly defined here as the major consoles and game publishers — is now , with one notable exception , but a sliver in a much larger interactive entertainment pie .
Why ?
There ’s a simple explanation , but first consider this recent litany of failure .

* A Future Business of Games Without a Single Industry

Milestones of an Industry On the Road to Irrelevance
* EA in Crisis :
The industry ’s largest publisher defenestrates their chief executive , citing sequel - itis , then drastically scales back its profit estimates , citing a failure to develop enough titles for the Wii .
* Nichification of the Next Gen Console : Xbox 360 eclipses Playstation 3 , sending Sony into a tumult .
But that conflict belies a more crucial truth : this generation , the console war is actually a duel between midgets .
Selling in the low millions , each has little chance of reaching anything near the PS2 ’s truly massive installed base .
* Wii Victorious :
At its E3 2006 debut , fanboys praise the Wii for its innovation , but because it lacks HDTV and hardcore gamer titles , dismiss it as a sideshow to PS3 - versus -360 .
Instead , the Wii vastly outsells both and becomes a disruptive technology , forecast to eventually reside in nearly 1 of 3 homes .
* Rise of Non-Game Virtual Worlds : World of Warcraft premieres in 2004 and three years later , retains an uncontested monopoly on the fantasy MMO .
The industry keeps churning out fantasy MMOs — all of which fail in comparison .
Meanwhile , a slew of non-fantasy online worlds — Gaia Online , Club Penguin , Second Life , and more — attract millions of users , extensive media coverage , and investment dollars .
None of them are produced by the game industry — which , after developing virtual worlds for some 20 years , represents a spectacular missed opportunity .
* Casual , Web - Based Games Rising : Dozens of free game sites like New Grounds and MiniClip rank in Alexa ’s top 1000 , attracting millions of casual players , especially women .
Few have any relation to the game industry .
Among the only fantasy MMOs to succeed post - WoW is the Web - based RuneScape — once again , not from a major publisher .
Inside an Insular Industry
Why is all this happening ?
The unifying explanation ca n’t be conveyed by strict business analysis , for it goes to a deeply rooted corporate culture :
The game industry is Hollywood for Lost Boys .
It ’s a business comprised almost entirely of young gamer dudes , serving an audience of young gamer dudes , covered by a gaming press of young gamer dudes , all of whom are only interested in creating , playing , and covering games that interest young gamer dudes — which they believe to be the pinnacle of entertainment .
( For a cruelly accurate , street - level sketch of its oblivious insularity , read this excerpt from Smart Bomb , or immodestly , my own report from E3 2001 . )
So of course EA would under - develop for the Wii : its low res graphics are n’t appealing to Lost Boys .
Of course the industry would be slow to grasp the Wii ’s disruptive power and fixate on the 360 - versus - PS3 sideshow , since both can run the Hollywood - worthy epics like Halo 3 and Gears of War they ’re interested in .
Of course they ’d fail to capitalize on the rise of Flash - driven casual games , which appeal to women and older gamers .
Of course they ’d keep churning out fantasy MMOs they like , and ignore the rise of non -game virtual worlds , which they do n’t .
( As Will Wright once told me , developers are hobbled by a “ moviemaker wannabe ” streak : “ You know : ‘ Well , George Lucas made his world — here ’s my world ! ’ ” )
And of course they ’d be indifferent to user - created worlds like Second Life : the idea that amateur - produced content might provide a new and in many ways superior experience to traditional MMOs is entirely alien to them .
Their peevishly incurious reaction is pretty much what you ’d have got from a movie producer in the 90s , if you told him that film and TV would soon start losing their audience to a video clip site featuring stupid dog tricks and a dancing bald guy .
A Future Business of Games Without a Single Industry
Can the industry regain the attention ?
Not as it exists now , not without brutal changes to its gamer - centric culture .
A few publishers , notably Ubisoft , are trying to steer their corporate ship out of Lost Boy territory , developing more Wii titles , more games for families and casual players .
So the PS3 and the 360 will continue underselling , and as more publishers shift their dollars to the Wii , become even more niche .
As traditional MMOs besides WoW go extinct , user - created online worlds will thrive , and budget - conscious game studios will turn to Multiverse , Areae , Second Life , and other open platforms .
Individual developers willing to make do with a little less geek glamor in exchange for more independence will leave the industry , and follow after the Flash - enabled success of games like Desktop Tower Defense .
After speaking at this year ’s Game Developer ’s Conference , venture capitalist and tech visionary Joi Ito described an industry steadfastly ignorant of the changing world outside , “ making the same mistakes that the content guys have been making since the beginning of networked computers .
They ALWAYS over - estimate the importance of the content and vastly underestimate the desire of users / people to communicate with each other and share . ”
So in the short term , nothing will change for most of them ; occasional tent pole hits like Halo 3 will soothe their cloistered delusions .
They ’ll keep ignoring non-traditional gamers , Web 2.0 , and the user - created revolution , assuming like Hollywood that their core product has enough global appeal to get them through the latest media revolution .
And that will be their final disastrous turn .
Because unlike the real Hollywood , there are only so many Lost Boys in the world willing to pay attention to them for so long .
Update , 6/6 : Some replies to reader comments here .
Update 2 , 6/7 : Esteemed veteran game designer Ernest W. Adams offers his take here .

Frank Hunte , a postdoctoral associate at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory ’s Applied Superconductivity Center has discovered surprising magnetic properties in new superconductors that suggest they may have very powerful applications allowing for dramatically faster computers free of the burden of resistance - produced waste heat as well as improved MRI devices and a new generation of superconducting electric motors more efficient then any current motor .

Currently three critical weaknesses of superconductors stand in the way of many cutting edge advances .
First and foremost is their temperature dependence , requiring temperatures well beneath the means of even standard liquid nitrogen cooling .
The critical temperature is somewhat pressure dependent , so extremely high pressure superconductors can superconduct at higher temperatures .
Two lesser known , but not lesser important , limitations of superconductors include a sensitivity to high currents as well as to magnetism .
At high currents , superconductors can cease functioning properly , and magnetic fields are particularly deadly to superconductors , easily reverting them back to normal conductors .
Recently there was a new breakthrough discovered by Japanese researchers that had been looking into iron superconductors , and found a unique class of superconductors which seem to be amazingly almost completely immune to magnetism .
This breakthrough could remove one of the largest obstacles to commercializing superconducting .

The scientists used an atypical combination of metals to the superconductor material ; they added a bit of arsenic to the mix to create iron oxyarsenide – which , as the name implies , also featured oxygen .
The new material also contains the rare earth metal lanthanum which can superconduct at 26 K ( - 413 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
As iron typically creates a magnetic field when conducting , researchers were surprised to find a fully working superconductor which included iron .
Somehow , the superconductor was surviving the magnetic field , an unexpected first .
Many possible applications await the improvement of this new technology , including ultra-efficient superconducting motors and power transmission lines .
They could also be used in new superconducting magnets , which would open up a new world of research opportunities in diverse fields of science .
As Hunte states , “ The field is completely open .
No one knows where this is going to go .
If it ’s found that these materials can support high current densities , then they could be tremendously useful . ”
TFOT recently covered the illogical secret of superconductors which described a recent research study which uncovered part of the mechanism that transforms matter into a high - temperature superconductor ; also covered was the demonstration of the first quantum computer , which uses superconductors for its operation , developed by the Canadian Company D - Wave .
More on the new superconductors can be found on the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory ’s Applied Superconductivity Center website .
A Pennsylvania woman has been sentenced to five years of probation , including six months of home detention , and forfeiture of her computer after pleading guilty Thursday to obscenity charges for running a Web site that featured text stories that were sexual and violent in nature .
Karen Fletcher , 56 , of Donora , Pennsylvania , owned and operated the Web site , Red Rose Stories , which featured stories describing sexual molestation and violence against children .
Other stories included torture , rape and murder of children , and Fletcher sold memberships to her site , where members could get full stories , the U.S. Department of Justice said .
Fletcher , using the pen name Red Rose , wrote most of the stories herself , the DOJ said .
Some of the stories were available as audio files , but the site did n't include photos , according to press reports .
Fletcher reportedly was abused as a child and started the site as a form of therapy , according to news reports .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the site closed in late 2005 .
Some constitutional lawyers have questioned the prosecution of Fletcher , saying many pieces of popular literature have contained similar descriptions of abuse or murder .
Fletcher pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh to six counts of using an interactive computer service to distribute obscene materials .
She must serve the first six months of her probation under home detention and pay a US $ 1,000 fine , Judge Joy Flowers Conti ruled .
Mary Beth Buchanan , the U.S. attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania , has filed obscenity charges against several defendants .
Buchanan " has gone on a rampage trying to stamp out expression that does n't meet her standards of morality , " Marc John Randazza , a law professor at the Barry University School of Law in Orlando , wrote on his blog .
Randazza , who teaches about free speech rights and other legal issues , acknowledges that the content of Red Rose Stories was shocking , but he suggested the U.S. Constitution protects fictional stories .
" If you believe in the Constitution , and you believe in what this country means , you can NOT believe that any American should ever face prison for writing fiction -- no matter what the subject matter of that fiction might be , " he wrote in a blog post .
I remember distinctly the first time I saw a pair of surgically enhanced breasts with my own eyes .
It was around eight or nine years ago , in the changing rooms of the gym at a private members ' club where a friend had taken me for a workout .
I was getting undressed , nervously , as I do n't like disrobing in front of strangers .
And there was another woman , a matter of a few feet away , topless , with oddly firm , projectile breasts pointing skywards .
My first reaction was shock .
Two very weird , alien , unnatural body parts , brazenly displayed , right in front of me .
They did n't look real or natural in the slightest .
They looked like what they were – breasts that had been bought and paid for .
Not soft and slightly saggy , like a thirtysomething embonpoint should be , but plastic , hard - looking and aggressively perfect .
I felt like I 'd been slapped in the face .
They said robotic .
They announced aspiration .
They said " I 'm considerably richer than you " , and " I 'm considerably more attractive than you " , and even " Money well spent " .
For there was an unmistakeable air of conspicuous consumption in this woman 's light golden tan and bizarrely pert orbs .
I felt instantly sickened , and turned away .
I put it down to our surroundings , this was , after all , an overtly moneyed members ' club .
I told myself it was precisely these types of people – rich , successful , conventionally attractive – who had such things " done " .
This woman 's fake , brown bosom seemed , at the time , to symbolise a jet - set lifestyle ; a vulgar , ostentatious and knowing signifier of social status .

It galvanised my opinion , anyway .
I did n't like what I 'd seen , and would never have it done myself .
But I 'd always assumed men liked them .
Do n't all men like big , voluptuous , bountiful breasts ?
But that , perhaps , was where I went wrong .
A few years later , a boyfriend told me an apocryphal story about how the LA porn industry was importing Russian and Eastern European porn actresses with real breasts , because the video directors in LA were fed up with the way their American counterparts ' silicone breasts did n't move and bounce with the same sensual jiggle .
I 'd brushed that aside , still convinced that the average man would rather fondle a burgeoning cup that had been surgically enhanced , than a modest A or even B - sized pillow .
So it was with great relief that this month I read in GQ magazine an impassioned polemic , " Fear of fake breasts " , by the novelist Tony Parsons .
His argument runs as follows : fake breasts are " like plastic fruit " – good to look at , but not to touch .
" They are not there to be fondled , kissed or felt , they are there to be admired , discussed , lusted after and photographed .
The moment they are touched – and I mean in the heat of passion , rather than out of curiosity or in the interests of scientific research – then the spell is broken .
And this is true of all fake breasts , no matter how much money has been spent on this act of female self - mutilation . "
The scales fell from my eyes .
I 'd always considered my problem with fake breasts to be just that – a problem with me .
I was n't post - feminist enough .
I was n't post - modern enough .
I was still entranced by those early feminist texts I 'd read aged 16 – The Female Eunuch , The Women 's Room and The Second Sex , books that railed against women 's representation in society as doll - like male fantasy figures .
I particularly hated the idea of women going under general anaesthetic , and thus risking life and limb , to adhere to some ideal of pneumatic , Barbie - like " perfection " .
So for me at least , it 's been truly liberating to find that men ( whom I had assumed might sanction or applaud any degree of painful female body modification if it titillates their sexual peccadilloes ) feel the same way , too .
In fact , during several months of dating recently , I 've found that many modern sensitive male souls are hardly the body fascists of yore .
American Psycho Patrick Bateman 's love of " hardbody ' blonde trophy girlfriends in the Eighties was a fiction , and remains so .
Men like women of all shapes and sizes .
Contrary to what women themselves think about their bodies , some men find small breasts sexy ; others actively prefer " overweight " size 16s over " perfect " size 10s .
What 's more , many men find the supposed mammarial perfection of Jordan / Katie Price far more objectionable than women do .
As an archetype of what men might like , the beach - ball sized , unapologetically false look insults both their taste and intelligence .
All of which begs the question : if they 're so horrible , and men do n't really like them , why on earth are thousands of woman going under the knife ?
As Parsons says : " Why are n't there armies of thinking women protesting about the grotesquely booming trade in bogus breasts ? "
But he may be wrong on this point .
Some women clearly do find breast enlargement procedures as needless as he does .
" Breast surgery has become just another part of the beauty regime , like applying make - up , and it 's unnecessary and unpleasant , " says the writer Joan Smith , " It 's treated the same as getting a haircut .
It 's become normalised .
I think any woman considering breast surgery for cosmetic reasons should spend a month in Darfur and then decide if body image is a really important issue . "
Former Cosmopolitan editor Marcelle D'Argy Smith agrees .
" Fake breasts have become inescapable .
But I think the main reason why women do it is to please men .
They 're trying to fulfil a male fantasy , and I do n't think we can blame them for this .
It might make them feel more confident – but it is ultimately for men . "
Like me , broadcaster Joan Bakewell finds the synthetic look repellent .
" Fake breasts simply look false .
They lack any kind of beauty or the softness associated with real breasts .
Implants look like two oranges stuffed in your top .
They 're nothing like real breasts . "
These are just a few voices of dissent .
But women are n't shouting loudly enough .
Yes , we may not like plastic breasts , but there is no denying they play an increasingly prominent role in our society .
Since that first shocking encounter of mine nearly a decade ago , surgically enhanced breasts – or at least images of them – are everywhere .
From Katie Price to Victoria Beckham , Jodie Marsh to Pamela Anderson , with celebrity endorsement , fake breasts have lost their shock value .
Brigitte Nielsen even had her breast silicone drained live on television last week .
Every series of Big Brother has a requisite pair – Lisa is this year 's model , purchased by her boyfriend , Mario .
There 's been speculation that Britney , Nicole Richie , Jessica Simpson and Kelly Rowland have had them .
It seems like these days , no one knows where real ends and fake begins – and that counts for the representation of curves in photography , too .
This week , Keira Knightley made a stand against the tyranny of the unnatural bosom when she prevented the makers of The Duchess from " airbrushing " bigger cups on to her naturally flat chest .
What happens in the world of celebrity now has ramifications for any young woman who opens a magazine or switches on the television .
Last year , 26,000 British women went under the knife in the pursuit of bigger breasts , and only 6,497 of those procedures were registered by BAAPS ( The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ) .
But even those 6,497 breast augmentation operations made it the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure recorded by BAAPS – up 6 per cent from the previous year .
And then there are the ordinary housewives or girls next door ( not Katie Price ) checking in for their fifth or sixth op , as explored on the recent BBC3 shock documentary Addicted to Boob Jobs .
" One woman on the show had had five operations , " recalls presenter Louise Roe , " three were cosmetic and two were reconstructive .
One of the cosmetic operations went wrong and the implant leaked , so she had to have two reconstructive operations after that . "
For Roe , the most shocking aspect was that these women " were not glamour models or Pamela Anderson " , but normal housewives , the sort of women you might find living down the road .
" A lot of them were very scarred from all the surgery , " she remembers , " There was one lady in particular whose boobs did n't even look like boobs any more . "
And like some of the celebrities , a minority of patients have become psychologically addicted to having their breasts altered and end up having multiple ops , hoping that each expensive procedure will help them attain an acceptable body shape .
A breast augmentation is n't like going for a blood test .
Normally , it is a two hour general - anaesthetic - and - all operation , with all the usual risks of organ failure and cardiac arrest .
After a successful procedure , drainage tubes are placed in the incision for several days to help eliminate excess fluid .
The chest is wrapped in gauze for a week , and the patient is advised to minimise arm movements to prevent separation of the muscle and tissue around the implants .
The enhanced breasts will still droop with age , and implants have a lifespan of around 16 years , so , depending on the woman 's age , will need replacing .
Then there 's the cost .
Although prices have become more " competitive " , the guide price for breast implants at Transform , a national chain of cosmetic surgery clinics , costs £ 3,950 for the round , silicone type .
Teardrop shapes are more expensive .
" Glamour model " sizes are pricier still , since they have to be ordered specially from the manufacturer .
The fallout from the less successful procedures can be catastrophic : even the best surgeons admit that risks include lumpy - bumpy appearance , indentations , mismatched breasts , infection , loss of sensation , formation of calcium around implant , bleeding , blood clots , skin loss and implant rupture or leakage .
The advent of the casual , lunch - hour op – this week , Sarah Cox , a 27 - year - old beauty therapist from West Bromwich , proudly showed off the results of her injectible boob " jab " in one paper – hardly seems to offer a better prognosis .
Why any person would risk so much because a B cup " just was n't big enough " seems a triumph of folly over reason .
The vogue for breast enlargement began more than 50 years ago .
At the tail end of the Second World War , Japanese prostitutes started having freely injected silicone liquid pumped into their breasts to please the US GIs .
This turned out to be a disaster , as rudimentary silicone often hardened , or became lumpy and infected .
Surgeons went back to the drawing board , and by the early Sixties had developed the modern breast implant : two sacs of liquid silicone , packaged in a shell which is then inserted into the body in its entirety .
Those used in the Sixties are termed by surgeons as " first - generation " implants , because they had a thin shell and liquid silicone inside which often went lumpy or coagulated at the lymph nodes .
We are now , in the Noughties , on the " fifth generation " , and have been for eight or nine years .
The contemporary implants have thicker shells and semi - solid silicone gel within .
Surgeons claim they are much sturdier – so if they do break , a patient should not experience leakage .
In the late Eighties , silicone implants became the subject of controversy in the US when a group of women made a claim that augmentation had caused connective tissue disease ( similar to rheumatoid arthritis ) .
The press soon got hold of the story , and the safety of fake breasts became a full - blown health scare .
In 1991 , the US government imposed a moratorium on silicone implants and subsequently a huge amount of research was carried out worldwide exploring the link between silicone implants and connective tissue disease or breast cancer .
It was proved that there was no link , and in 1998 the British government published a directive that silicone implants are safe .
The US moratorium on silicone was lifted this year .
" Silicone is undoubtedly the best implant material , " states consultant plastic surgeon and BAAPS member Patrick Mallucci .
He explains how various substitutes have been suggested but in trials all turned out to be disastrous .
Soya implants , for example , were deemed to be unsafe around 2000 to 2001 , and all women with them ended up having them removed and replaced with silicone .
Surgeons such as Mallucci are indignant about the exposure of breast implants in the media .
He claims that many women in the celebrity spotlight have implants through vanity and the desperate search for fame , which he , like me , finds deeply problematic .
However , he reckons that the majority of his patients are women with mastectomies seeking reconstructive surgery , women who 've been born with unnaturally flat chests and women whose breasts have been " devastated " post - pregnancy .
" Very few of my patients are the glamour model types we see in the media , " says Mallucci .
" I tell them to go to somebody else if they say they want to be like Jordan . "
Mallucci points out that very extreme augmentations , such as those belonging to Katie Price , Pamela Anderson and glamour model Jodie Marsh ( who recently got a " double - G cup " boost ) can ravage the human body and lead a patient on a rocky road towards further corrective operations .
" Big implants cause drooping over time , they stretch the skin and squash the breast tissue .
Women who 've had them will definitely need more operations over time which will , in turn , cause more scarring . "
Despite Mallucci's protestations that the majority of women are not having implants for vanity reasons , the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is that a boob op has been the answer for women who 've felt dissatisfied with a B cup and wanted a little boost to a double D , or more .
And primarily , it is this solipsistic vanity and nouveau riche ostentation that I object to .
I have no issue with the woman who has had a mastectomy .
Or the woman whose breasts , abnormally , did not develop at puberty .
What I have a problem with is believing that it is acceptable for consumers to treat themselves to new breasts as they might a new handbag .
The proof , if further were needed , of this dangerously casual attitude to potentially life threatening surgery , are the numerous ads in the back of glossy magazines and on platform - side advertising on London 's Tube .
Companies such as Transform and the Harley Medical Group present the acquisition of fake breasts as being a consumer choice comparable to the purchase of a new car or a sofa , with pay - by - instalment price plans to boot .
So I take heart from Tony Parsons and his " Fear of fake breasts " .
If only there were also men out there who would rail against all the other elements of porn culture that seem to have invaded and pervade our everyday lives and beauty predilections ( the orange tans , Hollywood bikini waxes and bleach - blonde extensions ... )
But women , too , need to stop aspiring to the fake silhouette .
Perhaps my greatest fear about the rise of the fake breast in Western culture is that , like Botox and facial surgery , it attempts to cheat ageing and mortality itself .
Women want new breasts for a variety of reasons , but those in their thirties and forties who have augmentations because their bosom was slightly sagging are attempting to turn back the clock .
Surely , like facial wrinkles , we need to learn to love the slight imperfections that ageing bestows .
These are signs that our bodies have travelled and worked and experienced emotions , not scars or disfigurements that should be erased .
If Parsons is paradigmatic , then men are n't half as critical of our bodies as women might imagine they are .
And while male approbation is the last reason women should avoid cosmetic procedures , we need to start loving ourselves a little more and stop worshipping dumb- assed celebrities who mutilate their breasts in the name of vanity .
Love what you 've got , girls !
Do n't succumb to the knife !
Kelsey Grammer Suffers a Heart Attack
So much for taking a relaxing family vacation .
Actorhas suffered a mild heart attack while with his family at their home in Hawaii .
The actor and his wife Camille were out paddle boarding when he became ill .
Famous for his roles in Cheers and Fraser , Grammer 's current sitcom Back to You will not be picked up again by FOX for the Fall .
The information came as a shock to the actor , who said that the cast had been assured by the network that all was well until FOX dropped the bombshell a few days ago .
Apparently an online petition is underway to try to encourage FOX to rethink the decision .
There is also a slight possibility that CBS may opt to pick up the show .
Kelsey 's publicist , Stan Rosenfield indicates that Grammer is resting comfortably in a local hospital and should be released by the end of the week .
Our best wishes go out to Kelsey for a speedy recovery .

In the course of writing my recent article on the current and future state of GP - GPU computing , I spoke to both Nvidia and ATI about what they have on the table now and what ’s coming up .
The article covers a lot of ground , but a several things are clear .
One , Nvidia ’s CUDA environment certainly seems to have been adopted more widely in the academic community and high performance computing ( HPC ) markets .
Two , Nvidia is shipping ( with a beta driver ) physics acceleration on the GPU today , though of course it ’s for a physics middleware ( PhysX ) they now own .
Third , neither Nvidia nor ATI really have a wealth of GPU - accelerated applications for the consumer space coming in the near term , though we ’ll see a handful of apps in the video transcoding and image manipulation areas .
Many have thought that CUDA is proprietary , and will only ever work on Nvidia ’s GPUs .
This is not entirely true .
Though it has been submitted to no outside standards body , it is in fact completely free to download the specs and write CUDA apps , and even completely free to write a CUDA driver to allow your company ’s hardware ( CPU , GPU , whatever ) to run apps written in the CUDA environment .
Nvidia “ owns ” and controls the future of CUDA , so it ’s not open in the “ open source ” definition , but it ’s certainly free .
Nvidia tells us it would be thrilled for ATI to develop a CUDA driver for their GPUs .
But what about PhysX ?
Nvidia claims they would be happy for ATI to adopt PhysX support on Radeons .
To do so would require ATI to build a CUDA driver , with the benefit that of course other CUDA apps would run on Radeons as well .
ATI would also be required to license PhysX in order to hardware accelerate it , of course , but Nvidia maintains that the licensing terms are extremely reasonable — it would work out to less than pennies per GPU shipped .
I spoke with Roy Taylor , Nvidia ’s VP of Content Business Development , and he says his phone has n’t even rung to discuss the issue .
“ If Richard Huddy wants to call me up , that ’s a call I ’d love to take , ” he said .
So what is AMD / ATI ’s take on all this ?
I spoke with Senior PR manager Rob Keosheyan at AMD , and he had plenty to say about the situation .
Open industry standards are extremely important to AMD as a company , and they feel that GP - GPU work should be no different .
It ’s working hard only on its own StreamSDK and Brook + , but with the Kronos group on OpenCL , where it sees the real future .
If open standards are so important , why partner with Havok for physics work ?
That technology is far from open ; it ’s owned by Intel , the other chief competitor of AMD / ATI .
Of course , there are no truly open physics middleware solutions on the market with any traction , so that point might be kind of moot .
Keosheyan says , “ We chose Havok for a couple of reasons .
One , we feel Havok ’s technology is superior .
Two , they have demonstrated that they ’ll be very open and collaborative with us , working together with us to provide great solutions .
It really is a case of a company acting very indepently from their parent company .
Three , today on PCs physics almost always runs on the CPU , and we need to make sure that ’s an optimal solution first . ”
Nvidia , he says , has not shown that they would be an open and truly collaborative partner when it comes to PhsyX .
The same goes for CUDA , for that matter .
Though he admits and agrees that they have n’t called up Nvidia on the phone to talk about supporting PhysX and CUDA , he says there are lots of opportunities for the companies to interact in this industry and Nvidia has n’t exactly been very welcoming .
To sum up , Keosheyan assures us that he ’s very much aware that the GP - GPU market is moving fast , and he thinks that ’s great .
AMD / ATI is moving fast , too .
He knows that gamers want GPU physics and GP - GPU apps , but “ we ’re devoted to doing it the right way , not just the fast way . ”
So it sounds like support for CUDA or PhysX on ATI graphics cards just is n’t going to happen unless Nvidia picks up the phone first and offers an olive branch , or there is an overwhelming demand from ATI ’s customers .
Public Knowledge , joined by EFF as well as the Consumer Federation of America , the Digital Freedom Campaign , the Media Access Project , the New America Foundation and U.S. PIRG , yesterday filed an opposition [ PDF ] to the MPAA 's FCC petition seeking a waiver of the ban against selectable output controls ( SOC ) ( we have an explanation of what a " selectable output control " is on our Digital Video issue page ) .
EFF has long opposed selectable output controls .
The basic premise of those who back SOC is that content owners should be able to decide not just who can watch their content , but how they can watch it .
You want to watch my new movie on that digital TV you bought a few years ago ?
No , sorry , I do n't like your TV ( perhaps because I 'm afraid of the analog component inputs it uses ) .
You want to space - shift using your Slingbox ( which lacks DRM - enabling controls on its outputs ) ?
Oh , no , I do n't think that 's a good idea .
You were hoping to TiVo that show that 's on this afternoon so that you can watch it when you get home from work ?
Hm , not unless you upgrade to a new TiVo , because I wo n't allow the signal to make it to TiVos that do n't have digital outputs .
You want to record that program so that you can make a fair use of an excerpt ?
Dear dear , we can't have that .
Seems kind of crazy , no ?
That 's what the FCC thought , too , which was why the agency forbade use of SOC when it last addressed this issue , in 2003 .
The FCC concluded that multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs - companies like cable television providers ) can't " attach or embed data or information with commercial audiovisual content . . . so as to prevent its output through any analog or digital output authorized or permitted under license , law or regulation governing such covered product . "
Well , the MPAA is taking another crack at the issue , asking the FCC to grant it a permanent waiver from the SOC ban , to allow it to apply SOC to recently released movies that are being distributed to homes via video on demand .
The MPAA 's goal here seems clear : Increase its members ' control over how you choose to watch their material .
As the opposition we joined puts it , " Granting the waiver would put MPAA member companies on the path to controlling what types of connections will be used by all U.S. consumers , and to profiting from that control . "
The opposition offers this example of what this could mean :
A model of how this would work can already be seen .
Sony Pictures recently announced it will be offering its new movie , Hancock , to some Sony television owners equipped with Sony ’s Internet media connection before release on DVD and other home media .
However , the movie will only be available to those who own the Sony box , and will only flow over Sony ’s proprietary video connection to a Sony TV .
This model could easily be extended to MVPDs by leveraging SOC controls - if the Commission grants this waiver .
Right now , your consumer electronics are designed by the consumer electronics industry , which reacts to consumer market demand in choosing how to innovate .
That consumer - focused approach makes sense .
But if the MPAA has its way , however , we 'll be well on the way to a world in which every new feature to every home theater product has to be pre-approved by the content industry .
Hot on the heels of last week ’s report from ABI Research noting that many consumers may not see the picture quality difference between Blu-ray and standard DVDs comes the latest Blu-ray sales figures from NPD Group .
And they ’re not pretty .
According to NPD , sales of Blu-ray standalone players plummeted 40 percent from January to February , then rose a scant 2 percent from February to March .
The general consensus was that once Toshiba dropped its support for the HD DVD format early this year , sales would increase .
In fact , sales of Blu-ray standalone players remain so low that NPD has not yet released actual numbers , for fear that it would be easy to identify individual retailers .
The research group will start to give actual figures later this year , said Ross Rubin , director of industry analysis at NPD .
The end of the format wars clearly did little to boost Blu-ray ’s prospects .
Like others , Mr. Rubin said the much cheaper upconverting standard DVD players are winning consumers ’ hearts and wallets .
The price of upconverting players is hovering around $ 70 .
And this week , Amazon is giving them away for free when consumers purchase certain Samsung TVs .
The result : a 5 percent uptick in upconverting DVD player sales in the first quarter of 2008 , compared to same quarter a year ago , and a 39 percent decline in players that do n’t have that feature .
With Blu-ray players still costing more than $ 300 — and a number of players on the market still lacking some Blu-ray features like Internet connectivity — NPD now figures that Blu-ray ’s future wo n’t be clear until this Christmas , when prices should drop to the $ 200 range .
ABI Research is even less optimistic .
In a report released yesterday , the research firm figures it could take until October 2009 until Blu-ray gains a foothold in the market .
About two weeks ago , we covered the release of a DNS security fix meant to patch a vulnerability in the system that matches domain names with IP addresses .
The flaw had been discovered by security researcher Dan Kaminsky some months earlier but , at the time , details on the exploit were being kept secret .
That information has since leaked thanks to an accidental blog post by someone at Matasano Security .
Fast forward four days , and hackers , enterprising little children that they are , have released an exploit aimed squarely at the vulnerability .
This would be less of an issue if the widely released patch from two weeks ago had been fully deployed , but a number of companies or ISPs do n't seem to have gotten the memo .
Accordingly to Kaminsky , some 52 percent of DNS servers are still vulnerable to the attack .
This is a marked improvement from the 86 percent vulnerability rate in the days immediately following the patch 's release , but it 's still far too high , especially with dangerous code now squirreling its way across the Internet .
Patch deployment is not an instant process , even if the company is on the ball , but we 'll hopefully see the number of patched DNS servers skyrocket in the next few days .
Some publications have dubbed the attack Metasploit , but that term refers to the open - source Metasploit Framework that was used to develop it .
As for the exploit itself , it 's a new variation on a classic DNS poisoning theme .
It disrupts the normal translation functions of a DNS server , causing it to redirect users to websites other than the ones they intended to visit .
A poisoned DNS server , for example , could send someone to www.RussianMalware.com when they had actually typed www.google.com into the address bar .
DNS poisoning is n't new — vulnerabilities have existed for over a decade — but the one Kaminsky discovered increases the power of a successful attack .
Kaminsky has now detailed the methodology of a standard DNS poisoning attack and provides additional information on the vulnerability he discovered .
As he describes it , a DNS lookup request is essentially a race between a good guy and a bad guy , each of whom possess certain advantages .
The good guy knows when the race begins , and he knows the secret code that 's been sent along with that request in order to verify that the response coming back is actually authentic .
The bad guy does n't have this code , but he actually decides when the request goes out , and he knows about the request before the good guy does .
Normally , the good guy wins the vast majority of these races , and the bad guy is forced to race again and again in an attempt to guess the right authentication value before the good guy provides correct information .
What Kaminsky discovered , and what the new hack exploits , is a vulnerability in the recursive nature of the DNS system .
DNS is designed to " bump " your request along until it reaches a server that can answer the client 's request .
If you ask www.DNSTarget.com for a location it does n't know , DNSTarget.com can refer you to A.DNSTarget.com , B.DNSTarget.com , and so on , until it finds the requisite information .
A.DNSTarget.com is what 's called an " in-bailiwick " relative to DNSTarget.com — the information that comes back from that server is automatically trusted and passed on .
Therein lies the problem .
Instead of launching an attack straight at www.dnstarget.com and losing 99 percent of the time , the bad guy attacks one of the recursive in - bailiwick servers and then feeds it false information .
The in - bailiwick server communicates that data back to DNSTarget.com , which then caches the response — that way , it does n't need to look the information up again .
Problem is , the server has cached poisoned information and does n't know it .
Until that information drops out of the server 's cache , the bad guy has effectively won the race .
Moving to the more DNSSEC system would have solved this problem , and that idea was apparently floated , but it was dismissed on account of the tremendous overhead required by this protocol .
The patch that currently exists is not a foolproof solution , but it minimizes the chances that the attack will succeed .
" The exploit is now tens of thousands of times harder , but still possible , " Kaminsky stated during his Black Hat webcast .
" one in several hundred million to one in a couple billion . "
Introduction and Related Information
VIA caused quite a stir a few months ago when the company first revealed initial details regarding their low - power Nano processor .
At the time , the product was referred to by its internal codename of Isaiah .
In addition , the President of VIA 's design center that was tasked with making the processor , was decidedly outspoken , which made for some exciting reporting .
When news of the Isaiah core first broke , we hopped on the phone with Glenn Henry , VIA 's Centaur design center president , and got many questions answered regarding the processor 's architecture , features , expected performance , and the company 's plans for the CPU .
We strongly suggest checking that article out because we wo n't be rehashing much of the data here -- Glenn Henry 's exact works are available for download at the end of the piece , as is VIA 's Isaiah Architecture FAQ .
We have also covered the official announcement of the VIA Nano processor and detailed the exact models that would be available at launch .
In this piece , we were also able to disclose more architectural details , which may interest many of you who are interested in the intricate details of the chip 's inner workings .
One thing we had n't been able to give you all , however , was a direct performance comparison of the VIA Nano processor versus Intel 's recently released Atom , which is target at the same market segment .
Thankfully , we were recently given the opportunity to take a VIA Nano reference platform for a spin to see what it could do and will be presenting our results for you here today .
First up , just to reiterate some of the information we have covered in previous articles , here is an outline of the main features of the VIA Nano processor and a short comparison between the Nano and Atom .
64 - bit Superscalar Speculative Out - Of - Order MicroArchitecture : Supports a full 64 - bit instruction set and provides for macro-fusion and micro-fusion functionality , and sophisticated branch prediction for greater processor efficiency and performance .
High - Performance Computation and Media Processing :
The high - speed , low power VIA V4 Front Side Bus starting at 800M Hz , plus a high speed floating point unit , support for new SSE instructions , and two 64KB L1 caches and 1MB exclusive L2 cache with 16 - way associativity gives a big boost to multimedia performance .
Advanced Power and Thermal Management : Aggressive management of active power includes support for the new “ C6 ” power state , Adaptive PowerSaver Technology , new circuit techniques and mechanisms for managing the die temperature , reducing power draw and improving thermal management .
Scalable Upgrade to VIA C7 Processor : Pin -to - pin compatibility with current VIA C7 processors enables a smooth transition for OEMs and mainboard vendors , enabling them to offer a wider range of products for different markets with a single board or system design .
Greener Technology :
In addition to full compliance with RoHS and WEEE regulations , product manufacturing will be halogen - free and lead - free at launch , helping to promote a cleaner environment and more sustainable computing .
Enhanced VIA PadLock Security Engine : Industry - leading on - die hardware cryptographic acceleration and security features , including dual quantum random number generators , an AES Encryption Engine , NX execute protection , and SHA - 1 and SHA - 256 hashing .
To test the VIA Nano processor , we received a mini-ITX reference platform , that was originally designed for the C7 core .
But because the Nano is pin-compatible with the C7 , VIA was able to solder a Nano right onto the existing board .
VIA Nano Reference Platform with 1.8GHz Nano L2100 Processor
We should note , however , what you see pictured above will not be made available to consumers .
This platform was put together strictly for testing purposes and wo n't be put up for sale .
With that said , we 're hoping something similar comes to market because it has some interesting features .
Obviously the mini-ITX form factor is desirable for assembling ultra small systems .
But we also like the integrated mini-PC slot , PCI Express slot , and Compact Flash adapter .
Slap a 32 GB compact flash card in this puppy , along with a wireless adapter , and you 've got a great foundation for durable , low power car - computer .
Powering this platform was a VIA Nano L2100 processor clocked at 1.8GHz , with a VIA CN896 North Bridge and VT8251 South Bridge , and integrated Chrome9 HC graphics .
Unfortunately , this beta platform stopped working for us after a couple of days and we could n't experiment with it as much as we would have liked in time for this article .
Hopefully we 'll have a replacement soon and can plug in some more details for you all later .
Intel BOXD945GCLF with 1.6GHz Atom 230 Processor
For comparison purposes , we also got out hands on Intel 's BOXD945GCLF which comes complete with a 1.6GHz Atom 230 processor .
The BOXD945GCLF features an Intel 945GC Northbridge with an ICH7 Southbridge and integrated GMA950 graphics .
For more details regarding the Atom processor architecture and the chipset powering this platform , please refer to our coverage of the Atom launch and the 945 chipset introduction available here .

In this article I am going to cover two scenarios for streaming Flash video from the Flash Media Server to Flash Lite 3 .
The first is the simplest possible example the second will use script based bandwidth detection to determine the bandwidth available to the device and then stream the appropriate video based on that information .
Flash Lite 3 as has support for streaming content from Flash Media Server .
I am sure that most of you already know that it cannot be the same support that is in the desktop Flash player and you would be right .
There are several exceptions , for example you can stream content to a device with the FashLite 3.0 player but not from a device with the FlashLite 3 player to the Flash Media Server .
I hope that one day soon we will be able to stream video from a cellphone to a Flash Media Server and broadcast to the world but for now we will have to settle for consuming that content on our FlashLite 3 enabled devices .
The approach for creating a Flash Lite 3 application that receives streaming content from a Flash Media Server is very similar to creating that content and targeting the desktop player .
I should also say that for now you cannot create FlashLite applications using Flex , I hope that changes soon but today the Flex component foot print is too large for devices .
I will use Flash CS3 and Device Central for the examples in this article .
The example we are about to create should be familiar to you if you have created an application that took advantage of the Adobe Flash Media Server in the past .
We will use NetConnection and NetStream to create the connection and video.attachVideo ( ) and NetStream.play ( ) to attach and play the stream .
Two notable exceptions to functionality as compared to the desktop Flash player are the lack of support for Remote SharedObjects and one - way streaming as I mentioned earlier .
We are going to focus on video in this article , I will cover data in a separate article in the near future .
In order to test this example you will need to have Flash Media Interactive server 3 installed .
If you do not already have it installed you can use the developer version which provides a connection limited development server .
It is fully functional but will only allow a limited number of connections .
You can download this example ( simpleStreamingExample.fla ) and other examples from my Connect meeting room .
When you download this example you will need to substitute your FMS servers name or ip address for the following yourserver.com in the actionscript of the simpleStreamingExample .
fla file .
If you have the FMS server installed locally that would be localhost or 127.0.0.1 .
In addition you will need to substitute the name of a video file that you created and placed in the _definst_ directory under your FMS applications folder for the following melissaInterview in the actionscript of the simpleStreamingExample .
fla file .
You could also use one of the flv files on my Connect meeting room in the zip file called videos_for_streaming_example.zip .
The first part of the process will be to choose a target device .
In other words what device or devices are we going to target with this application ?
Launch Device Central and sort the list by the version of FlashLite then choose 3.0 .
You should see a few devices in the list , if you do n’t make sure to download the newest device profile update # 5 .
For this example I am going to use a generic Flash Lite 3 ( 240 x 320 ) profile because there is a problem with the new Nokia N95 8GB profile and DoCoMo removed support for video from the 905i series .
The issue with the Nokia N95 8GB profile is a known issue and should be fixed shortly and DoCoMo will add video support to the 906i series .
Before you wonder why I asked you to download the update , I just wanted to see if I could get you to do it .
Just kidding there will be other updates and I want you to get in the habit so that you always have the latest intel on devices that support Flash .
Now that you have a new blank Flash file open in Flash CS3 we will move on to the next major step which is to create the video object that we will use to attach our streaming video .
Open the Flash library from the Windows menu in Flash CS3 or you can use the short cut keys ( cntrl & L ) .
From the Display panel menu options of the library panel select “ New Video… ” .
Give the video object a name ( “ vid ” ) and drag it to the stage .
Once it is on the stage you will need to give it an instance name .
Simply click on the video object that you moved to the stage then look at the property inspector at the bottom of the stage .
The instance name is “ vid_video ” .
We will use this name in the Actionscript to attach the video stream to this object .
Now its time for a little Actionscript .
This is a very simple example and in order to keep it simple I am going to place my Actionscript on the first frame of a layer that I named “ AS ” .
I am using an “ if ( inited ” code block as the starting point of my application .
Inside of this “ if ” statement I am setting up a connection to my Flash Media server using the “ connect ” method of the NetConnection Class .
if ( inited == null ) {
inited = true ;
nc = new NetConnection ( ) ;
nc.connect ( “ rtmp://localhost/simpleVideo/ ” ) ;
playvid ( ) ;
}
function playvid ( ) {
ns = new NetStream ( nc ) ;
vid_video.attachVideo(ns ) ;
ns.play ( “ melissaInterview ” ) ;
}
The parameter in “ nc.connect ( “ rtmp://localhost/simpleVideo/” ) ” points to the application on the FMS server .
“ RTMP ” is the protocol used to carry the content .
There are several types of RTMP but Flash Lite 3 only supports basic RTMP no tunneling or encryption .
Protocol Description RTMP Real - Time Messaging Protocol RTMPT
Real - Time Messaging Protocol tunneled over HTTP RTMPE 128 - bit encrypted Real - Time Messaging Protocol RTMPTE 128 - bit encrypted Real - Time Messaging Protocol tunnelled over HTTP RTMPS Real - Time Messaging Protocol over SSL
The default port for FMS is 1935 , that can be changed if you use the default you do not have to include the port in the server reference .
Finally the application name ( i.e. simple Video ) , simply means that there is a folder in the applications folder inside the installation folder of the Flash Media Server called simpleVideo .
C: \Program Files \Adobe \Flash Media Server 3\applications\simpleVideo
Using a reference to the connection created in the previous step we create a one way channel inside the connection using NetStream .
ns = new NetStream ( nc ) ;
Using the reference from the previous step we attach the stream to the video object on stage .
vid_video.attachVideo(ns ) ;
Finally we start to play the video .
Notice that we leave off the “ .flv ” file extension .
ns.play ( “ melissaInterview ” ) ;
Pretty simple huh ?
Now lets add a little control to this example .
I would assume that most people viewing video might want to pause and play that video .
I am going to create a function called “ pausePlayVid ( ) ” and inside of that function I am going to add the pause method of the Netstream class .
function pausePlayVid( ) {
ns.pause ( ) ;
}
To keep it simple I am going to use a component that I created to map navigation keys to function names .
In other words I would assume that your device has left , right , up and down navigation keys , this component allows you to pick one of those navigation keys , in this case I will use the right navigation key , and map that to the function we just added to the example called “ pausePlayVid ” .
This is a simple component that you can download with the samples for this article .
Now when I test this example in Device Central and the video starts to play if we hit the right navigation key it will pause and if we hit it again it will play .
There is one more thing we should consider if we want this to work on mobile phones , bandwidth !
I am sure you have noticed that you can have a conversation with someone on your cellphone and simply turn around and loose the connection ?
If you have n’t then you must live in cell tower heaven .
For all the rest of us we should consider a way to stream different content based on available bandwidth .
There is nothing we can do for a lost connection although that would be a neat trick .
At this point I was planning to show how we could use the native bandwidth detection of FMS 3 ( Flash Media Server ) to automatically select the best streaming content for the current bandwidth of the FlashLite enabled device but unfortunately there is a problem that will not allow this functionality to be used with Flash Lite 3.x .
I am still looking into the cause of this but all is not lost .
Even though we cannot use the native bandwidth detection we can use an approach developed back in the days of Flash Communication Server ( i.e. predecessor to FMS ) and described by Stefan Richter on Adobe ’s Developer Connection .
This is a very good article that covers in detail the approach for bandwidth detection that will work with FlashLite 3 content .
In this article you will also find tutorial files and the server side script that performs the bandwidth detection .
The approach involves a call from the client to a server side script .
The server side script calls a method on the client to determine the devices bandwidth and sends the value back to the device .
At this point the device can use this information to choose the most appropriate content .
You will need to download the server side script ( bwcheck.asc ) and place it in a folder called “ bwcheck ” under the applications directory of the Flash Media Server 3 installation directory .
For all those not familiar with the Flash Media Server , the “ .asc ” extension denotes this as a server side script .
Now lets take a look at an example ( bwcheckExample.fla ) that uses bandwidth detection to determine the appropriate video to play on the device .
You can download this example and other examples from my Connect meeting room .
When you download this example you will need to substitute your FMS servers name or ip address for the following yourserver.com in the actionscript of the bwcheckExample file .
The video files for this example are in the videos_for_streaming_example.zip archive .
Unzip the video files and place them in the _definst_ directory inside the streams folder of the Flash Media Server as the following screen capture illustrates .
There is a brief description of the approach in the help files for Flash Media Server .
Even though the description mentions “ native bandwidth detection ” the actionscript will work for script based detection as well with one exception .
You will need to set the following to false in the “ Application.xml ” file on your Flash Media Server .
< BandwidthDetection enabled =” true ” >
In the following example we will use two connections to the server .
The first is a connection to get the available bandwidth and the second is to connect and play the appropriate stream .
Just to be clear I had to create the different video files ( “.flv ” ) manually .
There are server solutions to realtime transcoding but they are either too expensive or outside the scope of this article to explain , that maybe a topic for a future article .
It is also worth noting that in this example we only check the bandwidth once , it would be a good idea to check the bandwidth again in the event of an error or possibly poor video play back performance .
That might also be the topic of a future article as well .
As I have already covered the basics I will only cover the bandwidth detection in this example .
The following example starts the same way the previous example started with a new NetConnection ( ) .
When the connection is made and accepted by the server side script ( “ bwcheck.asc “ ) the process of detecting the bandwidth begins .
The server calls the method “ onBWCheck ” and sends packets of data in order to determine the clients bandwidth .
When the process is complete the server sends the results to “ onBWDone ” .
We create the connection that will be used to check the bandwidth of the client .
nc = new NetConnection ( ) ;
On the server the following code in the bwcheck.asc file on the FMS server accepts the connection and kicks off the detection process by calling the function calculateClientBw inside the same file .
application .onConnect = function ( p_client , p_autoSenseBW ) {
this.acceptConnection(p_client ) ;
if ( p_autoSenseBW )
this.calculateClientBw(p_client ) ;
The following is method on the client is called by the server to assist in determining the bandwidth of the client .
nc.onBWCheck = function ( ) {
return ++ counter ;
} ;
When the process is complete the server calls the client with the following and passes in the bandwidth , deltaDown , deltaTime and latency .
p_client.call ( “ onBWDone ” ) ;
On the client the following method retrieves the bandwidth , deltaDown , deltaTime and latency and then calls the function on the client that will determine the appropriate video file to use .
nc.onBWDone = function ( p_bw , deltaDown , deltaTime , latency ) {
initVideo ( p_bw ) ;
} ;
The following function uses the bandwidth information passed to it to set a variable called useVideo to the appropriate video file .
For simplicity I named the video files for the bandwidth they will use ( e.g. 200 kbps ) .
In addition I am also changing the amount of video that will be buffered before playing each video .
function playVideo( param_detected_bw:Number ) {
var detected_bw : Number = param_detected_bw ;
if ( detected_bw >200 ) {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ connected @ “ + detected_bw + ” kbps playing 256kbps_Stream ” ;
useVideo = “ 200 kbps ” ;
bufferlength = 4 ;
} else if ( detected_bw<200 && detected_bw > =160 ) {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ connected @ “ + detected_bw + ” kbps playing 150 kbps_Stream ” ;
useVideo = “ 150 kbps ” ;
bufferlength = 7 ;
} else if ( detected_bw <160 && detected_bw > =120 ) {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ connected @ “ + detected_bw + ” kbps playing 100 kbps_Stream ” ;
useVideo = “ 100 kbps ” ;
bufferlength = 9 ;
} else if ( detected_bw <120 && detected_bw >=85 ) {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ connected @ “ + detected_bw + ” kbps playing 75 kbps_Stream ” ;
useVideo = “ 75 kbps ” ;
bufferlength = 10 ;
} else if ( detected_bw <85 && detected_bw >=65 ) {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ connected @ “ + detected_bw + ” kbps playing 50 kbps_Stream ” ;
useVideo = “ 50 kbps ” ;
bufferlength = 12 ;
} else {
bdwdth_txt.text = “ bandwidth too low .
Sorry ”
} ;
Well thats it .
I hope that helps get you started creating streaming Flash video content for Flash Lite 3.x .

July 23 , 2008 — Patrick Zimmerman
Senator Obama spent a hot , dusty Tuesday in Jordan on the heel end of his fact - finding mission to Afghanistan and Iraq .
He arrived in Amman this afternoon with two fellow senators , Jack Reed ( D - RI ) and Chuck Hagel ( R- NE ) .
The trio cleaned up a bit after their journey before heading to the ancient ruins of the Amman Citadel to hold a press conference on their observations before the world press .
Senator Obama then went to the Palace of His Majesty , King Abdullah , to have a private one - on - one meeting before his Senate colleagues joined them for dinner .
From Jordan , Obama flew to Jerusalem .
After landing at Ben Gurion Airport on Tuesday night , Obama stated , “ I will share some of my ideas .
The most important idea for me to reaffirm is the historic and special relationship between the United States and Israel , one that can not be broken . ”
He pledged staunch support for Israel and stated that if elected , he would work to reinvigorate the Middle East peace process .
As part of his overseas tour , Obama met with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak .
Later in the day , he saw President Shimon Peres , Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Obama in Jordan : First Press Conference of Foreign Tour
Senator Obama also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial .
Wearing a white yarmulke , he rekindled a flame and paused for a few moments of quiet reflection as he laid a wreath on a tomb that contains ashes from the Nazi extermination camps .
“ At a time of great peril and promise , war and strife , we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of man ’s potential for great evil , but also our capacity to rise from tragedy and remake our world , ” Mr. Obama said after visiting the memorial .
“ Let our children come here , and know this history , so they can add their voices to proclaim ‘ never again .
And may we remember those who perished , not only as victims but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us , and who have become symbols of the human spirit . ”
Obama ’s Press Conference in Israel
Some abandoned ghost towns are now tourist attractions , while others might be dangerous or illegal to visit .
Meet some of the most fascinating ghost towns from around the world .
1 KOLMANSKOP ( Namibia ) : Buried in sand
Kolmanskop is a ghost town in southern Namibia , a few kilometres inland from the port of Lüderitz .
In 1908 , Luederitz was plunged into diamond fever and people rushed into the Namib desert hoping to make an easy fortune .
Within two years , a town , complete with a casino , school , hospital and exclusive residential buildings , was established in the barren sandy desert .
But shortly after the drop in diamond sales after the First World War , the beginning of the end started .
During the 1950 ’s the town was deserted and the dunes began to reclaim what was always theirs .
Soon the metal screens collapsed and the pretty gardens and tidy streets were buried under the sand .
Doors and windows creaked on their hinges , cracked window panes stared sightlessly across the desert .
A new ghost town had been born .
A couple of old buildings are still standing and some interiors like the theatre is still in very good condition , but the rest are crumbling ruins demolished from grandeur to ghost houses .
2 PRYPIAT ( Ukraine ) : Chernobyl workers ’ home
Prypiat is an abandoned city in the “ zone of alienation ” in northern Ukraine .
It was home to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers , abandoned in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster .
Its population had been around 50,000 prior to the accident .
Until recently , the site was practically a museum , documenting the late Soviet era .
Apartment buildings ( four of which were recent constructions not yet occupied ) , swimming pools , hospitals and other buildings were all abandoned , and everything inside the buildings was left behind , including records , papers , TVs , children ’s toys , furniture , valuables , and clothing , etc. that any normal family would have with them .
Residents were only allowed to take away a suitcase full of documents , books and clothes that were not contaminated .
However , many of the apartment buildings were almost completely looted some time around the beginning of the 21st century .[ citation needed ]
Nothing of value was left behind ; even toilet seats were taken away .
Some buildings have remained untouched .
Many of the building interiors have been vandalized and ransacked over the years .
Because the buildings are not maintained , the roofs leak , and in the spring the rooms are flooded with water .
It is not unusual to find trees growing on roofs and even inside buildings .
This hastens deterioration , and due to this , a 4 - story school partially collapsed in July of 2005 .
3 SAN ZHI ( Taiwan ) : a futuristic resort
in the North of Taiwan , this futuristic pod village was initially built as a luxury vacation retreat for the rich .
However , after numerous fatal accidents during construction , production was halted .
A combination of lack of money and lack of willingness meant that work was stopped permanently , and the alien like structures remain as if in remembrance of those lost .
Indeed , rumors in the surrounding area suggest that the City is now haunted by the ghosts of those who died .
After this the whole thing received the cover - up treatment .
And the Government , who commissioned the site in the first place was keen to distance itself from the bizarre happenings .
Thanks to this , there are no named architects .
The project may never be restarted thanks to the growing legend , and there would be no value in re-developing the area for other purpose .
Maybe simply because destroying homes of lonely spirits is a bad thing to do .
San Zhi can also be seen from an aeriel view here .
4 CRACO ( Italy ) : a fascinating medieval town
Craco is located in the Region of Basilicata and the Province of Matera .
About 25 miles inland from the Gulf of Taranto at the instep of the “ boot ” of Italy .
This medieval town is typical of those in the area , built up with long undulating hills all around that allow for the farming of wheat and other crops .
Craco can be dated back to 1060 when the land was in the ownership of Archbishop Arnaldo , Bishop of Tricarico .
This long - standing relationshop with the Church had much influence over the inhabitants throughout the ages .
In 1891 , the population of Craco stood at well over 2,000 people .
Though there had been many problems , with poor agricultural conditions creating desperate times .
Between 1892 and 1922 over 1,300 people moved from the town to North America .
Poor farming was added to by earthquakes , landslides , and War – all of which contributed to this mass migration .
Between 1959 and 1972 Craco was plagued by these landslides and quakes .
In 1963 the remaining 1,800 inhabitants were transferred to a nearby valley called Craco Peschiera , and the original Craco remains in a state of crumbling decay to this day .
5 ORADOUR - SUR - GLANE ( France ) : the horror of WWII
The small village of Oradour - sur - Glane , France , is the setting of unspeakable horror .
During World War II , 642 residents were massacred by German soldiers as punishment for the French Resistance .
The Germans had initially intended to target nearby Oradour - sur - Vayres and mistakenly invaded Oradour - sur - Glane on June 10th 1944 .
According to a survivor ’s account , the men were herded into barns where they were shot in the legs so they would die more slowly .
The women and children , who had been held in a church , all perished when their attempt to escape was met by machine - gun fire .
The village was razed by the Germans afterward .
Its ruins still stand today as a memorial to the dead and a reminder of the events that took place .
6 GUNKANJIMA ( Japan ) : the forbidden island
This island is one among 505 uninhabited islands in the Nagasaki Prefecture of Japan about 15 kilometers from Nagasaki itself .
It is also known as “ Gunkan - jima ” or Battleship Island thanks to its high sea walls .
It began in 1890 when a company called Mitsubishi bought the island and began a project to retrieve coal from the bottom of the sea .
This attracted much attention , and in 1916 they were forced to build Japan ’s first large concrete building on the island .
A block of apartments that would both accommodate the seas of workers and protect them from hurricanes .
In 1959 , population had swelled , and boasted a density of 835 people per hectare for the whole island ( 1,391 per hectare for the residential district ) – one of the highest population densities ever recorded worldwide .
As petroleum replaced coal in Japan in the 1960 ’s , coal mines began shutting down all over the country , and Hashima ’s mines were no exception .
In 1974 Mitsubishi officially announced the closing of the mine , and today it is empty and bare , with travel currently prohibited .
The island was the location for the 2003 film ‘ Battle Royale II ’ and inspired the final level of popular Asian videogame “ Killer7 ” .
7 KADYKCHAN ( Russia ) : memories of the Soviet Union
Kadykchan was one of many small Russian cities that fell into ruin when the Soviet Union collapsed .
Residents were forced to move to gain access to services like running water , schools and medical care .
The state moved them out over a period of two weeks , and they were taken to other towns and provided with new housing .
Once a tin mining town of 12,000 people , the city is now desolate .
In their hurry to leave , residents left their belongings behind in their homes , so you can now find aging toys , books , clothing and other objects throughout the empty city .
8 KOWLOON WALLED CITY ( China ) : A lawless city
The Kowloon Walled City was located just outside Hong Kong , China during British rule .
A former watchpost to protect the area against pirates , it was occupied by Japan during World War II and subsequently taken over by squatters after Japan ’s surrender .
Neither Britain nor China wanted responsibility for it , so it became its own lawless city .
Its population flourished for decades , with residents building labyrinthine corridors above the street level , which was clogged with trash .
The buildings grew so tall that sunlight could n’t reach the bottom levels and the entire city had to be illuminated with fluorescent lights .
It was a place where brothels , casinos , opium dens , cocaine parlors , food courts serving dog meat and secret factories ran unmolested by authorities .
It was finally torn down in 1993 after a mutual decision was made by British and Chinese authorities , who had finally grown wary of the unsanitary , anarchic city and its out - of - control population .
9 FAMAGUSTA ( Cyprus ) : once a top tourist destination , now a ghost town
Varosha is a settlement in the unrecognised Republic of Northern Cyprus .
Prior to the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus , it was the modern tourist area of the city of Famagusta .
For the last three decades , it has been left as a ghost town .
In the 1970s , the city was the number one tourist destination in Cyprus .
To cater to the increasing number of tourists , many new high - rise buildings and hotels were constructed .
When the Turkish Army gained control of the area during the war , they fenced it off and have since refused admittance to anyone except Turkish military and United Nations personnel .
The Annan Plan had provided for the return of Varosha to Greek Cypriot control , but this never happened , as the plan was rejected by Greek Cypriot voters .
As no repairs have been carried out for 34 years , all of the buildings are slowly falling apart .
Nature is reclaiming the area , as metal corrodes , windows break , and plants work their roots into the walls and pavements .
Sea turtles have been seen nesting on the deserted beaches .
By 2010 , the Turkish Cypriot administration of the de-facto Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus plan to reopen Varosha to tourism and the city will be populated as one of the most influential cities in the north of the island .
10 AGDAM ( Azerbaijan ) : once a 150,000 city of people , now lost
The eerie city of Agdam , Azerbaijan was once a thriving city of 150,000 people .
It was lost in 1993 during the Nagorno Karabakh war ; though the city was never the setting of combat , it fell victim to vandalism while occupied by Armenians .
The buildings are gutted and empty , with only the graffiti - covered mosque remaining intact .
Agdam residents have moved to other areas of Azerbaijan , as well as into Iran .
Reposting , since the article has been updated for international readers .
I get traffic from here , eg. where international comments can also be made .
The parliamentary vote is over and the results , analysis and comments occur at the end .
June 17 , 2008 : Hello world !
( NOTE :
This is a copy of a blog posting to my intermittent Global Texplorer blog
This may be one of the last messages to be sent from Sweden before the Parliament forces all the big Internet and Telecom providers to send a copy of all their traffic to a state run surveillance central .
Without any rational reason for it .
Vague arguments about terrorism .
Sweden is not faced by such threats and to abolish freedom of communications is not a solution to political problems in other countries .
Swedes will never be able to communicate again without a copy being sent to the state of all the traffic that passes our borders .
That is a large part of what we do .
Our whole lives are lived on the net today .
So the state will have a direct line into our lives .
The Swedish Journalist 's Federation has now called every journalist in the country who can make it to personally turn up at the parliament to beg the MOPs to vote NO !
This is an unprecedented manifestation in Sweden .
The law was a sure thing to pass until only a week ago .
Bloggers and activists have worked for months against it but mainstream media has not seen the significance of the law until the last week .
We , the netizens , have now managed to whip up a firestorm and the law will probably be turned down with a very slim margin althouh 85 - 90 % of the people are against having their communication copied to the state and are against the law .
The Swedish people is now glued to the TV screens , frighetend by the speeches they hear from half the country 's politicians .
We are hopeful , since the NO - sayers still stand strong .
But they need all support they can get .
The Journalist Federation 's manifestation is a last effoert to instill faith in them .
The soon - to - be - heroes need all supprt they can get .
UPDATE : The ruling parties , that are supposed to be primarily " liberal " ( in a European way ) , have managed to do cosmetic changes that satisfies some of the fiercest critics who will now vote for a compromise .
They did not have the guts to say NO to their own party bosses .
The deeply anti-liberal principle stands in the compromise :
All our communications will be copied into a state surveillance central .
Four heroes were needed to break party lines .
They appeared to stand strong .
But the parties of the government were psyching and pushing them until the youngest member of parliament , who is against this heinous law , was seen breaking down and crying outside the House .
She obeyed .
Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt has alienated all the liberals in the country and is generally seen as a political catastrophe .
Sweden is abolishing a fundamental basis for a free society :
The right to communicate without having the state snooping on you without any suspicion of a crime .
General wiretapping of us all .
International media must wake up and put pressure on Sweden .
Help us , please !!

I was interviewed today by our Danish neighbors who have realized what is going on here .
He was one fo the few members of the parliament who was there on a personal ticket and the reactions from his supporters are now fierce .
His blog is filled with hundreds of hostile comments .
The heroine that emerged from the parliamentary vote was a Liberal Party outsider who took an adamantly individualistic stance and refused to bow to the party line .
Her name is Camilla Lindberg .
Swedes have been sending flowers to her as if there were no tomorrow .
She had to ask people to donate money instead to Reporters without Borders .
Activism is boiling .
There is a real confidence crisis in politics in Sweden now .
Rumours of new parties and actions are filling mailing lists and blogs .
A typical YouTube contribution shows how many Swedes now feel : Overrun by a government that no longer represents them .
Some of the pictures inside the video shows party leaders of the government alliance .

The toll of early device replacement is magnified here because of the sheer number of procedures that take place in the United States .
Nearly one million hips and knees were used last year , about half of the world ’s total .
“ We are No. 1 both as a provider and user of implants , ” said Dr. John J. Callaghan , a professor of orthopedics at the University of Iowa .
“ We should be the leader in the follow - up of them . ”
The Food and Drug Administration is charged with monitoring devices like artificial joints .
But that system is often overwhelmed by the vast number of products it monitors and because doctors often do not report problems .
Medicare , which pays for about half the hip and knee implants in this country , rebuffed a proposal two years ago from a medical group to support a joint database .
It said it was not the agency ’s job to gather such data — despite the considerable savings in taxpayer dollars that might come from reducing the number of do - over surgeries .
The use of joint registries has proven beneficial abroad .
In Australia , regulators use such data to force manufacturers to justify why poorly performing hips or knees should remain available , and products have been withdrawn as a result .
In Sweden several years ago , surgeons alerted by their national registry stopped using a badly flawed hip long before their American counterparts did .
A few medical organizations here , like Kaiser Permanente , operate their own registries to good effect and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York has recently set up a registry .
But for more than a decade , efforts to set up an open national registry in this country have failed .
One witness to those events has been Dr. Malchau , who worked for a decade at the Swedish registry .
He and other registry advocates have heard all the reasons a registry cannot work here — busy doctors hate paperwork , plaintiffs ’ lawyers would mine a database to find cases , general hospitals would be unfairly compared with specialty ones , to name a few .
Drowned out by those complaints is what registries do for patients .
“ It has been very frustrating , ” Dr. Malchau said .
Perhaps some of you have noticed my repeated references to weight related issues .
That 's because I have a sweet tooth .
And while it is generally frowned upon for an addict to admit a love affair with an addictive substance , I am not afraid to declare my love and sometimes admiration for the white , powdery substance I get by the bag .
No , not cocaine or heroin , something critics would have us believe is just as bad , in part because it is so easily accessible : white , refined table sugar .
And that readers , is why I often lament on the difficulties of managing weight in a world sprinkled with pushers like Sara Lee , the corner baker and the candy machine down the hall !
Just like an addict , repeated attempts to kick my " habit " have all ended disgracefully often leaving me with pie on my face , literally !
To this end , I have a friend who tries to calm my fears by reassuring me that something that does n't weigh a pound cannot make me gain a pound .
Fine !
But what about the bag of chocolate covered nuts ( they 're filled with protein ) I ate this morning ?
The one I forgot to weigh on my food scale ?
How much of that have I got sitting inside of me , threatening the needle of my bathroom scale ?
If you 've ever weighed yourself later in the day and wondered how much you should subtract for clothes and food you 've already eaten that day then you 'll immediately see the value in R.J. O'Neill 's " Feces Scale . "
If not , then just subtract 5 pounds .
FYI : This number has not been arrived at scientifically .
Instead , it is based solely on my wishful thinking .
Anyway , little explanation of this patent is needed , as the title pretty much gives it away .
United States patent 1493222 is for " A weighing device especially adapted for weighing feces as excreted . "
Simply put , the patent is for a toilet outfitted with a turd scale in the bowl .
A person seats themselves on the toilet , does their " business , " and just like stepping on a traditional scale , takes a deep breath and hopes the number that registers at the top of the toilet bowl does not betray the number they 've been praying for .
As for a sugar addict like me , the best I can hope for is that the number on the feces scale scares me straight and sends me running into detox !

" The first thing I want you to know , Mr. Mayor , is that when you walk out of this room , you will have the computer codes . "
Those words - delivered to Mayor Gavin Newsom by imprisoned city computer tech Terry Childs in a small , fourth - floor room at city jail Monday - signaled the beginning of the end of the weeklong standoff in which San Francisco officials found themselves in the embarrassing position of being locked out of their own computer system .
Childs - whom some have described as a friendly , hard worker at the city Technology Department , and others have labeled an over - the - top control freak - has been sitting in jail since July 13 on $ 5 million bail , after being arrested for reconfiguring key passwords in the city 's computer system .
A team of code crackers brought in from Cisco Systems had been working around the clock to try to decipher Childs ' codes , but with only marginal success .
" It was n't cheap and I just could n't see us keep spending that kind of money , " Newsom said .
Then , out of the blue , Childs ' lawyer , Erin Crane , called the mayor 's office Monday afternoon , offering a jailhouse meeting .
Childs , according to the lawyer , was ready to give up the codes - but only to the mayor , who had gone out of his way in his public comments not to portray Childs as some sort of monster .
Newsom did n't hesitate .
Without asking the city attorney for an opinion or giving a heads up to police or the district attorney , he was at the Hall of Justice in half an hour .
With Crane by his side , Childs told Newsom about the computer system he'd set up and how all the current problems sprang from a series of misunderstandings .
Crane did n't let him go on for too long , and Childs got to the business at hand , asking for a pen .
He then wrote out a very long computer code .
" This better be right , " Newsom said .
" It is , " Childs assured him , but asked the mayor to deliver it in person to the Cisco specialists - not to the city 's computer brass .
Newsom took the code to the city computer center and gave it to a Cisco techie , who found that it did n't work - prompting a call - back to Crane .
" He said you would be calling and you would be upset , " the lawyer said .
" He forgot to give you the protocols to go along with the code " - and she read the accompanying computer prompters to the mayor over the phone .
By Tuesday morning , the system was back in the hands of the city .
Wedding flash :
It turns out there 's a reason for the " Out of Africa " theme at Mayor Gavin Newsom ' swedding Saturday in Montana .
Following the nuptials , Newsom and his bride , Jennifer Siebel , will return home for a week - then jet to Africa for a two - week combination honeymoon and vacation with Siebel 's family .
" We 're going to South Africa , Kenya and I 'm not sure where else , " Newsom said .
" Jennifer used to work in Africa for Conservation International and she wants to show me around , " Newsom said .
Rolling on :
The hundreds of San Francisco and Oakland city workers receiving take - home cars and free gas fill - ups during these hard times are hardly alone .
Over at the pollution - monitoring Bay Area Air Quality Management Control District - an agency funded from a combination of permit fees and county , state and federal money - 128 workers have take - home car privileges .
That 's more than a third of its 300 - strong workforce .
Seventy - three of the employees are inspectors out in the field , and 55 more are tech staff and executives who " do so much traveling around the Bay Area for meetings , " according to agency spokeswoman Lisa Fasano .
The agency keeps an additional 32 cars - mostly gas - saving Toyota Priuses , hybrid Ford Escapes and vehicles that run on natural gas - for the rest of its workforce .
Plus eight bikes .
Employees who are assigned cars get gas cards for work - related driving - and in all , the agency spends nearly $ 260,000 a year on fuel .
Fasano said the cards do " not cover commuting to work . "
The gas bills can be checked by the district 's bosses , but Fasano acknowledged it 's largely an honor system .
The air quality district - whose goal is to push people out of their cars and onto public transit - also provides all its employees with free BART and bus passes at a cost $ 276,000 a year .
Muscle flexing : Big fight down at San Francisco 's Democratic County Central Committee , as Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin and Supervisor Chris Daly try to grab control from gay activist and Deputy City Attorney Scott Wiener .
Their idea is to replace Wiener as committee chairman with Peskin , who was just elected along with Daly to the central committee .
Wiener 's supposed offense : not condemning the Human Rights Campaign when it supported a federal anti-discrimination bill that left out protection for transgender people .
The real play : Peskin , who will be termed out of office in November , and Daly , who still has 2 1 / 2 years left in his final term , are looking to reassert their political power .
They figure that by taking control of the central committee , which is expected to hand out slate - card endorsements and money to candidates running for the Board of Supervisors this fall , they 'll stay in control .
When Daly heard that one central committee member might not go along with the play to dethrone Wiener , he fired off a blistering message on his Blackberry warning that Wiener 's re-election could stymie efforts for progressives to take control of the party .
" I , for one , have already committed to make it my personal mission to make sure that any members voting for Scott never receive the endorsement of the Guardian , Tenants Union , Sierra Club and Milk Club in subsequent races , " Daly said .
" I hope that you decide to be with us . "
And you thought Don Corleone was dead .
Peskin , who predicted Tuesday he may have just enough votes to replace Wiener when the balloting is conducted tonight , said he had nothing to do with Daly 's threats - and he even condemned them .

Pam Miles of AfterDowningStreet reports that she has firm confirmation that Nancy Pelosi is urging the Judiciary committee to not hold Rove in Contempt of Congress for his blatant contempt in not showing up to evoke executive privilege .
Just a glorious F.U. to any oversight .
And , to the American people .
First , we have masses of I do n’t recall and I do n’t remember ’s .
Then we have David Addington testifying with the attitude of a 14 year old who has been told it would n’t be wise to follow her friends over the cliff ( But , everyone does it ! ) .
And I wo n’t go into Professor Yoo , of University of California Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall , whose torture memos are now infamous .
I pondered the other day how this administration has managed to keep Congress on such a short leash .
It ’s not surprising that it will be forthcoming the level which this administration has spied on Congress .
There is little in the way of explanations for what has taken place in the last seven years .
In the 2006 midterm elections , Congress was given a mandate ( with 22 of the 33 seats going to the Democrats ) .
Additionally , three red strongholds were lost to Democrats in recent special elections , further showing that the American public is tired of Republican rule .
Yet , the Democrats continue to fold like cheap chairs .
So , with this , I ask you two things :
1 ) Call your elected officials and tell them not to let Rove off that easily .
Pam has an extensive list of contact telephone numbers and you can also get all of your elected official contact information here .
And ,
2 ) Tell me , why do YOU think the our elected officials are rolling over on all of us ?

Breaking up can be tough on the heart , but it 's not as emotionally taxing as we would predict , a study finds .
Score one for resilient types who keep things to themselves .
Contrary to popular notions about what is normal or healthy , new research has found that it is OK not to express one 's thoughts and feelings after experiencing a collective trauma , such as a school shooting or terrorist attack .
In fact , people who choose not to express their feelings after such an event may be better off than those who do talk about their feelings , said University at Buffalo psychologist Mark Seery , lead author of the study detailed in the June issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology .
Seery investigated the mental and physical effects of collective traumas on people who are exposed to a tragedy but who do not experience a direct loss of a friend or family member .
He focused on people 's responses to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" To the extent that other collective traumas are similar to 9/11 in that many people are exposed though intense media coverage , even if they do not experience direct loss , there is reason to think these results could generalize to other events , " Seery told LiveScience .
The findings have implications for expectations of how people should respond in the face of a collective trauma affecting a whole community or even an entire nation .
Seery says the results should not be interpreted to mean that expressing one 's thoughts and feelings is harmful or that if someone wants to express their emotions they should not do so .
" It 's important to remember that not everyone copes with events in the same way , and in the immediate aftermath of a collective trauma , it is perfectly healthy to not want to express one 's thoughts and feelings , " he said .
Assumption that talking is better
Seery points out that immediately after last year 's tragic shootings at Virginia Tech University there were many " talking head " psychiatrists in the media describing how important it was to get the students expressing their feelings .
" This perfectly exemplifies the assumption in popular culture , and even in clinical practice , that people need to talk in order to overcome a collective trauma , " Seery said .
" Instead , we should be telling people there is likely nothing wrong if they do not want to express their thoughts and feelings after experiencing a collective trauma , " he said .
" In fact , they can cope quite successfully and , according to our results , are likely to be better off than someone who does want to express his or her feelings . "
Surprise on who was better off
Seery and co-researchers tested people 's responses to the terrorist attacks , beginning immediately after the event and continuing for the following two years .
Respondents were given the chance to express their thoughts and feelings on that day and a few days afterward .
The analysis drew in part from 1,559 responses to an open - ended question about one 's " thoughts on the shocking events of today " emailed on Sept. 11 , 2001 , to a large randomly generated national sample ,
The researchers then compared people who chose to express their thoughts and feelings versus those who chose not to express , focusing on such measures as whether they had any post - traumatic stress symptoms , their physical health and generalized distress .
If the assumption about the necessity of expression is correct — that failing to express one 's feelings indicates some harmful repression or other pathology — then people who chose not to express should have been more likely to experience negative mental and physical health symptoms over time , the researchers said .
" However , we found exactly the opposite : people who chose not to express were better off than people who did choose to express , " Seery said .
Moreover , when the researchers looked only at people who chose to express their thoughts and feelings , and tested the length of their responses , they found a similar pattern .
People who expressed more were worse off than people who expressed less .
" We assessed various alternative explanations in secondary analyses , but nothing else accounts for this effect , " Seery said .
The research project was funded by the National Science Foundation and Roxane Cohen Silver .

I just received the following question , whose answer is the same in C++ , C# , and Java .
Question :
In the following code , why is n’t the destructor / disposer ever called to clean up the Widget when the constructor emits an exception ?
You can entertain this question in your mainstream language of choice :
// C++ ( an edited version of the original code
// that the reader emailed me )
class Gadget {
Widget * w ; public :
Gadget ( ) {
w = new Widget ( ) ;
throw new exception ( ) ;
// … or some API call might throw
} ; ~ Gadget ( ) {
if ( w != nullptr ) delete w ;
}
} ; // C# ( equivalent )
class Gadget : IDisposable {
private Widget w ; public Gadget ( ) {
w = new Widget ( ) ;
throw new Exception ( ) ;
// … or some API call might throw
} ; public void Dispose ( ) {
// … eliding other mechanics , eventually calls :
if ( w != null ) w. Dispose ( ) ;
// or just “ w = null ; ” if Widget is n’t IDisposable
}
} ; // Java ( equivalent )
class Gadget {
private Widget w ; public Gadget ( ) {
w = new Widget ( ) ;
throw new Exception ( ) ;
// … or some API call might throw
} ; public void dispose ( ) {
if ( w != null ) w.dispose ( ) ;
// or just “ w = null ; ” if Widget is n’t disposable
}
} ;
Interestingly , we can answer this even without knowing the calling code … but there is typical calling code that is similar in all three languages that reinforces the answer .
Construction and Lifetime
The fundamental principles behind the answer is the same in C++ , C# , and Java :
A constructor conceptually turns a suitably sized chunk of raw memory into an object that obeys its invariants .
An object ’s lifetime does n’t begin until its constructor completes successfully .
If a constructor ends by throwing an exception , that means it never finished creating the object and setting up its invariants — and at the point the exceptional constructor exits , the object not only does n’t exist , but never existed .
A destructor / disposer conceptually turns an object back into raw memory .
Therefore , just like all other nonprivate methods , destructors / disposers assume as a precondition that “ this ” object is actually a valid object and that its invariants hold .
Hence , destructors / disposers only run on successfully constructed objects .
I ’ve covered some of these concepts and consequences before in GotW # 66 , “ Constructor Failures , ” which appeared in updated and expanded form as Items 17 and 18 of More Exceptional C++.
In particular , if Gadget ’s constructor throws , it means that the Gadget object was n’t created and never existed .
So there ’s nothing to destroy or dispose :
The destructor / disposer not only is n’t needed to run , but it ca n’t run because it does n’t have a valid object to run against .
Incidentally , it also means that the Gadget constructor is n’t exception - safe , because it and only it can clean up resources it might leak .
In the C++ version , the usual simple way to write the code correctly is to change the w member ’s type from Widget* to shared_ptr < Widget > or an equivalent smart pointer type that owns the object .
But let ’s leave that aside for now to explore the more general issue .
A Look At the Calling Code
Next , let ’s see how these semantics are actually enforced , whether by language rules or by convention , on the calling side in each language .
Here are the major idiomatic ways in each language to use an Gadget object in an exception - safe way :
// C++ caller {
Gadget myGadget ;
// do something with my Gadget
} // C# caller using ( Gadget myGadget = new Gadget ( ) )
{
// do something with my Gadget
} // Java caller Gadget myGadget = new Gadget ( ) ; try {
// do something with my Gadget
}
finally {
myGadget.dispose ( ) ;
}
Consider the two cases where an exception can occur :
What if an exception is thrown while using myGadget — that is , during “ do something with myGadget ” ?
In all cases , we know that myGadget ’s destructor / dispose method is guaranteed to be called .
— that is , during “ do something with myGadget ” ?
In all cases , we know that myGadget ’s destructor / dispose method is guaranteed to be called .
But what if an exception is thrown while constructing myGadget ?
Now in all cases the answer is that the destructor / dispose method is guaranteed not to be called .
Put another way , we can say for all cases :
The destructor / dispose is guaranteed to be run if and only if the constructor completed successfully .
Another Look At the Destructor / Dispose Code
Finally , let ’s return to each key line of code one more time :
// C++
if ( w != nullptr ) delete w ; // C#
if ( w != null ) w. Dispose ( ) ; // Java
if ( w != null ) w.dispose ( ) ;
The motivation for the nullness tests in the original example was to clean up partly - constructed objects .
That motivation is suspect in principle — it means the constructors are n’t exception - safe because only they can clean up after themselves — and as we ’ve seen it ’s flawed in practice because the destructors / disposers wo n’t ever run on the code paths that the original motivation cared about .
So we do n’t need the nullness tests for that reason , although you might still have nullness tests in destructors / disposers to handle ‘ optional ’ parts of an object where a valid object might hold a null pointer or reference member during its lifetime .
In this particular example , we can observe that the nullness tests are actually unnecessary , because w will always be non-null if the object was constructed successfully .
There is no ( legitimate ) way that you can call the destructor / disposer ( Furthermore , C++ developers will know that the test is unnecessary for a second reason :
Delete is a no-op if the pointer passed to it is null , so there ’s never a need to check for that special case . )
Conclusion
When it comes to object lifetimes , all OO languages are more alike than different .
Object and resource lifetime matters , whether or not you have a managed language , garbage collection ( finalizers are not destructors / disposers ! ) , templates , generics , or any other fancy bell or whistle layered on top of the basic humble class .
The same basic issues arise everywhere … the code you write to deal with them is just spelled using different language features and / or idioms in the different languages , that ’s all .
We can have lively discussions about which language offers the easiest / best / greenest / lowest - carbon - footprint way to express how we want to deal with a particular aspect of object construction , lifetime , and teardown , but those concerns are general and fundamental no matter which favorite language you ’re using to write your code this week .
The study suggests sexual orientation may be set in the womb
The brains of gay men and women look like those found in heterosexual people of the opposite sex , research suggests .
The Swedish study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal , compared the size of the brain 's halves in 90 adults .
Gay men and heterosexual women had halves of a similar size , while the right side was bigger in lesbian women and heterosexual men .
A UK scientist said this was evidence sexual orientation was set in the womb .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no argument any more - if you are gay , you are born gay
Dr Qazi Rahman
Queen Mary , University of London Scientists have noticed for some time that homosexual people of both sexes have differences in certain cognitive abilities , suggesting there may be subtle differences in their brain structure .
This is the first time , however , that scientists have used brain scanners to try to look for the source of those differences .
A group of 90 healthy gay and heterosexual adults , men and women , were scanned by the Karolinska Institute scientists to measure the volume of both sides , or hemispheres , of their brain .
When these results were collected , it was found that lesbians and heterosexual men shared a particular " asymmetry " in their hemisphere size , while heterosexual women and gay men had no difference between the size of the different halves of their brain .
In other words , structurally , at least , the brains of gay men were more like heterosexual women , and gay women more like heterosexual men .
A further experiment found that in one particular area of the brain , the amygdala , there were other significant differences .
In heterosexual men and gay women , there were more nerve " connections " in the right side of the amygdala , compared with the left .
The reverse , with more neural connections in the left amygdala , was the case in homosexual men and heterosexual women .
The Karolinska team said that these differences could not be mainly explained by " learned " effects , but needed another mechanism to set them , either before or after birth .
' Fight , flight or mate '
Dr Qazi Rahman , a lecturer in cognitive biology at Queen Mary , University of London , said that he believed that these brain differences were laid down early in foetal development .
" As far as I 'm concerned there is no argument any more - if you are gay , you are born gay , " he said .
The amygdala , he said , was important because of its role in " orientating " , or directing , the rest of the brain in response to an emotional stimulus - be it during the " fight or flight " response , or the presence of a potential mate .
" In other words , the brain network which determines what sexual orientation actually ' orients ' towards is similar between gay men and straight women , and between gay women and straight men .
" This makes sense given that gay men have a sexual preference which is like that of women in general , that is , preferring men , and vice versa for lesbian women . "

AMSTERDAM , Netherlands , June 23 ( UPI ) --
Thousands of people in the Netherlands say they expect the world to end in 2012 , and many say they are taking precautions to prepare for the apocalypse .
The Dutch - language de Volkskrant newspaper said it spoke to thousands of believers in the impending end of civilization , and while theories on the supposed catastrophe varied , most tied the 2012 date to the end of the Mayan calendar , Radio Netherlands reported Monday .

De Volkskrant said many of those interviewed are stocking up on emergency supplies , including life rafts and other equipment .
Some who spoke to the newspaper were optimistic about the end of civilization .
" You know , maybe it 's really not that bad that the Netherlands will be destroyed , " Petra Faile said .
" I do n't like it here anymore .
Take immigration , for example .
They keep letting people in .
And then we have to build more houses , which makes the Netherlands even heavier .
The country will sink even lower , which will make the flooding worse . "
The DNA model is an extremely interesting thing and its art projects are personal masterpieces for your home .
DNA is basically a scientific genetic code which proves each one of us is his / her own unique being .
DNA 11 have decided to combine each person ’s unique code with his or her own art piece for home or office .
As the pictures illustrate , we can clearly see a difference in each portrait .
Since each individual DNA is different , no art project is the same , therefore creating a completely original print .
We have seen other code influences such as Ascii art made by printing ascii code on usable and practical curtains , but this provides a completely different personal artistic touch to your home .
By a simple saliva swab , you can provide your own DNA breakdown which may be made into an art portrait based on the design specs you select .
If you like a certain print more than others , you can either re-swab , or ask them if they have a cloning possibility .

Many sports teams select their uniforms based on the mascot , city or country they are representing and not on a referee ’s preference or bias but a new study has found that choosing the color red for a uniform in competitive sports can actually affect the referee ’s split - second decision - making ability and even promote a scoring bias .
Psychologists Norbert Hagemann , Bernd Strauss and Jan Leiβing from the University of Münster specifically found that referees tended to assign more points to TaeKwon
Do competitors dressed in red than those dressed in blue .
The researchers presented 42 experienced tae kwon do referees with videos of blue - and red-clad competitors sparring .
The two sets of clips were identical except that the colors were reversed in the second set , making the red athlete appear to be wearing blue and vice versa .
The referees were then asked to score the performance of each competitor , red or blue , after each video .
The psychologists found that when the competitors appeared to be wearing red , they were awarded an average of 13 % more points than the blue competitors , even though every athlete was presented in both colors at some point .
What ’s more , points awarded seemed to increase after the blue athlete was digitally transformed into a red athlete and decrease when the red competitor changed to blue .
The findings , which appear in the August 2008 issue of Psychological Science , suggest that referees may hold a split - second bias toward red-clad athletes when the competitors are evenly matched in skill : “ Referees ’ decisions will ‘ tip the scales ’ when athletes are relatively well - matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior , ” wrote the authors .
“ Although there is a need for further research , including research on the effects of different colors , our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision - making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem , ” they concluded .
ESPN analyst Barry Melrose will be introduced as the Tampa Bay Lightning 's new head coach at a news conference Tuesday .
Melrose has been an ESPN analyst full time since 1996 .
He had previously worked as a studio analyst for ESPN's Emmy Award - winning 1994 Stanley Cup playoff coverage and for ESPN and ESPN2 during the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs .
Melrose was the head coach of the Los Angeles Kings from 1992 to ' 95 .
In his debut season , his team advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in franchise history .
Melrose began his coaching career in 1987 when he led the Medicine Hat Tigers to the WHL's Memorial Cup Title .
He also coached the Seattle Thunderbirds for the 1988 - 89 season and the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League for three seasons ( 1989 - 92 ) .
Melrose guided the Red Wings to the Calder Cup championship in 1991 .
He also served as the team 's general manager during his final two seasons .
The Arizona Republic reported on Monday that Phoenix Coyotes assistant Rick Tocchet will not return to the team but will join Melrose 's staff in Tampa .
Tocchet , 44 , played 18 seasons in the NHL but as a coach was involved in a gambling investigation and left the team for two years .
Monday , the primary investors in a group buying the Lightning said they have no intention of moving the team and will be " shockingly aggressive " in trying to improve the club that finished last in the NHL last season .

Meet the Martin Jetpack , a contraption unveiled at a US air show yesterday .
It is a real - life version of the toy we all fantasised about as children ( and some of us as adults ) and which Sean Connery as James Bond got to wear in the early minutes of Thunderball .
Simply attach , the manufacturers claim , and up you go .
No more traffic jams as you slice through the air at speeds of up to 186 mph .
Developed in secret over the past 10 years by Glenn Martin , an inventor based in New Zealand , the jetpack made its public debut at AirVenture , an annual experimental aerospace show in Oshkosh , Wisconsin .
The pilot yesterday was Glenn 's son , Harrison , and he showed it off without mishap .
The company , that also launched an accompanying website , calls it the " world 's first practical jetpack " .
Mr Martin may have succeeded where many others have failed .
In the US , the now defunct Bell Aerosystems attempted to bring the dream of jetpack travel to reality in the 60s and 70s , notably with the so - called rocket belt .
It never came close to being pursued commercially , however .
In the 50s , the US military tested something called the Hiller Flying Platform .
It did n't work too well either .
But Mr Martin is apparently serious about getting your business .
Pay no attention to the not - so - sleek looks of his invention .
Take to the skies in his jetpack and onlookers might assume Superman is passing overhead with a drum kit hanging from his shoulders .
Nor will there be any music system options .
Commuting with the jetpack will be noisier than a visit to a two - stroke lawnmower derby .
Just so there is no misunderstanding , there are no actual jets involved here .
The thrust of a jet tends to be a little trickier to tame than the power generated by the two piston - engine fans that you will find in a Martin Jetpack .
But let 's not quibble , it looks like the real thing .
Technically , it is an ultralight aircraft that , according to the website , is already in compliance with regulations of the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States .
As such , moreover , buyers will not need a special licence to fly one .
If that sounds alarming , rest assured that Mr Martin 's company will insist that every purchaser take a training course before turning the ignition key .
" To attempt to fly any aircraft without professional instruction is extremely foolhardy , " the site says under a headline , " How do I learn to fly ? "
And while it may be an " ultralight " be aware that what you will be tying to your back weighs a good 250 lb and generates 600 lb in thrust .
A company official in New Zealand said yesterday that the books were open for orders at once at a price tag of $ 100,000 ( roughly £ 50,000 ) .
" We are not going to guarantee an actual delivery date , " Jan Harvey said , " but we are saying 2009 , roughly 12 months from order . "
In truth , Mr Martin does not seem seriously to be suggesting his jetpack will one day replace the automobile as the transport mode of choice .
He is hoping instead that it will become more of a sports toy for the very adventurous .
" I 've made the jetski for the sky , " he said in Oshkosh .
So far , Mr Martin has kept test - flights at super - low altitude , usually between 3ft and 6ft off the ground .
( A demonstration video shows a pilot gunning the pack while two helpers cling onto its sides to prevent man and machine zipping up into space . )
In theory , however , the pack can fly unimpeded for 30 minutes and go as high as 8,000 ft .
Instead of airbags , the jetpack comes with a parachute deployed by a small explosive in the event of disaster aloft .
Worried that if you buy a pack you may fail the training ?
Never fear , Mr Martin has thought of that .
" If for some reason they 're not co-ordinated enough , we 'll send them their money back and give it to the next person in the queue , " he said .
High flyers : the pioneering rocket men
For many , the jetpack will forever be associated with the master of gadgets , James Bond .
Bond used it to flee from his enemies in the 1965 film , Thunderball .
His pack had been developed for the US Army .
Millions of people watched in amazement during the opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , as Kinnie Gibson took his " Rocketman " jet pack to the sky , landing safely in the stadium .
A firm called Skywalker Jets devised a prototype rocket pack that could keep a pilot in the air for five minutes .
Hopes of mass production were foiled by an estimated £ 100,000 price tag .
Another recent design came from the German firm Jet -Cat .
Its take on the device , which contains foldable wings , made a six - minute flight to the Swiss town of Bex .

An Italian court has ordered the government to pay 100,000 euros ( £ 79,919 ) to a man who had to retake his driving test because he was gay .
Danilo Giuffrida , now 26 , told doctors he was homosexual during a medical examination for military service .
The information was passed to the defence and transport ministries .
Mr Giuffrida was told to repeat his driving test or have his licence suspended because of his " sexual identity disturbance " .
Mr Giuffrida passed his test for the second time but his licence was renewed for just one year rather than the usual 10 years because of his homosexuality .
A court in Catania , Sicily , ordered the ministries to pay damages on the basis that Mr Giuffrida 's constitutional rights had been breached and that homosexuality could not be considered a " mental illness " .
The judge said the actions of the ministries showed " evident sexual discrimination " .
Mr Giuffrida welcomed the sentence as " a step forwards for civil rights . "

Things in the U.S. sure are tough .
Brother , can you spare a euro ?
Signs saying " We accept euros " are cropping up in the windows of some Manhattan retailers .
A Belgium company is trying to gobble up St. Louis - based Anheuser - Busch , the nation 's largest brewer and iconic Super Bowl advertiser .
The almighty dollar is mighty no more .
It has been declining steadily for six years against other major currencies , undercutting its role as the leading international banking currency .
The long slide is fanning inflation at home and playing a major role in the run-up of oil and gasoline prices everywhere .
Vacationing Europeans are finding bargains in the U.S. , while Americans in Paris and other world capitals are being clobbered by sky - high tabs for hotels , travel and even sidewalk cafes .
Northern border - city Americans who once flocked into Canada for shopping deals are staying home ; it 's the Canadians flocking here now .
Everything made in America - from goods to entire companies - is near dirt cheap to many foreigners .
Meanwhile , American consumers , both those who travel and those who stay at home , are seeing big price increases in energy , food and imported goods .
The dollar has lost roughly a quarter of its purchasing power against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners from its peak in 2002 .
Since oil is bought and sold in dollars worldwide , the devalued dollar has made the recent surge in energy prices even worse for Americans , leading to $ 4 gasoline in the United States .
Analysts suggest that of the $ 140 a barrel that oil fetches globally , some $ 25 may be due to the devalued dollar .
Further declines in the dollar will add to oil 's appeal as a commodity to be traded .
Oil , suggests influential energy consultant Daniel Yergin , is " the new gold . "
The limp greenback has had one big benefit to the U.S. economy : Since it makes American goods cheaper overseas , it has helped manufacturers who export and other U.S. based companies with international reach .
Exports have been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise darkening U.S. economy .
Franklin Vargo , vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers , welcomes the dollar slide , as do members of his organization .
" We can see that , when the dollar 's not overpriced , that people around the world want American goods and our exports are going gangbusters now , " he said .
He does n't see the dollar as undervalued .
He sees it as having being overpriced in the 1990s - and what 's happened since as something along the lines of a correction .
Still , Vargo acknowledges the dollar 's decline has brought a measure of pain to some consumers .
" As the dollar has gone down in value , that has added to the dollar cost of oil .
No question .
So having the dollar decline is not unambiguously a plus .
That 's why we say there 's got to be a balance there somewhere .
What we want is a Goldilocks dollar .
Not too strong , not too weak .
But just right .
And only the market can determine that , " Vargo said .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com , said expanding exports due to a weak dollar are " an important source of growth , but it does n't add a lot to jobs , it does n't mean very much for the average American household .
For the average American , for the average consumer , these are pretty tough times . "
The loss of the dollar 's purchasing power and international respect has some experts worrying that the euro might one day replace the dollar as the so - called primary reserve currency .
And that could trigger a dollar rout as foreign governments and international investors flee from U.S. Treasury bonds and other dollar - denominated investments .
Making matters worse :
The gaping U.S. current - account deficit - the amount by which the value of goods , services and investments bought in the U.S. from overseas exceeds the amount the U.S. sells abroad - and the low levels of domestic savings means that foreigners must purchase more than $ 3 billion every business day to fund the imbalance .
Since roughly half of the nation 's nearly $ 10 trillion national debt is held by foreigners , mostly in Treasury bills and bonds , such a withdrawal could have enormous consequences .
Yet Washington finds its options limited .
President Bush asserts longtime support for a " strong " dollar , and made that point again Sunday in a news conference in Japan with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda .
" In terms of the dollar , the United States strongly believes - believes in a strong dollar policy and believes that the strength of our economy will be reflected in the dollar . "
But not once in his presidency has the U.S bought dollars on foreign exchange markets - called intervention - to help prop up the greenback .
There 's no telling where the buck will stop these days , although for the past few weeks it seems to be in a holding pattern .
Even as three Bush Treasury secretaries in a row spouted the strong - dollar mantra , the dollar kept tumbling against the euro , the pound , the yen , the Canadian dollar and most other major currencies .
The Federal Reserve could prop up the dollar by increasing interest rates under its control .
Increased yields would make dollar - denominated investments more attractive to foreigners .
But that could undercut the already anemic economic growth in a frail U.S. economy rocked by soaring fuel costs , falling home prices and rising unemployment - and the lowest reading of consumer confidence in 16 years .
The Fed must do a balancing act between keeping the domestic economy from going into recession and keeping inflation at bay .
Furthermore , no Fed likes to raise rates aggressively in a presidential election year .
It seems more inclined to hold interest rates low for now to give financial markets time to recover from the housing meltdown and credit crunch .
It did just that in its meeting on June 25 , leaving a key short - term rate at 2 percent .
The rate reached that level in April after a series of aggressive cuts that brought it down 3.25 percentage points since September .
Those cuts helped ease the housing and credit crises - but drove the dollar further down .
In early June , Bush declared before his trip to Europe : " A strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
It is in the interests of the global economy . "
That , plus a warning by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the dollar 's weakness was contributing to U.S. inflation , seemed to temporarily break the dollar 's tumble .
Presidents and Fed chairmen do n't usually talk directly about the dollar and exchange rates - leaving that up to the Treasury secretary - and international bankers and investors took note of the high - level attention .
Over the past few weeks , the dollar has remained relatively stable , although it took a dip after the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged .
The long slide may not be over .
Still , if the Fed moves to lift rates later this year , as some traders and investors anticipate , it could buttress the dollar and spur an exodus of speculators from the oil market - helping to both prop up the dollar and drive down oil prices .
But few economists are sanguine that the economy will improve any time soon .
The other main tool to move the dollar - intervention in currency markets by buying dollars and selling other currencies - is risky .
It would take great sums of money to make any difference .
The foreign exchange market is the largest in the world , with over $ 1 trillion traded each day .
Seeing the U.S. trying to prop up the greenback by buying dollars could be taken as a sign of desperation and possibly trigger a renewed round of selling .
Furthermore , there has been little encouragement for such a strategy from finance ministers from the Group of Eight wealthy democracies - Japan , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Canada and Russia plus the U.S. Leaders of the eight countries were to meet in Japan beginning Monday , but the falling dollar was not even on the formal agenda .
It 's too touchy an issue , and the dollar 's relative stability over the past few weeks makes it easier for world leaders to steer clear .
" People will be talking about it in the corridors , " said Reginald Dale , a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has suggested that nothing is " off the table " including intervention .
But Bush has made statements suggesting he intends to let market forces set exchange rates .
The dollar has fallen so far , it will be difficult to halt or reverse its slide .
U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia and other major oil - producing nations to increase their production - and help ease pressure on both oil prices and the dollar - have brought scant results .
" There 's no magic wand , " said White House press secretary Dana Perino .
" It 's not going to be a problem that we solve overnight . "
The impact of the falling dollar is not always visible to the average consumer .
Not like the big numbers on gas pumps that give stark evidence of price levels .
But imported goods , from fuel to cars from Japanese automakers and toys from China - are getting more expensive just as U.S. wages are either stagnant or falling .
American companies suddenly look cheap to acquisition - minded foreigners , particularly those based in Europe .
Belgian - based InBev 's hostile bid for Anheuser - Busch is a recent example .
It has bid $ 46 billion to acquire the company - a 30 percent premium above where Anheuser 's shares traded before the June 11 proposal .
A successful acquisition by InBev would put the last remaining mass - market American brewer in foreign hands .
InBev is based in Belgium but run by Brazilians .
Anheuser - Busch , which brews both Budweiser and Bud light , holds a 48.5 percent share of U.S. beer sales .
Anheuser - Busch rejected InBev's bid , but the Belgian brewer forged ahead , seeking to unseat Anheuser 's 13 - member board and take its offer directly to shareholders .
If the takeover goes through , it might open the floodgates to other foreign takeovers of American companies .
Some of the dollar 's decline depends on hard - to - measure factors , like the psychology of foreign investors .
When the U.S. economy is weakening , many investors stay away .
The slide of the dollar has coincided with a long period of relatively low interest rates .
And some of the decline in the dollar 's global role " is due to the foreign policy failures of the Bush administration , not just to recent economic developments and policies , " suggests Adam S. Posen , deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
In other words , some international investors unhappy with Bush 's policy on Iraq or toward other parts of the world might not wish to invest in American companies or buy U.S. bonds .
Still , he argues that the euro is unlikely to replace the dollar as the world 's main reserve currency , and that the euro may be at " a temporary peak of influence . "
David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor 's in New York , says he envisions a day when the dollar and the euro will share billing as the world 's reserve currencies .
He predicts that the dollar will remain roughly at its present levels " for a couple years . "
Still , he says , " We might not be done with this down leg . "
Another big problem for the dollar is that the European Central Bank is likely to hike rates while the Federal Reserve stands pat , giving euro - based investments a bigger yield advantage .
" I could see more downward pressure on the dollar , over the course of the summer , not dramatically , if the ECB does raise rates , " said Robert Dye , an economist with PNC Financial Services Group .
" If it is one and done , pressure will be minimal .
But if it 's an ongoing pattern of rate increases , there will be more substantial pressure . "
A euro now buys as much as $ 1.55 in the United States .
The dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as most people can remember .
But its dominant role can no longer be taken for granted .
Paul Volcker , who headed the Federal Reserve from 1979 - 87 , warned in April that the nation was in a dollar crisis , and that what is happening now reminds him of the early 1970s , when serious inflation erupted as economic growth stagnated .
Then , as now , a weak economy limited the Fed 's options .
The result was a spiral of rising prices and wages - until the Fed , led by Volcker , suppressed double - digit inflation with huge interest rate increases that pushed the economy into a steep recession in 1982 .
He recently criticized the current Fed as defending the economy and the market , instead of defending the dollar .
Volcker said that will make defending the greenback much harder later .
Energy consultant Yergin , chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , recently told the House - Senate Joint Economic Committee that oil had become " the new gold . "
" Oil has become a storehouse of value - reflecting broad global economic trends and imbalances .
At the same time , oil is increasingly seen as an asset by financial investors , an uncorrelated alternative to equities , bonds , and real estate , " he said .
When the credit crisis broke last summer , the result was a sharp reduction in interest rates by the Fed .
That , in turn , accelerated the fall of the dollar .
" Instead of the traditional flight to the dollar ' during a time of instability , there has been a flight to commodities ' in search of stability during a time of currency instability and a falling dollar , " Yergin said .
" There 's a painful irony here :
The crisis that started in the subprime market in the United States has traveled around the world and , through the medium of a weaker dollar , has come back home to Americans in terms of higher prices at the pump . "
On July 27 2002 in a remote region of Afghanistan near Pakistan 's border , US Special Forces surrounded a suspected al - Qaida compound near Khost .
When requests to have the occupants come out went unanswered , two Afghan soldiers fighting alongside the elite American team offered to go in and translate .
Entering , they were immediately shot dead .
This sparked a lengthy battle that required US air support before the compound crumbled .
When everything became quiet , the soldiers moved carefully forward to search for survivors .
Sergeant Mike Silver would later recall that he heard the popping sound a grenade makes when lit before the explosion .
The grenade landed near Sergeant Christopher Speer , who would die 10 days later from the shrapnel wounds .
A post - battle report quoted an unnamed commando as saying : " He heard moaning coming from the back of the compound .
The dust rose up from the ground and began to clear , he then saw a man facing him lying on his right side .
The man had an AK - 47 on the ground beside him and the man was moving .
[ A commando ] fired one round striking the man in the head and the movement ceased . "
Then the soldier saw another body moving and fired two rounds , which hit the back of Omar Khadr , leaving two gaping holes as they exited through his chest .
Shrapnel hit his eyes , partially blinding him .
Once dragged from the rubble , soldiers gave Khadr medical treatment , incredulous they had captured a 15 - year - old who spoke English .
The Pentagon would later allege that a month before that battle , Khadr , a Canadian citizen , had been sent by his father , Ahmed Said Khadr , to undergo weapons training and fight with al - Qaida .
A video later uncovered at the scene of the battle shows him making improvised explosive devices .
Once captured , the 15 - year - old was taken to the US base in Bagram , Afghanistan .
Three months later , on October 28 2002 , he was moved to Guantánamo .
The world had its first glimpse of Khadr this week in the interrogation video obtained by his Canadian lawyers .
Filmed at Guantánamo in 2003 , it shows more than seven hours of interrogations during which Khadr appears sometimes defiant , sometimes despondent and often desperate .
" Promise me you 'll protect me from the Americans , " he pleads .
But the chief interrogator from Canada 's spy agency was n't there to help .
He wanted information .
When Khadr is left alone , a camera hidden in an air duct in the small interrogation room continues to roll .
He sobs and holds his head but the poor audio quality of the recording makes it difficult to determine what he 's moaning .
Some hear " kill me , " while others believe it 's " help me . "
It sounds most like ya ummi , Arabic for " my mother " .
Now 21 , the Toronto - born Khadr is to be tried at Guantánamo on five war crimes charges in October .
The Pentagon alleges he conspired with al - Qaida and that he threw the grenade that killed Speer .
Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , has vowed not to interfere in the US prosecution .
But the case has international significance because of the light shed by the video on interrogation practices , and because Khadr , Canada 's only Guantánamo detainee , is now the sole prisoner there with western citizenship after Britain and other US allies secured the release of their nationals .
International law states that those under 18 captured in armed conflict deserve protection .
Canada has been a leader in protecting the rights of child soldiers .
Yet advocacy for former UK residents held at Guantánamo , including Ethiopian national Binyam Mohamed , has exceeded any pressure Canada has exerted concerning Khadr .
Canada 's Conservative minority government is now in an uncomfortable position , even with public opinion on its side .
From the moment Omar Khadr was born on September 19 1986 , he was his mother 's favourite child .
She called him yasser , Arabic for " comfort " or " easy " .
He was Maha Elsamnah 's fifth child , born in a Toronto hospital .
But her thoughts , even during labour , were across town at a the children 's hospital where her 14 - month - old son Ibrahim was about to undergo heart surgery .
She had been on the way there when the contractions started .
She did n't want to leave Ibrahim , but Omar was n't waiting .
When Ibrahim was born with a heart defect , she already had three young children - a daughter , Zaynab , and two sons Abdullah and Abdurahman .
The family lived in Peshawar , Pakistan , where her husband ran a charity .
But they came back often to Canada 's largest city to visit Elsamnah 's parents , and her children were born there , making them Canadian citizens .
Still , Peshawar was home , even though Elsamnah was born in Egypt to Palestinian parents and carried Canada 's blue passport .
Like other Muslims drawn to Peshawar , the couple were at first attracted by the excitement of the capital of the North - West Frontier Province and the fight against the Soviets who occupied Afghanistan .
Khadr was an engineer by training but also a persuasive speaker who had a gift for raising money .
In Peshawar , he was known as al - Kanadi , the Canadian , and life was a hectic routine of travel , war and fundraising .
During Omar 's childhood his family moved often between Pakistan , Afghanistan and Canada .
Ibrahim was sent to live permanently with his grandparents in Canada , where he later died .
Omar and his remaining five siblings became comfortable in both worlds , but Omar was especially fond of Canada 's liberal society and western movies - including action films such as Die Hard .
But his father had started to change .
In 1992 Ahmed Said Khadr nearly died after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan .
He had become determined to see an Islamic government in Afghanistan .
He became more involved in politics , and the Pakistani authorities were starting to become wary of his increasing militancy .
They knew he had met many powerful leaders during the Soviet occupation .
He knew Osama bin Laden , who had left Pakistan for Saudi Arabia and then Sudan after the Soviets withdrew , but who would return to Afghanistan and lead al - Qaida once the Taliban took power .
In 1995 , Khadr was among those arrested for the November 19 bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad that killed 16 and injured 60 .
Pakistan 's authorities suspected Ayman al Zawahiri , an Egyptian , was the mastermind , and Khadr the financier .
But little evidence was produced and Khadr went on a hunger strike to protest his detention .
His case garnered sympathy in Canada , where he was portrayed as a charity worker being held without trial .
Canada 's then prime minister , Jean Chrétien , intervened personally and demanded that Khadr be given a fair trial or released .
A few months later , Pakistani authorities relented and Khadr was freed .
But Chrétien was harshly criticised after the attacks of September 11 2001 , when it was revealed that America and the UN had listed Khadr as a suspected al - Qaida financier .
In the late 1990s Khadr moved his wife , four sons and two daughters to Afghanistan .
Although Khadr continued his charity work , he also reignited his friendship with Zawahiri and Bin Laden and sent Omar 's older brothers to militant training camps .
Abdurahman was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned over to the US authorities .
But Omar was considered too young , so most often stayed home with his mother , sisters and younger brother .
When 9/11 happened , the Khadr family was living in Kabul , and as the US invaded Afghanistan they fled to the mountainous border region with Pakistan .
It is from here , the US prosecutors allege , that Omar Khadr was sent to join al - Qaida fighters the following summer .
The 15 - year - old was held at Bagram for three months by the Americans , and some days was questioned for as long as eight hours at a stretch .
His chief interrogator , US Sergeant Joshua Claus , would later be convicted for his role in the death of another detainee at Bagram - an Afghan taxi driver named Dilawar .
During an interview after he left the military , Claus said Khadr 's interrogation was different , and he denies any allegations of abuse .
But Khadr , in an affidavit to his lawyers but which the Pentagon censored before being made public , said he was afraid of his interrogators .
" I figured out right away that I would simply tell them whatever I thought they wanted to hear in order to keep them from causing me ( censored ) . "
British detainee Moazzam Begg befriended Khadr while in custody and was shocked by the way the guards treated him .
" I remember eventually when I moved into a cell with him , his acceptance of his fate , what had taken place , the knowledge that he pretty much lost his family , " Begg said .
" Out of all the people I 've ever met in incarceration , my heart bled for him the most . "
On October 28 2002 , Khadr was taken to Guantánamo .
" For two nights and one day before putting us on the plane , we were not given any food so that we would not have to use the bathroom on the plane , " he later wrote in his statement .
Begg vividly remembers their last conversation before he left .
" There are people who actually are concerned about you , " Begg recalled Khadr as saying .
" I do n't have anyone . "
During his years at Guantánamo , the interrogations continued .
Khadr alleges that one day when he refused to answer questions , his hands and feet were cuffed together behind him .
When the guards returned and found he had urinated on himself , " [ The ] military police poured pine oil on the floor and on me , and then , with me lying on my stomach and my hands and feet cuffed together behind me , the military police dragged me back and forth through the mixture , " he claimed in his statement .
The Pentagon denied the allegations .
By 2007 , Khadr had spent almost a quarter of his life in Guantánamo .
He was confined in the isolation wing where a toothbrush was considered a privilege .
His lawyers feared he was suicidal .
On October 8 he is scheduled to make history when he goes before a panel of military jurors as the first person to be tried for alleged war crime offences while a minor .
He will be 22 .
His lawyers argue that he should be treated as a child soldier and rehabilitated , not prosecuted .
His father was killed in October 2003 by Pakistani forces in an attack which also paralysed his younger brother .
The rest of the family has since returned to Canada , where Abdullah is in prison fighting extradition to the US on terrorism charges , and Zaynab is being investigated .
Two younger siblings are still in high school .
The lack of sympathy for the family can partly be put down to a documentary aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Company in 2004 , in which Abdurahman , then 21 , confessed to working for the CIA after his capture , disclosed his father 's connections to Bin Laden and said he grew up in an " al - Qaida family " .
But what especially enraged Canadians were the comments made by Omar Khadr 's mother and older sister .
" You would like me to raise my child in Canada and by the time he 's 12 or 13 he 'll be on drugs or having some homosexual relation or this and that ?
Is it better ?
For me , no , " Elsamnah told the interviewer .
When asked for her reaction to the 9/11 attacks , she said : " Since I am Palestinian and I know the Americans are helping the Israelis so much , I said , ' Let them have it .
It 's time that they , ' I do n't want you I ... "
But Zaynab continued her mother 's unfinished sentence , saying : " Not the people themselves .
You do n't want to feel happy , but you just sort of think , ' Well , they deserve it .
They 've been doing it for such a long time , why should n't they feel it once in a while ? ' "
Whereas Canadian public opinion had supported Ahmed Said Khadr when he was incarcerated in Pakistan , the family were now labelled " Canadians of convenience " - happy to take advantage of the country 's medical system and passports , but disdainful of its liberalism .
The video this week seemed to tip the balance of public opinion in Omar Khadr 's favour but Prime Minister Harper said he would not criticize Guantánamo 's trials .
" We 're this far along so let 's see this thing through and get a judgment and whatever happens past that point of judgment happens , " his spokesman said .

WHICH costs more , the car or the gasoline ?
In the United States , the quarter that just ended was probably the first period since the early 1980s that a bigger proportion of the consumer ’s pocketbook was spent on gasoline , oil and other energy products than was spent on motor vehicles .
But even as the price of gasoline has soared to more than $ 4 a gallon , Americans are spending a much smaller share of their budgets on fuel than they did at the time of the last spike in oil prices , in 1980 .
The accompanying chart shows that spending on motor vehicles  both buying them and fixing them  tends to take a smaller share of spending during recessions , as consumers cut back on big ticket items .
Based on the dismal figures for car and truck sales in June that came out this week , that appears to be happening .
And the 4.2 percent share of consumer spending that went to cars in the first quarter seems likely to have fallen in the quarter that just ended .
But the share devoted to the purchase of gasoline and other fuels certainly increased , even though there are indications Americans have cut back on driving .
Gasoline prices in the quarter averaged more than 20 percent higher than in the first three months of 2008 .
The share of spending on fuels seems likely to have risen well above the 4.1 percent mark recorded then .
According to the White House , this country is scoring big wins in the war on drugs , especially against the cocaine cartels .
Officials celebrate that cocaine seizures are up  leading to higher prices on American streets .
Cocaine use by teenagers is down , and , officials say , workplace tests suggest adult use is falling .
John Walters , the White House drug czar , declared earlier this year that “ courageous and effective ” counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and Mexico “ are disrupting the production and flow of cocaine . ”
This enthusiasm rests on a very selective reading of the data .
Another look suggests that despite the billions of dollars the United States has spent battling the cartels , it has hardly made a dent in the cocaine trade .
While seizures are up , so are shipments .
According to United States government figures , 1,421 metric tons of cocaine were shipped through Latin America to the United States and Europe last year  39 percent more than in 2006 .
And despite massive efforts at eradication , the United Nations estimates that the area devoted to growing coca leaf in the Andes expanded 16 percent last year .
The administration disputes that number .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The dollar lost ground against other currencies Tuesday after an inflation report showed a further rise in wholesale prices , and housing starts fell to a 17 - year low .
The 15 - nation euro bought $ 1.4765 , up from the $ 1.4697 in late trading Monday .
The dollar also fell against the Japanese currency , sinking to ¥ 109.67 from ¥ 110.17 in the previous session .
The British pound bought $ 1.8651 Tuesday compared with $ 1.8643 Monday .
The Producer Price Index ( PPI ) , a measure of inflation at the wholesale level , rose 1.2 % in July , double what economists surveyed by Briefing .com were expecting .
So - called " core " PPI , which strips out volatile food and energy prices , rose by 0.7 % , more than three times what economists expected .
" The PPI has an effect on the dollar movement because eventually consumers will pay for those prices , " said Dustin Reid , senior currency strategist with ABN AMRO .
The Census Bureau reported Tuesday that both housing starts and building permits - a measure of builder confidence - fell to levels in July not seen since the 1991 recession as the housing market fallout continued .
" Coupled with the negative news that the financial sector has seen , the market is thinking that there 's going to be a lot more to go in terms of an economic housing crisis , " Reid said .
The dollar has fallen for two straight sessions after rebounding strongly for several weeks .
The euro fell to a six - month low Friday , and the pound hit its lowest point in over a year as weakness in the European economies became more apparent .
Both the European Central Bank and Bank of England indicated that the European economic slowdown may lead to a steadying or even trimming of key interest rates .
" We are ripe to see a bit of pause in the dollar rally , as we have further to go with concerns in the financial and housing sectors , " said Reid .
" The question remains is this the beginning of something significant or a short term head fake ?
Only time will tell . "
With a nationwide housing crisis far from over , the risk of future mortgage losses is rapidly shifting from the private sector toward government – and potentially US taxpayers .
This is occurring partly by choice , as policymakers try to stop a wave of foreclosures .
It is also happening by circumstance , as the crisis has left government - linked entities as the lenders of last resort in a troubled marketplace .
One symbol of rising risks came on Tuesday , as mortgage giant Fannie Mae announced a $ 2.2 billion loss for the year ’s first quarter .
The Federal National Mortgage Association , the official name that has been shortened to Fannie Mae for convenience , is not officially part of the government .
But its public charter , created in the wake of the Depression , is to help make sure that home loans remain available in bad times as well as good .
That mission has helped avoid a total shutdown of mortgage markets over the past year .
But it means that Fannie , along with entities with a similar mission , are assuming the risks that come with making loans at a time when house prices continue to fall .
“ They are fulfilling their mission ... but concentrating risks on themselves , ” Edward DeMarco , deputy director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , told a conference of mortgage bankers this week in Boston .
Home prices have been falling by double - digit rates in many metro areas , yet the inventory of homes for sale remains sky - high .
The great worry is that , rather than stabilizing , the housing market will spiral downward .
Homeowners default in greater numbers when their loan balances exceed the value of their homes .
That , in turn , results in more foreclosures and downward pressure on prices .
This explains the pressure on the government - linked enterprises to steady the market .
The House of Representatives appeared poised to vote Wednesday on a bill designed to stem a record tide of foreclosures .
Among other things , the bill would call for the Federal Housing Administration , a government agency , to let cash - strapped homeowners refinance into more affordable , fixed - rate mortgages .
Before the FHA agreed to refinance the loans , the current lenders would have to agree to take substantial losses .
That means the federal agency would insure a loan that ’s smaller than the original one , for about 85 percent of the current value of the home .
The approach might help half a million borrowers keep their homes , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
That would help at a time when foreclosures are running at a pace of more than a million a year .
But it would leave the government vulnerable if a high number of borrowers later default on their new , FHA - insured loans .
Traditionally , FHA borrowers pay premiums that cover this default risk .
Taxpayers might be on the hook in a scenario of high defaults and collateral ( property ) that falls another 15 percent or more in value after the refinancing .
Fannie and its sibling , Freddie Mac , do n’t carry official backstopping by US taxpayers .
But they are widely seen as institutions too large and important to be allowed to fail if they ever faced bankruptcy .
Those two enterprises , plus the FHA , have long been titanic forces in housing ( see chart ) .
But today they have become even more important .
Without them , new credit for home loans would have virtually dried up .
That ’s because losses on defaulting loans are prompting banks to retrench and investors to stop buying mortgage debts that do n’t carry a guarantee from Fannie or Freddie , or FHA insurance .
Rather than holding on to home loans , mortgage lenders sell most of them .
In 1995 , Fannie and Freddie bought the bulk of those loans and then resold them to investors .
At the peak of the real estate boom , other investment firms competed for that business , churning out complicated investments laden with subprime loans , where the bulk of defaults and foreclosures are occurring today .
Now that competing business has dried up , leaving Fannie and Freddie accounting for the lion ’s share of current activity .
“ It ’s going to take a long time for volumes to come back ” in private mortgage - backed investments , says Timothy Crandall , senior vice president of US Bank Home Mortgage in Minneapolis .
For quite a while , he predicts , the reliance on so - called GSEs ( government - sponsored enterprises ) will continue .
In a bid to ease the housing crisis , politicians are calling on the GSEs to ramp up lending and refinancing activity .
They have authorized Fannie Mae to guarantee “ jumbo ” loans of up to $ 730,000 in high - cost markets such as California that are now struggling .
And they have criticized Fannie Mae for not following through faster on this mandate .
But regulators and lawmakers also hope to limit the downside risks for taxpayers and for the GSE shareholders .
“ We want to make sure we ’re not doing it on the backs of all the taxpayers , ” Brian Montgomery , the federal housing commissioner overseeing the FHA , told the Boston conference .
The Bush administration has argued that it can expand refinancing activity without new legislation such as the FHA program being considered this week in the House .
In an effort to keep President Bush from vetoing the bill , Rep. Barney Frank ( D ) of Massachusetts has moved to package it with other measures supported by the president , such as strengthening regulatory oversight of Fannie and Freddie .
Many analysts say new efforts by Fannie , Freddie , and the FHA need not involve a large taxpayer tab if the process is carefully managed .
Still , the risk is significant .
Fannie and Freddie have been moving to raise new capital in order to retain a required cushion as mortgage defaults rise .
But some analysts say they have been allowed to operate with capital reserves that are much lower than those of ordinary banks .
Between them , the two enterprises have $ 90 billion in capital , compared with a mortgage business valued at $ 5 trillion .
Before taxpayers would take any hit , shareholders in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stand to lose .
Both corporations ’ stock - market value has plunged over the past year .
Dividend payments have been reduced .
Also , mortgage bankers now have to pay higher fees to channel their loans to the GSEs .
“ The cost to us has almost doubled , ” says Mr. Crandall .
I found Chris Lineberry ’s videos sitting like warm eggs in the great chicken coop that is YouTube after I demanded that my boyfriend look up the video for “ Melody Day ” by Caribou .
We watched the hammers hit a piece of wood to the beat for awhile , and he absentmindedly clicked on one of the videos in the “ Related Videos ” category , only to be quickly stunned by perfectly timed messes of pulsating colors , rainbows , clouds , dinosaurs , school buses , and apathetic faces that quickly melted into the landscape .
It was a video narration of Caribou ’s “ Zoe ” ( above ) by Lineberry , who after a few clicks I found out was only 17 and had created several visually stunning videos using nothing other than MS Paint .
Is it too late to say the future is here ?
It might be some kind of indicator that a teenaged North Carolina native who sits with his hand on a his mouse through many winter nights , his eyes full of pulsating colors , can create on crude software the type of animation that 50 years ago might have given Walt Disney a seizure .
Lineberry took time away from his MS Paint window to hop over to a Microsoft Word window and answer a few questions .
SPLICE TODAY : Give me a short paragraph about yourself .
If that sounds vague , try including things like childhood ticks , fears , obsessions , teenage hobbies , weird but shareable family predicaments , favorite ways to break the law , etc .
CHRIS LINEBERRY : I was born in Greensboro , NC and , save for an infantile two - year stint out of the state in Vancouver and Cincinnati , I 've lived here all my life .
When I was four , I thought that beyond my periphery the world might be the inside of a giant spaceship with the most disgusting and globbly aliens running the control panel .
I 'd turn around quickly to try and catch them but they were always just out of view .
I 'm obsessed with “ Where 's Waldo , ” mermaids , primary colors , miniatures , planning my dream house , comic books , and museums .
In seventh grade , my dad grounded me for having dreadlocks , perhaps rightfully so because they were disgusting .
As for my favorite way to break the law , I drive five miles over the speed limit .
ST : Have you had any formal training in art , especially animation ?
CL : I 've attended a magnet arts high school , Weaver Academy , and will be completing my senior year there this spring .
However , even though the school has the resources for animation , they 've never given me a chance to do it there .
The school has provided me with a technical basis for my work , though .
I 've also been involved with the Elsewhere Artist Collaborative since the spring of ‘ 04 and the conceptual foundation of my work has been heavily influenced by the experience .
The animations sort of arose when I realized that my clunky , obsolete , hand - me - down , McAfee - infected , warrantee - expired Dell could facilitate activities beyond x'ing out the pop-ups that confirm that all of my bullshit virus protection needs to be updated .
ST : How do you choose which songs to narrate ?
CL : On top of the song being something I would consider " good music , ” most of the time it 's the length that I look for .
It 's an unfortunate case of needing size to matter , but time is a crucial element in the process .
If the song is n’t short enough , then I feel bad about gypping it .
I guess part of what I do relies on having " a sense " for how things go together , which is probably not the most exciting or substantiated element of my work ( even though it 's still important ) .
ST : What is your personal history with music ( phases , embarrassments , philosophy if you have one ) ?
CL : In seventh grade I went from listening to Kittie to Cat Stevens .
The transformation happened over winter break , I guess .
Then in eighth grade I cut off my long , flowing , Shirley Temple locks and fell in love with the Arcade Fire .
I played upright bass for a while and played with a few orchestras ( I made it to Carnegie Hall once , even though the audience was composed of parents ) .
I 'm obsessed with noise that sounds like something 's being played backwards ( it 's in my animation of Jon Brion ’s “ Bookstore , ” called “ Time Travel ” [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3c7Tq5ia8]), strings / orchestral / symphonic sound , and sounds that define the times .
A lot of my music comes from local college radio stations .
Bush Hits New Low : Ties Carter Approval Poll : Just 28 % of Americans approve of how President Bush is handling his job .
July 15 , 2008  --
Driven down by the weak economy and the unpopular war in Iraq , President George W. Bush 's job approval rating has reached a new low for the third month straight .
Just 28 percent of Americans approve of how the President is handling his job , matching Jimmy Carter 's career low .
Only two presidents have gone lower : Richard Nixon , 24 percent in July and August 1974 ; and Harry Truman , 22 percent in February 1952 .
Bush Hits New Low in Record High Disapproval
Sixty - nine percent disapprove of Bush 's performance , a record high in presidential approval polls since 1938 ( by ABC News to 1981 , and Gallup before us ) .
Fifty - six percent " strongly " disapprove of Bush 's performance , another record .
Bush has n't seen majority approval in 42 months , surpassing Truman 's record of 39 months from 1949 - 52 .
Indeed Bush 's approval rating has n't exceeded even 40 percent since September 2006 .
Bush approval peaks among Republicans , at 65 percent ; it plummets to 27 percent among independents and only 6 percent among Democrats ( the latter a new low ) .
It ranges from 51 percent among conservatives to 21 percent among moderates and just 7 percent among liberals ( all new lows ) .
Watch " World News with Charles Gibson " at 6:30 pm ET for the latest polling on the 2008 election .
METHODOLOGY : This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone July 10 - 13 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,119 adults , including an oversample of African Americans ( weighted to their correct share of the national population ) , for a total of 209 black respondents .

Google Android initially was expected to be available by the second half of this year , but many of the wireless carriers and Android partners have struggled to hit that deadline , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday .
Still , device makers are working feverishly to add devices that run Android to their active roster .
T - Mobile said it plans to have an Android - powered phone come fourth quarter .
Sprint , however , wo n't be able to hit that target , the Journal reported , citing unnamed sources .
Sprint 's delays stem from the carrier wanting to develop its own branded services on Android , rather than just carry a device with Google features already built in .
In addition , shifts among the executive ranks at Sprint may also be contributing to the holdup .
Unnamed sources told the Journal that Sprint is considering scrapping its Android device plans for its current 3G network and may focus on developing an Android - based device for the faster 4G network it is working on with a host of partners , including Google .
Deciding against a 3G Android device may be a wise move for Sprint , especially with Apple 's recently announced 3G iPhone — which features a faster connection and smaller price tag than first - generation iPhones — continues to create waves and capture mind share among the device - buying populace .
The 3G Apple iPhone is expected to be available in July .
Elsewhere , China Mobile has said its Android launch will be on hold until either late this year or early in 2009 .
Quoting insiders , the Journal said China Mobile is hitting roadblocks in translating Android software from Roman characters into Chinese and is having trouble merging its own branded data services onto the Android platform .
The delays come despite Google 's proclamation at last month 's I/O Conference that devices would be ready by the second quarter of this year .
At the conference , Google stoked the flames and demoed an open - source Android - based device , a 3G HSDPA device based on a Qualcomm processor with a Synaptics touch screen , 128 MB of RAM and 256 MB of flash memory .
Along with hitting development snags , Google and Android have also come under fire from mobile software developers that claim it 's difficult to develop programs for the devices .
Google , for its part , continues to make finishing touches on the underlying software .
According to the Journal , managing software development and giving the 30 - plus partners , dubbed the Open Handset Alliance , the opportunity to push for new features is taking more time than expected .
" This is where the pain happens , " Google 's director of mobile platforms , Andy Rubin , told the Journal .
" We are very , very close . "
Google 's setbacks come as the LiMo Foundation , another consortium working on an open - source Linux - based mobile operating system , is gathering steam .
The LiMo Foundation is seen as Google Android 's main rival in the set - to - explode open - source handset market .
Last month , wireless heavyweight Verizon Wireless snubbed Google to join the LiMo Foundation , filling the last seat available on LiMo 's board of directors .
At the same time , LiMo also added cellular stalwarts such as SK Telecom , Infineon Technologies , Kvaleberg , Mozilla , Red Bend Software and SFR to its active roster of partners .
LiMo and Android are poised for heated competition , with LiMo having Verizon on board and Android touting the inclusion of Sprint and T - Mobile .
In addition , AT&T , the No. 1 mobile service provider in the U.S. , hinted in April that it was interested in riding the Google Android wave .
The LiMo Foundation launched in January 2007 and includes about 40 mobility leaders , including Motorola , NEC , NTT DoCoMo , Panasonic Mobile Communications , Samsung Electronics and Vodafone , a partial Verizon owner .
Despite pledging its allegiance to LiMo , Verizon 's network vice president , Kyle Malady , has said that the wireless carrier has not completely ruled out becoming a member of the Android team as well .
" If devices come along that are interesting to us and our customers , we 'd absolutely look at that , " he said at that time of Verizon 's addition to the LiMo lineup .
Third parties could also sell Android devices to Verizon Wireless customers if they work on the Verizon network , he added .
Johnny Mac would NEVER cheat

So some big talk in the blogosphere today has been about the questions asked of Mac and Barry at the Saddleback Church forum on Saturday .
The NY Times says it ’s “ lighting up ” the blogosphere .
Liberals ( those bastards ) are worried that McCain had the unfair advantage of hearing some of the questions ahead of time because he was in his motorcade on the way over .
Possible , but who cares ?
The man is 145 and an idiot .
Give him ALL of the questions ahead of time and any debate will still end with Barry standing over McCain like Ali staring down at Sonny Liston .
The part that got me though was this :
The McCain campaign heatedly denied that Mr. McCain had done anything wrong .
“ The insinuation from the Obama campaign that John McCain , a former prisoner of war , cheated is outrageous , ” Nicolle Wallace , a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain , told The Times .
The McCain campaign also sent a statement to Saddleback , which Mr. Ross made available to The Times .
As if military service means someone ca n’t lie .
As if John McCain was n’t one of the Keating Five .
As if he is n’t violating his own campaign finance reform laws .
Johnny Mac would NEVER cheat .
Except on the wheelchair - bound wife who stood by him while he was a POW , of course .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Ads promoting Islam are to be placed on New York subway cars in September , but a U.S. congressman finds people sponsoring the messages unacceptable .
Siraj Wahhaj is imam of a Brooklyn mosque and a backer of pro-Islam ads on New York subway cars .
" I have no problem with the ad itself , but I have a very , very real problem with those behind it , " Rep. Peter King , a New York Republican , said Tuesday .
He is urging the Metropolitan Transit Authority to reject the ads .
The campaign is to feature ads on 1,000 of the subway system 's roughly 6,200 cars .
The main sponsor is a grass - roots organization , Islamic Circle of North America .
The ads , simple black - and - white panels , will feature key words or phrases about Islam on one side of the panel such as " Head Scarf ? " or " Prophet Muhammad ? " and the words " You deserve to know " along with the Web site address WhyIslam.org on the other side .
" The idea is to evoke certain thoughts in the mindset of the person who is looking at the ads and get them to a point where they can reflect upon certain words that one could define as hot words or keywords that get thrown around a lot but are not necessarily defined in the most proper context , " said New York University 's Imam Khalid Latif , a cleric who is promoting the project in a YouTube video created by the Islamic Circle .
Watch the controversy surrounding the subway ads »
Another of the backers of the advertising campaign -- which will launch in September to coincide with the monthlong Islamic holiday of Ramadan -- is Siraj Wahhaj , imam of a Brooklyn mosque .
Wahhaj was the first Muslim to lead a prayer before the House of Representatives , but King objects to him because he was a character witness for convicted 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Sheikh Omar Abdel - Rahman .
" He is a known Islamic extremist , and you would be giving him credibility and stature through a known government facility , " said King , ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee .
Do n't Miss Islamic Circle of North America
Wahhaj also appeared on a list of 170 potential unindicted co-conspirators in the 1993 bombing case .
A prosecutor said that not everyone on the list was considered a co-conspirator .
On Monday , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg did not join in King 's outrage about the ads .
" If you were to advocate becoming a Muslim , I assume the First Amendment would protect you , " he said .
But King , noting that the ads would be up during the seventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks , said , " I 'm calling on the MTA not to have these ads , not to go forward with them , and I do n't see this as a free speech issue at all . "
King said he sent a letter to the MTA on Monday night demanding that it reject the ads .
The New York Post has reacted strongly to the ads , running a cover photograph of Wahhaj on Monday with the headline " Jihad Train " and posting an article on its
Web site with the headline " Train - ing day for jihadists " and the first paragraph saying , " Allah aboard ! "
Abdel - Rahman and nine others were convicted in 1995 of seditious conspiracy for their role in a plot to bomb the United Nations , FBI headquarters in Manhattan , two tunnels in New York and a bridge connecting New Jersey with Manhattan , all in one day .
The government said the group also was responsible for the February 26 , 1993 , World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 .
Andrew McCarthy , a former federal prosecutor in that case , said Wahhaj 's name was included in a filing that prosecutors were required to provide to defense attorneys in the case , a list of all the names of people who could possibly be foreseen to come up in the evidence .
The filing , McCarthy said , has been called a " co-conspirator list . "
But Wahhaj was never named by the prosecution .
" The only time he came up in a meaningful way before the jury is when the defense called him as a witness , " McCarthy recalled .
McCarthy said that although the list named anyone the government might allege during the trial was a co-conspirator , not everyone on the list was so labeled .
Wahhaj said Monday that he was a character witness for Abdel - Rahman in the context of " what we knew about him before the incident , " citing him as a " scholar in Islam " and " a great reciter of the Quran . "
" People try to make the connection as if I 'm endorsing some bad deeds that [ were ] done by Sheik Abdel - Rahman , " he said .
" That had nothing to do with it . "
He added , " not only have I never been charged with anything , not one FBI agent has ever asked me one question in relationship to that bombing . "
Wahhaj also said that he regrets some of his more controversial statements , such as calling the FBI and the CIA " terrorists . "
" What I was saying is that not all the FBI or CIA are terrorists , but there are some elements in there , " he said .
" So if you want to accuse some Muslims [ of being terrorists ] , OK .
These Muslims did that , but do n't undermine the entire faith .
That 's what the message is . "
Wahhaj said the New York Post 's " cheesy " and " anti-Islam " reaction to his participation in the Subway Project is " the very reason the young Muslims want to put out this ad campaign . "
Islamic Circle spokesman Azeem Khan called the situation a " perfect microcosm " of what the ads seek to address : that Wahhaj 's portrayal in media reports is similar to how Islam is often depicted .
" I think that even more so reinforces the idea as to why a project like this is necessary , where Muslims have to be more pro-active in terms of educating people about their religion , by no means proselytizing the faith in any capacity , but really setting a standard and defining what mainstream Islam stands for , " Latif said .
The project is the Islamic Circle 's first such advertising campaign .
The group has run ads before but not on New York 's subways .
The transit authority said the cost of the monthlong campaign is about $ 48,000 .
CNN 's Shirley Zilberstein , Mary Snow and Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report .
All About Islam • Religion
To you or me , a monorail is a way to get around an airport , or a theme park .
To a group of Israeli and German engineers , it 's a high - tech defense , scanning for intruders .
Linceus GmbH is looking to turn miniature monorail cars into camera - equipped sentries , zipping around at nearly 50 miles per hour .
And unlike human guards , * Defense News ' * Barbara Opall - Rome reports , these rail - riding robo - watchers are " impervious to bad weather ; operate around the clock ;
and come equipped with dazzling spotlights , high - decibel acoustics and other nonlethal means of warn­ing the unwitting . "
A demonstration at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport is planned for next week .
The sentries are outfitted with a thermal and standard camera ; laser pointer and laser rangefinder are optional .
" Video , voice and oth­er data are broadcast through em­bedded cable on the rail , which also provides the electricity powering the rider ’s engine and onboard sub­systems , " Opall - Rome adds .
While optimized for independent operations , the robotic patrols also work in support of ground patrols and anti-infiltration squads .
And in cases of extreme threats to sensitive border areas or high - value installa­tions , the system can be linked into external sensors and ground - , sea­ or air - based shooters ... [ If a facility is ] penetrat[ed ] , the sensors are slaved inward to assist ground patrols in search - and - dis­able mission .
The U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security already put cameras on blimps , on towers , even on ground robots , to watch over borders and military bases .
The results have been ... well , uneven .
High - powered G- Boss lenses have been credited with finding bomb - planters in Iraq .
But a prototype " virtual fence " along the Arizona - Mexico border has flunked , badly .
Costs to further build and maintain the system range from from $ 300 million to $ 1.7 billion per mile , depending on materials , " according to Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Linceus says its system could prove to be a better , more cost - effective border defense .
But would building a monorail , around Montezuma Peak and Nogales and Black Knob be any cheaper ?
Sounds to me like them should stick to airports and family attractions .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It may be possible to be both fat and healthy , researchers reported on Monday , for at least half of overweight adults , and close to a third of obese men and women , have normal blood pressure , cholesterol and other measures of heart health .
Dancers take part in open auditions to become a Radio City Rockette for the annual " Radio City Christmas Spectacular " show in New York City , May 6 , 2008 .

And being lean does not necessarily protect people , either .
Close to a quarter of normal - weight U.S. adults in one study had risk factors for heart disease or diabetes .
“ We really do n’t know as much about obesity as we think we do , ” Judith Wylie - Rosett of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , who oversaw the study , said in a telephone interview .
“ A considerable proportion of overweight and obese U.S. adults are metabolically healthy , whereas a considerable proportion of normal - weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities , ” Wylie - Rosett and Rachel Wildman and colleagues wrote in their report , published in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine .
Wylie -Rosett ’s team looked at data on 5,440 men and women who were examined and filled out questionnaires for the National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys between 1999 and 2004 .
Most did not exercise very much .
They found just over 51 percent of those who were overweight , and 31.7 percent of those who were obese , had healthy levels of cholesterol , blood sugar , blood pressure and other measures linked to heart disease .
These measures have been shown in many other studies to predict heart attacks , strokes , diabetes and other heart disease , although this particular study did not look at whether people suffered any of these problems .
OBESE YET HEALTHY
More than 23 percent of those who were at a healthy weight , as measured by body mass index , had two or more unhealthy readings , the researchers found .
“ Our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese , ” Wylie - Rosett said .
Her team did not look at people ’s diets , but she believes the location of body fat is as important as how much there is .
Many studies have shown that having visceral fat , in and among the internal organs , may be more dangerous than having fat thighs or buttocks .
But when Wylie - Rosett ’s team measured waist circumference , a common way to estimate visceral fat , more than 36 percent of the obese people with what should have been dangerously large waists had healthy blood test results .
A second study suggested that the liver may be the key .
Dr. Norbert Stefan and colleagues at the University of Tubingen in Germany closely examined 314 people , using magnetic resonance imaging to look at precisely how much body fat they had and where it was .
They also found that obese men and women could have healthy hearts and arteries and suggested that having fat on the liver may be what makes the difference .
“ Altogether , 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or ‘ metabolically benign obesity , ’ ” they wrote in their Archives report .
“ Our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity , ” they wrote .
“ That ’s an area that we are very intrigued with as well , ” Wylie - Rosett said , ” adding : “ If you start stuffing people with calories , it is very much like making pate from goose liver . ”
Geese are often force - fed to make their livers fatty and thus more suitable for pate - making .
Put the Texas Senate race on your radar screen , and open up your wallets ( please ) .
Democratic candidate and Afghan war vet , Rick Noriega , is already running a very strong race against the GOP incumbent , John Cornyn , who is one of the nastiest and most right wing Republicans in the Senate ( think : Santorum , but dumber ) .
Cornyn once said that violence against judges is understandable ( remember that one ? )
And Cornyn defended Karl Rove ’s role in the Valerie Plame affair .
Rick Noriega , on the other hand , has a 100 % rating from NARAL , is good on gay issues , and more .
You can give to Noriega by clicking on the blue box ( right ) .
But what are his chances ?
Rather incredible , actually .
Last week , two polls came out showing that Noriega had moved to within four points of Cornyn :
1. Research 2000 for Daily Kos. 5/5 - 7 . Likely voters .
MoE 4 % ( 9/24-26/07 results ) Cornyn ( R ) 48 ( 51 )
Noriega ( D ) 44 ( 35 )
That is nothing short of astounding .
And lest anyone worry that it ’s an outlier , these numbers confirm a Rasmussen poll from earlier this week :
2. Rasmussen .
5/1 . Likely voters .
MoE 4 % ( No trend lines ) Cornyn ( R ) 47
Noriega ( D ) 43
Rasmussen elaborated :
It ’s time to add United States Senator John Cornyn to the list of potentially vulnerable Republican incumbents in Election 2008 .
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey in the state find Cornyn leading Democratic state legislator Rick Noriega by just four percentage points , 47 % to 43 % .
Any incumbent who polls below 50 % is considered potentially vulnerable .
That is especially true when a little known challenger is so competitive in an early general election match - up .
We can help make Noriega a better known and better funded challenger .
Texas Democrats are energized this year .
And , Noriega is the perfect candidate for his state .
He ’s a native Texan with an impressive career and commitment to public service .
Rick is a veteran who has served in the U.S. Army and the Texas National Guard – including a fourteen month tour of duty in Afghanistan .
Check out his website .
Rick Noriega is a candidate who can change the political landscape in Texas .
Howie Klein interviewed Rick recently , and he is great on the issues you care about .
Let ’s help him do it by clicking on the blue box , above , and donating to Rick ’s campaign .
We ’ve set a generous goal of raising $ 15,000 this week via the blog .
We ’ll be reminding you throughout the week .
And we ’re done with Rick , we ’ll hit another race , and so on .
Thanks , guys .
JOHN
PS By law , you can give a maximum of $ 2300 to Noriega .
But honestly , even 25 or 50 bucks is appreciated .
It all adds up .

It 's not every day that record companies are accused of behaving like goblins in a book by JK Rowling .
To a goblin , the rightful and true master of any object is the maker , not the purchaser
JK Rowling , Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows
But that is just one of the more colourful accusations being bandied around in a US legal battle that could have implications for many people 's private CD and LP collections .
It all began in May 2007 when Universal Music Group ( UMG ) , the largest of the Big Four companies that dominate the music industry worldwide , sued a Los Angeles - based trader on the eBay online auction site .
The target of the legal action , Troy Augusto , runs a business called Roast Beast Music Collectables .
He makes his living by snapping up rare albums in second - hand record shops and selling them on eBay .
Universal is taking him to task for copyright infringement , saying some of the items he offered for sale online were promotional copies and not authorised for sale to the public .
But digital rights lobby group the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has taken up cudgels on Mr Augusto 's behalf and is counter - suing Universal .
" UMG seems to think that the promotional use only label somehow gives it eternal ownership over the CD , " says the EFF .
" While this might make sense to a goblin living in Harry Potter 's world , it 's not the law under the Copyright Act . "
Not transferable If , like Mr Augusto , you frequent specialist music shops or other outlets selling rare releases to collectors , you may have acquired promo albums or review copies that record labels send out to journalists and radio stations before the regular editions go on sale .
The online auction included a Nelly Furtado promo CD
They can be recognised by markings such as " For promotional use only " or " Not for resale " , visible on the record or CD artwork and sometimes on the disc label itself .
Record companies have long maintained that they continue to own these items and can ask for them back at any time .
Now , because Mr Augusto's online auctions contained some of these promotional discs , the argument is close to being tested in court .
In legal documents filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California , UMG 's lawyers allege that " [ Mr ] Augusto 's unauthorised distribution of the UMG promo CDs violated UMG's exclusive right to distribute its copyrighted works " .
Among the promotional items listed as sold by Mr Augusto , according to the legal brief , are titles of CD singles by Nelly Furtado and rap group Bone Thugs - N - Harmony .
Listing removed
Although the outcome will apply only to US law , the case is being watched keenly in the UK , where record shop owners and eBay traders report similar treatment at the hands of music companies in the past .
One trader , who has asked to remain anonymous , told the BBC he recently had a promo CD removed from eBay that was on sale for a couple of pounds .
We used to get so many promos of some records that we would end up turning them down
Zafar Chowdhry of now - defunct shop Reckless Records
Rare groove shops face extinction " I was clearing out some cupboards and decided to list a CD single on eBay that had been handed to me by a friend quite some time ago .
" The very next day , the listing was removed and I was astounded to get an e-mail from eBay , bristling with terms such as ' illegal , pirated , copyright law , violation , content protection ' and so forth .
" I can understand it if I had been selling a crateload of bootleg live CDs , or had burnt off albums worth of official studio stuff and was trying to sell them as if they were new and originals .
" There was also a sinister hint from eBay that if I ever put on a promo single again , then I could have my account with them suspended .
" This seems like both the record labels and eBay taking a hammer to a nut , although eBay are probably terrified of any action from the media companies . "
Reading eBay 's policy on promotional items does little to clarify the issue .
The UK version of the auction site says : " eBay policy does not specifically prohibit the listing of promotional items , but you should be aware that many rights owners take the position that the listing of such items is a copyright infringement .
" Listing such items could therefore result in the ending of your listing if a member of our Verified Rights Owner Programme ( VeRO ) reports the items as infringing their rights . "
Ambiguous attitude Clearly eBay is making efforts to comply with the record companies ' wishes on the sale of promos .
The problem is that the companies ' own attitude is , at times , ambiguous .
One long - established second - hand record shop , Beanos of Croydon in south London , fell foul of the major labels when it advertised promos for sale through one of its eBay outlets .
David Lashmar would like more clarity from the record companies
The shop 's proprietor , David Lashmar , points out that the record industry seems happy to let promos from the 1960s or 1970s go up for auction , but has chosen to crack down on newer items .
" Back in 1992 or 1993 , Sotheby 's had on the front of their rare record catalogue a record by the Beatles , Love Me Do , " he says .
" This was a seven - inch single marked ' promotional copy , not for resale ' and it went for £ 15,000 .
" Now I suggested to the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society that they might like to go back to Sotheby 's and ask for the money back , because this is still subject to the same rules that modern promotional items are .
" We have sold recently , on eBay , many promotional records for tens of thousands of pounds in total .
That does n't seem to be a problem because they are 30 or 40 years old .
" Suddenly , if you are trying to sell something which is a promotional item made in the last few years , that seems to incur their wrath .
" Maybe we should sit down and decide where the break - point is when it becomes a collectable , non-promotional item any more . "
Mastery of objects Back in the US , the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's case against Universal makes extensive use of JK Rowling 's work , with a brief that begins with a lengthy quotation from Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows .
" To a goblin , the rightful and true master of any object is the maker , not the purchaser .
All goblin - made objects are , in goblin eyes , rightfully theirs , " as Bill Weasley explains to Harry in the book .
" They consider our habit of keeping goblin - made objects , passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment , little more than theft . "
It 's an attitude that does seem to sum up the record companies ' approach to promos - but it's far from clear whether the US courts will take the same view .

What are these ?
Virginia Museum of Natural History scientists have confirmed that an approximately 500 million - year - old stromatolite was recently discovered at the Boxley Blue Ridge Quarry near Roanoke , Virginia .
This specimen is the first - ever intact stromatolite head found in Virginia , and is one of the largest complete “ heads ” in the world , at over 5 feet in diameter and weighing over 2 tons .
Stromatolites are among the earliest known life forms , and are important in helping scientists understand more about environments that existed in the past .
A stromatolite is a mound produced in shallow water by mats of algae that trap mud and sand particles .
Another mat grows on the trapped sediment layer and this traps another layer of sediment , growing gradually over time .
Stromatolites can grow to heights of a meter or more .
They are uncommon today but their fossils are among the earliest evidence for living things .
The oldest stromatolites have been dated at 3.46 billion years old .
They were discovered in 1999 in Western Australia , near the town of Marble Bar .
The Boxley stromatolite was discovered by Boxley employees in a pile of loose rock they were moving .
The curious shape of the “ rock ” initiated a call to Tom Roller , Boxley ’s professional geologist , who immediately suspected it to be a stromatolite .
Scientists from the Virginia Museum of Natural History traveled to the quarry to evaluate the discovery and confirmed it to be a stromatolite .
The stromatolite has been donated by Boxley to the Virginia Museum of Natural History , where it will be displayed in the coming months .
Although fragments and sections of stromatolites are fairly common , it is very rare for a whole stromatolite head to be collected intact .
This specimen is particularly unusual because the top surface of the head is very well preserved .
“ The exquisite preservation of the surface of this stromatolite will allow museum scientists a rare opportunity not only to look at the stromatolite itself , but also to look for other organisms that may have been living on our around it , ” said Dr. James Beard , assistant director of research and collections for earth sciences , and curator of earth sciences at the Virginia Museum of Natural History .

WASHINGTON  Al Qaeda ’s success in forging close ties to Pakistani militant groups has given it an increasingly secure haven in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan , the American government ’s senior terrorism analyst said Tuesday .
Al Qaeda is more capable of attacking inside the United States than it was last year , and its cadre of senior leaders has recruited and trained “ dozens ” of militants capable of blending into Western society to carry out attacks , the analyst said .
The remarks Tuesday by the intelligence analyst , Ted Gistaro , were the most comprehensive assessment of the Qaeda threat by an American official since the National Intelligence Estimate issued last summer , which concluded that Al Qaeda had largely rebuilt its haven in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
A year later , Mr. Gistaro said , the problem has only grown worse , in part because of a symbiotic relationship between Qaeda operatives and Pakistani militant groups based in the tribal areas .
Rowan and Martin's Laugh - In Creator Dick Martin Dies in Santa Monica ( PHOTOS )
Dan Rowan and Dick Martin
of the famed Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In has died in Santa Monica of respiratory complications .
The 86 year old had a legendary career in nightclubs and as a television director .
He was a master of satire and a champion for free speech .
Martin first met Dan Rowan in 1952 .
The pair hit Las Vegas and became the opening act for Nat King Cole .
Martin was a regular on The Lucy Show in the early 1950's and he and Rowan were frequent guests on The Ed Sullivan Show , The Perry Como Show and The Dean Martin Variety Show .
Rowan and Martin's Laugh - In began it's 6 year run in January , 1968 .
NBC put the show on opposite The Lucy Show and Gunsmoke , two mega-hits and nobody gave the show much of a chance - but by the eighth show , Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In was the number one show in the country .
Rowan and Martin's Laugh - In taped 144 shows and went off the air in 1973 .
The hour long show featured an offbeat ensemble cast that remained unrivaled until SNL .
Goldie Hawn played the giggling dumb blonde , Lily Tomlin was Ernestine the telephone operator , Judy Carne was the ' sock it to me ' girl , Artie Johnson played the German soldier and Ruth Buzzi was the little old lady with a mean umbrella .
( See photos below )
Many catch phrases evolved over the show 's run .
They include : ' Is that a chicken joke ? ' , ' Very interestink ... but stupid ' , ' You bet your sweet bippy ' , ' Here come de judge ' , and ' Sock it to me ' .
Martin directed the hit sitcom The Bob Newhart Show after his Laugh - In stint ended .
The actor married Britain 's first Playboy Playmate Dolly Read in 1971 .

Memo Dated January 28 , 2003 , from CIA to OLC
Contains " communications from the CIA to OLC on a matter in which the CIA requested legal advice from OLC " and shows that CIA interrogators were permitted to use both " Standard Techniques " and " Enhanced Interrogation Techniques " and that in each CIA interrogation session in which an Enhanced Technique was employed , a " contemporaneous record " was created setting forth , among other things , " the nature and duration of each such technique employed " and " the identities of those present . "
Memo Dated August 4 , 2004 , from CIA to OLC
Contains " communications from the CIA to OLC on a matter in which the CIA requested legal advice from OLC " and shows that CIA interrogators were told that the Justice Department had concluded that certain interrogation techniques , " including the waterboard , " did not violate the torture statute .
The document also indicates that CIA interrogators were told to take into account the possibility that their actions would ultimately be subject to judicial review .
Memo Dated August 1 , 2002 , from OLC to CIA
Memo " advising the CIA regarding interrogation methods it may use against al Qaeda members , " and includes information " regarding potential interrogation methods and the context in which their use was contemplated . "
The document also discusses " alternative interrogation methods , " a phrase that was echoed by President Bush in a September 2006 speech promoting the Military Commissions Act .
Though heavily redacted , the document shows that the Justice Department authorized alternative interrogation methods after concluding that " those carrying out these procedures would not have the specific intent to inflict severe physical pain or suffering " or " to cause severe mental pain or suffering . "
The memo explains : " Prolonged mental harm is substantial mental harm of sustained duration , e.g. harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoner . "
The memo also includes this sentence : " Your review of the literature uncovered no empirical data on the use of these procedures , with the exception [ redacted ] . "
The memo is signed by Jay Bybee , who also signed the " organ failure " memo issued to the CIA the same day , and who is now a federal appellate judge .
Pregnancies , both planned and unplanned , happen to trans folks , too .
It is imperative for reproductive health care providers to seek appropriate education and training in order to be able to provide comprehensive care to these patients .
The media circus that greeted Thomas Beatie , a pregnant trasgender man in Bend , Oregon , and his wife , Nancy , turned the subject of transgender pregnancy into spectacle .
Beatie ’s reflections on conception and pregnancy for The Advocate spawned a flurry of media attention ,
from an appearance on Oprah to an
article in People Magazine and
numerous mentions on national and regional news around the country .
Some of the coverage was respectful , but
much of it was not .
For many in the transgender community , and specifically
trans health advocates , this media activity highlighted the urgent need for
increased education and support surrounding transgender pregnancy and trans
awareness and health care .
Because of social stigma and oppression , transgender
patients have typically been an underserved medical population .
Experiencing transphobia leads many transgender people to stay closeted , particularly to their health care providers .
In The Advocate , Beatie describes the discrimination and disrespect he experienced during the process of conception and pregnancy ,
explaining that " doctors have discriminated against us , turning us away due to their
religious beliefs .
Health care professionals have refused to call me by a male
pronoun or recognize Nancy
as my wife .
Receptionists have laughed at us . "
It is this kind of discomfort and misunderstanding that often
leads transgender patients to avoid healthcare altogether , even for routine and preventive
medical care .
It is important for trans allies in
the healthcare community to create networks and partnerships , and to increase
visibility within the greater trans community so that patients feel invited to
seek care with qualified clinicians .
Because there is not one definitive
transgender experience , there is not a singular appropriate approach to care
for providers to follow .
However , there are certain guidelines that can be used
as a framework by health care providers who are interested in providing competent ,
compassionate care for transgender patients .
Health care providers working with the transgender community
must have an understanding of transgender psychosocial issues , and should also
be familiar with basic sensitivity practices .
These include using the preferred
name and gender pronoun of the patient , reassuring the patient about
confidentiality , and discussing their preferences and concerns regarding
potentially sensitive physical exams and tests , such as pap smears or
mammograms .
The clinic staff , from receptionists to medical assistants and
nurses , should also be educated on transgender issues .
Providers should also be aware of and savvy about the healthcare and social services
systems their transgender patients are navigating .
Outreach and networking with
other providers and advocates in the transgender community is key to providing
proficient care .

In terms of reproductive health in particular , it is
important for health care providers to become proficient about the concerns
that are unique to transgender pregnancy .
For many , the notion of pregnant men
is not always easy to understand or imagine , and yet it is a real and
significant occurrence that should be openly addressed and responded to
appropriately .
While the mainstream media has portrayed Thomas Beatie’s
pregnancy as a medical anomaly , he is certainly not the first transgender man
to become pregnant , and he will not be the last .
In light of the recent media attention on transgender pregnancy
and parenthood , we should also remember that the topic of transgender pregnancy
applies not only to pregnancies that result in birth , but also pregnancies that
result in abortion or miscarriage .
As a counselor at a reproductive health
clinic , I have talked with people of many gender variations about their
reproductive health decisions , including female - to - male transgender people ( FTMs ) seeking pregnancy termination .
This phenomenon is often overlooked not only in the healthcare community but
also in the trans community .
Outward and internalized transphobia can make the
process of seeking prenatal care or pregnancy termination a difficult , even
shameful experience for transgender patients .
Pregnancies , both planned and
unplanned , definitely happen to trans folks and it is imperative for
reproductive healthcare providers to seek appropriate education and training in
order to provide comprehensive care to these patients .
Gender is complicated , and so it is to the benefit of our
patients , clients , partners , friends , and family to network and partner with
community allies , and to also seek accurate information and understanding in
order to provide them with excellent healthcare , reproductive and
otherwise .

Nio Inc - ADR ( NYSE : NIO ) shares have broken above the $ 20 level again following positive sell - side commentary Tuesday on the electric vehicle manufacturer .
The Nio Analyst : Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Edison
Yu reiterated a Buy rating on Nio with a $ 24 price target .
The Nio Takeaways : Compelling evidence exists that consumers are increasingly perceiving Nio as a " high - quality premium brand " with best - in - class technology and service , Yu said in a Tuesday note .
Nio's average customer referral rate increased from 52 % in 2019 to 62 % in the first half of 2020 , the analyst said .
Recent studies have shown that Nio's favorability among customers is higher than both BMW and Mercedes - Benz , he said -- and that the Chinese EV maker is one of the most reliable battery EVs across all segments based on the number of problems , even ahead of Tesla Inc ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) .
Yu said he expects
Nio to officially unveil its all - electric sedan , the EE7 , later this year , with a revamped hardware sensor suite that will enable level four autonomy by 2022 .
This should alleviate concerns about the R&D roadmap , the analyst said .
As battery electric vehicle adoption increases and word - of - mouth spreads , Nio can take material share in the premium segment as consumers begin to understand the value proposition and quality of its products and services , he said .
In the near - term , Deutsche Bank expects record deliveries and margins in the third and fourth quarters thanks to the newly launched EC6 SUV coupe , 100 kilowatt - hour battery pack option and the battery - as - a - service rollout .
On Monday , BofA Securities analyst Ming Hsun Lee maintained a Buy rating and $ 23 price target following the unveiling of Nio's new advanced driver assistance system and other use enhancement strategies at the China Auto Show over the weekend .
NIO Price Action :
At last check , Nio shares were rallying 10.39 % to $ 20.76 .

AUGUST 6 -- While on patrol Monday evening , an Indiana cop noticed a naked guy standing in the window of a Fort Wayne home .
So she approached the man 's front door , which was wide open , to investigate further .
It was then that Officer S. Hughes and a colleague were treated to the sight of a prone Ronald Miller , 56 , engaging in a remarkably lewd act on his living room sofa .
For the dirty details , you 'll have to read this Fort Wayne Police Department report , which notes that Miller is apparently handy with a claw hammer and some motor oil .
Miller , pictured in the mug shot at right , was arrested on a felony indecency charge .
A neighbor told cops that Miller was ' not right ' and parades around naked ' 24/24 . ' ( 3 pages )
Adobe steps up
About a year and a half ago , Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 1.0 launched to a fairly positive reception , especially given the shortcomings in its main competitor , Apple 's Aperture .
But now that Apple has addressed many of the major problems with Aperture , Lightroom now faces some stiff competition in the RAW workflow arena .
The recent release of Lightroom 2.0 is Adobe 's attempt to strike back at Aperture 2.0 , and we 've taken a close look at the new release to see just much it advances Adobe 's game .
While some of the new things in 2.0 are tweaks that you 'd expect in a second - revision product , Lightroom also supports some significant additions that aim to raise the feature bar for RAW image processing .
The much - touted localized adjustments feature , which attempts to bring some Photoshop - level control to RAW image processing , is headlining this release 's feature set .
Lossless RAW image editing is a bit of a holy grail for digital image processing , so the more granular control we 're given over RAW images , the closer we 'll be to that digital imaging grail .
But Lightroom 2.0 is n't just about localized edits — there are a lot of other additions that warrant a closer look .

Library Module Changes
Overall , the 2.0 interface too is n't much different from Lightroom 1.0 — the same main five panels remain , and some things , like metadata browsing by lens , rating , etc. , have been put at the top of the Library interface .
Nonetheless , the 2.0 interface does sport a few significant new features .
Better disk - based image management
The one thing that has always bothered me about the cached library approach to image management is that it creates a middleman between you and your files .
In effect , you 're presented a web page that links to your images — it 's not live and you never know what 's really on your disk at any given time , so invariably things get out of sync .
To make matters worse , if you had content on other disks then Lightroom 1.x did n't show which disk they were on ; it displayed only the name of the imported folder .
Lightroom 2.0 attempts to clear away the abstraction by adding a disk - based browser to the Folders Library module , so you can see more clearly where images are located on - disk and you can keep folders synchronized should images be added from outside of Lightroom itself .
The color block to the left of the disk name shows a visual indicator of how full your disk is , going from green to red as it gets more and more full ; an offline disk will appear as gray .
The info to the right of the disk name can be set to show photo count , free disk space , or disk status .
Since the folders shown are still only ones that have been imported and not the whole file structure on the disk itself , it 's not very useful as an import tool .
The ability to synchronize content from each folder , with the option to delete or add any missing images , is a welcome addition and one I know that I 'll be using often .
This synchronization feature works as you 'd expect , and while it 's very handy , my main problem with it is that it 's pretty slow .
When working with a folder containing 900 + images , it took around 20 seconds to find two new images and import them .
I could have gone to the Finder and dragged and dropped them onto Lightroom 's icon in a fraction of that time .
Also , there 's no option to auto - import from an existing folder with images in it , so you 're forced to hit synchronize every time you want to keep the folder current .
An automatic synchronize feature would be pretty nice to see here , so hopefully that 's coming sooner than later .
In spite of its flaws , though , the synchronization feature is big help for clearing up the confusion that inevitably arises between what 's a cached library vs. what 's actually on the disk .
A sewer dwelling horse that is watching you RIGHT NOW .
sewer horse in my pasture ?
Well , it 's more common than you think .
You will know when a sewer horse is in your prescence .
The Sewer horse is a hideous creature , .
I will describe the sewer horse to you and you tell me if you 've seen it .
The Sewer Horse has black skin and the face resembles a horse .
It looks like it would be hanging around a sewer or was born in a sewer because of it's disfigured and abnormal facial features .
We call it shitface .
It 's one of those creatures you feel sorry for and wonder if the mother did crack when she was pregnant with the sewer horse .
The Sewer Horse will have a face that resembles Mr. Ed .
Long narrow , bony with bulging mishapen eyes that pop out of the sockets .
The mouth will be large with gums exposed and larger teeth .
The Sewer Horse also has hair like a horse would .
It resembles straw and is dry to the touch .
If you see this creature stay far away from it and it 's minions or you may end up eaten or worse .
The sewer horse likes to watch people and gets angry when they see another who threatens their territory .
If threatened the horse will attack so tread carefully .
The sewer horse goes by numerous names including jenny , vay jay jay , straw hair shemale , crack baby , ugly duckling and sewer .
In July , 1820 , John Keats published his third and final book , “ Lamia , Isabella , The Eve of St. Agnes and Other Poems . ”
He had no reason to expect that it would be a success , with either the public or the critics : in his short career , the twenty - four - year - old poet had known nothing but rejection on both fronts .
After his first book , “ Poems , ” appeared , in 1817 , his publishers , the brothers Charles and James Ollier , refused to have anything more to do with him .
In a letter to the poet ’s brother George , they wrote , “ We regret that your brother ever requested us to publish his book , or that our opinion of its talent should have led us to acquiesce in undertaking it . ”
They went on , “ By far the greater number of persons who have purchased it from us have found fault with it in such plain terms , that we have in many cases offered to take the book back rather than be annoyed with the ridicule which has , time after time , been showered upon it . ”
“ I have an habitual feeling , ” Keats wrote , “ that I am leading a posthumous existence . ” Illustration by David Hughes
When Keats ’s long poem “ Endymion ” came out , the following year , from a different firm , the ridicule was even worse , and far more public .
The leading Tory magazines of the day published savagely satirical reviews , linking the poem ’s undisciplined exuberance with its author ’s working - class origins .
Keats was the son of a stable - keeper , and he had trained as an apothecary : no wonder , the critics smirked , that he had fallen in with the sentimental “ Cockney School ” of poets , led by the radical journalist Leigh Hunt .
Keats ’s class and his liberal politics were enough to damn him sight unseen , as the Quarterly Review made clear when its critic admitted that he had not bothered to read “ Endymion ” to the end : “ If any one should be bold enough to purchase this ‘ Poetic Romance , ’ and so much more patient , than ourselves , as to get beyond the first book , and so much more fortunate as to find a meaning , we entreat him to make us acquainted with his success . ”
Blackwood ’s Magazine said , “ It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet ; so back to the shop Mr John , back to ‘ plasters , pills , and ointment boxes . ’ ”
After all this , Keats could hardly have been optimistic about his third volume .
He grumbled in a letter to George that he ought to give up writing and become a doctor — it could n’t be any “ worse than writing poems , & hanging them up to be fly - blown on the Review shambles . ”
But he must have been particularly unsettled by a review in the Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review .
The book was not mocked ; the anonymous critic simply said , more in sorrow than in anger , that it was not much good .
“ We confess this volume has disappointed us ; from Mr Keats ’s former productions , we had augured better things , ” the paper opined .
“ We are confident he can do better . ”
To Keats , this would have been the bitterest verdict of all , for by the summer of 1820 he knew that he would not live to publish another book .
Tuberculosis was slowly choking him to death , leaving him without the will or the energy to work : he had written almost no poetry since late the preceding year , and would write no more before he died , in Rome , in February , 1821 .
Keats continued to believe that , with time and study , he would have become a great poet , but he was starting to agree with the critics that nothing he had written could prove it .
A year before his death , he wrote that he was reconciled to failure : “ ‘ If I should die , ’ said I to myself , ‘ I have left no immortal work behind me — nothing to make my friends proud of my memory — but I have lov’d the principle of beauty in all things , and if I had had time I would have made myself remember ’d .’ ”
Of all the piteous elements in Keats ’s story , none is more distressing than the idea that he went to his grave convinced of his failure .
For Keats ’s last book , in addition to the three masterpieces named in its title , included a series of odes —
“ Ode to a Nightingale , ” “ Ode on a Grecian Urn , ” “ Ode to Psyche , ” “ Ode on Melancholy , ” and “ To Autumn ” — that are now universally regarded as among the greatest poems in the English language .
If any single book ever earned its author immortality , it was this one .
And , as Stanley Plumly points out in “ Posthumous Keats ” ( Norton ; $ 27.95 ) , his moving new study of the poet ’s work and legend , “ one could form a considerable collection from what was left out of this last book . ”
Some of Keats ’s best poems , including “ La Belle Dame Sans Merci , ” were never collected in his lifetime .
Did Keats really believe that , having written such poems , he was a failure ?
The question is more urgent in his case than in any other poet ’s , for no writer ever yearned for fame more ardently than Keats .
His ambition was all the more remarkable considering that he started life with none of the advantages of the noble Byron or the wealthy Shelley .
Born in 1795 , the eldest child of a prosperous working - class family , he soon learned how precarious his fortunes really were .
His father , Thomas , died in a riding accident when Keats was eight years old , a blow made worse by the remarriage of his mother , Frances , just a couple of months later .
The hasty marriage was brief , and when it collapsed Frances disappeared in a cloud of scandalous rumors , leaving her children in the care of their grandmother .
When she came back home , a few years later , it was to die .
John nursed her through the final stages of consumption , as he was to do with his youngest brother , Tom , in 1818 .
Keats , orphaned at the age of fourteen , was not entirely without resources .
A small legacy paid for his apprenticeship to a surgeon , after which he went on to medical school , leaving in 1816 with a license to practice as an apothecary — the lowest , most menial kind of medical man .
But by then he had decided that poetry , not medicine , was his calling .
In the time remaining to him — less than five years — he lived off the remains of his inheritance in order to devote himself to greatness .
From his first mature poem , the sonnet “ On First Looking Into Chapman ’s Homer , ” written just before his twenty - first birthday , to his last — the dreamlike fragment “ The Fall of Hyperion , ” which he abandoned just before his twenty - fourth — this ambition was Keats ’s major theme .
In that first poem , written in the early - morning hours after a night spent reading Homer with friends , Keats evokes his dawning sense of the immense realm of poetry — “ like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes / He stared at the Pacific ” — and of the heroic effort required to carve out for himself one of the “ goodly states and kingdoms ” which “ bards in fealty to Apollo hold . ”
In the last , he records a hallucinatory encounter with the goddess Moneta , who tells him that his quest has failed , that he is not a poet but a mere dreamer :
The poet and the dreamer are distinct , Diverse , sheer opposite , antipodes .
The one pours out a balm upon the world , The other vexes it .
Keats offered an apparently unambiguous assessment of his short career when he told his friend Joseph Severn — a young painter who volunteered to accompany him to Rome , and nursed him through his last months — that he did not want his name to appear on his tombstone .
Instead , he instructed , it should simply read , “ Here lies one whose name was writ in * water . ”
Yet Plumly , an award - winning poet , is deeply attuned to the subtleties of poetic ambition , and he points out that the famous epitaph is not quite as resigned as it seems .
“ The fact that Keats did not want his name to appear on the tombstone adds only interest to the mystery of who might be buried so anonymously , ” Plumly writes .
“ The unnamed is , after all , written in stone , not water . ”
It is the epitaph not of a man accepting oblivion but of a poet cultivating his legend from beyond the grave .
Plumly quotes Keats ’s publisher John Taylor , who approved of the anonymous gravestone because he foresaw “ that it will be as clear an indication to posterity as the plainest , everyday inscription that one may find in Westminster Abbey . ”
Such moments of canny sympathy justify the unusual approach that Plumly takes in “ Posthumous Keats . ”
Instead of simply recounting the life and analyzing the poems , Plumly pursues his intuitions through a series of linked essays , all of them concerned with aspects of the poet ’s death and afterlife .
He explores the “ drawings , paintings , engravings , and sculptings ” of Keats ’s face “ by some forty separate artists , ” showing how he was turned into the Victorians ’ archetypal poet , “ perfected and abstracted ” into unrecognizability .
He narrates Keats ’s last days in Rome , evoking the eerie contrast between the sensual city and the increasingly incorporeal sufferer .
He shows us Keats running into Coleridge on Hampstead Heath , and quotes the older poet ’s prophecy : “ When I shook him by the hand there was death ! ”
Through this interweaving of themes and episodes — a “ walk around in Keats ’s life and art , not simply through them ” — Plumly emphasizes , as a more conventional biography never could , the fatal , fated quality of Keats ’s career .
He shows how Keats , in a way that feels unique even among the doomed Romantics , became posthumous while he was still alive .
In one sense , this is because he knew that he was dying long before death arrived .
Thanks to his medical training , and to his experiences nursing his mother and his brother , Keats was well acquainted with the symptoms of tuberculosis .
On February 3 , 1820 , when he fell into a coughing fit and brought up blood on the sheets , he had no doubt what was in store .
“ I know the colour of that blood .
It ’s arterial blood , ” his friend Charles Brown remembered Keats saying .
“ That blood is my death - warrant .
I must die . ”
For the next year , Keats went along with his doctors ’ various treatments — bloodletting , starvation diets , complete avoidance of excitement .
He agreed to leave England , on the slight chance that Italian air would cure him .
But he could never trick himself into believing that his first , fatal diagnosis was mistaken .
In November , 1820 , in the last letter Keats wrote , he told Brown , “ I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past , and that I am leading a posthumous existence . ”
Keats is hardly the only nineteenth - century writer to have died a lingering , consumptive death ; what sets him apart is that his art , from the beginning , was connected with the imagination of death , especially his own .
Like Socrates , he could have said that his life was a long preparation for death , so often had he written about it in poems and letters .
Keats ’s “ posthumous existence , ” one might say , began at the moment he became a poet .
That is why , after he died , so many of his lines began to look eerily like premonitions .
In “ Sleep and Poetry , ” an early attempt at a long poem , Keats was already bargaining for time to complete his work : “ O for ten years , that I may overwhelm / Myself in poesy ; so I may do the deed / That my own soul has to itself decreed . ”
By the age of twenty - one , he was imagining what it would be like to lie in his grave :
If I do fall , at least I will be laid Beneath the silence of a poplar shade ;
And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven ;
And there shall be a kind memorial graven .
The union of poetry and death , in Keats ’s work , only became more intimate as his powers grew .
In March , 1817 , shortly after the Parthenon marbles taken from Greece by Lord Elgin had been put on display at the British Museum , the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon took Keats to see them .
A day or two later , Keats recorded his impressions in a sonnet that invokes death in its very first line :
My spirit is too weak — mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep , And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship , tells me I must die .
Why should the sublimity of these images immediately have reminded Keats that he must die ?
One might as well ask why he exclaimed , in another poem , “ Verse , Fame , and Beauty are intense indeed , / But Death intenser . ”
Or why , in one of his last poems , a love sonnet , he yearned “ Still , still to hear her tender - taken breath , / And so live ever — or else swoon to death . ”
It would be easy to explain Keats ’s preoccupation with death by assigning it a straightforward biographical cause .
Many biographers and critics have pointed to the early loss of his father , and to his bedside view of his mother ’s and brother ’s slow deaths .
Then , there was his experience as a student at Guy ’s Hospital , in London , where he attended gruesome surgeries and dissections .
To an extent unusual even by the grim standards of his time , Keats was constantly surrounded by death and dying .
It was only rational for him to wonder if he , too , would die young .
This was , in fact , the subject of one of his most moving sonnets — the one that begins , “ When I have fears that I may cease to be / Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain . ”
Plumly unsparingly relates the bodily reality of Keats ’s sickness and death .
His description of the poet ’s last days is as clinical as anything Keats might have observed while walking the wards :

An Ethiopian child sits in his mother 's lap at the Wad Sherife refugee camp in Sudan , near the Ethiopian border , in this image from March 13 1985 .
Much of what occurred in Ethiopia at this time was never reported in the Western media
Last Thursday week , with famine approaching yet again , I wondered about the wisdom of forking out yet more aid to Ethiopia .
Since the great famine of the mid-1980s , Ethiopia 's population has soared from 33.5 million to 78 million .
Now , I do not write civil service reports for the United Nations : I write a newspaper column , and I was deliberately strong in my use of language -- as indeed I had been when writing reports from Ethiopia at the height of that terrible Famine .
I was sure that my column would arouse some hostility : my concerns were intensified when I saw the headline : " Africa has given the world nothing but AIDS . "
Which was not quite what I said -- the missing " almost " goes a long way ; and anyway , my article was about aid , not AIDS .
Since dear old Ireland can often enough resemble Lynch Mob Central on PC issues , I braced myself for the worst : and sure enough , in poured the emails .
Three hundred on the first day , soon reaching over 800 : but , amazingly , 90 pc + were in my support , and mostly from baffled , decent and worried people .
The minority who attacked me were risibly predictable , expressing themselves with a vindictive and uninquiring moral superiority .
( Why do so many of those who purport to love mankind actually hate people so ? )
We did more in Ethiopia a quarter of a century ago than just rescue children from terrible death through starvation : we also saved an evil , misogynistic and dysfunctional social system .
Presuming that half the existing population ( say , 17 million ) of the mid 1980s is now dead through non-famine causes , the total added population from that time is some 60 million , around half of them female .
That is , Ethiopia has effectively gained the entire population of the United Kingdom since the famine .
But at least 80 pc of Ethiopian girls are circumcised , meaning that no less than 24 million girls suffered this fate , usually without anaesthetics or antiseptic .
The UN estimates that 12 pc of girls die through septicaemia , spinal convulsions , trauma and blood - loss after circumcision which probably means that around three million little Ethiopian girls have been butchered since the famine -- roughly the same as the number of Jewish women who died in the Holocaust .
So what is the moral justification for saving a baby from death through hunger , in order to give her an even more agonising , almost sacrificial , death aged eight or 13 ?
The practice could have been stamped out , with sufficient political will , as sutti in India once was .
And the feminists of the west would never have allowed such unconditional aid to be given to such a wicked and brutal society if it had been run by white men .
But , instead , the state was run by black males , for whom a special race - and - gender dispensation apparently applies : thus the two most politically incorrect sins of our age -- sexism and racism -- by some mysterious moral process , akin to the mathematics of the double - negative , annul one another , and produce an unquestioned positive virtue , called Ethiopia .
I am not innocent in all this .
The people of Ireland remained in ignorance of the reality of Africa because of cowardly journalists like me .
When I went to Ethiopia just over 20 years ago , I saw many things I never reported -- such as the menacing effect of gangs of young men with Kalashnikovs everywhere , while women did all the work .
In the very middle of starvation and death , men spent their time drinking the local hooch in the boonabate shebeens .
Alongside the boonabates were shanty - brothels , to which drinkers would casually repair , to briefly relieve themselves in the scarred orifice of some wretched prostitute ( whom God preserve and protect ) .
I saw all this and did not report it , nor the anger of the Irish aid workers at the sexual incontinence and fecklessness of Ethiopian men .
Why ?
Because I wanted to write much - acclaimed , tear - jerkingly purple prose about wide - eyed , fly - infested children -- not cold , unpopular and even " racist " accusations about African male culpability .
Am I able to rebut good and honourable people like John O'Shea , who are now warning us that once again , we must feed the starving Ethiopian children ?
No , of course I 'm not .
But I am lost in awe at the dreadful options open to us .
This is the greatest moral quandary facing the world .
We cannot allow the starving children of Ethiopia to die .
Yet the wide - eyed children of 1984 - 86 , who were saved by western medicines and foodstuffs , helped begin the greatest population explosion in human history , which will bring Ethiopia 's population to 170 million by 2050 .
By that time , Nigeria 's population will be 340 million , ( up from just 19 million in 1930 ) .
The same is true over much of Africa .
Thus we are heading towards a demographic holocaust , with a potential premature loss of life far exceeding that of all the wars of the 20th Century .
This terrible truth cannot be ignored .
But back in Ireland , there are sanctimonious ginger - groups , which yearn to prevent discussion , and even to imprison those of us who try , however imperfectly , to expose the truth about Africa .
And of that saccharine , sickly shower , more tomorrow .

Matt Yglesias has a great post which really captures a key component of McCain 's foreign policy approach - it is rooted in hyperbolic rhetoric mixed with hysterical over reaction .
As Matt describes it ,
Not only is Russia on the march beyond Tbilisi to Ukraine , Finland , and substantial swathes of Poland but that ’s not even the transcendent issue of our time .
And North Korea ’s nuclear program is “ the greatest challenge to U.S. security and world stability today ” but that ’s not the transcendent issue of our time .
And Islamism is the transcendent issue of our time , but not a serious international crisis or an especially great challenge to U.S. security and world stability .
Now of course there ’s no way to make sense of that , because it ’s not supposed to make any kind of sense .
McCain just thinks that overreacting is the right reaction to everything .
It ’s a hysteria - based foreign policy .
Each of those statements from McCain sound like they came from an excited media pundit .
Well that ’s because they did .
McCain ’s approach and tone on foreign policy has always been more emblematic of a tv pundit rather than a sober president .
While McCain has attacked Obama as the " celebrity " candidate , the fact is that a bad place to be over the last 25 years has been between John McCain and a TV camera .
The New York Times on Sunday noted that one of the first things McCain did after 9 - 11 was go on just about every TV program - where he incidentally called for attacking about four countries .
In its biographical series profiling the candidates the Times also noted that McCain was attracted to the celebrity of the Senate with one close associate noting that McCain “ saw the glamour of it .
I think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power . ”
McCain clearly enjoys being on television and he has been a constant commentator on the Sunday news shows and the evening talk news programs .
But TV appearances encourage sound bites , over - the - top rhetoric , and good one - liners , not reasoned and nuanced diplomatic language .
This is especially true from guests who are not in the current administration , since you are less likely to get invited back on Face the Nation if you down play a crisis or take a boring nuanced position .
Thus on almost every crisis or incident over the last decade , McCain has sounded the alarm , ratcheted up the rhetoric and often called for military action - with almost no regards to the practical implications of such an approach .
The big concern with a McCain presidency – a concern which I am surprised has not been vocalized more fully – is that the U.S. will lurch from crisis to crisis , confrontation to confrontation , whether it be with Iran , North Korea , Russia , Syria , Saudi Arabia , etc .
The danger is that McCain ’s pundit - like rhetoric will entrap the U.S. in descending spiral of foreign policy brinksmanship .
Just think about the very likely scenario of McCain giving Iran / Russia a rhetorical ultimatum and Iran / Russia ignoring it .
Now we are stuck - either we lose face by not following through on our threats or we follow through and go to war .
We ca n’t afford such a reckless approach after the last eight years .
For the next eight we need a president not a pundit .

The AAA overnight survey of gasoline prices found that the national average price for gasoline is at $ 4.108 , and the cheapest gasoline in the U.S. is still $ 3.930 .
With prices that high , SUV drivers are increasingly finding themselves members of an unfortunate group , the triple - digit club , people whose large gas tanks and low mileage make every fill - up cost over $ 100 .
As more and more people have budget for high fuel prices , their support for environmental conservation has fallen and their support for more energy development and exploration has increased .
According to last week ’s Pew Research Center for the People and the Press report , support for energy conservation has fallen 10 % and support for more energy exploration and development ( drilling , mining , etc. ) has increased by +12 % from February to June and support for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling has increased 8 % to 50 % of the survey respondents .
If there ’s a silver lining here , it ’s that 60 % of the country ( up 6 % from February ) supports new energy development , while 34 % support protecting the environment .
The problem is convincing people that the two are n’t mutually incompatible , and that “ new energy development ” cannot equal “ drill more oil and gas wells , mine more coal , and grow more corn for ethanol ” .
And with most of the energy technologies that have been featured by the Carboholic over the months , new energy development is eminently possible without relying on even more coal or natural gas power plants and more domestic oil production ( that wo n’t come on line for at least a decade anyway ) .

High oil prices are n’t going away anytime soon no matter what Congress and the President do to try and bring them down again .
Plans that supposedly curb speculation are specious at best .
Plans to increase oil supplies are too far out in the future to matter , and humanity needs to wean itself off oil , not drill more to extend the pain .
The best way to adapt to high oil prices is to reduce the amount that you drive , and the best way to do that is to live close enough to where you work and shop that you do n’t need to drive and can take mass transit , walk / run , bicycle , or use some method other than the single occupant automobile .
The problem is that twenty years or so of low gasoline prices has not only convinced people to buy overly - powered and over - large vehicles , but low gasoline prices also created the low population density suburb .
And so long as people live in suburbs and commute long distances , oil demand and prices will both remain high .
According to an article in the Wall Street Journal , cities are exploring how to increase their population density as an answer to high oil prices , falling home values , traffic , and the problems associated with urban sprawl .
The Journal article is a detailed look at the city of Sacramento ’s “ smart growth ” plans and how they ’re progressing , especially now that a California State University - Sacramento poll found 12 % of Sacramento - area respondents had moved or changed jobs to shorten their commute .
According to the article , Mike McKeever , the head of Sacramento ’s regional planning agency , is he person most directly responsible for the largely successful , albeit voluntary , push for new development to become transit - focused and higher density than the usual single - family home on a large suburban lot .
He developed a software program that enabled attendees at public planning meetings to observe the changes in traffic , job growth , and pollution as they changed the amount and type of housing , and in the process he convinced not only the regional city governments to do things his way , but he also largely convinced the public and property developers too .
The reason it worked was that developers and governments realized that their property values would be less susceptible to to housing bubbles and their inevitable pops if cities had a mix of residential development – apartments , lofts , condos , and single - family homes .
People realized that denser development with local transit access would enable them to get around Sacramento to and from their jobs , and that having groceries , schools , restaurants , and shopping within walking distance would also reduce the need for a car .
And as a result , Sacramento is now being looked to by much of the rest of the country , where suburban sprawl still dominates , as a possible template for a new American culture , without the singular focus on the automobile .
The popping of the housing bubble combined with high oil prices may well be the Armageddon bell for the suburb , and if that ’s the case , the U.S. probably has a great deal more economic pain to go through before we ’ve transitioned our culture sufficiently away from a car culture .
But as Sacramento - based architect David Mogavero said in the Journal article , “ Expensive oil is going to transform the American culture as radically as cheap oil did . ”

A couple of weeks ago , the Carboholic reported that the United States Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) had issued a 22 - month moratorium on all new solar power generation permits on federal land in the desert southwest .
As of July 3 , the BLM has reversed that position and will continue to accept new solar permit requests while the 22 - month environmental study is in process .
According to the New York Times article , lobbying by the solar power industry , citizens groups , and interested members of Congress pressured the BLM to reverse course for the time being .

Generally speaking , flat screen liquid crystal display ( LCD ) computer monitors consume less power and generate less heat than equivalently sized cathode - ray tube ( CRT ) monitors .
Not only does this mean that your monitor costs less to run , but because it ’s operating cooler , LCD monitors require less energy than CRT monitors for climate control around the computer station , saving yet more money .
Its for these excellent reasons that most energy conservation experts claim that switching over to an LCD monitor is better for energy conservation and thus also better for addressing global heating .
Unfortunately , it may not be quite that simple .
According to an article in the Telegraph last week , an industrial compound used in the manufacturing of LCD products known as “ NF3 ” is a potent , and totally unregulated , greenhouse gas .
There are two problems with NF3 .
The first is that it ’s 17,000 times more potent a greenhouse gas ( GHG ) than carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , and according to the Telegraph article , Professor Michael Prather from the University of California at Irvine estimates that the 4000 tons of NF3 emitted yearly equates to roughly 67 million tons of CO 2 .
The second problem is that NF3 , along with many other synthetic industrial compounds , are totally unregulated .
If they were n’t used or had n’t been invented when the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated , they were n’t regulated accordingly .
Thankfully , however , the Telegraph article quoted a spokesman for the UK’s Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs as saying “ This is an issue that affects every country , and we ’re working with other members of EU to ensure that all new synthetic greenhouse gases , including NF3 , are covered as part of any future UN climate change agreements . ”
So if you ’re inclined to estimate your computer monitor ’s CO 2 emissions , do n’t forget to add the additional emissions of industrial GHGs too .
Assuming you can figure out how much of which gas is emitted per monitor , that is .

According to the Dayton Daily News , a new project undertaken by the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership aims to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of CO 2 sequestration in a huge underground saline aquifer , the Mount Simon Sandstone formation .
The test will compress and inject 1 million tons of CO 2 produced as a byproduct of the Andersons Marathon Ethanol LLC corn ethanol plant and inject them into the aquifer to gather data on both sequestration technologies and whether the Mount Simon Sandstone formation aquifer will safely store CO 2 without causing small earthquakes .
If the test , slated to be completed in 2014 , is successful , then much of the rest of the aquifer may also be viable for carbon sequestration .
And if that ’s the case , the National Energy Technology Laboratory ( part of the U.S. Department of Energy ) estimates that the aquifers could hold up to 653 billion tons of CO 2 .
For reference , if we use the U.S. Energy Information Agency ’s CO 2 emissions data from 2005 as the baseline , the aquifer could store as much as 108 years worth of emissions .
From Warren Ellis ' blog :
" The partner of designer and COILHOUSE co-creator Mildred Von has been arrested in Dubai for carrying melatonin .
This , apparently , gave them the excuse to declare without testing that a few fragments of dirt in the bottom of his bag were hashish .
Everyone 's hoping that they 'll be forced to release him in another seven days but the Dubai authorities , as you might expect , are behaving like monsters .
Details are here .
Please read them before asking questions .
Mil 's contact details are in that post too .
We might get lucky and they might bounce him out when it turns out there 's nothing to hold him on , but , really , that does n't sound like Dubai .
If you think you can help , please do get in touch with Mil .

Average shoppers chose locally - grown strawberries over those shipped from farther away , and preferred berries that came from small farms over those from large industrial producers .
If that carrot traveled across state lines , I ’m not eating it !
Even if it costs more to buy one that did n't .
That 's the attitude of more and more foodies , and a new study finds that grocery store shoppers , in general , are willing to shell out more money for locally - grown foods than they would for the same product trucked , shipped or flown in from farther away .
The effect was even more pronounced among shoppers at farmers markets .
" This is an indication that certain groups out there value locally produced food and if farmers deliver that , it makes these consumers happier , so it ’s good for them , too , " said Marvin Batte , a professor of agricultural , environmental and development economics at Ohio State University , and lead author of the study .
Batte and his colleagues surveyed shoppers , offering them choices between conventional strawberries and locally - grown strawberries .
The team found that consumers at grocery stores were willing to pay 42 cents more , on average , for the local berries , and that buyers at farmer 's markets were happy to shell out 92 cents extra .
With the quarts of strawberries selling for $ 3 when subjects were surveyed , this meant an increase in one - sixth , and one - third , respectively , of the total price .
The results of the study , funded by the National Research Initiative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the Fred N. VanBuren Program in Farm Management at Ohio State , and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center , were detailed in the May issue of the American Journal of Agricultural Economics .
People who chase after locally - grown food — sometimes called " locavores " — do so for a variety of reasons .
The most common motive reported to the researchers : " It 's better quality food , it tastes better , it 's fresher , " Batte told LiveScience .
The next most common response was from shoppers who cared about supporting community businesses and keeping the money they spend in their neighborhood economy .
Furthermore , locally - grown food may be attractive to people concerned about the environmental impact of transporting food :
The farther it travels , the more carbon it produces , said Tim Schlitzer , the executive director of the Food Routes Conservancy , a non-profit organization that works to build the local food movement .
And some consumers simply feel reassured when the distance between farm and plate is n't so vast .
" They know where it comes from , they may know the farmer and get to know how they grow things , " Schlitzer said .
" They are looking for someone who can actually tell them how it was grown . "
For consumers concerned about buying sustainably - grown food , or eating produce made without potentially harmful chemicals and pesticides , it may be easier to ensure local food meets these criteria compared with conventionally - farmed products .
Survey says
The researchers analyzed the results of 477 surveys from people shopping at various grocery stores , farmer 's markets , and farms themselves , all in the Midwest .
Batte 's team offered two baskets of strawberries under 80 different combinations of price , farm location and farm type , and asked shoppers which option they would prefer to buy .
" Statistically , we sorted out what explains each person choosing one basket over the other , " Batte said .
" We were able to determine how important price was , how important where the strawberries were produced was and whether the freshness guarantee was a factor .
Basically what made the biggest difference was local production . "
The scientists also tested how much the type of farm the strawberries came from mattered .
They offered baskets from a fictional producer called " Fred 's " compared to baskets from a fake company called " Berries Inc . "
Grocery store shoppers gladly forked over 17 extra cents for Fred 's fruit , and farmer 's market shoppers paid a whopping 42 cents more for the berries they thought came from a small farm .
Is Purdue local ?
Batte said consumption of locally - grown foods is " increasing fairly dramatically , " though he does n't have statistics , partly because the definition of " locally - grown " can change .
For example , local in California , a huge state with multiple agricultural regions , may mean something different than it would in New England , where several small states are clustered together .
And for many shoppers , preferring locally - grown does n't simply mean caring about how many miles the food has travelled , but also the practices used to produce it .
" Conventional can be local , " Schlitzer said .
" You can live in Maryland and Purdue chicken is right there , but they 're not considered sustainable .
That ’s not what people are looking for .
They 're looking for the small farmer who feeds the chickens healthy food and they 're well - exercised . "
Depending on where you live , local food may not be the more expensive option .
" In terms of price , I know people are willing to pay more , but in a lot of cases you pay a lot less , " Schlitzer said . "
Buying food in season from a small farm in the immediate area , where marketing , packaging and shipping costs are lower , can be cheaper than out - of - season produce shipped from another country , he said .
With the rising price of gas lately , this may become more and more true .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
If you 've ever complained about an unexpected interest - rate hike on your credit card , now 's your chance to have your gripe heard .
But you do n't have much time .
The Federal Reserve is accepting comments through Aug. 4 on credit - card reform rules it proposed in May .
( The deadline for comments regarding related proposals , mainly to do with credit - card disclosures , is sooner : July 18 . )
Already , more than 9,300 people have commented on the sweeping set of proposed changes that , among other things , would prohibit credit - card companies in some instances from hitting you with a higher interest rate on debt you 've already incurred .
Or , if you 've ever accepted a " balance transfer " offer with a low interest rate , only to find that your payments go first to that cheaper debt , rather than to the higher - rate purchases you 've made , that situation would change too .
Under the Fed 's proposal , credit - card issuers would need to apply at least a portion of your monthly payment to higher - rate debt , in most cases .
The proposed rules also would prohibit " two - cycle billing , " in which banks compute interest on debt on days preceding the most recent billing cycle , a practice that can result in borrowers paying interest on debt paid off during the previous month 's grace period .
The Fed 's proposed rules are " much better than we expected , " said Lauren Saunders , managing attorney of the National Consumer Law Center 's Washington office .
" There are some real improvements in them . "
Plenty of consumers agree , judging by the comments posted to the Federal Reserve site .
The Fed does n't keep a running for - or - against tally , however .
It 's not unusual for consumer - related proposals to generate about 1,000 comments , said Federal Reserve spokeswoman Susan Stawick .
A recent high was more than 45,000 comments related to a December 2000 proposal to allow financial holding companies to act as real - estate brokers , she said .
Credit industry disagrees
Credit - card issuers say the proposed rules are bad news for consumers .
" We are deeply concerned that these rules will result in less competition , higher consumer prices , fewer consumer choices and reduced consumer access to credit cards , " said Edward Yingling , president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association , a Washington - based trade group , in a statement released soon after the Fed 's proposal .
" For example , the proposal would greatly restrict the ability of card companies to charge interest rates that reflect the risks of different consumers , " the statement said .
" If card companies cannot fully reflect risk , then millions of consumers with good credit histories will end up with higher rates . "
While consumer advocates disagree with banks ' claims , they are n't entirely pleased with the proposed regulations -- they would like to see them go further .
For instance , the proposal to make credit - card issuers apply consumers ' payments to higher - rate debt only applies to money consumers send in above the minimum payment .
And the Fed rules do n't really address fees .
That 's where Congress may step in .
A veritable feast of pro-consumer bills has been introduced over the past year or so .
Bevy of bills
In February , Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , introduced H.R. 5244 , a bill that , among other things , would end " universal default " -- when a credit - card issuer raises a consumer 's interest rate based on late payments to other , unrelated creditors .
The bill would also prohibit " any time , any reason " changes in credit - card terms , with certain exceptions .
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , recently outlined a bill he intends to introduce with similar provisions to Maloney 's , such as requiring banks mail statements 21 days before the bill is due rather than the current 14 , according to Dodd 's statement .
In May 2007 , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , introduced S. 1395 , which proposes a cap on " penalty " interest - rate hikes to no more than seven percentage points above the previous interest rate .
The bill would also prohibit charging interest on fees , among other provisions .
Sen. Robert Menendez , D - N.J. , introduced S. 2753 in March .
Like Dodd 's proposal , the bill limits the ways in which banks offer credit to people under age 21 .
Also , it would prevent late - payment fees on any payment postmarked by the payment date , among other changes .
Many members of Congress " are very , very concerned " about credit - card practices , said Travis Plunkett , legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America , a Washington - based advocacy and research organization .
" I actually think that action by the Fed will encourage Congress to further investigate and act on abusive lending practices " not covered by the Fed 's rules , Plunkett said .
Still , " it 's unlikely anything will pass two houses of Congress this year , " he said .
" But there 's a reasonably good chance we 'll see a bill pass the House . "
The Federal Reserve said it expects to issue a final ruling by the end of this year .
It could weaken the proposed rules .
Saunders said the Fed asked credit - card companies whether the rules would be expensive or burdensome .
That " indicates a possibility of [ the Fed ] weakening the rules , " she said .

The final novel by legendary sci-fi author Arthur C Clarke is to be published in August .
According to the Independent , Clarke 's unfinished book The Last Theorem was completed by fellow scribe Frederik Pohl .
Publisher HarperCollins coughed six figures to secure the rights earlier this year .
The book appears to have been a truly collaborative effort , with Clarke asking for Pohl 's assistance when he became increasingly ill with post - polio syndrome , and also found himself stricken with writer 's block .
" Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and did n't know how to write any of the books he had contracted , " Pohl explained .
" The stories had just gone out of his head . "
Pohl worked from notes and an outline to bring the book to life over a period of two years , saying that " everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him " .
Clarke was able to review the finished manuscript before his death in March this year .
The last theorem of the title is that of 17th - century maths whiz Pierre de Fermat , but if that 's too dry there is the promise of space elevator action too .
The book is available to pre-order now before publication next month . ®
A British minister said Thursday that the U.S. has landed two " extraordinary rendition " flights carrying terrorism suspects on British territory .
The British government had previously insisted there was no evidence to support allegations that U.S. planes had landed on British territory during rendition , the controversial process of transferring detainees to another country where they possibly face torture .
But Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband told MPs on Thursday that on two separate occasions in 2002 the U.S. landed rendition flights on the U.K. - dependent island of Diego Garcia , located in the Indian Ocean south of India .
" Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights , recent U.S. investigations have now revealed two occasions , both in 2002 , when this had , in fact , occurred , " Miliband told parliament .
On both occasions , the U.S. plane carried a single detainee on board and stopped only to refuel at a U.S. facility on the island , Miliband said .
" The detainees did not leave the plane .
And the U.S. government has assured us that no U.S. detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia , " Miliband said .
He apologized for previous statements made that rendition did not happen , saying that errors in earlier U.S. records searches meant the cases did not come to light .
Neither of the two detained men was a British resident or citizen , Miliband said .
One is presently detained at Guantanamo Bay and the other has been released .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , speaking in Brussels , said he had just been informed and " shared the disappointment that everybody has " about the stops .
" The important thing now is we put in place the best possible procedures to ensure that this will not happen again , " he said .

After getting in hot water over the BitTorrent allegation – Comcast ’s new form of network management will kick in when it identifies a single user “ disproportionately ” consuming network resources and will move to throttle their connection for a short while .
“ If in fact a person is generating enough packets that they ’re the ones creating that situation , we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers , ” ’ said Comcast senior vice president and general manager of online services Matt Bowling .
Comcast says its new “ fair share ” system of throttling troublesome customers has so far proven to be fairly effective , particularly when the throttling stays in effect for about 10 to 20 minutes .
Once the time limit elapses , speeds revert to normal .
It does n’t mean a throttled internet experience will be undesirable , however , as Bowling says that users experiencing limited bandwidth will still have an experience on par with “ really good ” DSL service .
But if a user continues a high level of consumption , “ we would have to manage them again . ”
It appears that Comcast customers will still enjoy an essentially unlimited bandwidth allotment ; however the company says it is mulling over the possibility of charging subscribers a higher price for heavier internet use – but , it “ [ has n’t ] made any decisions ” yet .
FIOS to the rescue !
Bye - Bye Comcast !
Well , predicting Bush Stupidity is about as difficult as checking to see if the Sun rises each morning .
Yep , daytime ... the Sun is still up , Bush is still stupid , and still a punk - ass little shit of a president who needs the sh*t kicked out of him .
When I think of Bush , I am often reminded of the legendary one - liner that Winston Churchill slapped Lady Astor with after a Parliament lunch break and before Churchill became Prime Minister : " Mr. Churchill , you are drunk !
Yes , Lady Astor , I am .
However , in the morning I shall be sober but you shall still be ugly . "
Yeah , GW will still be stupid in the morning ... and we can all expect another Bush dirty diaper tomorrow or the next day .
The analogy is also simple - Russian troops and tanks will still be in Georgia today and tomorrow , and the Bear will leave only when it is ready to leave .
Bush and Rice can make all of the blustery melodramatic statements they wish but the paw of the Bear is parked squarely on the chest of Georgia until further notice .
The news media has already reported that Bush is talking to the G7 to try to get them together to kick Russia out of the G8 .
Fortunately , I believe most of the G7 realize this is another Bush punk temper tantrum and wo n't go along with it .
As hard as this would be for Bush and his ' type ' of supporters to accept , the world needs Russia right now more than it does the United States .
Bush I , Bush II and Clinton have done that much damage to the honor and integrity of America .
The Bush and Blair show has cost the United States in huge ways that will be impossible to recover from for the next 10 to 20 years .
Either McCain or Barky will find so many Bush dirty diapers in the Oval Office , they wo n't be able to make a dent in them for the next 4 OR 8 years .
Bush is leaning on NATO to ' punish Russia ' and he is not getting very far there , either .
Most of the NATO nations are worried about Russian oil and gas supplies more than they are in joining with Bush in a tantrum because he did n't get his way in Georgia .
NATO did , in fact , DENY membership to Georgia .
Please read that again to be sure you understand it .
The ' territorial dispute ' matter was just an excuse .
South Ossetia and Abkhazia have not desired to be a part of Georgia since the USSR disbanded in 1991 .
The real reason is that most NATO members want peace with Russia , and want no more Bush lunacy stirring up problems .
To the ' letter of the law ' Russia withdrew 80 armored divisions , legions of missile and artillery systems and ended the Cold War .
Most of NATO knows that Bush and his lunacy are bungling into what could be a very hot war .
Many NATO members are not happy about this fake ' Bush Missile Shield ' that is an offensive weapon system aimed at Russia .
Russia has made it clear Poland is now designated as a nuclear weapons target .
EU and NATO saw that coming and they are not pleased at this constant , never ending , underhanded provocation of Russia by Junior and his Zionist Buddies .
For the bogus Bush Missile Shield to be able to protect EU from " IRANIAN MISSILES " ...right ...its proper location would be in Bulgaria , Romania , Ukraine , Hungary , etc .
Just look at a map .
Most Europeans are not happy about McCain and his ' 100 years of war ' comment , nor are they happy that sock puppet Barky is being run by Russia - hating Zbig .
The Russian Bear is now in position to attack and some of the EU nations are already backing up .
News surfaced August 16 , 2008 in Armenian television that the Bush Administration is trying to pressure the IOC to not have the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi , Russia which used to be part of Abkhazia and is in the general area of Georgia .
US lawmakers want IOC to strip Russia of 2014 Olympics http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hsyDQxSkAQPxDwD6Vb-KIathwfbQ
Imagine my surprise that our gutless Congress started in this late Friday so the media would not pick up on it .
It is an old stunt in DC to keep the Sheeple buried in shit and in the dark , like mushrooms .
This is yet another tempter tantrum by the Punk President of the United States because things did not go his way in Georgia .
Even Congress is joining in on the stupidity and hollow rhetoric .
http://www.theseminal.com/2008/08/14/move-the-2014-winter-olympics- away - from - sochi-russia
This is a very good map of Georgia clearly showing the locations Sochi , Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
I have never done this before ... but the exact second this cretin moron diaper - filling drunkard is no longer President of the United States , I - and probably countless other Americans - am going to throw a big party celebrating his departure ... which should have him in irons headed to the World Court to face war crimes and genocide charges .
Yeah , GW , pitch a fit , throw a tantrum , have another drink , continue to show the world what a lame - brained ass you are .
If you hurry you can make it back to Beijing in time to touch some more US women athletes and for the closing ceremonies to make an ass of yourself twice in one Olympics games .
Think of how ' historical ' and ' presidential ' that would be .
They might find a Gold Medal laying around somewhere to give Bush for a ' double show , double ass - busting ' performance .
The thought just occurred to me that this cute stunt by Georgia is going to hurt them big time economically .
Little things like tourism , foreign investment , putting in a McDonalds franchise and having to put up with Blackwater USA thugs , little things like that .
It will all add up and it will hurt .
I bet the people traveling to the 2014 Olympics will not book a room in Georgia , except maybe the US and Israeli teams ... so Blackwater can protect them .
If you look closely at the map above , beach front property for oil and gas pipelines is rather limited these days .
That other region to the south of Poti is also a breakaway region that adjoins both Armenia and Turkey .
Everyone in that area of the world is smelling that strange stench coming out of ' poor little Georgia . '
For those who are not familiar with geography or history , the Khazar Jews originated in the part of the world between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea .
Those are the ones who are not descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel but they are the Zionist Jews who are now the world 's biggest problem .
That is why true , pious Jews want them OUT of Judaism ... they are not descendants of the 12 Tribes .
It is that strange mixture of Kosher and Muslim , with a liberal amount of mercenary spices that has people turning up their nose on this matter .
Stay tuned ... there will be war crimes charges brought against Georgia and its accomplices - which include Ukraine , Israel and the USA .
The Russians are wondering if Poodle Rice is ' stupid . '
She did seem to have a rather one track mind all last week : " Russian forces must leave Georgia now . "
Apparently , her handlers forgot to program her for much more than that .
The Russians might be right .
Candi Rice as proof positive that affirmative action does not always work .
Her performances are also testimony to how meaningless a PhD can be .
There are two types of PhD degrees : one denotes brilliance and dedication to a discipline ... and the other is an acronym that stands for ' Piled higher and Deeper . '
Has anyone ever seen a lick of brilliance from her ?
She is nothing more than a Zionist Neocon lap - dog poodle who has been trained to ' arf ' and pee on cue .
There is no reason to worry about the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games .
Georgia is going to either clean up its act or Russia will end this dispute long before 2014 .
Latest word is Russia signed the cease fire agreement but its troops and armor are still in Georgia .
Russia made the clear and unambiguous statement : " We are not withdrawing until certain security measures are in place . "

Fox forced to apologise to Obama for third time in two weeks
Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News television station has been forced to apologise to Barack Obama for the third time in a fortnight after screening a racially tinged caption referring to his wife Michelle as his " baby mama " .
Bill Shine , senior vice president of programming at Fox , said in a statement on Thursday that a producer " exercised poor judgment " during the segment .
The statement came as Obama established a website to help counter what he referred to as smears and rumours .
One of his first moves was to defend Michelle by debunking a persistent rumour that there is a video showing her speaking from the pulpit of the Trinity church in Chicago in which she allegedly refers to whites as " whitey " .
He said she had never spoken at Trinity or used such a phrase .
Republicans see her as vulnerable because she is more inclined than Obama to make off - the - cuff remarks .
Obama 's communications director , Robert Gibbs , rejected this in an interview with MSNBC yesterday , describing her as an " asset to the campaign " .
Fox , seen by liberals as a cheerleader for the Republican party , carried an interview this week with the conservative columnist Michelle Malkin about whether Michelle Obama was being unfairly targeted .
During the interview , a caption was flashed up saying : " Outraged liberals : Stop picking on Obama 's baby mama . "
The term is slang for a woman who has a baby with a man who is neither her partner nor boyfriend .
The apology comes just over a week after one of Fox 's anchormen expressed regret for a comment on the night that Obama won the Democratic nomination .
Obama , in a show of affection , lightly touched his fist against Michelle 's and the anchorwoman referred to it as a " terrorist fist jab " .
Previously , a Fox contributor Liz Trotta had to apologise after making a joke about Obama being assassinated .
The trio of apologies is embarrassing for Fox .
Murdoch last month praised Obama but stopped short of endorsing him , though his New York Post came out for Obama in January .
Prebiotic potential of almonds

Almonds , as well as being high in vitamin E and other minerals , are also thought to have other health benefits , such as reducing cholesterol .
Recently published work by the Institute of Food Research has identified potential prebiotic properties of almonds that could help improve our digestive health by increasing levels of beneficial gut bacteria .
Our digestive system maintains large population of bacteria that live in the colon .
Prebiotics are non-digestible parts of foods that these bacteria can use to fuel their growth and activity .
These ' good ' bacteria form part of our body 's defence against harmful bacteria and play a role in the development of body 's immune system .
The prebiotics work by stimulating the growth of these bacteria .
However , in order to get to where they are needed prebiotics must be able to get through the upper part of the intestine without being digested or absorbed by the body .
Funded by the Almond Board of California , IFR scientists first used the Model Gut , a physical and biochemical simulator of the gastro - intestinal tract , to subject almonds to the same conditions experienced in the stomach and small intestine .
They then added the digested almonds to an in vitro batch system to mimic the bacterial fermentation in the large intestine and monitored its effect on the populations of intestinal bacteria .
The study , published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology , found that finely ground almonds significantly increased the levels of certain beneficial gut bacteria .
This effect was not seen when the fat content was removed from the almond preparation , suggesting that the beneficial bacteria use the almond lipid for growth , and this is the basis for the prebiotic effect of almonds .
Previous studies have shown that the amount of available lipid is reduced if the almonds are not processed , for example by grinding as in this study or by chewing .
The length of time the almond spends in the digestive system also affects the amount of available lipids and proteins .
More detailed studies on the digestibility of almonds are now required , and the prebiotic effect of almond lipids needs to be tested in human volunteers .
For Teddy Roosevelt it was the creation of our system of National Parks .
For Richard Nixon it was the passage of landmark environmental reforms found in the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act , and the National Environmental Policy Act.
For Bill Clinton it was an eleventh - hour preservation of millions of acres of public lands .
For George W. Bush it will be tackling the issues of global warming and climate change .
huh ?
In light of my recent post about the demoralizing effect this administration has had upon EPA scientists and other agency ‘ lifers ’ , I was more than just a little surprised to hear about the story leaked in Monday ’s Washington Times that reports President Bush is “ poised to change course and announce as early as this week that he wants Congress to pass a bill to combat global warming , and will lay out principles for what that should include . ”
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino declined on Monday to confirm rumors that action was imminent , though she would not rule it out .
She said the administration ’s discussions are building toward an expected debate on climate change in the Senate in June [ watch video of White House press conference here ] .
If President George W. Bush throws his support behind mandatory carbon dioxide regulations , it would indeed be a major shift away from his insistence that placing binding caps on emissions would harm the U.S. economy .
Not So Fast ?
Jeffrey Holmstead , an attorney with Bracewell and Giuliani LLP and a former EPA official , said the White House was not “ on the verge of a fundamental shift ” in climate change policy .
“ I do n’t think that anyone should be holding their breath waiting for a dramatic new cap - and - trade proposal from the administration , ” Holmstead said .
[ read more about the environmental leanings of Giuliani and Bracewell LLP here ]
It is possible that word from the White House may come as early as Thursday , when Bush is scheduled to speak in the Rose Garden to recipients of the President ’s Environmental Youth Awards .
I would argue that the only opportunity the current president has to leave a positive and lasting legacy is to take ownership of the climate change and global warming issues ( and all of the thorny issues they present ) .
Bush would have to seize the opportunity with all the capacity , all of the willpower , and all of the resources that he can possibly muster as the leader of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world and channel it towards solving the most pressing problem facing humanity today .
Many would argue that this president damaged the environment as well as the institutions we have built to protect it , beyond any hope of repair .
While it may be true that the ecological damages may never be undone , the beauty of the democratic project is such that , it allows us to challenge those assumptions and rebuild those crumbling institutions which allowed the ecological damage in the first place .

Visitors to Number 10 TV site were greeted by an error message
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's new website has been hit by teething troubles , Downing Street has confirmed .
Number 10 TV was officially launched as part of Mr Brown 's efforts to reach out to a wider public .
The site will feature exclusive video coverage of the prime minister 's speeches and media appearances .
But anyone trying to access it was met with a " 404 page not found " error message .
A Downing Street spokeswoman denied the site had crashed .
But she said users on some servers might experience glitches " for the next 48 hours " .
" It is just what happens when you launch a new website , " she added .
Number 10 TV is part of a redesigned Downing Street website , which includes news , guided tours of Number 10 and official reports .
Downing Street says the revamp is designed to " boost the amount of video content " .
It comes two years after Conservative leader David Cameron launched his own website , Webcameron , which regularly features behind - the - scenes content .
In May Mr Brown launched an online version of prime minister 's questions .
He pledged to respond to video - clip questions submitted via the Downing Street Youtube website .
Summary of Findings
As he has since January , this week , Barack Obama enjoyed much more visibility as far as the public was concerned than did John McCain .
By a margin of 76 % to 11 % respondents in Pew ’s weekly News Interest Index survey named Obama over McCain as the candidate they have heard the most about in recent days .
But the same poll also shows that the Democratic candidate ’s media dominance may not be working in his favor .
Close to half ( 48 % ) of Pew ’s interviewees went on to say that they have been hearing too much about Obama lately .
And by a slight , but statistically significant margin – 22 % to 16 % – people say that recently they have a less rather than more favorable view of the putative Democratic nominee .
In contrast , if anything , Pew ’s respondents said they want to hear more , not less about the Republican candidate .
Just 26 % in the poll said they had heard too much about McCain , while a larger number ( 38 % ) reported that they had heard too little about the putative Republican candidate .
However , as for Obama , a slight plurality reports that recently they have come to have a less favorable view of McCain rather than a more favorable view of him – ( 23 % to 18 % ) .
Not surprisingly , a very large number of Republicans say they have heard too much about Obama lately .
But 51 % of independents shared this opinion , and as many as a third of Democrats thought so too .
While Obama has dominated McCain as the candidate citizens say they have heard the most about in the news , roughly equal numbers say that they are aware of commercials on behalf of each candidate .
About six - in - ten have seen commercials for both candidates .
Most of those who are aware of Obama ’s commercials say they are mostly positive messages about the candidate ( 38 % ) , while fewer ( 13 % ) characterize them as negative messages about McCain .
The balance of opinion about McCain ’s commercials is the opposite – a plurality ( 31 % ) sees them as negative messages about his opponent , with fewer ( 19 % ) describing them as positive ads .
There is surprising partisan agreement about the campaign commercials of both candidates .
On balance , both Republicans and Democrats think Obama ’s commercials have been mostly positive .
And pluralities of both Republicans and Democrats say McCain ’s ads are mostly negative .
Nonetheless Democrats are more likely than others to say Obama ’s commercials are positive , and Republicans are less likely to characterize McCain ’s ads as negative .
When asked about specific commercials , those tested for each candidate registered about similar recall levels – 41 % of Pew ’s respondents said they have seen McCain ’s commercial that compares Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
Almost the same number – ( 43 % ) report seeing Barack Obama ’s commercial where he talks about his background growing up in Kansas .
Economic and Campaign News Capture Most Attention
Public interest in news about economic conditions remained high last week amid reports about federal legislation to uplift the housing market and official projections of a half - trillion - dollar national budget deficit .
About half of all Americans ( 47 % ) paid very close attention to news about the state of the U.S. economy and another 34 % were following this news fairly closely .
Three - in - ten ( 30 % ) said it was the news they followed most closely for the week , making the economy the public ’s top story .
Actual news coverage of the economy was the second most heavily covered story last week .
The national news media devoted 5 % of all coverage to the topic .
For the third straight week , the audience for campaign news totaled three - in - ten Americans who were following the presidential race very closely .
While not the most closely followed news item of the week , the campaign was the public ’s number two story , with 27 % of Americans citing the campaign as the story they were following more closely than any other .
A far greater share of the national newshole was devoted to the presidential campaign last week than to any other major news story .
More than one - quarter of all news ( 26 % ) focused on the campaign .
Roughly one - in - four Americans ( 27 % ) followed news about the Iraq war very closely and 11 % listed this as their most closely followed story for the week .
News about an earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area attracted the very close attention of 17 % of the public .
Predictably , residents of the West Coast followed the story more closely than residents of other regions of the country .
The earthquake , which caused little damage last week , received 2 % of all news coverage .
So far this summer , there is a relatively small American audience for news about the upcoming Olympic games in Beijing , China .
Just 13 % followed news about Olympic preparations very closely last week .
Interest in the Chinese games remains unchanged from the previous week ( 12 % ) .
The media , for its part , devoted 3 % of all news to the upcoming Olympics .
Overall , the press devoted 4 % of coverage to the indictment of Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens for making false statements about his personal finances .
However few in the public followed the story closely .
Just 9 % followed news about Sen .
Stevens very closely and even fewer ( 2 % ) called it their most closely followed story of the week .
For the first time this year , John McCain attracted nearly as much media attention as his Democratic rival , Barack Obama .
For the week of July 28 - Aug.
3 , Barack Obama was a featured candidate in 81 % of all campaign stories and John McCain was a featured candidate in a comparable 78 % of all campaign reporting , according to the Campaign Coverage Index from the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
While John McCain may have closed the gap in campaign news coverage , equaling the attention garnered by his opponent , Barack Obama remains the far more visible candidate in the eyes of the public .
When asked which presidential candidate they have heard the most about in the news over the last week or so , 76 % of the public names Barack Obama while just one - in - ten ( 11 % ) recalls John McCain .
As many Republicans ( 76 % ) as Democrats ( 80 % ) cite Obama as the candidate they have heard most about in the news recently .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s agenda .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage were collected from July 28 – August 3 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected August 1 - 4 from a nationally representative sample of 1,004 adults .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Sunday through Friday ) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

BIGFOOT BODY FOUND – EVIDENCE AND DNA DETAILS TO BE PRESENTED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY , AUGUST 15th
FROM 12 N00N TO 1:00 PM AT THE CABANA HOTEL - PALO ALTO IN PALO ALTO , CALIFORNIA
A body that may very well be the body of the creature commonly known as “ Bigfoot ” has been found in the woods in northern Georgia .
DNA evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented in a press conference on Friday , August 15th from 12 Noon to 1:00 pm at the Cabana Hotel - Palo Alto at 4290 El Camino Real in Palo Alto , California , 94306 .
The press conference will not be open to the public .
It will only be open to credentialed members of the press .
Here are some of the vital statistics on the “ Bigfoot ” body :
* The creature is seven feet seven inches tall .
* It weighs over five hundred pounds .
* The creature looks like it is part human and part ape - like .
* It is male .
* It has reddish hair and blackish - grey eyes .
* It has two arms and two legs , and five fingers on each hand and
five toes on each foot .
* The feet are flat and similar to human feet .
* Its footprint is sixteen and three - quarters inches long and five and three - quarters inches wide at the heel .
* From the palm of the hand to the tip of the middle finger , its hands are
eleven and three - quarters inches long and six and one - quarter inches wide .
* The creatures walk upright .
( Several of them were sighted on the same day that the body was found . )
* The teeth are more human - like than ape - like .
* DNA tests are currently being done and the current DNA and photo evidence will be presented at the press conference on Friday , August 15th .
The creature was found by Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer ( residents of Georgia ) in the woods in northern Georgia .
( The exact location is being kept secret to protect the creatures . )
Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer will be flying in from Georgia to be at the press conference .
Also present at the press conference will be Tom Biscardi , CEO of Searching for Bigfoot , Inc .
Whitton is a Clayton County , Georgia , police officer , who is currently on administrative leave after being wounded in the course of duty pursuing an alleged felon .
Dyer is a former correctional officer .
Whitton and Dyer are co-owners of bigfoottracker.com and Bigfoot Global LLC. , a company that offers Bigfoot expeditions .
Whitton and Dyer are working with Bigfoot hunter , Tom Biscardi , and Biscardi ’s Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. , to present and conduct the scientific study of the evidence and information on this body .
A few weeks ago , Whitton and Dyer announced the finding of the body on the “ Squatch Detective ” radio show , an internet based radio show hosted by Steve Kulls .
While on that show , the commentator asked Rick Dyer “ Would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body ? ”
Dyer replied , “ The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was ‘ the real Bigfoot Hunter , ’ Tom Biscardi . ”
The next day , the producer of the Squatch Detective show contacted Biscardi with pertinent information on how to contact Dyer and Whitton .
Extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist , an anthropologist , a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location .
The studies will be carefully documented and the findings will be released to the world , according to Biscardi .
Biscardi is known as “ the real Bigfoot Hunter ” because of his extensive investigations out in the field .
He has been searching for Bigfoot since 1971 and over the past several years , he has been criss - crossing the United States and Canada tracking down the hottest leads on Bigfoot sightings .
Videography on the studies will be done under the supervision of Scott Davis , an independent producer and owner of TV Biz Productions in Phoenix , Arizona .
Currently , Tom Biscardi and his Searching for Bigfoot Team , in conjunction with Bigfoot Global LLC. , are preparing to capture another of these creatures alive .
That expedition will start very soon .
The dates and the locations are being kept confidential .
The body that is currently being studied is being referred to as the “ RICKMAT ” creature , a name derived from the names of Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton .
[ Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman recommends the term “ Georgia Gorilla ” be used to remove any taint of ego from the discovery , and so the general public , media , and science will have a comfortable moniker until a formal zoological name may be bestowed . ]
Last year , a film that Biscardi produced about his investigations , called “ Bigfoot Lives , ” won first place in the Documentary category at the Pocono Mountains Film Festival .
Biscardi also hosts a Bigfoot oriented internet radio show that can be heard on Wednesday nights from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm PDT at www.bigfootliveradioshow.com.
The show is heard in over thirty countries .
Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. has exclusive rights to all publishing rights , photo rights , television and film rights , production and distribution rights and other commercial opportunities related to the discovery and findings regarding this body and these creatures .
Interested parties may contact Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. , in writing , at their mailing address , 1134 Crane St. , Suite 216 , Menlo Park , California 94025 .

I ca n’t say I ’m a fan of flying , to be honest I ’m terrified of airplanes but if I simply have to get on an airplane , I ’d prefer it to be a decent - looking one .
And that definitely excludes anyone of these odd - looking flying machines .
Sure some of them are designed this way to facilitate merchandise transport , but this does not make them any prettier .

WITH oil prices at their present highs and Iraq at last making tentative progress towards stability , the last thing anyone wants to hear is that conditions in the Middle East could be about to take an abrupt turn for the worse .
Unfortunately , they could .
Recent weeks have brought a spike in chatter about the prospect of an Israeli military strike on Iran 's nuclear installations .
Israel has conducted ostentatious long - range air exercises over the Mediterranean , and one former chief of staff has called an attack inevitable if Iran continues its nuclear work .
This noise might be just a bluff designed to signal to Iran that it would be wise to stop enriching uranium , as the United Nations Security Council ordered it to a full two years ago .
Then again , it might not .
Until recently , fears of an Israeli or American attack on Iran had been receding .
The prospect of an American strike diminished after America 's intelligence services published their inconvenient finding last December that Iran had stopped trying to design a nuclear weapon in 2003 .
At the same time , diplomats have been able to point to the sort of progress diplomats point to : a series of Security Council resolutions , supported by Russia and China as well as the West , telling Iran to stop its uranium - enriching centrifuges .
Sanctions have been applied as well : in the latest , the European Union decided this week to freeze the assets of Iran 's biggest bank , Bank Melli .
Slowly but surely , you might conclude , the normal tools of diplomacy are being brought to bear , removing the need for anything worse .
Besides , in November Americans may elect Barack Obama as president .
Does n't he promise to sort out Iran by means of direct talks at the highest level , a necessary step that George Bush could never quite bring himself to take ?
If those were your reasons for ceasing to worry , think again .
Despite that American intelligence finding , neither Israel nor many other governments believe that Iran has given up its interest in nuclear weapons .
Yes , the UN has passed resolutions and imposed some mild sanctions , but Iran has spent two years disregarding them , continuing to spin its centrifuges and to call for the destruction of Israel .
It may well be true that Mr Bush is disinclined to bomb Iran now that he is a lame duck , but the possible advent of a President Obama might just make Israel more inclined to do so itself .
As the hawkish John Bolton , a former Bush administration official , said this week , Israel may think the best time to attack would be during America 's presidential transition — too late to be accused of influencing the election and before needing a new president 's green light .
Do n't do it
Such an attack would be a mistake .
Even if it did not turn the region into a “ fireball ” , as Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the world 's nuclear watchdog , has predicted , it would certainly provoke retaliation .
Given Iran 's size and sophistication , it would at best delay rather than end whatever plans the Iranians have to become a nuclear military power .
Even if Iran did get the bomb , it would probably not use it for fear of Israel 's bigger , existing stockpile .
And in the ( admittedly improbable ) event that Iran is telling the truth when it denies having any such ambition , nothing would change its mind faster than an Israeli strike .
The trouble is , this logic looks different from Tel Aviv .
Given their history , a lot of Israelis will run almost any risk to prevent a state that calls repeatedly for their own state 's destruction from acquiring the wherewithal to bring that end about .
Till now , the world has talked a lot and applied some modest sanctions to stop Iran 's dash to enrich uranium .
It is time to apply much tougher ones , in the hope that it is not already too late .
In the United States , the primary fuel used for electricity generation is coal , at 49 % of electricity production .
Natural gas follows at 22 % ; nuclear at 19 % ; hydroelectric at 6 % , and petroleum at 1.6 % .
The newer renewables are all quite small : wood at 0.93 % ; wind at .77 % ; waste at .41 % ; and solar ( for electricity generation ) at 0.01 % .
It seems to me that there is likely to be a very short path from petroleum shortages to electricity shortages .
There are a lot of issues involved , from the fact that the fuels used in electricity production are themselves dependent on petroleum for their extraction and transportation , to the current state of the US electricity infrastructure , to the impact of peak oil on debt financing .
I have written about most of these issues before , but since the petroleum / electricity link is such an important one , I thought I would devote an article to putting the pieces together .
I see a number of reasons why there is likely to be a very short path from petroleum shortages to electricity shortages :
1 . All of the fuels used today for electricity generation are dependent to some extent on petroleum for their production and transport .
Unless there is an amazingly good allocation system , once there is a shortage of oil , of say , 20 % , it is going to start affecting electricity production , because the oil deficit will start affecting fuels used for electricity production .
Electrical fuel dependence on petroleum Coal .
Surface mining uses large diesel powered machinery .
Below ground mining almost certainly uses some diesel powered equipment , since diesel is so portable .
Workers in mines use gasoline or diesel fuel to get to work .
Transportation of coal is primarily by rail and barge , and these are petroleum powered in the US .
Natural gas .
Drilling rigs are often powered by diesel fuel .
Workers who visit wells to make adjustments drive trucks that use diesel or gasoline .
Roads to the wells are maintained using diesel operated equipment .
In arid places like Wyoming , the food that workers eat needs to be shipped long distances .
Uranium .
Uranium mining is very volume - intensive , because it is only available in low concentrations .
Earth - movers used to mine uranium use diesel fuel ; the process for separating out the ore from the waste most likely uses petroleum as well .
Once the ore is mined and suitably processed , it must be transported to the ultimate location , again using some form of petroleum as fuel .
Petroleum .
If petroleum itself is used as a fuel , there is clearly a direct link between petroleum shortages and electricity shortages .
In the US , petroleum is primarily used in Hawaii ( since it is a group of islands ) and for backup generation .
Outside the US , there are many countries that use oil for power generation because oil is easy to transport and plants powered by petroleum are easy to build .
Wood or switchgrass .
If biomass is used as a fuel , it must be harvested and transported to the place where it will be used .
Diesel operated trucks and other equipment are currently used for this purpose .
Wind turbines .
Wind turbines are very large .
Roads must be maintained to transport the equipment to the site where it is used .
Trucks are needed when maintenance is performed .
If the turbines are located offshore , boats are needed for maintenance .
Wind turbines must be serviced regularly because of wear and tear on the gearbox .
Hydroelectric .
Needs less petroleum inputs than most .
Petroleum is used for maintaining the transmission lines to the electrical power plant ; for replacing parts of the hydroelectric dam when they wear out , and for dredging out the area behind the dam when it gets filled with silt .
Solar power generation .
Today , solar generates only 0.01 % of grid electric power .
If solar power stations are situated in the desert to produce electrical power for the grid , oil is needed to transport the equipment to the desert location , and to bring food for the workers .
Oil is needed in the initial manufacture of the equipments , and for building and maintaining transmission lines .
Geothermal .
Less oil dependent than most .
Oil is needed in building the initial station , for making and transporting replacement parts , and for maintaining electrical transmission lines from the plant .
2 . If there is a shortage of oil , people will tend to substitute other fuels for petroleum .
This substitution is likely to lead to other shortages .
We have already seen how a plan to use biofuels as a substitute for gasoline can result in higher food prices .
There has been considerable discussion of using cellulosic ethanol as a liquid fuel .
If wood and other biomass are used to produce cellulosic ethanol , there are likely to be shortages of these fuels for powering electric generation .
Petroleum , coal , natural gas and nuclear are used for electricity generation around the world .
Once petroleum is high priced or unavailable , power companies are likely to switch to other forms of electricity generation , at least for their new power plants .
Because of this , it is likely to become increasingly difficult to buy uranium , coal , and natural gas for use in power plants .
T. Boone Pickens and others have talked about using natural gas as a transportation fuel .
This is also likely to put pressure on available natural gas supply for electricity .
Even apart from the substitution issue , many forecasts say that other fossil fuels will peak not many years after petroleum supply peaks .

3 . Our electrical infrastructure is very dependent on petroleum inputs .
Our electrical infrastructure includes transmission lines and transformers , among other things .
Many components of the transmission systems are reaching the ends of their normal life spans , and will need replacement in the next few years .
Outages are also expected because of storms .
In order to service these transmission lines and generators , replacement transmission lines and generators much be built and transported to the location where they are needed .
Workers need trucks and roads to do the servicing .
All of this requires considerable petroleum use .
If transmission lines are to be expanded because of addition of new wind or solar or nuclear plants , this also requires petroleum .
4 . There is a substantial chance that petroleum products available will suddenly decline by a large percentage ( more than 20 % ) , rather than just the small annual increment one might expect that results from the world decline in oil production .
There are really two issues with oil availability -- the worldwide decline , expected to begin in the next few years , and a decline in the US ability to import petroleum products .
Of the two , the decline in the US ability to import petroleum products is probably the bigger issue .
We have lived in a world where the United States uses 24 % of the world 's petroleum products for such a long that it seems like this is the natural order of things .
The problem is that we are no longer exporting very many goods to pay for this oil , and our balance of payments situation is getting worse and worse .
Our financial situation is worsening .
There is a substantial chance that the value of the dollar will drop sufficiently that we will not be able to afford to continue our big share of world oil supply .
There are other ways that the amount of oil we are able to buy might decline , also .
Geopolitical forces may eliminate some production , or may change the amount we are able to purchase in the open market .
5 . Shortages of petroleum products are likely to occur in unexpectedly , in places where it hurts the economy .
In an ideal situation , shortages of petroleum products will only affect consumption in places that it will have no negative impacts elsewhere in the economy -- for example , will not reduce natural gas production , or will not affect our ability to produce food and water , and transport it to those who need it .
In practice , it would be very difficult to design such a system .
Diesel is likely to be in especially short supply , because it is used for so many commercial and industrial purposes .
If its use is allocated based on who is able to pay the most , there is no reason to believe that those who will make the best use of the oil will receive it .
For example , many small truckers who are involved with food delivery are likely to be priced out of the system .
If oil use is allocated by a governmental organization , they may do a bit better , but it still will be very difficult to get the oil to the those who will make the best use of it .
Supply chains are so long and complicated that it is difficult to foresee what impact a shortage for one particular user will have , as it works its way through the system .
Even with the best intentions , allocation schemes designed by government agencies are likely to undersupply users who are critical to the system .
As a practical matter , I think that what we will see is a lot of local outages , based on logistical issues .
People at the end of the pipeline will find that there is not enough oil left by the time it gets to them .
A particular refinery will not be able to get enough oil , and the people in the area of the refinery will discover themselves without enough gasoline and diesel , because the refinery was not able to purchase adequate fuel , or was not able to make repairs after an accident , because of missing parts .
A pipeline operator ( or refinery ) will go bankrupt , and there will be no substitute available .
We have already seen unplanned outages in North Dakota and Winnipeg .
There were also problems with oil shortages after Hurricane Katrina hit .
The problem in this situation was electrical outages along the Colonial Pipeline .
In order to get the pipeline moving again , it was necessary to bring generators to the pipeline and use oil from the pipeline to generate electricity to operate the pumps .
6 . With increased petroleum shortages , we should expect more and more gaps in petroleum supply .
If these gaps become widespread , they are likely to trigger further loss in electrical fuels .
Suppose that petroleum products become unavailable in Appalachia , because of a pipeline problem .
This could affect the production of coal .
If there is an outage in Wyoming , it could affect the production of both coal and natural gas .
A gap in petroleum supply in the New York City area could bring all kinds of businesses to a sudden stop , and this could lead to all kinds of indirect impacts , which ripple from one sector of the economy through to other sectors of the economy .
7 . If we start having electric supply disruptions , these disruptions are likely to start chain reactions of disruptions of other types .
I mentioned earlier the problem with the Colonial Pipeline after Katrina , because of electrical outages .
Most oil pipelines and many natural gas pipelines use electricity to pump the product .
Gas stations also use electricity to pump gasoline .
Because of these connections , an area without electric power is likely to find itself without petroleum products as well , in a fairly short a time period .
If oil is not available in an area , industrial agriculture in the area is likely to cease .
Truckers may not be willing to make deliveries , if their trucks cannot get refueled .
8 . While it is theoretically possible to get around a lot of oil shortage problems by building new infrastructure , as a practical matter this is not likely to work , because of timing , the enormity of the project , and our current financial problems .
Theoretically , there are a lot of things one could do to circumvent oil shortages .
One could build electric cars for transportation .
One could build electric powered machines to mine uranium .
One could replace our current truck transportation with much expanded railroad transportation .
Even in the best of times , it would be a monumental undertaking to make a transformation from one type of infrastructure to another .
It would likely take a very long time -- certainly more than 20 years , based on the Hirsch Report .
With our current financial situation , it seems like such a transformation is pretty much out of the question .
We have been reading recently about the fact that lenders are becoming less and less willing to make loans .
This will make financing new infrastructure more difficult .
In the future , the US governments and state governments are likely to be in poorer and poorer financial condition , based on my analysis of the US current financial situation .
Local governments will find their revenues dropping as house prices drop .
The federal government will find itself increasingly asked to cover debt shortfalls of a lot of different organizations ( Fannie and Freddie , banks , insurance companies , pension funds , airlines , auto manufacturers ) .
This will leave little left over for building new infrastructure .
Because of all of the foregoing issues , I expect that we will encounter electrical difficulties within twenty years .
The timeperiod may even be much shorter than this ..
Any kind of change we want to make to the country 's infrastructure to better prepare us for the future will take a very long time -- most likely 30 to 50 years .
Perhaps , with great effort , we could make a transformation in 20 years .
The issue I see is that if we know we are very likely to have electrical difficulties within twenty years , it does not make sense to start a transformation to a more electrical society .
For example , if we start building a lot of electric trains , we are likely to discover that that we do n't have the electricity to operate them when they get built .
It seems like we would better off figuring out what resource base is likely to be available thirty to fifty years from now , and gearing our efforts accordingly .
It seems to me that the model we should be envisioning for future electric supply is local electric supply .
People talk about making food production more local .
I think that in the long run , whatever electricity production we have will be primarily local .
It seems to me that much hydroelectric power can continue for many years , if we make plans to maintain it .
We may also be able to maintain geothermal power and power from photovoltaic cells , if the PV cells have a sufficiently long lifespan .
There are likely to be many parts of the country without electricity .
I doubt that coal - fired power stations will still be available , except possibly in areas where coal is produced .
( If there is a shortage , those closest to where it is produced are likely to get the output . )
Electricity from natural gas may be available near natural gas supplies .
Nuclear will probably not be available , because of all of the issues of mining and importing .
Back - up batteries are not likely to be available for PV or other use .
All of these have very long supply chains , and these are likely to be broken as electric outages become more common .
We need to be looking closely at what is really feasible , and aiming for that level .
With the limited amount of electricity available from local production , our ability to manufacture things will be much reduced .
We will need to prioritize what we do manufacture carefully , so as to have the basics covered -- food , clothing , heating , and basic transportation .
I doubt we will be able to count on imports for very much of our basic needs .
It seems to me that we should be analyzing the situation closely , and developing plans that will work , based on what has worked in the past .
We should be thinking about raising more draft animals and building small windmills to pump water .
We should be thinking about building bicycles , if we can get all of the necessary components locally sourced .
We should be thinking about what infrastructure is really essential ( fresh water , hydroelectric dams , geothermal electricity , basic roads ) , and taking steps to maintain it .
I think the danger is aiming too high , and ending up with virtually nothing that works .

The U.S. military is looking for a contractor to patrol cyberspace , watching for warning signs of forthcoming terrorist attacks or other hostile activity on the Web .
“ If someone wants to blow us up , we want to know about it , ” Robert Hembrook , the deputy intelligence chief of the U.S. Army ’s Fifth Signal Command in Mannheim , Germany , told United Press International .
In a solicitation posted on the Web last week , the command said it was looking for a contractor to provide “ Internet awareness services ” to support “ force protection ” — the term of art for the security of U.S. military installations and personnel .
( Article continues below )
“ The purpose of the services will be to identify and assess stated and implied threat , antipathy , unrest and other contextual data relating to selected Internet domains , ” says the solicitation .
Hembrook was tight - lipped about the proposal .
“ The more we talk about it , the less effective it will be , ” he said .
“ If we did n’t have to put it out in public ( to make the contract award ) , we would n’t have . ”
He would not comment on the kinds of Internet sites the contractor would be directed to look at but acknowledged it would “ not ( be ) far off ” to assume violent Islamic extremists would be at the top of the list .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The solicitation says the successful contractor will “ analyze various Web pages , chat rooms , blogs and other Internet domains to aggregate and assess data of interest , ” adding , “ The contractor will prioritize foreign - language domains that relate to specific areas of concern … ( and ) will also identify new Internet domains ” that might relate to “ specific local requirements ” of the command .
Officials were keen to stress the contract covered only information that could be found by anyone with a computer and Internet connection .

How children respond to the smell of alcoholic beverages is related to their mothers ' reasons for drinking , according to a new study from the Monell Chemical Senses Center .
When asked to choose between the odor of beer and an unpleasant odor , children of mothers classified as ' Escape drinkers ' were more likely than children of Non-escape drinkers to choose the unpleasant odor .
" Children 's responses to odors provide us with a window into their emotions , " says study lead author Julie Mennella , PhD , a Monell biopsychologist .
" When given a choice between beer and pyridine -- the smell of rotten eggs -- children of mothers who drink to relieve tension and worry choose pyridine as smelling better .
That 's pretty powerful . "
In the study , which appears in the journal Alcohol , 145 children between the ages of 5 and 8 years were presented with seven pairs of odors .
One of the odors was always beer ; the others were bubblegum , chocolate , cola , coffee , green tea , pyridine , and cigarette smoke .
For each pair , the children indicated which odor they liked better .
Mennella notes that because odor information travels directly to areas of the brain that deal with non-verbal aspects of emotion and memory , studying children 's responses to odors provides insights into their emotional worlds .
" Like adults , children are not very good at identifying odors , " she says .
" However , they are good at telling us whether they like an odor or not .
This study shows that whether they like the odor of beer depends not just on how often their mother drinks , but on why she drinks . "
The children 's mothers completed a questionnaire about their drinking habits , including their reasons for drinking ; 35 were classified as ' Escape drinkers , ' based on their indicating having at least two escape reasons for drinking .
These included : helps to relax , need when tense and nervous , helps to cheer up when in a bad mood , helps to forget worries , and helps to forget everything .
Mothers ' reasons for drinking influenced how children responded to the odor of beer .
Relative to children of Non-escape drinkers , children whose mothers were Escape drinkers showed greater dislike for the odor of beer , even when beer was compared with unpleasant odors such as pyridine and cigarette smoke .
Questionnaires also revealed that Escape drinkers drink more often than Non-escape drinkers .
Because of this , children of Escape drinkers were exposed to alcohol odors more often .
These children also experienced alcohol in a different emotional context , as the questionnaires revealed that their mothers were more tense and more likely to worry and feel guilty about their drinking .
" Even before their first taste , young children are learning about alcohol and about why their parents drink .
They do this by seeing people drink and hearing them talk about it , " says Mennella .
" Our findings show that children are also processing the smell of alcohol with the emotional reasons their mothers , and perhaps fathers , drink . "
Mennella comments that additional research is needed to determine whether children who dislike the odor of alcohol and experience it in a negative emotional context are more or less likely as adolescents or adults to seek out alcohol when stressed .
Also contributing to the study was Catherine Forestell , PhD , currently at the College of William and Mary .
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ( NIH ) and the Pennsylvania Department of Health .
The Pennsylvania Department of Health specifically disclaims responsibility for any analyses , interpretations , or conclusions .
Salim Ahmed Hamdan was found guilty of providing material support for terrorism at a Guantánamo military commission today .
Hamdan 's guilt was never in doubt , but it is rather surprising that the prosecution was unable to persuade a simple majority of the military jurors that Hamdan participated in a conspiracy to murder American soldiers , for which he was also charged .
That failure underscores the fact that we learned more during this trial about the feebleness and bankruptcy of the Bush administration 's fight against terrorism than we did about Salim Ahmed Hamdan or al - Qaida .
Hamdan was Osama bin Laden 's driver , a fact he never denied .
It would have been an open and shut case of material support for terrorism in federal court .
If the Bush administration had chosen that path , Hamdan would have been safely locked away years ago .
But no , the Bush administration chose to create a system of military commissions to pursue war crimes charges against suspected al - Qaida terrorists , because they were highly valued intelligence assets and the procedures of regular criminal trials were too restrictive to make a case against these battlefield detainees .
After nearly seven years , we have the first example of results , and it 's not good .
Osama bin Laden 's driver is clearly a highly - prized intelligence asset who likely possessed invaluable information about the movements and perhaps even the whereabouts of bin Laden and other senior al - Qaida figures .
This is exactly the situation envisioned when the military commission system was created .
No lawyers would get in the way of interrogations .
No deals would be sought to provide information in exchange for leniency .
So what happened ?
During his interrogation , Hamdan made a serious offer of assistance , and the government did n't do anything about it .
We do n't know precisely what this offer entailed because that portion of the government 's case was presented to the jury in secret .
But we do know that Hamdan 's attorney reminded the jurors of the offer and the government 's subsequent inaction during his closing argument .
It seems likely that this was a very serious offer , probably to help to track down Hamdan 's former boss , if the defence wanted to remind the jurors about something in the prosecution 's case .
The whole point of keeping people like Hamdan out of the criminal system was to gather intelligence like this .
Yet when presented with an offer of assistance from Osama bin Laden 's former driver , they botched it .
The more permissive rules and procedures for the commissions is what has caused numerous courts to rule the commissions unlawful .
No US court has yet to determine whether this latest iteration meets the standards of American law , meaning that Hamdan 's and any other convictions in the commissions could be invalidated some time in the future .
These new rules have also created the perverse situation of putting US judges in the position of having to decide how much torture it too much .
The judge in Hamdan 's case ruled that some of Hamdan 's statements were inadmissible because they were made in " highly coercive " conditions , but others were allowed because they were merely " coercive " .
So now that we have wound our way through various euphemisms to find an acceptable level of torture , what was the result in the trial ?
Hamdan was acquitted of the charge to which these coerced statements pertained .
So we went through this whole exercise for nothing .
The worst aspect of this entire process is that the Bush administration has simultaneously devalued the concept of a war crime and elevated al - Qaida terrorists to the status of warriors .
Charles Taylor is a war criminal .
Radovan Karadzic is a war criminal .
Salim Hamdan is a chauffeur .
He is clearly guilty of the crime of material support for terrorism .
But now he is a warrior , legitimising al - Qaida terrorists ' belief that they are waging a holy war against the United States and our allies .
The Bush administration turned an open and shut case into a seven - year odyssey that undermines the entire rationale for bypassing the criminal justice system in the first place .
Well done .
Ashcroft says he did n't necessarily disagree with torture memos RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Attorney General John Ashcroft said Thursday " it was not a hard decision " to withdraw Justice Department legal opinions that approved the use of harsh interrogation methods which critics say amount to torture .
Ashcroft , testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee , said he did not necessarily disagree with the conclusions of the two memos that were written in 2002 and 2003 but later rescinded .
But he said the legal reasoning behind both memos was flawed and needed to be corrected .
Earlier in the day , the American Civil Liberties Union called on Ashcroft to account for actions that happened when he was at the Justice Department .
 There have been too many questions left unanswered since the American people first learned that our government has authorized and engaged in torture ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
 John Ashcroft was the head of the Justice Department when the disastrous legal decisions to use torture were made .
He was also present at White House NSC principals meetings , where the use of torture was authorized .
The American people deserve to know what happened during those meetings and how this administration tried to undo decades of American law prohibiting torture .
At the heart of both the 2002 and 2003 opinions was a controversial definition of torture .
It said " only extreme acts " that cause pain similar in intensity to that caused by death or organ failure should be prohibited in the interrogations of terrorist suspects .
Ashcroft , who served as attorney general from 2001 to 2005 , had initially approved both memos .
They were written in part at least by former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo .
" It became apparent in the further examination of those opinions , when made in another timeframe , that there were matters of concerns that were brought to my opinion , " Ashcroft told lawmakers .
" It was not a hard decision for me . "
He added that he relied on his staff attorneys  and Yoo in particular  to give him sound legal advice .
Though the memos were later replaced with a new , narrower policy about what methods would be allowed , that did not " call into question any of the actual interrogation practices that the OLC had previously approved as legal , " Ashcroft said .
OLC stands for the Office of Legal Counsel , which writes the Justice Department 's legal opinions for the president .
" When I was informed about concerns regarding overly broad advice , the limits of which were never tested , I directed the OLC to correct it , " Ashcroft said .
Democrats peppered Ashcroft with questions about how often waterboarding was used by interrogators who were following the now - defunct legal opinions .
Waterboarding involves strapping a person down and pouring water over his or her cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
It has been traced back hundreds of years , to the Spanish Inquisition , and is condemned by nations around the world .
Critics call it a form of torture .
Ashcroft said he was aware of three times that interrogators waterboarded terror suspects .
He said he does not believe waterboarding , as it was then described by the CIA , amounted to torture .
The Bush administration maintains waterboarding was legal when it was used by CIA interrogators in 2002 and 2003 on top al - Qaida detainees Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
CIA Director Michael Hayden has said waterboarding was used , in part , because of widespread belief among U.S. intelligence officials that more catastrophic attacks were imminent .
Hayden banned waterboarding in CIA interrogations in 2006 .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has refused to publicly discuss whether waterboarding is currently legal since it is no longer used by CIA interrogators .

Its Unanimous : Banks Have Bottomed !
Very strange confluence of media coverage this morning on the banking sector .
All three major financial papers ( WSJ , NYT , Barron's ) have stories on the bottom of the banking sector :
Can you recall the last time 3 major media players all picked the bottom in a market or sector on the exact same day -- and were all proven correct ?
Perhaps the caveats are worth noting -- I found it interesting that all publications had some moderating hedges in place ( as opposed to some recent embarrassing cover articles ) .
As we noted early this week , we covered most of our shorts in the financials , and are now looking for a bounce play in these names .
However I remain unconvinced that Banks are now a good long term investment .
Why ?
The business model of Leverage and Capitalization is now kaput .
Its a new era of De-leveraging , and Re-capitalizing .
A long time ago , Banks were 3 - 6 - 3 spread players .
Pay your depositors 3 % , make loans at 6 % , be on the golf course at 3 pm .
But the end of Glass Steagell , and the mergers with investment banks , have put an end to that simple but profitible business .
For the past 10 years or so , we seen a model that involved taking on a lot of risk , then leveraging it up 25X , 35X , even 65X ( for Fannie ) .
Now that model has come unglued .
Banks of all types are unwinding risk , de-leveraging ( selling off assets held on borrowed money ) and raising capital .
This means that until a new model is developed , profits will be anemic and the shareholder capital structure is about to get wildly diluted .
Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , with its $ 6B cap , is seeking to raise $ 10B .
That will be enormously dilutive to both future earnings , and shareholder equity .
Remember that Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) capital raise ?
$ 6 Billion secondary priced at $ 28 with 8.75 % coupon and an % 18 conversion premium ?
The stock is now $ 19 m , the cap is $ 13.3B .
After the last debacle , good luck with future capital raises -- they are likely to be treated much more skeptically .
Is " the " bottom in ?
Well , it certainly looks like " a " bottom is in .
But longer term , this is a sector that is likely to have continued write downs , weak earnings prospects , and a whole lot more regulation and government supervision than it got away with in the past .
P/E compression may also be in the cards -- especially if we see some dividend cuts from some of the bigger houses .
Unless you have a decade long time horizon , does that make you want to rush out and own these things anytime soon ?
Me neither . . .

UPDATE : July 20 , 2008 8:23 pm
Several readers have noted that this is Barron 's 2nd attempt to tag a banking bottom in 4 months .
The last time out , they recommended as " cheap " Merrill ( MER ) , Citigroup ( C ) , UBS , HSBC ( HBC ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , Deutsche Bank ( DB ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) , Credit Agricole ( ACA ) Washington Mutual ( WM ) and Credit Suisse ( CS ) .
Ouch . . .

DIGG THIS
Could it be that our ruling elite has effectively transcended hypocrisy ?
As the aphorism informs us , hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue ; it is the product of a person ’s capacity for decent shame , the fig - leaf garment concealing one ’s naked corruption .
Shame being a vital precursor to hypocrisy , those who rule us — not only the politicians , but the banksters and image - molders as well — ca n’t be accused of hypocrisy .
This would be a bit like criticizing the fashion sense of somebody who ’s color - blind .
This does n’t mean , however , that they should be allowed an indulgence for the evil that they do .
Last week , during a brief digression in the ongoing efforts to socialize the losses suffered by the super - rich kleptocrats at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Congress conducted an authentic Orwellian hate - fest directed at “ super - rich ” people who had earned their money through legitimate enterprise .
The Fannie / Freddie nomenklatura built huge profits through the government - subsidized generation and “ securitization ” of bad mortgages and criminally corrupt bookkeeping .
Last week ’s hearings by the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations focused on people who had made large sums of money through honest , productive commercial activity — and then tried to preserve their honest earnings for their posterity by protecting it in bank accounts in Liechtenstein .
Congress and the ruling elite it serves are eagerly stealing everything in sight , through taxes , subsidies , and inflation .
But as last week ’s Senate hearings - cum - show trial illustrate , they are tuning up the machinery of mass hatred in anticipation of scapegoating authentic capitalists for the ongoing economic collapse .
The fault , we will be told , lies not with our corrupt and incurably profligate government , or the incorrigible official counterfeiters at the Federal Reserve , or the government - subsidized corporatist interests who are their clients — but rather those who greedily insist on keeping what they earn instead of paying their “ fair share ” in the name of the “ common good . ”
The calculation here is that a hate campaign of that sort can keep the public from noticing how the phrase “ common good ” always seems to refer to policies that confer benefits on one particular elite .
And it ’s quite likely that members of that elite have their own numbered accounts in places like Switzerland and Liechtenstein .
Which is probably another reason they ’re so eager to go after well - heeled people who are n’t part of their club .
As I have noted before , Liechtenstein , unlike the United States , is a relatively free country .
It is presided over with a gentle hand by Prince Hans - Adam II , rather than being ruled by a degenerate fascist oligarchy like the one entrenched in Washington .
Hans - Adam II is on record saying that a top tax rate higher than 6 % is “ tyrannical . ”
This puts him well ahead of any other political leader I can think of in pursuing the truth , which is that taxation is always and everywhere nothing but officially sanctioned theft .
As would be the case in any civilized country , Liechtenstein ’s banking secrecy laws were designed to protect the assets of depositors from the scrutiny of predators serving the ruling class .
Many foreign depositors have , in accordance with the sound and commendable laws of that estimable alpine country , set up foundations to protect their earnings from rapacious tax - gatherers in their own afflicted nations .
Unfortunately , a squalid little creature named Heinrich Kieber who had been a clerk at Liechtenstein ’s LGT Group , pilfered several CDs worth of data regarding foreign depositors from the United States and Europe .
Driven by a variant of the invidious impulses that sixty years ago would have led him to rat out those who protected Jews from the Gestapo , Kieber — as viscous as he is vicious — oozed into the offices of Germany ’s BND intelligence service and sold his stolen information for $ 7.3 million stolen at gunpoint from German taxpayers .
Kieber conducted similar transactions with ruling criminals in London , Paris , Rome , and Washington .
His information led to last week ’s hearings , chaired by the loathsome Senator Carl Levin ( D - Michigan ) , who — in the interests of “ bipartisanship ” — gave a prominent co-starring role to the even more repulsive Senator Norm Coleman ( R- Minnesota ) .
Kieber himself , who has been taken into the “ witness protection program , ” testified by way of a videotaped statement from a secret location .
The target of Comrade Levin ’s show trial was the reported $ 1.5 trillion cached by wealthy Americans in offshore accounts , including those in Liechtenstein , Switzerland ’s UBS , and elsewhere .
Those banks , Levin complained , had employed “ tricks ” that made it “ impossible for the Internal Revenue Service to follow the money , bring tax cheats to justice , and bring back into the US treasury the tens of billions of dollars owed to Uncle Sam . ”
Well , sure :
The banks that sought to protect the assets of Jews during WWII employed the same methods to protect the assets of honorable people from the contemporary tax gestapo , who are the true moral heirs of the Nazi officials who sought to seize the assets of persecuted Jews .
Impeding the efforts of criminals to steal wealth is not a “ crime , ” and it ’s interesting that Levin did n’t use that word to describe the “ tricks ” he protested .
And , if I can be permitted a brief digression , Levin ‘s statement that the money should be brought “ back to the US treasury ” in order to pay “ the tens of billions of dollars owed to Uncle Sam ” is a Marxist lie sandwiched between two crusty slices of chutzpah .
For the purposes of this discussion , we ’ll refer to the fraudulent fiat currency issued by the Fed as “ money . ”
Any quantity of “ money ” honestly earned does not belong to the Treasury ; it belongs to the individual or enterprise that earned it , until he or they decide to spend it for some purpose .
Accordingly , that money cannot go “ back ” to the Treasury , although it can be diverted there to be wasted on corrupt government undertakings of various kinds .
Furthermore , taxes are not “ owed ” to the federal government ; they are seized by the federal government .
One “ owes ” money to another party from whom he has received goods or services pursuant to a legitimate contract .
“ Contracts ” imposed through duress ( such as extortion pay - offs ) are illegitimate .
Those of us who pay taxes do so not because a legitimate contract exists between us and the Regime that extracts our wealth ; we do so because of a desire to stay out of prison , or to avoid violent death at the hands of the State ’s hired killers .
Levin is a nearly ideal representative of the parasite class .
His mind , or what passes for it , is entirely hostage to collectivist assumptions .
Just as a dog cannot discern colors , Levin ca n’t see anything amiss in extending official protection to a foreign criminal ( Kieber was convicted of fraud in Liechtenstein ) so he can testify against those who have done no injury to persons or property , or in treating foreign bank officers as if they were under Washington ’s jurisdiction by demanding that they testify before his committee .
All of this is being done , Levin insists , to bring “ tax cheats to justice . ”
Leaving aside , for the nonce , the fact that the word “ justice ” when uttered by the likes of Levin is like the word “ love ” in the mouth of a whore , the cruel fact is that tax avoidance is impossible for anyone who conducts business using the Federal Reserve ’s fraudulent scrip .
This brings us to one history - making admission offered last week by Fed Commissar Ben Bernanke beneath the avuncular but relentless cross-examination of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) during Bernanke ’s recent congressional testimony .
" Inflation is a tax , ” Rep .
Paul observed during his colloquy with Bernanke .
“ And if the Federal Reserve , and you as chairman , have this authority to increase the money supply arbitrarily , you ’re probably the biggest taxer in the country . ”
“ I could n’t agree with you more that inflation is a tax , ” admitted Bernanke , quickly seeking to evade responsibility by saying that “ inflation currently is too high . ”
The criminal syndicate over which Bernanke presides imposes taxation without representation or accountability .
Furthermore , it exports that inflation world - wide , thanks to the fact that the instrument of debt the Fed calls the “ dollar ” is the world ’s reserve currency .
This means that nearly everyone who uses the dollar to conduct business is paying the tax called inflation .
This is a unique form of withholding , in that the Fed steals an increment of value from each dollar before it ends up in the hands or accounts of private actors in the economy .
Where a government exercises the power to tax through inflation , no other taxes are “ necessary , ” including the income tax .
Furthermore , where governments tax through inflation , no tax evasion is possible , as long as people conduct business in that adulterated currency .
The redoubtable G. Edward Griffin points out that former Fed Chairman Beardsley Ruml admitted that , because of the Fed ’s ability to tax via inflation , “ Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete ” — the title of an essay Ruml published in the January 1946 issue of American Affairs .
As Ruml wrote , “ given control of a central banking system and an incontrovertible currency [ that is , a fiat currency not backed by gold ] , a sovereign national government is finally free of money worries and need no longer levy taxes for the purpose of providing itself with revenue .
All taxation , therefore , should be regarded from the point of view of social and economic consequences . ” ( Emphasis added . )
Thus , where Washington is concerned , taxation exists purely for the purpose of social manipulation through vulgar redistribution of wealth , not to pay the operating costs of government .
And as carried out by the IRS , taxation is an instrument of intimidation and terror used to compel social conformity .
By keeping their money in dollars , or any currency “ pegged ” to the dollar , so - called “ tax cheats ” are n’t evading taxes .
They , like the rest of us , are being taxed through the Fed ’s relentless inflation .
Their only hope to evade being taxed by the Fed would be to take the advice offered by Jim Rogers last fall :
Get out of dollar - denominated assets entirely .
There are only two ways to acquire wealth :
It can be earned through mutually beneficial voluntary action , or it can be stolen through force and fraud .
Any effort to acquire wealth that involves any degree of force or fraud is theft .
Senator Levin and his comrades , who are preparing to bail out the politically favored thieves running Fannie and Freddie , spent many taxpayer - funded hours last week dilating upon the supposed iniquity of those “ super - rich ” Americans who seek to protect what they earn from people whose professional lives are nothing but one prolonged exercise in theft .
It would avail nothing to point out such hypocrisy to Levin and his ilk ; they can no more feel honest shame than a chimpanzee can compose a cantata .

White men could be legally blocked from getting jobs under new anti-discrimination laws being considered by Labour .
Employers would be able to give jobs to women or ethnic minority candidates in preference to other applicants , under the plans unveiled by equalities minister Harriet Harman .
If two candidates were equally qualified for a position , employers would be able to reject the white person or the man in favour of a black person or a woman .
But the plans are due to be criticised by business leaders and last night , even equalities campaigners expressed doubt .
Miss Harman - known as Harriet Harperson for her politically correct views - wants to look at how to bring U.S. - style " positive action " to Britain , saying it is vital to ensure the workforce more accurately reflects the demographic make - up of the population .
She says too many women and people from ethnic minorities are being held back because they cannot break through the " glass ceiling " .
The new laws would only come into play where two equally qualified candidates had applied for the same post , allowing the employer to tip the balance in favour of minority candidates .
Businesses would not be compelled to favour the female or black candidate but the law would be changed to ensure they could not be sued for turning down a white man .
The proposals would also allow universities to select more female students in male - dominated subjects such as science .
But equal rights campaigners said the new rules would have a limited effect , and that action should be targeted on equal pay .
Katherine Rake of the Fawcett Society , which campaigns on equal pay , said : " How you would really hold that up in a court of law is not clear and , if it is n't , employers may be reluctant to use it .
" You are probably talking about a handful of cases . "
The present law says employers are allowed to say they welcome applications from minority candidates , and they are allowed to promote jobs to specific groups .
Theresa May , Conservative spokesperson for women , said : " One of the real problems facing women today is the gender pay gap .
" If Harriet Harman really wants to help women in the work place she should strengthen the existing laws on equal pay .
We have recently put forward proposals to do just that and our proposals would have a real impact on women 's lives . "
A spokesman for Harriet Harman said : " This is under discussion but no decisions have yet been made . "
The changes would be included in the new equalities Bill , which will also give new rights to mothers to breast - feed in public .
Golf clubs would have to give female players equal access .
Miss Harman also wants to force companies to conduct " pay audits " , reviewing staff salaries to ensure they are not underpaying women .
But she is facing opposition from within the Cabinet on this from ministers who are worried about antagonising business yet further .
Last year Miss Harman called for all - black shortlists in constituencies with high ethnic - minority populations .
She said that unless action was taken , it would take decades for the make - up of the Commons to accurately reflect the make - up of British society .
But the plan immediately came under attack from ethnic minority MPs on the Labour backbenchers - saying black people should be selected on merit .
Spaces in 10.5.3
Spaces was one of the new features in Leopard I was most excited about , but I found the actual implementation unusable .
Henry Story wrote a fine description of the problems with Spaces in 10.5.0 .
When I linked to his critique , I wrote :
I ’ve tried to love Spaces but can’t , because I want to divide spaces into tasks , and some apps , like my web browser , need to have windows in every space .
If I ’m in , say , space 3 and Command - Tab to Safari , I want Safari to activate in my current space , not jump me to whichever space contains the frontmost Safari window .
In short , Spaces seems designed for app partitioning , not task partitioning .
Take , for example , the task of writing this article .
What I want to be able to do with Spaces is dedicate one space solely to the task .
I want Safari windows pertaining to any web pages related to the article , and MarsEdit and BBEdit windows for the article itself .
But I do n’t want all open Safari , MarsEdit , and BBEdit windows in this space — I only want those pertaining to the article .
There was simply no way to make this work in 10.5.0 through 10.5.2 ; you could get the windows grouped this way , but you ’d keep getting switched to another space when what you wanted to do was switch to another app within the current space .
Spaces really only seemed suited to putting all of any given app ’s windows in a particular space ( or making all an app ’s windows visible in all spaces ) .
This is n’t to say Spaces was n’t usable , only that it was n’t usable for grouping a few windows from different apps together in one Space .
This week ’s release of 10.5.3 brought good news :
Apple has addressed this problem with a few seemingly minor changes to Spaces .
Apple ’s release notes for 10.5.3 hint at the changes , but do n’t explain them in any detail :
Spaces Resolves an issue in which switching to a different space and returning back to the original space may reorder the application windows with a different active window .
Resolves an issue in which activating an application from the Dock switches to a different space , even if there is a window for that application in the current space .
Fixes an issue in which Command - Tab may incorrectly switch to a new space .
Addresses reliability issues with Spaces when syncing preferences over .
Mac .
Some of these are simply bug fixes .
Clearly , for example , switching between spaces should n’t have changed the window ordering within a space .
But some of these describe new behavior which only kicks in if you turn off a new - to - 10.5.3 checkbox in the Spaces panel in System Preferences :
“ When switching to an application , switch to a space with open windows for the application ” .
By default , it ’s checked , which means app switching under Spaces remains much the same as it was on 10.5.0 – 10.5.2 .
For example , let ’s say you have two spaces , with one or more Safari windows in space 1 , and no Safari windows in space 2 .
If you ’re in space 2 and activate Safari — whether by clicking the Dock icon , Command - Tabbing , or opening a link in some other app ’s window in space 2 , then Spaces will jump you to space 1 , where there are already open Safari windows .
If you turn this new checkbox off , however , activating an app , even one that has no windows in the current space , will not jump you to another space .
Once you ’re in a space , you stay there until you explicitly switch spaces , not just switch apps .
This makes all the difference in the world for the way I , and others , want to use Spaces .
This is a major change to the way Spaces works , but the checkbox label does n’t exactly make it clear .
( I do n’t have a better label to suggest ; it ’s a tough feature to describe in the length of a checkbox label . )
Sadly , the help content for Spaces does not seem to have been updated to even mention this checkbox , let alone describe what it does .
One non-obvious detail is that you can switch to another space by clicking an app ’s Dock icon multiple times .
If you click a running app ’s Dock icon once , that app will activate in the current space .
If it does n’t have any open windows in the current space , it will activate without creating a new untitled window .
But if you click that same app ’s
Dock icon again , you ’ll jump to the next space in which that app does have an open window .
If the app has open windows spread across multiple spaces , subsequent clicks on its Dock icon will cycle through those spaces .
So if you have four total spaces , with Safari windows in spaces 1 and 3 , you can repeatedly click Safari ’s icon in the Dock to cycle between spaces 1 and 3 .
If you ’re starting in space 2 or 4 , clicking Safari ’s Dock icon once will activate Safari in that space but without a window .
Using Command - Tab to switch between apps , you will never automatically switch to another space when this new “ switching ” checkbox is turned off .
( It ’d be nice if the Command - Tab window provided some sort of indication for which apps have open windows in the current space . )
I also ran into an issue specific to web browsers .
In the General tab of Safari ’s preferences window , you can specify whether links from other applications open in a new Safari window or in a new tab in the frontmost existing Safari window .
I had been using the “ in a new tab ” option .
However , with this new Spaces feature , opening a link from another app in a space that has no Safari windows will jump you to the next space that does have one .
Ideally , I ’d like to see Safari create a new window in the current space in this situation , but as it stands , changing Safari ’s preference to open links in a new window is good enough .
( This same thing applies to other tabbed web browsers , such as Firefox and Camino . )
In short , if you were happy with the way Spaces worked through 10.5.2 , you should n’t notice any changes , because the default behavior remains the same in 10.5.3 .
But if , like me , Spaces drove you nuts by switching between spaces when you only wanted to switch between apps within the current space , give it another shot after turning this new checkbox off .
Kudos to the Spaces team .
Lastly , I should mention that I had problems getting this new feature to work at all .
After upgrading to 10.5.3 and seeing the Spaces - related changes in the release notes , I tried it out .
Toggling the new checkbox made no difference for me , however — I got the same old “ jump to another space when switching apps ” behavior either way .
I solved the problem by trashing my com.apple.dock.
plist preferences file ( which , since Spaces is controlled by the Dock , is where most Spaces - related prefs seem to be stored ) .
After logging out and logging back in , the new checkbox worked perfectly .
( Alert was repeated to broaden distribution )
ABUJA , Aug 6 ( Reuters ) - Oil companies have repaired two major Nigerian pipelines damaged in militant attacks last week , allowing some production to resume in the restive Niger Delta , the oil minister told Reuters on Wednesday .
“ All of the pipelines have been repaired .
It has beefed up production slightly , ” Odein Ajumogobia said in an interview .
Militants had sabotaged two crude oil pipelines operated by Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L , halting production of 150,000 barrels per day .

AS AN intellectually gifted Jewish New Yorker who had reached manhood in the mid-1950s , Marc Schleifer was relentless in his pursuit of new cultural and spiritual experiences .
He dallied with Anglo - Catholicism , intrigued by the ritual but not quite able to believe the doctrine , and went through a phase of admiration for Latin American socialism .
Experimenting with lifestyles as well as creeds , he tried respectability as an advertising executive , and a more bohemian life in the raffish expatriate scene of North Africa .
Returning from Morocco to his home city , he was shocked by the harsh anonymity of life in the urban West .
And one day , riding the New York subway , he opened the Koran at a passage which spoke of the mystery of God : beyond human understanding , but as close as a jugular vein .
Suddenly , everything fell into place .
It was only a matter of time before he embraced Islam by pronouncing before witnesses that there is no God but God , and Muhammad is his prophet . 
Some 40 years on from that life - changing moment not untypical of the turning points that many individuals experience Abdallah Schleifer has won distinction as a Muslim intellectual .
Last year he was one of 138 Muslim thinkers who signed an open letter to Christian leaders calling for a deeper theological dialogue .
The list of signatories included ( along with the muftis from Cairo , Damascus and Jakarta ) several other people who had made surprising journeys .
One grew up as an English nonconformist ; another as a Catholic farm boy from Oregon ; another in the more refined Catholic world of bourgeois Italy .
Sometimes conversion is gradual , but quite commonly things come to a head in a single instant , which can be triggered by a text , an image , a ceremony or some private realisation .
A religious person would call such a moment a summons from God ; a psychologist might speak of an instant when the walls between the conscious and unconscious break down , perhaps because an external stimulus words , a picture , a rite connects with something very deep inside .
For people of an artistic bent , the catalyst is often a religious image which serves as a window into a new reality .
One recurring theme in conversion stories is that cultural forms which are , on the face of it , foreign to the convert somehow feel familiar , like a homecoming .
That , the convert feels , is what I have always believed without being fully aware of it . 
Take Jennie Baker , an ethnic Chinese nurse who moved from Malaysia to England .
She was an evangelical , practising but not quite satisfied with a Christianity that eschews aids to worship such as pictures , incense or elaborate rites .
When she first walked into an Orthodox church , and took in the icons that occupied every inch of wall - space , everything in this new world made sense to her , and some teachings , like the idea that every home should have a corner for icons and prayer , resonated with her Asian heritage .
Soon she and her English husband helped establish a Greek Orthodox parish in Lancashire .
Following the heart
In the West it is generally taken for granted that people have a perfect , indeed sacred , right to follow their own religious path , and indeed to invite though never compelother people to join them .
The liberal understanding of religion lays great emphasis on the right to change belief .
Earlier this year , a poll found that one in four Americans moves on from the faith of their upbringing .
Americas foundation as a refuge for Europes Christian dissidents has endowed it with a deep sense of the right to follow and propagate any form of religion , with no impediment , or help , from the state .
In the 1980s America saw some lively debates over whether new - fangled cults  should be distinguished from conventional forms of religion , and curbed ; but in the end a purely libertarian view prevailed .
The promotion of religious liberty is an axiom of American foreign policy , not just in places where freedom is obviously under threat , but even in Germany , which gets gentle scoldings for its treatment of Scientology .
But Americas religious free - for - all is very much the exception , not the rule , in human history and increasingly rare , some would say , in the world today .
In most human societies , conversion has been seen as an act whose consequences are as much social and political as spiritual ; and it has been assumed that the wider community , in the form of the family , the village or the state , has every right to take an interest in the matter .
The biggest reason why conversion is becoming a hot international topic is the Muslim belief that leaving Islam is at best a grave sin , at worst a crime that merits execution ( see article ) .
Another factor in a growing global controversy is the belief in some Christian circles that Christianity must retain the right to seek and receive converts , even in parts of the world where this may be viewed as a form of cultural or spiritual aggression .
A fighting matter
The idea that religion constitutes a community ( where the loss or gain of even one member is a matter of deep , legitimate concern to all other members ) is as old as religion itself .
Christianity teaches that the recovery of a lost sheep  causes rejoicing in heaven ; for a Muslim , there is no human category more important than the umma , the worldwide community of believers .
But in most human societies the reasons why conversion causes controversy have little do with religious dogma , and much to do with power structures ( within the family or the state ) and politics .
Conversion will never be seen as a purely individual matter when one religiously - defined community is at war or armed standoff with another .
During Northern Irelands Troubles a move across the Catholic - Protestant divide could be life - threatening , at least in working - class Belfast and not merely because people felt strongly about papal infallibility .
And in any situation where religion and authority ( whether political , economic or personal ) are bound up , changes of spiritual allegiance cause shock - waves .
In the Ottoman empire , the status of Christians and Jews was at once underpinned and circumscribed by a regime that saw religion as an all - important distinction .
Non-Muslims were exempt from the army , but barred from many of the highest offices , and obliged to pay extra taxes .
When a village in , say , Crete or Bosnia converted en masse from Christianity to Islam , this was seen as betrayal by those who stayed Christian , in part because it reduced the population from which the Ottomans expected a given amount of tax .
In the days of British rule over the south of Ireland , it was hard for Catholics to hold land , although they were the overwhelming majority .
An opportunistic conversion to the rulers  religion was seen as letting the side down by those who kept the faith .
Similar inter-communal tensions arose in many European countries where Jews converted to Christianity in order to enter university or public service .
In most modern societies , the elaborate discrimination which made religious allegiance into a public matter is felt to be a thing of the past .
But is this so ?
In almost every post -Ottoman country , traces exist of the mentality that treats religion as a civic category , where entry and exit is a matter of public negotiation , not just private belief .
Perhaps Lebanon , where political power is allocated along confessional lines ( and boat - rocking changes of religious affiliation are virtually impossible ) is the most perfectly post -Ottoman state .
But there are other holdovers .
In secular  Turkey , the Greek Orthodox , Armenian and Jewish minorities have certain poorly observed rights that no other religious minority enjoys ; isolated Christians , or dissident Muslims , face great social pressure to conform to standard Sunni Islam .
In Greece , it is unconstitutional to proselytise ; that makes life hard for Jehovahs Witnesses or Mormons .
In Egypt , the fact that building a Christian church requires leave from the head of state is a direct legacy of a ( liberalising ) Ottoman decree of 1856 .
Tactical manoeuvres
But the Ottoman empire is by no means the only semi- theocratic realm whose influence is still palpable in the governance of religious affairs , including conversion .
In an odd way , the Soviet Union continued the legacy of the tsars by dividing citizens into groups ( including Jews or some Muslim ethnicities ) where membership had big consequences but was not a matter of individual choice .
In post -Soviet Russia , the prevailing Orthodox church rejects the notion of a free market in ideas .
It seeks ( and often gets ) state preference for traditional  faiths , defined as Orthodox Christianity , Judaism , Islam and Buddhism .
This implies that other forms of Christianity are poaching  if they seek to recruit Russians .

But issues of conversion are also painful in some former territories of the British empire , which allowed its subjects to follow their own communal laws .
Take India , which once aspired to be a secular state , and whose constitution calls for a uniform civil code for all citizens .
That prospect is now remote , and the fact that different religious groups live by different family laws , and are treated unequally by the state and society , has created incentives for expedient conversion .
A colourful body of jurisprudence , dating from the British Raj , concerns people who changed faith to solve a personal dilemmalike men who switched from Hinduism to Islam so as to annul their marriage and wed somebody else .
In 1995 , the Supreme Court tried to stop this by saying people could not dodge social obligations , or avoid bigamy charges , by changing faith .
What Indias case law shows , says Marco Ventura , a religious - law professor , is the contrast between conversion in rich , liberal societies and traditional ones , where discrimination tempts people to make tactical moves .
And in many ways religious freedom is receding , not advancing , in India .
Half a dozen Indian states have introduced laws that make it hard for people to leave Hinduism .
These states are mostly ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .
But last year Himachal Pradesh became the first state led by the more secular Congress party to bring in such legislation : such is the power of Hindu sentiment that even non-religious parties pander to it .
The states new law is billed as a freedom of religion measure , but it has the opposite effect : anyone wishing to switch faiths must tell the district magistrate 30 days before or risk a fine .
If a person converts another by the use of force or by inducement or by any other fraudulent means , they can be jailed for up to two years , fined , or both .
Local pastors say inducement could be taken to mean anything , including giving alms to the poor .
Supporters of such laws say proselytisers , or alleluia wallahs , are converting poor Hindus by force .
It is true that Christian evangelism is in full swing in parts of India , especially in its eastern tribal belt , and that it enjoys some success .
Officially , fewer than 3 % of Indias 1.1 billion people are Christian .
But some Christians say the real total may be double that .
Christian converts , most of whom are born as dalits at the bottom of the Hindu caste system , often hide their new faith for fear of losing their rights to state jobs and university places kept for the lower castes .
But it is unlikely that many Hindu - to - Christian switches are forced .
In states with anti-conversion laws , credible allegations of conversion under duress have very rarely been made .
Anyway , Indias arguments have more to do with politics than theology .
Hindutva , the teaching that India is a Hindu nation and that Christians and Muslims are outsiders , has been a vote - winner for the BJP .
Even in Himachal Pradesh , voters were unmoved by the Congress partys attempt to ride the religious bandwagon ; the BJP still won the latest elections .
The contest between theocratic politics and a notionally secular state looks even more unequal in another ex-British land , Malaysia , where freedom of choice in religion is enshrined in the federal constitution , but Islamic law is imposed with growing strictness on the Muslim majority .
Until the mid-1990s , say Malaysian civil - rights advocates like Malik Imtiaz Sarwar , the federal authorities enforced religious freedom ; the National Registration Department , a federal agency , would comply when anybody asked to record a change of religion .
More recently , both that agency and Malaysias top judges have deferred to the sharia courts , which enjoy increasing power in all 13 states of the Malaysian federation ; and those courts rarely let a registered Muslim quit the fold .
A recent exception was an ethnic Chinese woman who was briefly married to an Iranian ; a sharia court let her re-embrace Buddhism , but only on the ground that she was never fully Muslim , so the idea of  Once a Muslim , always a Muslim remained intact .
A more telling sign of the times was the verdict in the case of Lina Joy , a Malay convert from Islam to Christianity who asked a federal court to register the change on her ID card .
By two to one the judges rejected her bid , arguing that one cannot , at ones whims or fancies , renounce or embrace a religion .
Too bad , then , for any Malaysians who have a moment of truth on the subway , especially if the faith to which they are called happens not to be Islam .
The recording industry and U.S. radio companies have squared off for decades about whether AM and FM radio broadcasters should pay royalties to singers , musicians and their labels .
But now the debate is getting meaner ; there 's more at stake as the recording industry seeks new income avenues in the wake of wanton peer - to - peer piracy and declining CD sales in part due to the iPod and satellite radio .
A U.S. House subcommittee could vote as early as Thursday on a royalty measure .
On Monday , the recording industry sent the National Association of Broadcasters – the trade group representing the $ 16 billion a year AM - FM broadcasting business – a can of herring to underscore that it believes its arguments against paying royalties are a red herring .
The NAB says its members should not pay royalties because AM - FM radio " promotes " the music industry .
The herring present followed another gift – a dictionary , a bid by the recording industry to explain what it saw as the difference between fees and taxes .
The NAB describes the latest royalty proposal as a tax .
And two weeks ago , the recording industry , under the umbrella group musicFIRST , sent the NAB four digital downloads : " Take the Money and Run " by the Steve Miller Band ; " Pay me My Money Down " by Bruce Springsteen ; " Back In the U.S.S.R " by Paul McCartney and " A Change Would Do You Good " by Sheryl Crow .
Broadcasting music without payment is akin to piracy , the industry says .
" It 's a form of piracy , if you will , but not in the classic sense as we think of it , " said Martin Machowsky , a music First spokesman .
" Today we gifted them a can of herring , about their argument that they provide promotional value .
We think that 's a red herring .
Nobody listens to the radio for the commercials . "
The coalition includes the Recording Industry Association of America , Society of Singers , Rhythm & Blues Foundation , Recording Academy and others .
The argument boils down to this : Radio is making billions off the backs of recording artists and their labels ; and the recording artists gain invaluable exposure because they 're on the radio , so royalties should not have to be paid .
A House subcommittee is expected to approve a royalty bill perhaps as early as Thursday .
The measure , HR 4789 , sponsored by Rep. Howard Berman , D - California , would move to the full House Judiciary Committee – legislation that the National Association of Broadcasters said would cost the industry as much as $ 7 billion annually .
An identical proposal , S 2500 , is in the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Rates under both proposals would be negotiated , although small and public stations would pay a flat $ 5,000 annually .
Internet , cable and satellite broadcasters pay royalties to all participants involved .
Singers , musicians and the labels get no royalties when AM - FM radio broadcasters air their songs .
That would change under both the Senate and House proposals .
Composers and songwriters , however , do get AM - FM royalties , which are set under a complicated and negotiated rate .
" If it was n't for radio play , most of the performers would n't be known , " said Dennis Wharton , a NAB vice president .
The group says that free airplay generates as much as $ 2.4 billion a year for the recording industry .

The 2008 presidential election in the US may well leave us all waxing nostalgic for the good old disaster days of 2000 and 2004 .
Given the asterisks in the record books next to both of those elections , you might think that Democrats , the victims of the anti-democratic ( small " d " ) attacks in both elections , would have spent the intervening years putting virtually all resources into making sure there would n't be another such electoral disaster in 2008 .
You would have been horribly mistaken .
In addition to proving miserable failures ( though , admittedly , they did n't try very hard ) at rolling back the tsunami of wholly unverifiable electronic voting systems now set for use , misuse and utter breakdown across the country this November , the Democrats have also made little headway in ending what will be one of the most troubling problems this year : voter disenfranchisement via phony Republican claims of " voter fraud " .
The Republicans , on the other hand , have been at work for years developing their anti-democratic ( small " d " again , but it may as well be a capital " D " ) schemes .
For a glimpse at what may well be the Rosetta Stone of Republican disenfranchisement efforts , one need look no further than at what Paul Weyrich , one of the founding fathers of modern American conservatism , told a gathering of some 15,000 preachers at a training conference in Dallas , Texas in 1980 ( at which both Ronald Reagan and the right - wing Rev. Jerry Falwell also shared the podium ) .
" Many of our Christians have what I call the goo - goo syndrome - good government .
They want everybody to vote , " Weyrich instructed the flock in comments captured on video .
" I do n't want everybody to vote , " he continued unapologetically .
" Elections are not won by a majority of people , they never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now . "
And here comes the key to what will be the most crucial driving force for the entire Republican party effort this November : " As a matter of fact , our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down . "
Thus spoke Weyrich in 1980 , and the party leaders have followed in good faith ever since .
Their disciples continue today to regularly advise the most powerful Republican insiders in the country .
And thus have they gone forth to find every measure - no matter how adverse to the key American value of democracy , or how expensive the cost may be - to keep legitimate , legal voters from being able to cast their vote and have that vote counted accurately .
Not every voter , of course .
Just the ones who tend to vote Democratic ( capital " D " ) .
The easiest ones to target among those who do n't tend to vote Republican : African - Americans , Hispanics , the elderly , the urban poor and even students .
All in the hopes , as Weyrich urged , of keeping Republican " leverage in ... elections ... up " by keeping " the voting populace ... down " .
According to the non-partisan League of Women voters , some 21 million Americans do not have the type of photo identification required by the most draconian types of polling - place photo ID restrictions that are now being pushed - by hook and by crook - in states across the country .
Among that group , some 25 % of African - Americans , 18 % of Americans over 65 , 10 % of the 40 million Americans with disabilities , 15 % of low - income voters and untold numbers of voting - aged college students who reside in states other than where they may have valid drivers ' licenses would have difficulty voting under such laws .
( You may add to the Republican enemies list : married women , hurricane victims and those suffering from palsy , if you like . )
With that in mind , the Republicans have stopped at nothing , in order to see such laws passed wherever possible , and otherwise enforced nonetheless even where such poll restrictions have been found by the courts to be illegal and / or unconstitutional .
An unprecedented decision by the now rightward - slanted US supreme court earlier this year , allowed such a law to stand in Indiana .
The result : the disenfranchised in the state 's May primary election included college students and nuns in their 80s and 90s from St Mary 's Convent ( one of the " nonagenarian hooligans " kept from her right to vote , was 98 years old ) and vets of multiple foreign wars , not to mention those who simply did n't bother to show up , since they knew they 'd not be allowed to vote .
All of that following the state of Indiana 's own admission in the court case that they were unable to document a single case of voter fraud in the state 's history that would have been prevented by their new voter - suppression law .
The supporters of such laws , however , argue that it 's easy to get one of the free IDs that Indiana offers .
Fact is , it 's not easy at all , and those supposedly free IDs can get rather expensive .
And the same effort is underway in other states as well .
In Missouri , for instance , a state regarded by the McClatchy News Service as " Ground Zero " , in 2006 , for the GOP 's voter disenfranchisement effort , a man was arrested while legally voting two weeks ago during a state primary election .
He was sent to jail because he offered two different pieces of perfectly legal ID , but none that the poll workers at his polling place wanted to accept .
That , even after the state 's supreme court found draconian photo ID restrictions to be unconstitutional there .
In the same state in 2006 , not long after the state court 's decision , the secretary of state herself ( a Democrat ) , responsible for enforcing the election laws there , was told three times as she was trying to vote that she needed to present a photo ID .
Of course she did n't , and has some familiarities with the law .
But that did n't stop them from trying anyway , even as Missouri has some 200,000 voters who could , according to the secretary of state 's own numbers , be kept from exercising their legal franchise under such laws .
Make no mistake .
This is an effort that reaches to the highest federal levels .
For example , despite a very clear federal law that requires it - the Bush administration 's department of veterans affairs has disallowed voter registration activities in VA hospitals and other facilities , describing such activities as " partisan " ( telling , that ) .
Thus , it 's assured that many of those who put their very lives on the line under the premise of spreading democracy throughout the world will have no voice in that same democracy back in their own country this year .
The beat goes on and will continue to grow louder through Election Day in November .
Count on it .
The Prospect 's Art Levine elegantly and accurately referred to all of this as The Republican war on voting .
But make no mistake about it , this is an all out Republican war on democracy in which we will be witnessing an unprecedented " troop surge " between here and November .
Paul Weyrich is surely smiling .

State board member wants education chief replaced Board member wants education chief replaced
Plan to rewrite English standards prompts criticism
AUSTIN — Don McLeroy " has created havoc " as chairman of the State Board of Education and should be replaced , the senior member of the board said in a letter to Gov. Rick Perry .
" It is such a shame that after all these years of trying to improve public education in Texas , we are taking steps backwards because of Don McElroy , " Mary Helen Berlanga of Corpus Christi said in her letter to Perry , misspelling McLeroy 's name .
Berlanga , who has been on the 15 - member board since 1984 , said McLeroy 's leadership has been a disaster and asked Perry to replace him with " a moderate conservative who can work with all members of the State Board of Education and the citizens of this state . "
McLeroy , a Bryan - based dentist , declined to comment because he had not seen the letter .
Perry said he fully supports him .
Berlanga faults McLeroy for the way he has engineered the rewriting of the state 's English language arts and reading curriculum , which will go to the board for a final vote on Thursday .
She said McLeroy has ignored board instructions to Texas Education Agency staff by issuing separate dictates and deceived public school teachers , ignoring their recommendations in favor of out - of - state teachers in the development of new English language arts and reading standards .
And she renewed earlier criticisms of McLeroy for inviting experts in topics ranging from special education and dyslexia , but not including Hispanic experts in the development of English standards .
" Any intelligent , logical person would have named an expert who had dealt with Hispanic children and language minority children since more than ( 47 percent ) of the 4.5 million students in our public schools are Hispanic , " Berlanga wrote .
Even after the board voted two months ago to require Hispanic experts to evaluate the proposed standards , those experts were isolated instead of being invited to work with agency staff , she complained .
Berlanga said frustration led her to ask the governor to name a new chairman for the board that oversees Texas education .
She does not expect Perry to accede to her request , but the governor should , at least , speak to McLeroy about her complaints , she said .
" He can certainly encourage him to change his behavior ... ( and ) tell him that he can't behave this way anymore , " Berlanga said Tuesday .
" His tactics , I do n't think anyone can change , but he 's got to let the teachers speak and do n't yell at them and do n't be rude . "
Berlanga should take her objections to the full board , Perry said , " and the board will appropriately make the right decision . "
" I would suggest focusing on the issues that are important to the people of the state of Texas , not on whether I particularly like someone 's personality , " Perry said .
In her letter to Perry , Berlanga mentioned Perry 's interest in running for re-election in 2010 as a reason he should appoint a new chairman .
" Texas has a large population of Hispanics , and ( McLeroy ) seems bent on alienating this very significant group of voters , " she wrote .
" He has managed to alienate our Texas teachers .
For the sake of our great state do not allow this Master of Deceit to continue his very dangerous game . "

ON July 6 , police say , a Pakistani named Chaudhry Rashid strangled his 25 - year - old daughter San- deela Kanwal with a Bungee cord in her bedroom because she wanted to end her arranged marriage .
This “ honor killing ” came not in Pakistan , but in Jonesboro , Ga. – a suburb 16 miles outside Atlanta .
At his arraignment , Rashid said through an Urdu interpreter that he was “ not in the state of mind to talk because of the death of his daughter , ” but stated “ I have done nothing wrong . ”
This is not the same as declaring innocence .
His attorney , Tammy Long , explained , “ My client is going through a difficult time .
As you can imagine , he is distraught . ”
Apparently , it takes a stronger man to murder his daughter without sentiment .
The national media has paid little attention to the story of Kanwal ’s murder , though most outlets found plenty of time to debate the cover of The New Yorker .
When a blonde girl goes missing , cable networks stop in their tracks – but when a Muslim woman is murdered by her father , there ’s not a ripple of sustained interest .
Where ’s the outrage ?
Maybe it ’s muted because we ’ve grown reluctant to pass judgment on other culture ’s customs – but multiculturalism hits a crossroads when honor killings come to America .
The United Nations estimates that the world sees 5,000 honor killings a year – overwhelmingly in the Middle East , South Asia and Africa , but increasingly among Muslim immigrant communities in Europe .
The United States has avoided this bloodstained trend until recently .
Some consider Kanwal ’s death the first documented honor killing here .
Others point to the murder of sisters Amina and Sarah Said in Irving , Texas , on New Years ’ 2007 .
( Their MySpace page remains up .
Featuring assimilated teen culture and American music , it is haunting . )
Their father remains on the run from police .
Few doubt that other honor killings have occurred behind closed doors .
In upstate Monroe County just a few days ago , a girl was stabbed by her brother for wearing immodest western clothing and wanting to move to New York City .
According to court documents , Waheed Allah Mohammad explained the stabbing by saying his sister was a “ bad Muslim girl . ”
“ Honor killing is a misnomer , ” author and exile Ayaan Hirsi Ali told me .
“ The killing occurs because these girls have allegedly brought shame on their family .
The paradox is that these are individuals who have emancipated themselves .
“ These girls embody the American dream .
They want to become self - reliant – deciding who they marry , when they marry and how many children they will have . ”
On the surface , this sounds like a classic case for the left – outrages well worth protesting .
Honor killings and other tribal customs like female genital mutilation represent a far greater threat to human rights than comparatively benign examples of Western sexism , like unrealistic measurements on a Barbie doll .
But this would require recognizing that the greatest danger to civil liberties in the world today comes not from the United States , but from a medieval tribalism that ’s still murdering people around the world under the guise of enforcing piousness .
“ America is an assimilating nation , ” affirms Ayaan , “ and so when immigrant Muslim men assimilate into American society they are applauded for it .
But when some immigrant Muslim women assimilate into American society , they find themselves ostracized – beaten and even killed by their own families .
And the American public ignores their plight to protect the immigrant Muslim community from stigma . ”
There should be wall - to - wall coverage when Rashid ’s pretrail hearings begin tomorrow in Atlanta .
By any standards , this is a sensational crime .
Instead , the trial may well get dismissed as old news or swept under the rug as just another domestic - violence case .
These rationalizations cover up a discomfort with wading into cultural judgment – and a desire to avoid the risk of violence that always comes with criticizing radical Islam .
There ’s a cost to such squeamishness .
In England , Lord Chief Justice Phillips , the country ’s top judge , has said that sharia law should be incorporated into British law , while the Archbishop of Canterbury described such incorporation as “ inevitable . ”
This slippery slope threatens to undermine liberal democracy and even the concept of civilized norms .
America must make a stand , because many Europeans either ca n’t or wo n’t .
As Ayaan says : “ As an immigrant Muslim woman running for your life , from your own family , I think America is a better place for us , because we know that Americans are individualist enough that they will ultimately chose to protect us – while Europeans choose to stick their heads in the sand and pretend nothing is going on . ”
Our ultimate victory in the War on Terror will be to encourage a Muslim reformation by offering examples of successful Muslim - American citizens – especially women – who thrive within the equal rights and open opportunities of American society .
For Muslim women who want to live in freedom , America is the last best hope on earth – and we must remain nothing less .

Wall * E is just a stunningly good movie .
It 's gorgeous , and genuine , and mostly avoids the overweening cute that infects most animated films .
One of the things that cracked me up about it was how much Wall * E is emblematic of geek culture : he tools around doing his job , collecting his weird objects , obsessively watching his favorite movie over and over again , and fixates on the first girl he sees , regardless of her personality or even her name .
And the first thing he does is bring her home to see all his Stuff .
And then ... he sort of stalks her .
But it all works out , sort of , because like most geeks , he is also capable of extraordinary loyalty and devotion and -- wonder .
God , remember when SF was about wonder ?
How refreshing to see someone in love with the world .
I know some people are getting all het up about the " anti- fat " message of the movie , and I think that 's pretty much bullshit .
Come on , guys .
Fat people saved the world .
Be happy .
If you do n't think most corporations would go absolutely priapic over the idea of being able to get us all in limited space , strapped to a chair , fed through a straw and advertised to 24/ 7 until we are nothing more than constantly consuming grubs , you 're pretty much first in line for your blue suit .
I completely believe the idea -- especially since , unlike most SF space operas , Wall * E does n't pretend that hyperdrive elevates the soul or that interstellar capability means any of that behavior would stop -- it will be Wal - Mart taking us to the stars , if ever we go .
I think one of the truest , subtlest moments of the film was when BNL was advertising the new " blue " jumpsuits to the universally morbidly obese passengers -- and still advertising them as worn by thin people .
There is a sad irony in the fact that this message has been brought to us by the Disney Corporation , who , let 's be honest , would be first in line to strap humanity down and force - feed us frosted high fructose corn syrup Disney Princess ( tm ) cakes and Mickey Mouse Brand anti-depressants until we burst .
Which brings me to the end .
Stop reading if you do n't want to know .
Oddly enough , I kept thinking of Heinlein , who for all his faults , and they are legion , has a lot of important things to say about how hard it is to make a planet livable , about what kind of blood greases the trail from subsistence to Coruscant , about how long it takes and how brutal a task it really is .
My problems are twofold : one , they have a giant spaceship with automated farms , perfect AI , and food - generating whirly - gigs .
If they did n't , they would n't have survived 700 years .
Yet the Captain is fucking around with pouring water on dirt .
If you are serious about recolonizing you have to feed people -- people with a certain vigorous expectation of regular food -- and one blade of grass does not a sustainable ecology make .
Watching the Captain flail cutely with his watering can filled me with horror .
Because those bone - degenerated , net - addicted , HFCS - saturated people who have been plugged in all their lives are simply not prepared for the task of rebuilding a planet that is still completely fucked .
The whole facile " let 's roll up our sleeves " solution reminded me uncomfortably of certain leaders who want to enact grand schemes as long as other people are the ones to die making them happen , and the whole , utterly corrupted green movement that seems to think handing out grotesque medieval indulgences in the form of carbon offsets makes a damn bit of difference .
Why , as soon as you declare a wonderful thing done , it 's done !
Mission accomplished !
The real work always gets done somewhere else , by someone else , via musical montage .
So welcome to a lifetime of toil and death , kids !
But hey , it 's worth it .
It 's not like you have a hyperdrive craft capable of taking you to a world that does not prominently feature deadly trashstorms , skyscrapers of garbage , and a sky blotted out by satellites , right ?
Right ?
Which brings me around to something I talked about on the Magical Realism panel at Wiscon , and hope to post about in detail shortly .
You see , mainstream fiction , filmed or printed , has an agenda .
No , you say !
Say it is n't so !
Yeah yeah .
But listen , because the message is this : you must always choose this world .
You cannot choose virtual reality , or space , or Middle Earth .
You must always strive to return from Kansas , no matter how shitty the Depression is , you must always choose Earth over any other planet even if you 've never seen it and barely heard of it .
You cannot choose the simulacrum , even if it is better in every way .
To do otherwise is metaphorical suicide , and no matter how cool the aliens are on the other side , kid , you 'd better choose life .
This life .
Mos maiorum .
The Captain had to choose Earth , no matter how truly horrible life there will be for each and every one of his passengers , who will , in the main , die in awful ways , otherwise Wall * E would not be a nice little pedagogical movie meant to exhort us to action in this world .
Fiction must instruct .
I have no problem with exhortations to action .
But in a movie that was otherwise about not making the easy choice , the Pollyanna hand - waving of the ending jarred .
Because it made the work of rebuilding earth seem so easy that it was hardly worth considering anything else .
Because it glorified farming ( because that sure was a ship full of farmers .
Pizza plants , indeed ) and bucolic life over the readily - available resources and AI that would safe thousands of lives -- and this is what our own government does when it denies scientific funding because of an obsession with seeing themselves as cowboys , simple men , Christians with a foot in the other world .
There is a seriously dark future waiting for those cute , roly - poly humans .
The robots , on the other hand , will be fine .
And then , after the credits , the BNL logo gleams huge and shiny and red .
Which I thought was an incredibly subtle thing , an implication that all the preceding was a BNL - approved media product , with a BNL - approved message : do n't worry , kids .
If we fuck it up beyond all hope , we 'll just wait a bit , swim in the pool , and then break out the watering cans like the salt - of - the - earth folks we are .
Then we 'll have a hoedown .
The fixing is easy .
So feel free to fuck it up .
I think Pixar understood their own morbid joke .
That 's what the logo says to me .
It says : this is already happening , and the very people who brought you this adorable robot will be the ones to strap you into a hyperdrive chair aimed towards oblivion .
Have a nice trip .
Police were called out to break up the annual “ mooning ” of Amtrak trains in Laguna Niguel on Saturday when the crowd grew to 8,000 and many began baring more than just their behinds .
“ We had some mooners and some female flashers and some people who were nude altogether , ” said Jim Amormino , a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department .
“ There was also lots of drinking .
We felt that it was in the public ’s interest to shut it down . ”
Mooners , flashers and others dispersed peacefully about 3 p.m. and there were no arrests , Amormino said .
More than 50 officers responded from several police agencies , backed up by helicopters .
Some participants were angered by the police response .

“ What was the point of stopping people from enjoying themselves when they were under control ? ” asked Robert Zoellner , 47 , a first - time mooner from Mission Viejo .
“ Everybody was getting along . ”
Some participants returned to a mile - long stretch of festivities after police left , and newcomers arrived throughout the afternoon .
Into the evening , revelers continued to moon the trains that passed about every 20 minutes .
The crowd , which included children with their parents as well as middle - aged adults -- stood on the shoulder of a road parallel to the tracks to show themselves .
The sideshow included barbecues , T - shirt sales and RV parties .
“ It ’s so liberating it ’s contagious , ” said Steve Bartolo , 39 , of Costa Mesa .
“ You just wait until that next train goes by . . . I ca n’t stop . ”

The 29 - year - old event is said to have started when a patron at the nearby Mugs Away Saloon in the 27000 block of Camino Capistrano offered to buy drinks for any of his buddies who would run out to the tracks and bare their bottoms for the next passing train .
Many did , and the tradition was born .
Usually held the second Saturday in July , the event begins early in the morning and continues into the night .
Though it has no official sponsors and free beer is no longer provided , it does have a website .
“ The truth is I never heard of it until today , ” Amormino said .
“ This is probably the first time it ’s gotten out of hand . ”

“ It ’s a good thing they were mooning trains , ” Amormino said , “ because if it were cars I ’m sure it would cause ” an accident .
“ I guess a few people wrecked it for everybody . ”

Over the past few years , wind energy has experienced a tremendous , if precariously fragile , boom .
Last year alone , wind - power capacity jumped 21 percent in the United States .
Wind is now one of the country 's fastest - growing electricity sources , buoyed by strong consumer demand , mounting concerns about fossil fuels , and — perhaps most notable — vital government support .
But uncertainty about key federal tax credits threatens to knock the wind out of the wind - power industry .
Nearly every American - bred source of energy , from coal to nuclear power , gets some sort of federal push , and wind and solar companies receive theirs in the form of tax credits , which enable them to line up investors and overcome enormous start - up costs .
( Hundred - foot blades do n't come cheap . )
The credits , which are set to expire at the end of the year , enjoy almost universal support on Capitol Hill .
Politicians of both parties routinely champion them .
And yet because of continued bickering , Congress this year has failed to renew them — with potentially drastic consequences .
The mere prospect of these credits expiring , in fact , has already begun to rattle the renewable - energy industries .
Some wind developers are putting projects on hold and , in more extreme cases , laying off workers .
" We have four projects right now that are what we call construction ready — we could install them and get them up and running by spring 2009 , " says Leon Steinberg , CEO of National Wind , one of the nation 's leading wind - energy developers .
" But none of our financial institutions will finance these projects with just the hope that the tax credit will be renewed . "
As a result , Steinberg says , construction on these projects has yet to start .
The rationale for waiting is simple :
The wind - energy tax credit is good for 10 years and pays developers about 2 cents for every kilowatt - hour of electricity they produce , but it must be available on the date that a project comes online .
If a new wind farm starts pumping out electricity in January 2009 but the credits have n't been renewed yet , it loses out .
The solar industry , which gets a 30 percent credit on new investments , is in the midst of a similar shake - up .
Some large - scale developers have tabled projects as they await Congress 's decision , while smaller operations are scrambling to get solar installations up and running by December .
" With solar , we can put things in place a little more quickly , so you are seeing a tremendous jump in solar installations right now , " says Gilbert Metcalf , a professor of economics at Tufts University and noted tax policy expert .
" It is driving up the cost of solar panels and installations . "
If the credits are not renewed , he warns , the solar market could collapse , and solar - technology firms may have to lay off workers .
" It will retard the progress we are making , " he says .
The uncertain future , in turn , is sending ripples through the economy , affecting , in particular , the nation 's nascent " green " manufacturing industry , which has quietly emerged in the tow of the renewable - energy market .
In the Midwest and other industrial regions , factories that manufacture turbine parts or solar panels are seeing a slowdown in new orders .
New York officials recently warned that the state could lose 7,000 jobs if the tax credits are allowed to expire , and national estimates put the potential losses above 110,000 .
In the past , green manufacturing in the United States has been somewhat stifled by volatile levels of government support , and industry observers warn that the trend could worsen — with more green jobs and companies going overseas — if Congress refuses to act .
History hints at the possible long - term damage if the credits expire in December — because it has happened before .
In 1999 , 2001 , and 2003 , Congress did n't renew the tax credits , and in each of the following years , wind - power installations fell dramatically , according to the Department of Energy .
In 2000 , there was a 93 percent drop in new wind projects ; in 2004 , a 74 percent drop .
" This is not rocket science , " says Greg Wetstone of the American Wind Energy Association .
" When the credit is in place , wind energy and renewable energy has grown dramatically .
When the credit has lapsed , the level of wind development has fallen dramatically . "
The solar industry suffered a similarly dramatic bust in the early 1980s , when Congress , looking to cut spending , eliminated the solar tax credits and effectively cut the industry in half .
Today , ironically , there is overwhelming bipartisan support for the incentives — even Sen.
James Inhofe of Oklahoma , a conservative Republican and vocal global warming skeptic , is a strong proponent .
Few consider the tax credits ' estimated price tag of about $ 8.2 billion a significant drain on the federal budget , especially in light of the measurably larger incentives awarded to oil and coal .
In fact , a recent study by General Electric found that the tax credits more than pay for themselves , because they create jobs and profits , resulting in 2007 in a net gain of $ 250 million for the federal treasury .
Also , the American public is behind them : About 94 percent of Americans support government development of solar energy .
It is tempting to think that all this goodwill would have presaged easy passage .
But Congress , despite its pledges of support , has lately ground into something of a stalemate , and on multiple occasions in the past few months it has defeated or blocked bills that would have salvaged the credits .
At the moment , the main obstacle to progress seems to be a philosophical one .
House Democrats , led by the so - called Blue Dog Democrats , a group of fiscally minded moderates , have insisted that the cost of the credits be offset by savings elsewhere .
Their solution , which would raise taxes on offshore companies , has rankled Senate Republicans , who insist that no offsets are needed in the first place .
And so a parliamentary standoff has unfolded .
Twice the Senate attempted to attach an amendment to the now recently passed housing relief bill that would have renewed the credits ; twice it was stripped out by the House .
Meanwhile , a House bill with similar aims was defeated last week by a Senate Republican filibuster .
At a breakfast meeting with reporters on Monday , Sen. Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the Senate energy committee , said that passing the tax credits this week is one of the Senate 's top priorities before it adjourns for its August recess .
It remains uncertain how he and his Democratic colleagues intend to reconcile the squabbling over offshore drilling and oil speculation that has tied up most energy legislation this summer .
— As many as 300 people joined a melee that began inside a Raleigh mall and spilled outside the shopping center during the fight , police said Sunday .
Raleigh Police Department spokesman Jim Sughrue said the gang - related brawl began inside Triangle Town Center Mall on Saturday night at about 8 p.m .
Off - duty officers working at the mall requested assistance , and Wake County sheriff 's deputies N.C. Highway Patrol troopers also responded
Sughrue said a 15 - year - old was stabbed during the incident .
He was taken to WakeMed and treated for non-life - threatening injuries .
A police officer was also injured with a " significant " cut to his knee that he suffered during a chase .
He was taken to Duke Raleigh Hospital for treatment and is expected to recover , Sughrue said .
Authorities said the fight was " gang - related , " though Sughrue declined to say why they reached that conclusion .
Raleigh police have previously said examples of gang - related activity include actions that would establish a gang 's territory , suppress another gang or get revenge .
Seven people were arrested : Darryl Anthony Bobbitt , 18 ; Tyrell Eugene Brantley , 18 ; Christopher James Gamble , 17 ; Laquavis Oneal Jordan , 16 ; Javonnie Nicholson , 16 ; and Ricky Ladd Williams , 16 .
The seventh person was a 15 - year - old whom authorities would not name .
The six older teenagers were each charged with inciting a riot .
Some of them also face other charges , including second - degree trespassing , disorderly conduct , assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury , assault on a law enforcement officer , and engaging in an affray .
Gamble has been charged in the stabbing , authorities said .
Norma Williams said her son , Tyrell Brantley , was falsely accused .
She said he was in the mall trying to get a job .
“ He was in a store filling an application ; he came out walked in the mall .
Then he saw all the noise and people running .
… When he goes out the door , he gets arrested , ” Williams said .
It took about an hour for authorities to fully restore order .
Jennifer Jones , the mall 's marketing director , said authorities decided to close the mall early .
She said the mall operated on normal hours Sunday and that officials there are working to identify ways to prevent such an incident from happening again .
" Our main concern is the safety of our shoppers and our retailers , " Jones said .
Security guards handed out memos to retailers on Sunday about the incident and about a meeting scheduled for later in the week .
Mall officials said among the options under review is a curfew for teenagers .
Northgate Mall in Durham already has such a policy and security officials said it has been effective .
At Northgate , shoppers under 16 must be accompanied by an adult after 6 p.m. Paula Harris , marketing director at Northgate , said the " Shoppers First " program has been in place since 2003 .

A move to impeach would bolster the resistance to Bush among our senior military leaders who know that attacking Iran at this time would be the strategic equivalent of the marches into Russia by Napoleon and Hitler .
Since Conyers took the helm of Judiciary in January 2007 , the train of abuses and usurpations by the Bush administration has gotten even longer .
But oddly , Conyers has lost his earlier appetite for impeachment and begun offering all manner of transparent excuses not to proceed .
On July 23 , 2007 , for example , Conyers told Cindy Sheehan , the Rev. Lennox Yearwood and me that he would need 218 votes in the House , and vociferously claimed the votes were not there .
Well , they are now .
Last week , 251 members of the House voted to refer to Conyers ' committee the 35 Articles of Impeachment offered by U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
Conyers should take them up .
When bombs are falling on Iran , it will be too late -- and our commander in chief is likely to give that order within the next couple of months .
As former White House press secretary Scott McClellan reminds us , when the president sets his mind on something , he is not going to let anything stop him .
What seems to be driving Bush comes through best when he ad - libs at press conferences .
On June 10 , in Slovenia , he was asked about the intensifying debate in Israel about a military option against the nuclear installations in Iran .
Bush responded : " If you go to Israel and listen carefully , you 'll hear the urgency in their voice . "
What 's so urgent ?
Israel 's ambassador to the United States , speaking at an American Jewish Committee luncheon last Oct. 22 , said the Iranians must not be permitted to conclude that , " come January '09 ( after Bush leaves office ) , they have it their own way . "
Vice President Dick Cheney last summer pushed for air strikes on Revolutionary Guards bases in Iran , but was thwarted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , according to J. Scott Carpenter , a senior State Department official working on the Middle East at the time .
The Joint Chiefs also have strongly opposed attacking Iran 's nuclear sites , according to a former Iran specialist at the National Security Council , Hillary Mann , who has wide contacts among senior Pentagon officials .
Mann reports that Admiral William Fallon , the former CENTCOM commander , joined the Joint Chiefs in opposing such an attack and made his views known to the White House .
Fallon was forced to resign in March and will be replaced as CENTCOM commander by Gen. David Petraeus .
A " political general , " Petraeus has already demonstrated his willingness to do Cheney 's bidding -- by , for example , making demonstrably false claims about Iranian weaponry in Iraq .
Nonetheless , the U.S. military in Baghdad apparently remains under orders to blame any serious violence on " special groups " -- code for those said to be supported by Iran .
Before the smoke had cleared after Tuesday 's bombing in Baghdad that left at least 63 dead and 78 wounded , U.S. spokesman Lt. Col .
Steven Stover announced that the U.S. command believed one of those " special groups " was behind the bombing .
The corporate media are already launched in their pre-attack mode , providing stenographic services for the White House to indoctrinate Americans on a synthetic " threat " from Iran .
So far , though , we have been spared the " mushroom cloud " imagery .
Neither Bush nor Cheney want to risk drawing attention to the fact that all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last November that Iran stopped nuclear weapons - related work in 2003 and has not restarted it .
Conyers may say there 's not enough time to begin impeachment , with only seven months left to this administration .
But how could Conyers say this one day , and on the next say that if Bush attacks Iran , well then the House may move toward impeachment ?
His nonchalance regarding what an attack on Iran would mean is mind - boggling .
You impeach the scoundrels before they start another war .
At a similarly critical juncture in our nation 's history , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was characteristically direct : " There is such a thing as being too late .
...
Life often leaves us standing bare , naked , and dejected with lost opportunity .
...
Over the bleached bones of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words : ' Too late . ' "

For the second time in two months , a bunch of Los Angeles bike advocates calling themselves Crimanimalz took to one of the busiest freeways in the world to make the case that , when your freeways are gridlocked , bikes are better .
About 30 cyclists rode onto the
Santa Monica Freeway ( I - 10 ) at the height of Friday 's rush - hour commute and went east to the San Diego Freeway ( I - 405 ) , where they rode north to the Santa Monica Boulevard exit , moving easily through traffic .
In all , they rode more than two miles .
" There 's thousands of cars and you 're just flying by , " said one of the group , called RichToTheIE , by phone on Wednesday .
" It 's an amazing feeling . "
The renegade rides are a radical off - shoot of the popular - and often controversial - Critical Mass rides held each month in cities around the world as cyclists grow increasingly vocal in asserting their rights to the road and extolling the environmental and societal benefits of ditching your car in favor of a bike .
Such rides are usually limited to downtown areas , but Crimanimalz are taking them to the freeways of Los Angeles to prove that riding a bike is faster than creeping through bumper - to - bumper traffic .
Crimanimalz first appeared around the end of last year after Santa Monica police started coming down hard on the monthly Critical Mass ride .
" The freeway is the last stronghold of the car , so when you 've got 30
cyclists flying down the lanes , you feel like General Custer , except you feel like the good guys , " said Alex Cantarero , another of the group " People look on the bicycle as an anachronism .
Now with high gas prices , the car looks like an anachronism . "
Crimanimalz has held three Crimanimal Mass rides since April 18 , when 15 cyclists rode almost three miles on the Santa Monica and San Diego freeways .
They have n't had much trouble with the California Highway Patrol , who managed to nab two of the cyclists in Friday 's rides but let them off with a lecture even though Section 21960 ( a ) of the California Vehicle Code gives police the authority to cite cyclists for riding on highways .
Bay Area cyclists have n't been quite so lucky .
They 've been busted biking over the Bay Bridge as part of their campaign to get a bike lane added to the span .
The Crimanimalz plan to keep pushing their luck - they 're promising more Crimanimal rides .
" We want to do a bigger freeway with more riders , " said Cantarero .
The rides have garnered mixed reaction from cyclists at the Midnight Ridazz website .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Short - term exposure to smog , or ozone , is clearly linked to premature deaths that should be taken into account when measuring the health benefits of reducing air pollution , a National Academy of Sciences review concludes .
The findings contradict arguments made by some White House officials that the connection between smog and premature death has not been shown sufficiently , and that the number of saved lives should not be calculated in determining clean air benefits .
The report released Tuesday by a panel of the Academy 's National Research Council says government agencies " should give little or no weight " to such arguments .
WHAT'S 'SMOGGY '? : USA TODAY analyzes EPA 's rules UNLIKELY LOCATIONS : Unsuspecting counties are smog centers " The committee has concluded from its review of health - based evidence that short - term exposure to ambient ozone is likely to contribute to premature deaths , " the 13 - member panel said .
It added that " studies have yielded strong evidence that short - term exposure to ozone can exacerbate lung conditions , causing illness and hospitalization and can potentially lead to death . "
The panel examined short - term exposure — up to 24 hours — to high levels of ozone , but said more studies also were needed on long - term chronic exposure where the risk of premature death " may be larger than those observed in acute effects studies alone . "
Ground - level ozone is formed from nitrogen oxide and organic compounds created by burning fossil fuels and is demonstrated often by the yellow haze or smog that lingers in the air .
Ozone exposure is a leading cause of respiratory illnesses and especially affects the elderly , those with respiratory problems and children .
While premature deaths from ozone exposure is greater among individuals with lung and heart disease , the report said such deaths are not restricted to people who are at a high risk of death within a few days .
The scientists said they could not determine , based on a review of health studies , whether there is a threshold below which no fatalities can be assured from ozone exposure .
If there is such a point , it is below the ozone levels allowed for public health .
Environmentalists and health advocates have argued that a string of health studies and surveys show that exposure to smoggy air not only aggravates respiratory problems , but annually causes thousands of deaths .
But in a number of instances the EPA and the White House Office of Management and Budget , which reviews regulations , have been at odds over the certainty of a link between smog levels and deaths .
The Academy 's report " could have important consequences " on such future disputes , said attorney Vicky Patton of the advocacy group Environmental Defense .
She said the OMB in a number of air pollution regulations has sought to minimize the relationship of pollution and premature deaths , resulting in a lower calculation of health benefits from pollution reductions .
" This has been used by industry to try to attack health standards by minimizing the societal benefits , " said Patton .
One such case involves the EPA 's decision last month to toughen the ozone health standard , reducing the allowable concentration in the air .
When the cost - benefit analysis was being prepared in connection with the rulemaking , the OMB argued there is " considerable uncertainty " in the association between ozone levels and deaths .
As a result , the EPA issued a wide cost - benefit range from an annual net societal cost of $ 20 billion to a savings of $ 23 billion , depending largely on whether one takes into account lives saved from ozone - related premature deaths .
OMB officials also have objected to the EPA quantifying ozone - related mortality benefits in new emissions standards for lawn mowers and other small engines that release large amounts of ozone - forming pollution .
In response , the EPA removed " all references to quantified ozone benefits " in the proposed rule , according to an e-mail sent by EPA to the OMB .
The small engine regulation is awaiting final action .

As tradition in years past with LAist , we visited the tri-annual UCLA Undie Run last month for the Spring Quarter midnight event just prior to graduation .
To say the least , the party was massively huge .
It took just under 20 minutes for the thousands of students to get through the Strathmore tunnel .
The event was so wild that LAist photographer Tom Andrews ' camera came to near death in a water balloon fight ( everything is okay now ! ) , people were swinging from trees , the police put on their tactical / riot gear and there was a much more variety of happenings going on this time around .
UCLA student Ryan D. Knight also helped out by contributing many of the wonderful crowd shots .
And with that , finally , here 's your Undie Run .
See you next December .
Russian soldiers today held blindfolded Georgian servicemen at gunpoint and commandeered US Humvees in a dramatic sequence of events in Poti , a key Black Sea port .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe stated that if Russia has seized any US military equipment in Georgia , it must return it immediately .
In Poti , on the Black Sea , Russian forces blocked access to the naval and commercial ports this morning and towed the missile boat Dioskuria , one of the navy 's most sophisticated vessels , out of sight of observers .
A loud explosion was heard minutes later .

Several hours later , an Associated Press photographer saw Russian trucks and armored personnel carriers leaving the port with about 20 blindfolded and handcuffed men riding on them .
Port spokesman Eduard Mashevoriani said the men were Georgian soldiers .
The Russians also took with them four Humvees that were at the port awaiting shipment back to the United States after taking part in earlier US - Georgian military exercises .
The deputy head of Russia 's general staff , Col. - Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said in Moscow that Russian forces plan to remain in Poti until a local administration is formed , but did not give further details .
He also justified previous seizures of Georgian soldiers as necessary to crack down on soldiers who were " out of any kind of control ... acting without command . "
A small column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles left Gori on Tuesday , and a Russian officer said they were heading back to South Ossetia and then Russia .
It was the first sign of a Russian pullback of troops from Georgia .
The column , which also apparently included a mobile rocket - launcher , passed the village of Ruisi , outside Gori on the road to South Ossetia on Tuesday afternoon .
Col .
Igor Konoshenkov , a Russian military officer , told The Associated Press at the scene the unit was headed for South Ossetia and , ultimately , back to Russia .
He gave no timetable for when the unit would reach Russia .

Konoshenkov said it was part of the Russian pullback mandated by a cease - fire that requires both sides to return to positions held before fighting broke out Aug. 7 in South Ossetia , a separatist Georgian province with close ties to Russia .
Elsewhere , Russia they exchanged POWs with Georgia and pulled back some troops from the strategic city of Gori .
It was a day of deeply mixed messages that left the small , war - battered country full of anxiety about whether Russia was aiming for a long - term military presence in Georgia or whether it was just trying to inflict maximum damage before adhering to a EU - brokered cease - fire and troop pullout .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
You 've no doubt heard the language by now -- that Americans are plagued by an oil addiction .
More oil drilling could act like a nicotine patch for smokers , an addiction expert says .
In his 2006 State of the Union address , President Bush used the analogy while pushing for more research into alternative energy sources , saying , " here we have a serious problem .
America is addicted to oil . "
But is U.S. dependence on oil a true " addiction " ?
Jack Henningfield , an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University who has extensively studied addictions , said there are parallels .
" Oil addiction is not an addiction in the medical sense , like a drug addiction or a tobacco addiction , " Henningfield said .
" But it is an addiction in the sense that powerful behaviors are involved .
They 're difficult to change , [ and ] it can be agonizing for people to change . "
Henningfield said that when it comes to substance addiction , the brain rewires itself to depend on the chemical .
Similarly , in the case of oil , Henningfield noted , " our nation has been rewired .
Our national infrastructure has been wired by cheap plentiful oil . "
Watch Henningfield discuss addiction »
So , how does Bush 's proposal for more oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge fit in to the science of addiction ?
Without commenting on the effectiveness of that proposal , Henningfield said the idea behind it can be compared to a smoker using a nicotine patch .
" We have to give people ... some kind of aid to just function and just get along , " Henningfield said .
He added , however , that while studies show that aids such as the nicotine patch can help people function in the short term , as part of an effective long - term solution , additional drilling " may do little to actually help people in the short or long term to the oil addiction problem " and " could actually divert attention away from long - term solutions . "
Democrats argue that Bush 's proposal would only enable America 's oil addiction .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said recently , " Foreign oil , the president said we were addicted to it .
And what does he want to do ?
He wants to reinforce the addiction . "
Pelosi has said she will not schedule votes in the House of Representatives to lift the bans on offshore drilling and oil exploration in ANWR .
Henningfield said that 's why any strategy to break an addiction must have a long - term goal .
Ultimately , he said , kicking any habit can boil down to economics , as smoking studies have shown .
" Money talks for addictions .
Money gets people 's attention .
And the most important single driver to get people to quit smoking is the rising cost of cigarettes , " Henningfield said .
" So , with addictions -- whether it 's cocaine , nicotine or oil -- money talks . "

Jason Hoppin , twincities.com — St. Paul is facing two new lawsuits related to protest activity at September ’s Republican National Convention .
Both suits were announced Monday , each claiming a designated protest area , which will house a large stage with amplified sound for the duration of the Sept. 1 - 4 event , is inadequate .
The suits also ask a Ramsey County judge to force the city to spell out the rules under which protesters will be allowed to march .
“ Basically , nobody knows what the rules are except the police , ” said Chuck Samuelson , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota .
The organization also represented a group of protesters in federal court over a city - designated Sept. 1 protest route to the Xcel Energy Center , where John McCain will accept his party ’s presidential nomination .
The ACLU is representing several plaintiffs in one case , including activist Coleen Rowley , who rose to prominence as an FBI whistleblower after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , and a group called Impeach for Peace .
The National Lawyer ’s Guild is representing a separate group in the second case , including the Welfare Rights Committee , Twin Cities Peace Campaign and Mick Kelly , a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the RNC and Stop the War .
Kelly already has a suit against the city over what he claims was an unlawful detention by police for passing out leaflets outside the Xcel Energy Center during a speech by Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama earlier this summer .
“ What we ’re trying to do with this lawsuit is open up more space on the streets and sidewalks for people to raise their voices against the war the Republicans are waging at home and abroad , ” Kelly said .
But the city , which won a federal suit over the protest route , maintains it has gone the extra mile to accommodate protesters .
A march planned for Sept. 1 — the day Vice President Dick Cheney and President Bush are expected to address the convention — is expected to draw 50,000 people , and a number of smaller marches are in the works .
“ From the city ’s perspective , we granted a permit that affords unprecedented access and accommodations for the protesters , ” said St. Paul City Attorney John Choi .
“ This really is an attempt by the lawyers to get another bite at the apple . ”
A protest area slated for the Democratic National Convention in Denver is smaller than the one planned in St. Paul and further away from the venue .
While the St. Paul area is across the street from the Xcel Energy Center , the one in Denver is more than 700 feet away .
Protesters remain suspicious that the city will impose last - minute , onerous restrictions for the march , especially after a recent decision to revoke all permits for Hamm Plaza , located across Sixth Street from downtown St. Paul ’s Landmark Center .
St. Paul Parks and Recreation Director Bob Bierscheid said they were yanked because of a changing security plan .
The suits are being brought under the Minnesota Constitution , and Samuelson denied the ACLU and the National Lawyer ’s Guild are trying to relitigate a case they lost in federal court .
“ The federal Constitution is the floor , ” Samuelson said .
“ No state … can give you less rights than the federal Constitution .
All states , including Minnesota , give you more . ”
Monday was the deadline to sign up for a designated speaking slot on the protest stage , but officials said there were n’t enough entries to fill the slots .
Assignments were to be finalized today using a lottery system , but the deadline will likely be extended .
There are 48 50 - minute slots .
Kelly said the groups he is in touch with are not seeking a designated speaking slot .
“ To my knowledge , they ’re not .
Groups that I ’m aware of are not going to be signing up for a police - organized rally in the public viewing area , ” Kelly said .
“ The stage in the public viewing area is an attempt to make it seem as if the city ’s interested in free speech , ” he added .
“ In fact , it ’s just a cover for the shabby way the city ’s treated the protesters . ”
The city takes strong exception .
Choi repeated that a federal judge has already validated the city ’s accommodations .
“ Our position is , the Minnesota Constitution affords no additional protections than the U.S. Constitution , ” he said .

Java7のクロージャの提案者の一人，Neal Gafterのブログが大変参考になるので，ちょっと野良翻訳してみよう．
クロージャの定 義
Java 言語にクロージャを追加しようという我々の提案に関して混乱があるようだ．そもそも，Javaにはすでに無名インナークラスという形で，クロージャがあるのではないか?
すでにあるものをなぜまた追加しようというのか?
一部の人々には，我々の提案には，クロージャとは関係ないものが含まれているように思われているようだ．例えば，control invocation 構文，null型 ，Unreachable , 型パラメータ付きthrows，関数インターフェイス型，「非ローカル」な
returnなどがそうだ．Javapolisでの講演で，なぜこれらの機能が提案に含まれているのかを，これまで不可能だったことを可能にするための実用的な観点から説明したつもりだ．しかし，この講演は別の疑問を招いてしまった:ではなぜそれをJavaの「クロージャ」と呼ぶのか?
このブログポストで，クロージャの定義が，われわれの提案の機能とどのように関係しているのか，そしてどの機能が定義から導かれているのか(もしくは導かれていないのか)を示そう．
クロージャの定義を議論する前に，この言葉が導入された歴史的な文脈を理解しておこう．
Lisp言語が ，1950 年代に John MacCarthy らによって，M.I.T.でつくられた．この言語の機能の一つに，ラムダと呼ばれる関数の値を持つ式があった．「ラムダ」という名前は，数学的形式論のλ-calculusからとられたものだ．Lispはこの形式論に基づく言語ではないのだが，ラムダはλ-calculusにおける役割と大体同じ役割，つまり関数の値を持つ式の構文という役割を，Lispでも果たしている．McCarthyは，Lispが非常に効率的に実装できるように，理想的にはコンパイルできるように，設計されるべきだと考えていた．この効率への欲求が，言語の設計に影響を与えた．
Lispは動的スコープと呼ばれるスコープルールを用いていた．論理的には，動的スコープの言語では，変数参照が評価されると，実行時環境はその変数名が定義されているスコープを見つけるまでコールスタックを検索しなければならない．しかし実際には，それぞれの変数名に対して現在の値をキャッシュする値セルをかんりすることによって，定数時間で，変数参照を解決することが可能だった．動的スコープは，インタプリタでもコンパイラでも簡単に実装できた．一部のとても賢い人たちは，動的スコープをただ利用するだけでなく，動的スコープに深く依存した，今でいうプログラミングパターンを編み出した．しかし，すぐに動的スコープにはFUNARG問題と呼ばれる，厄介な問題があることがわかった．
さて，時間を1970年代に進めよう．ラジオからは，Elton John , Emerson Lake & Palmer , Joni Mitchell , The Captain and Tennille , John Denver , Paul Simon , Paul McCartney and Wings , ABBA , David Bowie , Janis Ian , Aerosmith , Fleetwood Mac , Heart , Queenが流れていたころだ．このころは，いくつもの有名なLisp方言が使われていた．InterLisp , MacLisp , UCI - Lisp , Stanford Lisp 1.6 , ユタ大学 Standard Lispなどで，これらはすべて動的スコープだった．そのようななかで，Guy Steele と Gerald Jay Sussman が，非常に単純 なLisp方言であ るSchemeを開発したのだ．
Schemeには，他 のLisp方言とは異なる点があった．Schemeはλ-calculusや他の数学的記法と同様にレキシカルスコープだったのだ．つまり，変数参照は，外側のラムダ式が評価された時点でアクティブなラムダ式をレキシカルに取り囲む変数定義に束縛される．
このセマンティクスを実装の観点から説明するためにクロージャが導入された．ラムダ式を評価するとクロージャが作られる．クロージャは，オブジェクトとして表現された関数で，ラムダ式の中で使用されていて，ラムダ式の外で定義されているすべての変数への参照を含む．このような変数を自由変数と呼ぶ．後で，クロージャオブジェクト，つまり関数に引数を適用すると，クロージャに取り込まれた変数束縛が，コード中の自由変数に意味を与える．クロージャは単なる抽象的な言語要素ではなく，その実装法でもあるのだ．
そのころ のLispコミュニティの多くの人たちにとって，クロージャを用いたLisp方言は意味をなさなかった．このような言語は，一般的なプログラミングテクニックを使えないようにするだけでなく，明らかに効率が悪いのだ．しばらくの間，この件に対する議論がなされ，Guy Steeleは一連 の 「 Lambda the Ultimate _____ 」 ( _____ には Imperative , Declarative , GOTO , Opcodeが入る ) と題する論文を発表し，レキシカルスコープのラムダ式(
クロージャ)の強力さを説明した．数年早送りすると，議論にはだいたい決着がついた．レキシカルスコープが正しく，動的スコープは間違っていたのだ．われわれは教訓を得た．クロージャという言葉は，レキシカルスコープの無名関数のことを意味するにもかかわらず，バグや実装の効率などのたくさんの理由で，その意味を取り違えるということがあり得るということ．また，言語の設計が実装を駆動するべきであって，その逆ではないこと，である．ラムダや無名関数値があろうと無かろうと，事実上すべての言語で，動的スコープではなく，レキシカルスコープが用いられている．しかし，クロージャの基本的な定義は，その起源がLispにあることを物語っている．
このころ ，Smalltalkがあらわれた．Smalltalkは，最も純粋で単純なオブジェクト指向言語で，すべてがオブジェクトである．オブジェクト指向言語では，レキシカルスコープに少し変更が必要になる．すべての名前をレキシカルスコープで束縛するのではなく，メソッド内に現れる自由変数は，そのメソッドが属するオブジェクトのスコープで束縛するのである．言い換えれば，メソッドに登場する名前は，「現在の」オブジェクトのメンバに束縛される．現在のオブジェクトは，selfという名前でアクセスできる．もう一つの些細だが面白い点はSmalltalkでは " ^ 式 " という構文で，メソッドから脱出できることである．この事実が持つ重要性は後で見る．
Smalltalkでは，メソッドだけがコード抽象方法ではない．ブロック式を書くことができる．ブロック式は本質的にラムダである．初期のいくつかの方言ではブロックに制約があったが，ほとんどの近代的なSmalltalkにはそのような制約は無く，Schemeのラムダと完全に等価なものになっている．Smalltalkのブロック内の自由変数は，ブロックの外側のスコープに束縛される．多くの場合外側のスコープはそれを取り囲むメソッドである．ブロック式を評価した結果はクロージャであり，他のすべてのものと同様に，クロージャもオブジェクトである．この場合，このオブジェクトは，ブロックの表すコードを実行するためのメソッドを持つ．
無名関 数( クロージャ ) はただかっこ良く見えたから，とか，他の言語でうまくいっているから，という理由で無目的にSmalltalkに導入された訳ではない．無名関数は，完全に，そして注意深く言語に統合されている．既存の言語に無名関数をうまく統合することも可能だが，初期の段階で統合することにはメリットがある．Guy Steelが一連の論文で示したように無名関数は，非常に強力で，他の言語機能を包含する．早い段階で無名関数を導入すれば，言語機能を追加する時間を節約して，ライブラリで実装することが可能になる．Smalltalkが言語として直接サポートしている制御構造はごくわずかである．条件文の if ですら，ライブラリメソッドとして実装されており，ブロックを用いて呼び出される．
Smalltalk のブロック とSchemeのそれとでは，2つの点が異なる．ひとつは，ブロック内のselfが，ブロックの外側のコンテクストでのselfを意味すること．特に，クロージャオブジェクトを指すわけではないこと．もう一つは，メソッドからリターンする「^ 式 」
は，外側のメソッドからのリターンを意味しており，クロージャ実行のメソッドからのリターンを意味しないこと．これらの2点は，Schemeにはレキシカルスコープの言語要素が一つ(変数束縛)しかないのに対して，Smalltalkには3つのレキシカルスコープ言語要素を持っていることに起因している．3つとは，束縛( Schemeと同じ) ，リターン文の対象，" self "
が指すもの，の3つである．上で示したクロージャの定義では，「自由変数の束縛」についてしか触れていないが，それはこの定義がSchemeのためになされたからであり，Schemeでは名前(変数)束縛だけが，レキシカルスコープの言語要素だからでる．Common
Lispに は" return " と" goto " があり，これらもクロージャ内でレキシカルに捕捉される．Guy Steeleのラムダ論文で書かれたとおりに，クロージャの力を存分に発揮させるためには，すべてのレキシカルスコープの言語要素をクロージャで捕捉しなければならない．他の言語をカバーできるようにクロージャの定義を一般化するには，より一般的な単語を使う必要があるだろう．「自由変数の束縛」のかわりに，例えば「レキシカルスコープの言語要素」を使えばいいかもしれない．しかしこれでは，クロージャという単語の出自が分からなくなってしまう．
さて，25年ほど早送りしてみよう．1970年代に聞いていたのと同じ音楽がまた流れるようになっていて，われわれは，JavaというSchemeよりもSmalltalkよりも格段に複雑な言語にクロージャを追加しようとしている．追加するのは，クロージャがかっこいいからでも，他の言語でうまくいっているからでも，ただ退屈したからでもない．クロージャが，プログラマの武器庫における強力で柔軟な武器になるからであり，他の既存の書き方で書くよりもプログラムがより読みやすくなることが期待できるからであり，最近提案された言語拡張の多くが，クロージャによって不要になるからだ．クロージャのパワーを完全に引き出すためには，レキシカルスコープ持つ言語要素をすべて捕捉しなければならない．Javaにおける，レキシカルスコープを持つ言語要素にはなにがあるだろうか?
変数名の意 味
メソッド名の意 味
型名の意 味
thisの意味
文ラベルの意 味
ラベルのついていないbreak文が抜け出す場所
ラベルのついていないcontinue文が抜け出す場所
宣言され，キャッチされる例外の集合
return文の戻り先
変数へのアサインメント状態
変数への非アサインメント状態
コードへの可達 性
さらに ，JavaにはSchemeやSmalltalkと大きく異なった点がある．Javaは静的型付き言語なのである．すなわち，すべての式は，コンパイル時に型付けされていなければならない．したがって，クロージャを追加するのであれば，クロージャには適切な型がついていなければならない．クロージャは無名関数であるから，関数型を言語に追加するのが自然だ．しかしこれは必須というわけではない．われわれはクロージャ機構として2つバージョン(nominalとfunctional)を提案しているが，そのうちの一つが示す通り，関数型を追加しなくてもクロージャを追加することが可能だと考えている(高階プログラミングをするには実用にならないだろうが ) ．
われわれの，クロージャ提案は，上記のチェックリストのすべてに対応している．提案には他の機能も含まれている(制御起動構文とクロージャ変換)が，これらは，直接クロージャの定義には関係ない．これらはクロージャを既存の言語機能とうまく統合させるためのものなのだ．さらに，規格のなかでは触れられていない追加機能(適切な末尾再起など)も，クロージャのパワーをフルに実現するために必要となるだろう．
さて，無名内部クラスはどうだろうか?
無名内部クラスは，上述のチェックリストのどれも満たさない．無名クラスでローカル変数を使用するには，外側のスコープでfinalを付けなければいけないということは，とりあえずおいておこう．問題は，変数名が正しいスコープで解決されていないということなのだ．変数名が，外側のスコープではなく定義された無名クラスの中で解決されてしまう．インターフェイスのインスタンスを作るような場合には，これはあまり問題にはならない．多くのインターフェイスには変数(定数)は定義されていないからである．無名内部クラスは，チェックリストの他の項目すべてを満たさない．他のクロージャ提案のほとんども，このリストの項目に対応しようとしていないので，既存の言語要素と同様に，クロージャのパワーを活用することはできない．
これまでのべたプログラミング言語の理屈はさておき，無名内部クラスは実用上のクロージャとしての機能を果たすことができるだろうか?
わたしはその答えはノーであると既に示したつもりだ．クロージャで書くことのできるすべてのプログラムにたいして，大体等価なプログラムを無名内部クラスで書くことはできるだろう．これは，Java言語がチューリング完全であるからである．しかしそのためには，プログラムの目的とは何の関係ものない，面倒で大々的なリファクタリングをしなければならないだろう．実際，アセンブラ言語ですら，大体等価なプログラムを書くことはできる．その努力に耐えられる気力があるならば，だが．これに対して，真のクロージャは，表現可能な抽象の種類を追加することで言語を強化してくれるのだ．

Unsuccessful and unhappy visits to Germany and Spain in search of medical care in his youth have left him with a distrust of doctors .
This , combined with his loyalty to his mother 's faith , and concerns about life without the mask to which he has become accustomed , appear to have instilled Jose with a sullen fatalism about his condition .
In one country , which Newsweek polled in June , the electorate is split R26/ D38/I36 .
In the other country , which Newsweek polled a few weeks later , that country 's electorate is split R32/D32/I36 .
In one country , polled in June , 84 % of the electorate is white .
In the other country , polled a few weeks later , 88 % of the electorate is white .
In one country , polled in June , 19 % of the registered voters are under 40 , 39 % are between 40 and 59 , and 42 % are 60 or older .
In the other country , polled a few weeks later , only 17 % of the registered voters are under 40 , 38 % are between 40 and 59 , and 45 % are 60 or older .
In the younger , slightly more racially diverse and much more Democratic country , Barack Obama was supposedly leading by 15 points .
In the country that is somewhat older , is somewhat whiter , and is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats , Barack Obama is supposedly leading McCain by only 3 points .
According to Newsweek , comparing these results shows " what a difference a few weeks can make . "
A more valid conclusion is that it shows what a difference polling two very different countries can make .
Why does this silliness happen ?
DemFromCT gave us the answer a few weeks ago .
IN 1960 Tomi Ungerer was returning from his native France to New York City , his adopted home , when he realized that three men were walking uncomfortably close to him as he was leaving a terminal at the old Idlewild airport in Queens .
One ordered him to drop his suitcases .
Then the others latched onto him , hustled him into a car and drove him to a nearby building where they questioned him obliquely about his travel and his political affiliations .
“ It was just like in a movie , ” Mr. Ungerer recalled recently with a quiet laugh .
“ I do n’t know whether it was the F.B.I. or whoever they were .
They even opened the soles of my shoes . ”
It ’s the kind of trench - coat caper that does n’t generally feature a beloved children ’s book author as the abductee .
But then , few children ’s book authors in those wary cold war years made a habit of playing poker with the Cuban envoy to the United Nations , as Mr. Ungerer did , or applied for a visa to visit China .
Or had a side career publishing books of often disturbing erotica .

Miley Cyrus Says NO ! to Nudity ( Photos )
Rumors having been making the rounds over the past few days suggesting thatwas interested in playing the lead role , that calls for nudity , in Undiscovered Gyrl .
The film project is an adaptation of a new book by Allison Burnett that tells the tale of a teenager from the suburbs who heads down a bad path with her partying and promiscuity .
Miley 's rep was quick to squelch that little tidbit as just a very BAD rumor .
The Disney phenom is ' barely ' getting over her recent Vanity Fair photo fiasco and certainly wo n't be lining up for nudity at this juncture .
Smart girl .
The singer and actress has been busy in LA filming her latest Hannah Montana movie .
The young sensation has had her share of bad publicity with personal photos that have flooded the internet in 2008 .
It is safe to say that Disney is keeping a much tighter reign on their young superstar right now .
Her most recent round of television appearances have been wholesome and squeaky clean , much to the networks relief .

A recent mission to Iraq headed by top archaeologists from the U.S. and U.K. who specialize in Mesopotamia found that , contrary to received wisdom , southern Iraq 's most important historic sites -- eight of them -- had neither been seriously damaged nor looted after the American invasion .
This , according to a report by staff writer Martin Bailey in the July issue of the Art Newspaper .
The article has caused confusion , not to say consternation , among archaeologists and has been largely ignored by the mainstream press .
Not surprising perhaps , since reports by experts blaming the U.S. for the postinvasion destruction of Iraq's ...

Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) was indicted today on seven counts of making false statements in Washington , D.C .
You can read the indictment here , which focuses on Stevens ' alleged concealment of gifts from the Alaskan oil company VECO and the company 's CEO Bill Allen ; according to the indictment , Stevens did not disclose them in the annual Senate financial disclosure forms .
The indictment is just the latest move in the FBI 's sprawling Alaskan public corruption investigation of VECO 's ties to state and federal lawmakers .
Stevens has not yet surrendered to authorities .
At a press conference today , Matthew Friedrich , the chief of the Justice Department 's criminal division , said that Stevens would be allowed to turn himself in .
Our call to Stevens ' lawyer was not immediately returned .
According to the indictment , Stevens accepted more than $ 250,000 in gifts from VECO and Allen , the largest coming in the form of a major renovation to Stevens ' home in Girdwood , Alaska , which involved jacking up and resting the house on stilts to add a new first floor .
VECO employees and contractors performed " significant portions " of the renovations , says the indictment , and Stevens never reimbursed the oil company for the work .
The indictment also says that in 1999 , Allen exchanged a new Land Rover for Stevens ' 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang and $ 5,000 .
The Mustang was worth less than $ 20,000 .
While prosecutors do not allege a quid pro quo , the indictment does charge that " it was part of the scheme " that Stevens " could and did use his official position and his office on behalf of VECO . "
Among the favors requested by Allen and VECO enumerated in the indictment are funding requests , federal grants and help with " both federal and state issues " concerning VECO 's construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska .
Update :
In a statement , Stevens says that he's " never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form " and that he 's innocent .
He also says that he 's temporarily stepped down from his positions as the ranking member on both the Senate commerce and appropriations committees in accordance with GOP bylaws .
Two of Britain 's leading civil liberties groups are to offer a £ 1,000 reward for the fingerprints of the Prime Minister or Home Secretary - a move that could leave both groups open to prosecution for incitement .
The anti-ID cards group No2ID and the campaign organisation Privacy International will this week take out spoof ' Wanted ' posters in tube stations and pub lavatories offering the cash to anyone who can lawfully obtain either the fingerprints of Gordon Brown or Jacqui Smith .
An initial print run of 10,000 has been commissioned .
The posters , resembling those issued by US sheriffs hunting outlaws in the Wild West , are backed by an internet campaign and accuse Brown and Smith of ' identity theft ' .
They stipulate that ' the fingerprint must be obtained lawfully and can be located on a beer glass , doorknob or any object with a hard surface .
Corroborating evidence is required to ascertain the identity of these thieves . '
The £ 1,000 reward will then be paid to the charity of the ' bounty hunter 's choice ' , as the posters put it .
The poster continues : ' As fingerprint technology spreads , this government will essentially have back - door access to your computers , files , wallets and even cars and homes .
We are offering this bounty to teach these individuals a lesson about personal information security . '
Phil Booth , of No2ID , said the campaign was designed to highlight the increasing sensitivity of fingerprinting as a political issue .
' Having committed the largest data breach in history , the government is about to perpetrate the largest identity theft in history , ' he said .
' I'm sure the government will seek legal advice to see if we can be prosecuted , ' said Simon Davies , director of Privacy International .
' But it would be a foolish government that would try to charge civil rights groups . '

Zimbabwe 's central bank has said it will revalue its currency on 1 August as part of efforts to fight the effects of hyperinflation .
The bank 's governor , Gideon Gono , has announced 10 zeros will be lopped off the Zimbabwe dollar , making 10bn dollars now equal to one dollar .
Only last week , the government introduced the Z$ 100 bn note .
South Africa's Thabo Mbeki is visiting Harare after crisis talks between government and opposition were halted .
He will meet President Robert Mugabe , whom the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) have accused of stealing the election earlier this year .
We would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks ... so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
President Robert Mugabe Mr Mugabe said he wanted the talks to succeed but warned that " sometimes compromise is difficult " .
The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says it has emerged that President Mbeki held a meeting in the South African capital , Pretoria , on Tuesday with the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai .
Mr Mbeki , the lead mediator on the Zimbabwe crisis , has said the two sides are determined to reach an agreement within a two - week time - frame at the talks in a secret location near Pretoria .
But opposition sources said the talks have reached deadlock .
Emergency threat
After the currency announcement , Mr Mugabe warned the country 's businessmen in a televised address to stop profiteering or face emergency measures .
" If you drive us more than you have done we will impose emergency measures , and we do n't want to place our country in a situation of emergency rules , they can be tough rules you know , " Reuters news agency reports him as saying .
Mr Mugabe blames Zimbabwe 's economic problems on white businessmen and Western sanctions , rather than his own policies .
The latest currency announcement is another desperate attempt by Mr Gono to stabilise Zimbabwe 's collapsing economy , our correspondent says .
" The Zimbabwe dollar will be redenominated by a factor of one to 10 , which means we are removing 10 zeros from our monetary value .
Ten billion dollars today will be reduced to Z$ 1 ... effective from 1 August , " Mr Gono said in a television broadcast .

The high rate constrained the operations of the country 's computer systems , with computers , calculators and banks ' cash machines not able to handle transactions in billions and trillions of dollars , he added .
The new Z$ 100bn ( under $ 2 , £ 1 ) note introduced last week is not enough to buy a loaf of bread .
Inflation is officially running at more than 2,000,000 % , but many analysts believe the true inflation figure is at least 9,000,000 % .
A BBC reporter in Harare said that on the day he recently went shopping , a tray of 24 eggs went up from Z$ 375 bn to Z$ 600 bn .

Bitter hope in Harare
So far this year , Zimbabwe has been forced to print Z$ 100 m , Z$ 250 m and Z$ 500 m notes in rapid succession , now mostly worthless .
Mr Mugabe said he would like a speedy conclusion to talks with the MDC so " we can focus in the future our attention around our economy " , AFP news agency reports .
The negotiations began last week after Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai met for the first time in a decade .
Mr Tsvangirai pushed Mr Mugabe into second place in the first round of voting on 29 March but he pulled out of a 27 June run-off election after a wave of deadly attacks against his supporters .
The MDC says that more than 120 of its supporters have been killed , some 5,000 abducted and 200,000 forced to flee their homes after being attacked by ruling Zanu - PF militias and security agents .

GRAND RAPIDS , Mich . -
The oft - derided " cubicle " is turning 40 years old this month .
The open - office style was originally known as the " Action Office , " and was introduced by West Michigan 's Herman Miller Company in 1968 .
Bill Crooks was one of the first people in America to work in a cubicle .
He started in Herman Miller 's customer service department in 1967 , shortly before the Action Office concept was introduced .
Crooks says he was one of the guinea pigs to test the Action Office " and that was the great part because we had the hands on , helped install it , helped the installers install it , and when it was changed , we would work with it .
So we really understood the furniture . "
Although , Crooks says Action Office was a tough sell at first .
He recalls one of the first meetings when the design was introduced to Herman Miller executives .
Crooks says , " After the presentation , they showed us this set up of really ugly stuff and I , with all my wisdom thought , that is never going to sell . "
But , the concept caught on quickly .
Crooks helped many major companies adjust their entire business style using Action Office , including Texas Instruments , Citibank and , " There was another small company out in White Plains , New York I went to .
It was called MasterCard ... just come into existence . "
Robert Propst designed the Action Office to change with the evolving work space .
Crooks says , " You also could have a stand up work surface and the sit down work surface . "
When Propst explained the need for the Action Office , Crooks says , " They were describing the office changes that were in the future and they were really talking about stuff way out there , like the paperless office . "
From reams and reams of paper files , to a computer on every desktop , Action Office has changed with the way we work , and has changed the way we work .
Herman Miller grew exponentially after Action Office was introduced 40 years ago .
It 's a design many other companies have adapted as well .

Suicide
Bible passages dealing with suicide
Sponsored link .
The Bible contains a number of references of men seeking suicide , either
by taking direct action or by begging God to kill them on the spot .
In these passages , the authors of the Bible do not appear to consider suicide to be a great moral sin .
The act of committing suicide or of asking that God kill them are simply reported in a factual manner .
The authors do not interpret these acts as sinful .
They seem to be regarded simply as straightforward personal decisions .
However , the Christian church has traditionally considered suicide to be a great moral sin .
Some denominations have even refused to bury people who have committed suicide in consecrated land .

An F.B.I. briefing on Monday was supposed to bolster the agency ’s conclusion that a lone , disturbed bioterrorism scientist was responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people , sickened 17 others and terrified the country .
It fell short of its goal .
The F.B.I. spent years pointing a finger at a different suspect .
It is not enough for the agency to brush off continuing skepticism .
“ There ’s always going to be a spore on a grassy knoll , ” Vahid Majidi , the chief of the agency ’s weapons of mass destruction division told reporters .
A group of independent experts needs to look hard at the F.B.I. ’s technical analysis and detective work that combined to convince investigators that the mailed anthrax must have come from Dr. Bruce Ivins , a scientist at the Army ’s bioterrorism lab in Fort Detrick in Maryland .
The core of the F.B.I. ’s case , was the use of new microbial forensic techniques to match the mailed anthrax with anthrax that the agency says was prepared by Dr. Ivins and contained in a flask that he controlled .
Experts identified four distinct genetic markers among the anthrax spores in the mailings .
They analyzed anthrax samples gathered from laboratories around the world .
Ultimately , they concluded that only anthrax batches prepared by Dr. Ivins contained all four mutations .
One of the most exciting things in the Java world right now is the work being done to get other programming languages to run on the virtual machine .
There is a lot of buzz around JRuby , Groovy , Scala , and the JavaScript engine Rhino .
But why stop there ?
If you really want to take a step outside the mainstream and dive into something completely different from Java , Lisp is a great option .
And there are several open - source implementations of the Lisp programming language for the JVM out there , ready to be explored .
So what makes Lisp worth looking at ?
For one thing , this fifty - year - old language has been the catalyst of many ideas we take for granted today .
The if - then - else construct originally came out of Lisp , as did early attempts at object - orientation and automatic memory management with garbage collection .
Lexical closures -- a hot topic for Java programmers right now -- were first explored in Lisp back in the seventies .
And beyond that , Lisp still has many other unique features that other languages have yet to adopt , the kind of good ideas that are bound to make a comeback in the future .
This article is aimed at Java developers curious about Lisp .
It will discuss the different dialects of Lisp that are available on the JVM today , and give you a crash course in how Lisp programming works and what makes it unique .
Finally we 'll look at how Lisp code can be integrated with a Java system .

There are plenty of both free and commercial Lisp systems available for many different platforms .
For a Java user who wants to start out exploring Lisp , staying on the JVM is a good first choice .
It 's easy to get going and you get the benefit of being able to make use of all the existing Java libraries and tools that you 're familiar with .
COMMON LISP AND SCHEME
There are two main dialects of Lisp : Common Lisp and Scheme .
They 're based on many of the same ideas , but are still different enough to stir up intense debates about which one is the better choice .
Common Lisp is an ANSI standard that was finalized in 1991 , consolidating ideas from several earlier Lisps .
It 's a large environment designed for many kinds of application development , most famously artificial intelligence .
Scheme on the other hand comes out of the academic world , is deliberately more minimalistic and has turned out to be good language for both teaching computer science and for embedded scripting .
Another couple of well - known Lisps you may have run into are the smaller application - specific DSLs , like Emacs Lisp or AutoCAD 's AutoLISP .
On the JVM there are implementations of both the main dialects , but the Schemes are more mature .
Armed Bear Common Lisp ( www.armedbear.org/abcl.html) is a reasonably complete implementation of the Common Lisp standard , but it suffers from that the distribution can't be built unless you have another Common Lisp system installed , which may be a problem for beginners .
On the Scheme - side the two main players are Kawa ( www.gnu.org/software/kawa) and SISC ( www.sisc-scheme.org -- the Second Interpreter of Scheme Code ) .
For the examples in this article , we 're going to use Kawa .
Kawa is actually a framework for creating new languages compiled to Java bytecode , with Scheme being one of the implementations .
Incidentally , its creator Per Bothner is now working for Sun on the compiler for the JavaFX project .
Another contender worth looking out for is Clojure ( clojure.sourceforge.net ) .
This is a new language , its own dialect of Lisp that sits somewhere between Scheme and Common Lisp .
Being designed directly for the JVM it has the cleanest Java integration of all the Lisps mentioned so far , as well as featuring some other exciting ideas , like built - in support for concurrency and transactional memory .
Clojure is still in an exploratory beta - stage right now , so it 's perhaps a little too early to build something on top of , but it 's definitely a project to keep your eyes on going forward .
THE READ -EVAL-PRINT-LOOP
Let 's start out by getting Kawa installed .
The distribution , a single jar - file , can be downloaded directly from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/kawa/kawa-1.9.1.jar.
Once you get the jar , add it to the classpath .
With that done you 're ready to start up the REPL by running this command :
java kawa.repl
# |kawa:1| #
This starts Kawa and gives you a prompt .
So what is this ?
REPL means READ -EVAL -PRINT -LOOP
and is a way to interface with a running Lisp system -- it READs your input , EVALuates it , PRINTs the result , and then loops back to the prompt again .
The way you develop a Lisp program is often different from the " write code , compile , run " cycle followed when programming Java .
Lisp programmers typically fire up their Lisp systems and keep them running , making the line between compile - and runtime blurry .
Within the REPL , functions and variables can be modified on the fly .
Code is dynamically interpreted or compiled .
First up , something real simple : adding two numbers together .
# |kawa:1|# (+ 1 2 )
3
This is the typical structure of a Lisp expression , or " form " .
The syntax is very consistent : the expressions are always wrapped with parenthesis , and use an prefix notation , so the plus goes before the two terms .
To make a more advanced construct , you nest several forms to build a tree structure :
# |kawa:2|# (* (+ 1 2 ) (- 3 4 ) )
-3
Scheme 's built - in functions work the same way :
# |kawa:3| # ( if (> ( string - length " Hello world " ) 5 )
( display " Longer than 5 characters " ) )
Longer than 5 characters
Here you have an if - statement checking whether a specific string is longer than five characters .
If that happens to be true , like in this case , the next expression is executed causing a message to be printed .
Note that the indentation here is for readability purposes only .
You could write this whole thing on one line if you wanted to .
The parenthesis - heavy style used for Lisp code is known as " s- expressions " .
It also doubles as a generic way to define structured data , much like XML .
Lisp has many built - in functions that let you manipulate data in s-expression format very easily , and that in turn leads to one of its strengths .
Since the syntax is so simple , writing programs that generate or modify code gets a lot simpler than in other languages .
We 'll see more of that when we get into examples of macros .
FUNCTIONS
Scheme is usually considered part of the family of functional programming languages .
Unlike the object - oriented world , the main means of abstraction here are functions and the data they operate on -- not classes and objects .
Everything you do in Scheme is really calling functions that take some arguments and return a result .
To create a function you use the define keyword :
# |kawa:4| # ( define ( add a b ) (+ a b ) )
This defines add , which takes two arguments , a and b .
The body of the function simply executes + , and automatically returns the result .
Note that there are no static type declarations .
All type checking is done at runtime , the same way as in other dynamic languages .
With the function defined , you can simply call it from the REPL :
# |kawa:5 | # ( add 1 2 ) 3
Functions are first - class citizens in the Scheme world , and can be passed around much like objects in Java .
This opens up some very interesting possibilities .
Let 's start by creating a function that takes an argument and doubles it :
# |kawa:6| # ( define ( double a ) (* a 2 ) )
And then define a list of three numbers , by calling the list function :
# |kawa:7| # ( define numbers ( list 1 2 3 ) )
Now for the exciting part :
# |kawa:8|# ( map double numbers ) ( 2 4 6 )
Here you called map , which takes two arguments : another function , and a list of some kind .
map will iterate over each of the elements in the list and call the supplied function for each one .
The results are then collected into a new list , which is what you can see getting returned to the REPL .
This is a more " functional " way to do what would be solved with a for - loop in Java .
LAMBDAS
Even more convenient is to use the lambda keyword to define an anonymous function , similar to how an anonymous inner class would work in Java .
Reworking the example above , you can the skip the definition of the intermediate double function and write your map statement as just :
# |kawa:9 | # ( map ( lambda ( a ) (* 2 a ) ) numbers )
( 2 4 6 )
It 's also possible to define a function that just returns a lambda .
A classic textbook example is this :
# |kawa:10 |# ( define ( make - adder a ) ( lambda ( b ) (+ a b ) ) )
# |kawa:11 |# ( make - adder 2 )
#
What happened here ?
First you defined a function called make - adder that takes one argument , a .
make - adder returns an anonymous function that expects another argument , " b " .
When called , this anonymous function will in turn calculate the sum of a and b .
Executing ( make - adder 2 ) -- or " give me a function that will add 2 to the argument I send to it " -- causes the REPL to report back the cryptic which is just the actual lambda procedure printed out as a string .
To use this you can do something like :
# |kawa :12 |# ( define add - 3 ( make - adder 3 ) )
# |kawa:13 |# ( add - 3 2 )
5
The great thing here is that the lambda works as a closure .
It " closes over " and keeps references to the variables that were in scope when it was created .
The lambda that was the result of the ( make - adder 3 ) call holds on to the value of a , and when ( add - 3 2 ) is executed it will be able to calculate 3 + 2 and return the expected 5 .
MACROS
The features we 've looked at so far are very similar to what can be found in newer dynamic languages .
Ruby , for example , also lets you use anonymous blocks to process collections of objects , exactly what we did with a lambda and the map function earlier .
So let 's switch gears now and look at something more uniquely Lispy : macros .
Both Scheme and Common Lisp have macro systems .
When you see people referring to Lisp as " the programmable programming language " , this is what they mean .
With macros you can actually hook into the compiler and redefine the language itself .
This is where Lisp 's uniform syntax really starts paying off and the whole thing gets really interesting .
For a simple example , let 's look at loops .
Originally there were no loops defined in the Scheme language .
The classic way to iterate over things was to either use map or recursive function calls .
Thanks to a compiler trick known as tail - call optimizations recursion can be used without blowing out the stack .
Later a very flexible do command was introduced , and using it to execute a loop would look something like this :
( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) )
( (= i 5 ) # t )
( display " Print this " ) )
Here we define an index variable , i , initialize it to zero , and set it up to be incremented by one each iteration .
The looping breaks once the expression ( = i 5 ) evaluates to true , and then #t , Scheme 's equivalent of Java 's boolean true , is returned .
Inside the loop we just print a string .
This is a lot of complicated boilerplate code if all we need is just a simple loop .
In some cases being able to do something more straight forward would be preferable , like :
( dotimes 5 ( display " Print this " ) )
Thanks to macros it is possible to add the special syntax for dotimes to the language , using the appropriately named define - syntax function :
( define - syntax dotimes
( syntax - rules ()
( ( dotimes count command ) ; Pattern to match
( do ( ( i 0 (+ i 1 ) ) ) ;
What it expands to
( (= i count ) # t )
command ) ) ) )
Executing this tells the system that any call to dotimes needs to be treated in a special way .
Scheme will use the syntax rules we defined to match a pattern and expand it before sending the result over to the compiler .
In this case the pattern is ( dotimes count command ) , which is then transformed into the regular do loop .
Execute this in the REPL , and you get :
# |kawa :14 |# ( dotimes 5 ( display " Print this " ) )
Print this Print this Print this Print this Print this #t
Two questions are bound to come up after this example .
First , why do we need to use a macro at all ?
Could n't something like this be done with a regular function ?
The answer is no - a call to a function would actually trigger the evaluation of all its arguments before they get sent off , and that would n't work in this case .
How would you handle ( do - times 0 ( format #t " Never print this " ) ) , for example ?
The evaluation needs to be deferred , and that can only be done with a macro .
Second , we 're using the variable i inside the macro .
Wo n't there be collisions if the code in the command expression happens to use the same name for one of its variables ?
No need to worry - Scheme 's macros are what 's known as " hygienic " .
The compiler automatically detects and knows how to work around naming collisions like that , completely transparent for the programmer .
Now that you 've seen this , imagine trying to add your own loop construct to Java .
It 's close to impossible .
Well , not quite perhaps -- the compiler is after all open source so you 're free to download it and get right to work , but that 's not really a realistic option .
In other dynamic languages closures can get you a bit further along the way to make the language look the way you want , but there are still cases where those constructs are not powerful or flexible enough to completely let you tweak the syntax .
This power is why Lisp often comes up as the language to beat when the topic is meta- programming or domain - specific languages .
Lisp programmers have been the long - time champions of " bottom - up programming " , when the language itself is adjusted to fit your problem domain , instead of the other way around .
CALLING SCHEME CODE FROM JAVA
One of the main benefits with running another language on top of the JVM is how code written in it can be integrated with existing applications .
It 's easy to imagine using Scheme to model some complex business logic that tends to change often , and then embedding it in a more stable Java framework .
The rule engine Jess ( www.jessrules.com) is one example of an idea going in that direction , running on the JVM but using its own Lisp - like language to declare rules .
But getting interoperability between different programming languages to work in a clean way is a tricky problem , especially when the mismatch between the two is as big as for Java and Lisp .
No standards exists for how to do this integration , and the dialects that live on the JVM all approach the problem differently .
Kawa has relatively nice support for Java integration , and we 'll keep using it to investigate how to define a Swing GUI using Scheme code .
Running some Kawa code from within a Java program is simple :
import java.io.InputStream ;
import java.io.InputStreamReader ;
import kawa.standard .Scheme ;
public class SwingExample {
public void run ( ) {
InputStream is = getClass ().getResourceAsStream(" /swing-app.scm " ) ;
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader ( is ) ;
Scheme scm = new Scheme ( ) ;
try {
scm.eval ( isr ) ;
} catch ( Throwable schemeException ) {
schemeException.printStackTrace ( ) ;
}
}
public static void main ( String arg [ ] ) {
new SwingExample ( ) .run ( ) ;
}
}
In this example , a file containing a Scheme program called swing - app.scm is expected to be found somewhere on the classpath .
A new instance of the interpreter , kawa.standard .
Scheme , is created , and called to evaluate the contents of that file .
Kawa does n't support the JSR - 223 scripting APIs that were introduced in Java 1.6 yet ( javax.scripting .ScriptEngine , etc ) .
If you need a Lisp that does that , your best bet is SISC .
CALLING JAVA LIBRARIES FROM SCHEME
Before we go on to write a bigger Lisp program it 's time to find a more fitting editor to work with , or keeping track of all those parenthesis will soon drive you crazy .
One of the most popular choices is of course to use Emacs -- it is after all programmable in its own dialect of Lisp -- but for a Java developer sticking with Eclipse may be more comfortable .
If that is the case you should install the free SchemeScript plugin before moving on .
It can be found at schemeway.sourceforge.net/schemescript.html .
There is also a plugin for Common Lisp development called Cusp ( bitfauna.com /projects / cusp ) .
Now , let 's look at the actual contents of swing - app.scm , and what we need to do to define a simple GUI using Kawa .
This example will open up a small frame with one button in it .
After the button has been clicked once it is disabled .
( define - namespace JFrame )
( define - namespace JButton )
( define - namespace ActionListener )
( define -namespace ActionEvent )
( define frame ( make JFrame ) )
( define button ( make JButton " Click only once " ) )
( define action - listener
( object ( ActionListener )
(( action - performed e :: ActionEvent ) ::
(*: set - enabled button # f ) ) ) )
(*:set-default-close-operation frame ( JFrame : .EXIT_ON_CLOSE ) )
(*: add- action - listener button action - listener )
(*: add frame button )
(*: pack frame )
(*: set - visible frame # t )
The first couple of lines use the define - namespace command to set up shorter names for the Java classes we 're about to use , similar to Java 's import statements .
We then define the frame and the button .
Java objects are created by using the make function .
In the button case we supply a string as an argument to the constructor , and Kawa is smart enough to do the translation to a java.lang .
String object as needed .
Let 's skip the ActionListener definition for now , and take a look at the last five lines first .
Here the notation * : is used to trigger methods on objects .
For example ( *: add frame button ) is the equivalent of frame .add ( button ) .
Also notice how the names of methods are automatically translated from Java 's camel - case style to the lower - case words separated by dashes typical for Scheme .
Behind the scenes set - default - close - operation will get turned into setDefaultCloseOperation , for example .
Another detail here is how :. is used to access static fields .
( JFrame : .EXIT_ON_CLOSE ) is the equivalent of JFrame .
EXIT_ON_CLOSE .
Now back to the ActionListener .
Here the object function is used to create an anonymous class that implements the java.awt.event .
ActionListener interface .
The action - performed function is set up to call setEnabled ( false ) on the button .
Some type information must be added here , to let the compiler know that action - performed is supposed to be the implementation of void actionPerformed ( ActionEvent e ) defined in the ActionListener interface .
Earlier we said that normally in Scheme you do n't need types , but in this case when you 're interfacing with Java the compiler needs the extra information .
Once you have both these files , compile SwingExample .
java and make sure to put both the resulting class and swing - app.scm on the classpath somewhere .
Next , run java SwingExample to see the GUI .
You can also have the REPL evaluate the code in the file by using the load function : ( load " swing-app.scm " ) .
This opens the door to manipulating the GUI components dynamically .
For example , you can switch the text on the button by executing ( *: set - text button " New text " ) at the REPL prompt , and see the changes take effect immediately .
Of course , this example was only meant to show how to call Java from Kawa .
By no means is it the most elegant Scheme code you could imagine .
If you in fact wanted to define a large Swing UI in Scheme , you 're probably best off raising the abstraction level a bit and hide the messy integration code behind a couple of well - chosen functions and macros .

He can pull a pint faster than you can shout for one , and there ’s no chance he ’s going to be distracted by the cute girl behind you in the queue : meet Mr. Asahi , the robot bartender .
Japan ’s top beer maker Asahi Breweries , known for its “ Super Dry ” , is deploying the life - size Mr. Asahi to bars and clubs to pull pints , open beer bottles and pour them to customers -- quickly .
He can serve customers , with a smile , in less than two minutes , saving the average customer 13 minutes at a busy bar , the company said .
“ He ’ll be a great asset to the Asahi team , ” said Asahi UK Brand Manager Christian Hamilton in a statement .
Mr. Asahi is currently on a two - month tour around Britain .
“ We were looking for a unique way to sample our beer as we go on our first national tour and we think that Mr. Asahi will certainly attract a great deal of attention in bars , clubs and grocers , ” Hamilton added .
Mr. Asahi , who weighs quarter of a tonne , works behind a specially designed bar and can politely respond to customers ’ questions via an operator - controlled system that includes over 500 vocal effects .
Mr. Asahi may also go across the Atlantic to show off his skills in the United States in the future , the company added .
GlaxoSmithKline could put SRT501 , its resveratrol formulation , on the market right away , selling it as a natural compound and nutritional pharmaceutical that does not require approval by the F.D.A .
“ We have n’t made any decisions , but that clearly is an option , ” Dr. Vallance said .
If GlaxoSmithKline decides instead to seek F.D.A. approval , it will need to prove that resveratrol is safe in the large doses required for efficacy .
Resveratrol seems to exert many influences on the body , some of which are not exerted through sirtuin .
“ None of us should be naïve enough to think resveratrol wo n’t have multiple effects , including some you do n’t want , ” Dr. Vallance said .
GlaxoSmithKline ’s purchase of Sirtris has pushed the optimism of sirtuin researchers and others to new heights .
“ We are all holding our breath , ” said Dr. Huber Warner , editor of the Journals of Gerontology .
But the success of the drugs is far from assured .
Most potential drugs fail to make it past clinical trials , and the same may prove true for Sirtris ’s candidates .
The sirtuin - activating chemicals the company has designed could turn out to be toxic .
Another uncertainty is that the underlying science is still in flux and debate rages among academic researchers over many details of how caloric restriction works .
Some biologists think that sirtuin is not the only mediator of the famine reflex , and that resveratrol may not work through sirtuin at all in exerting its beneficial effects on mice .
“ There are data both for and against that hypothesis , though that does n’t dissuade one from pursuing it as a potential benefit , ” said Dr. Thomas Rando , who studies aging in stem cells at Stanford University .
In initial tests in mice , resveratrol has doubled muscular endurance , lowered the bad form of cholesterol , protected against various bad effects of a high - fat diet and suppressed colon cancer .
New reports are confirming some of these benefits , but others are ambiguous or puzzling .
According to a study published on July 3 in the journal Cell Metabolism by Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Rafael de Cabo of the National Institute on Aging , resveratrol given to aging mice reduced their cataracts , strengthened their bones , improved coordination and enhanced their health in several other ways .
Yet despite their better health , the mice lived no longer than usual .
Presidential hopeful Barack Obama will be attempting to reach red state audiences by sponsoring a NASCAR Sprint Cup car for the Pocono race on August 3rd of this year .
Assuming no one gives it the red flag , this will be the first time that a presidential candidate has officially sponsored a NASCAR entrant .
The one - time sponsorship deal is part of a larger " get out the vote " and " make John McCain spend all his money " initiative by the campaign .
The # 49 car is run by BAM Racing and will be driven by Ken Schrader .
Of course , it 's a Toyota .

NASCAR , for its part , has been trying to reach out to minority audiences so it's no surprise this sponsorship will include a fundraiser with NASCAR fan Randy Moss and Fergie .
The team is run by staunch Republicans , but they 're not going to turn down the money and , after years in racing , seem to know how to spot a winner .

Manooh and I have had all kinds of conversations about pi .
Actually I wrote the song lyrics that I posted yesterday because she and I had been discussing the fact that pi contains , somewhere in its digits , all the melodies that have ever been written or ever will be written .
It ’s true for poems too .
For example if you write A as 01 , B as 02 , all the way up to Z as 26 , space as 27 and so on for other punctuation , then any poem you can think of ( as well as all the poems you ca n’t think of ) will show up sooner or later as a string of digits in pi , if you go out far enough ( 2515212701180527031205220518 ) .
And if you write music as a string of digits , then you can also find all the melodies .
Manooh , quite rightly , felt that a song needs music .
Since I had used the first thirty one digits for the lyrics of my little tribute to pi , she responded by using the digits immediately after those for the melody .
The result was the following lovely song , which she promptly recorded and posted , and has now graciously given me permission to link to here , for your listening pleasure :

Quotes [ edit ]
Socialism sounds great .
It has always sounded great .
And it will probably always continue to sound great .
It is only when you go beyond rhetoric , and start looking at hard facts , that socialism turns out to be a big disappointment , if not a disaster .
What the welfare system and other kinds of governmental programs are doing is paying people to fail .
In so far as they fail , they receive the money ; in so far as they succeed , even to a moderate extent , the money is taken away .
During a discussion in Milton Friedman 's " Free to Choose " television series in 1980 .
Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it .

Ch. 1 : The Role of Knowledge
Ideas are everywhere , but knowledge is rare .
Ideas , as the raw material from which knowledge is produced , exist in superabundance , but that makes the production of knowledge more difficult rather than easier .
Civilization is an enormous device for economizing on knowledge .
Knowledge may be enjoyed as a speculative diversion , but it is needed for decision making .
It is unnecessary to attempt any general rule as to where the overall balance lies in comparing the respective costs of knowledge in larger and smaller decision - making units .
What is important is to understand that ( 1 ) the respective cost advantages of the large and small units differ according to the kind of knowledge involved ( general versus specific ) , that ( 2 ) most decisions involve mixtures of the two kinds of knowledge , so that the net advantages of the larger and smaller units vary with the kind of decision , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of hierarchical subordination varies with the extent to which the subordinate unit has knowledge advantages over the higher unit .
While decisions are constrained by the kinds of organizations and the kinds of knowledge involved , the Impetus for decisions comes from the internal preferences and external incentives facing those who actually make the decisions .
Key indicators require some specified time span during which they are to be tabulated for purposes of reward or penalty .
The time span can vary enormously according to the process and the indicator .
Ch. 2 : Decision - Making Processes
Before attempting to determine the effect of institutions , it is necessary to consider the inherent circumstances , constraints , and impelling forces at work in the environment within which the institutional mechanisms function .

He was taken inside to the nurse 's room , where he was asked if he was a government employee .
If he were , he would have been eligible to be taken to a medical facility there .
Unfortunately , he was not , so a phone call was made to a local hospital to send an ambulance .
By the time this ambulance made its way through miles of Washington rush - hour traffic , the man was dead .

The one over - riding consistency across all these disparate venues is the self - exaltation of the intellectuals .
Unlike great cultural achievements of the past , such as magnificent cathedrals , which were intended to inspire kings and peasants alike , the hallmark of self - consciously “ modern ” art and music is its inaccessibility to the masses and often even its deliberate offensiveness to , or mockery of , the masses .

The question is not what anybody deserves .
The question is who is to take on the God - like role of deciding what everybody else deserves .
You can talk about ' social justice ' all you want .
But what death taxes boil down to is letting politicians take money from widows and orphans to pay for goodies that they will hand out to others , in order to buy votes to get re-elected .
That is not social justice or any other kind of justice .

Thomas Sowell , Discriminations and Disparities ( 2018 )
Neither in nature nor among human beings are either equal or randomly distributed outcomes automatic .
On the contrary , grossly unequal distributions of outcomes are common , both in nature and among people , in circumstances where neither genes nor discrimination are involved ...
The idea that it would be a level playing field , if it were not for either genes or discrimination , is a preconception in defiance of both logic and facts .

Quotes about Sowell [ edit ]
I must take the occasion to apologize for a major omission from my article , my failure to give credit to Professor Thomas Sowell for two excellent discussions on Marxian economics which I have only recently come across .
While he does not deal explicitly with the transformation problem , his discussion of Marxian value theory , which is documented with exquisite care , comes to conclusions very similar to my own on the tautological nature of the value theory and on the nature of Marx ' interests in the subject .
Though he does sometimes speak of value theory as a first approximation [ 3,1967 , p. 66 ] he makes it clear that Marx always considered the deviations between prices and values to be systematic [ 3 , 1967 , pp. 65 - 6 ] .
I recommend these pieces unhesitatingly as models of Marxian scholarship .
William J. Baumol , " The Fundamental Marxian Theorem : A Reply to Samuelson : Comment " , Journal of Economic Literature , Vol. 12 , No. 1 ( Mar. , 1974 )
Sowell ’s book attacks liberal , experts and intellectuals for their interventions into the media sphere ( the wealth of homosexual journalists explains the absence of ‘ factual information ’ that could reflect negatively on homosexuals ) , the law , war ( pacifism fails to understand the ‘ tragic vision ’ that human aggression must be controlled by force ) and finally for seeking to replace ‘ family , religion and patriotism ’ with ‘ class ’ and ‘ “ gender ” ’ .
Ultimately , this partisan book reproduces the Hobbesian vision of humanity as savage and selfish and lacking higher instincts .
There is no society : we are all rational consumers whose only influence should be through our myriad daily economic transactions .
Intellectual utopianism is tyrannical arrogance .
Democracy leads to fascism , and intellectuals are already there .
Intellectuals and Society is neither philosophy , nor politics .
It is , however , an instructive tour d’horizon of Tea Party concerns .
Aidan Byrne , " Book Review : Intellectuals and Society by Thomas Sowell " ( 2012 )
is neither philosophy , nor politics .
It is , however , an instructive of Tea Party concerns .
Sowell is an economist by training and should not be expected to know much about American foreign policy , as it ’s beyond his area of expertise .
I do find it a little rich , however , that Sowell has written a book complaining about what happens when intellectuals leave their knowledge reservation to opine about events of the day — and then proceeds to commit that precise sin during his book promotion .
There are two possibilities here .
Either Sowell has no capacity for irony , or he ’s cleverly trying to add data points to support his argument .

There are two possibilities here .
Either Sowell has no capacity for irony , or he ’s cleverly trying to add data points to support his argument .
If there was any justice in the intellectual world , Thomas Sowell would be awarded the Nobel Prize for his brilliant interdisciplinary studies on the connections between race , culture and economics around the globe .
Richard Ebeling , Comment in " Lewis Lehrman on Deficits , Debt and Debasement " ( 2010 )
Thomas Sowell is a gifted applied economist with much of importance to say about the larger issues in social policy and government regulation of economic affairs . [...]
Sowell , however , has two failings .
First , he has no heart for the plight of the poor , so his work in this area is illuminating for the false ideas he debunks , but does not contribute in any way to dealing with the problem of poverty .
Second , he is a thorough - going right - wing ideologue , who is often cogent in his critique of liberal ideas , but is blind to similar , indeed often parallel , problems with conservative ideas .
This book suffers especially from the second of these weaknesses .
[...]
Sowell has no understanding of information economics .
He follows Hayek on the distributed nature of information , but he never confronts the literature that deals with the transformation of private information into public information .
The importance of public information , central for instance to Durkheim and Aumann , is completely ignored in his treatment of government regulation .

For many years the term Austrian school in the United States was synonymous with Mises ’s disciples .
The first outstanding pupils to find themselves highly respected were Murray N. Rothbard and Israel M. Kirzner .
In the 1970s and 1980s the group greatly expanded , with the present most representative work probably being done by Thomas Sowell .
Friedrich Hayek , unfinished essay for the New Palgrave dictionary of economics , published in addendum of Chapter 1 of The fortunes of liberalism : essays on Austrian economics and the ideal of freedom ( 2012 ) .
Professor Sowell is one of the rare minds who , after they have ascended from the infinite variety of concrete facts to a general view accounting for the structure of the complex world , find their way back to the wealth of particulars from which they started and in which ordinary people , other than economic theorists , are alone interested .
Although his exposition of economic theory is impeccable and contains many original contributions , the strength of the book , its impressiveness and liveliness , is due to his always having before his eyes the concrete phenomena .
Simple and vivid illustrations make us aware of the practical implications of his theoretical insights . [...]
What I mean by the heading I have given to this review is that if I should now be asked by persons capable of exact thinking but ignorant of technical economics ( and there must be hundreds of thousands of them who have great influence on policy ) what single modern work would give them the best introduction to the present knowledge needed to judge the wisdom or folly of current policies , I would without hesitation refer them to Professor Sowell ’s book .
Friedrich Hayek , in " The Best Book on General Economics in Many a Year , Knowledge and Decision By Thomas Sowell : Reviewed by F. A. Hayek " Reason , Vol. 13 , No. 8 ( December 1981 ) .
Sowell is the best they have , sir .
Has been cranky for years but wrote solid books back in the day .
Jeet Heer , twitter ( 22 Jan 2016 )
All in all , Sowell offers a number of intriguing ideas in the book , but he leaves too many of them only partly developed and defended .
One final example : Sowell claims that those of us who favor free markets are more empirically inclined and have less ego invested in our views than those who advocate central planning and heavy government intervention generally .
That is my impression too , and it is one of the most interesting and important ideas in his book .
Unfortunately , he gives no evidence for that comparison .
The book would have been a great forum in which to do so , but on this idea and too many others , he leaves his readers unsatisfied .
David Henderson , Review of Intellectuals and Society by Thomas Sowell , Regulation ( 2010 )
Sowell likes history , but he likes it on Post - it notes .
He also prefers to revisit stale arguments rather than intervene in current controversies .
In a book about intellectuals and society , he manages to ignore the health - care and financial crises .
Instead , he argues that intellectuals have misunderstood Herbert Hoover .
Would n't VLII help us with the current economic crisis , to find out which ideas " worked " ?
Russell Jacoby , " Why Intellectuals Are All Bad " , The Chronicle of Higher Education ( 2010 )
Instead of addressing any concrete issues , Mr. Sowell simply repeats the bluster that intellectuals play rhetorical tricks and avoid arguments .
As usual , he provides no details .
If teaching consists of repetition , Mr. Sowell is a master .
As to the single specific point in Sowell 's note — that he in fact offers criticism of contemporary intellectuals , for instance , of myself : Dream on .
Sowell cites me in two sentences — that is all — and he cites me in error .
In Sowell country , a passing mention or mismention constitutes criticism .
Russell Jacoby , Russell Jacoby responds
The Chronicle of Higher Education ( 2010 )
I have a very high likelihood of finding amusement in the things that Thomas Sowell says .
It 's not what he says so much as the fact that he 's saying it .
... Thomas Sowell is very well known for his critique of intellectuals who make claims about society .
That 's all well and good - he even has some good points in the critique .
But I just can't bring myself to take Sowell completely seriously when he puts on his public intellectual hat , precisely because he is so widely identified as an anti-public - intellectual .
...
A lot of this is just meant to be in fun - the point of Intellectuals and Society was a good point .

Unfortunately , it 's often people who complain the loudest about the misbehavior of others that are successful in taking the spotlight off themselves .
Thomas Sowell , an eighty - seven - year - old African American economist , has written more than thirty mind - expanding books .
These include his Culture trilogy which ( among other things ) anticipated Jared Diamond ’s ideas in Guns , Germs , and Steel and explains the ubiquity of anti-Semitism ; A Conflict of Visions , which identifies the rival theories of the human condition underlying left - wing and right - wing political ideologies ;
The Quest for Cosmic Justice , which compares this quixotic pursuit with the quest for human justice ; Intellectuals and Society , an uncomfortable exposé of the follies of all - star intellectuals ; and Late - Talking Children , which anticipated Simon Baron - Cohen ’s work on the extreme male brain .
Sowell is a libertarian conservative , which makes him taboo in mainstream intellectual circles , but even those who disagree are well advised to grasp his facts and arguments .

As I said in my review , “ Sowell maintains that his purpose in A Conflict of Visions is not to argue for one of the visions he describes but rather to understand the nature of enduring differences in political outlook . ”
On the other hand , as I also said , it is quite clear where his sympathies lie , and I do not think that any careful reader could fail to conclude from this book that Sowell takes a concern with “ results ” rather than with “ process ” to be a fault .
An adherent of what he calls the unconstrained vision would not describe that vision in the terms Sowell employs .
T. M. Scanlon , ‘ Down from Liberalism ’ : An Exchange , The New York Review of Books ( September 29 , 1988 )
Sowell ’s A Conflict of Visions is , on the whole , a very stimulating book and it argues a very important point , namely , that the political struggles which will shape our future social and political order are not only , and maybe not even primarily , driven by identifiable interests and by rent - seeking activities that use politics as a pure machinery for the redistribution of material wealth .
Sowell rightly reminds us of the genuine power of ideas and visions in the political arena .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Residential wind turbines are gaining acceptance with more homeowners looking to cut their electricity bills .
Although they have been around for years in rural areas and isolated locations , they are spreading to the suburbs and , in some cases , even cities .
But harnessing the wind 's power in order to generate your own does n't come cheap .
And because of site requirements wind turbines generally cannot be used by those whose homes sit on less than an acre of land .
" They are definitely growing [ in popularity ] , " says Ron Stimmel of the AWEA , the national trade association for the wind energy industry .
Sales of turbines that generate 2 kilowatts to 10 kilowatts of electricity , the smallest category of turbine and the ones most likely to be in residential use , have been rising nearly 25 % annually , he said .
The rising cost of electricity has been driving wind - turbine sales .
Homeowners in an area of high winds with a properly sited turbine can shave up to 80 % off their monthly electricity bills , industry experts say .
But securing those monthly savings will take a hefty upfront investment .
The turbines , including installation , can run anywhere from $ 12,000 to $ 50,000 , with some models even pricier .
One of the more popular models on the market , Southwest Windpower 's Skystream 3.7 , goes for $ 12,000 to $ 15,000 and can generate 1.9 kilowatts .
The newer turbines like the Skystream appeal more to the average consumer than their predecessors , which are largely battery operated and designed for " off grid " use .
" The Skystream has been taking off in this country , " says Miriam Robbins , a representative for Southwest Windpower .
" When we partnered with the Department of Energy to design the system , we wanted to create a turbine that was low cost , easy to install , and that met the demands of an everyday consumer . "
Known as direct grid systems , these turbines can be plugged directly into the circuit breaker of a house .
From there , they can be connected to the local utility 's power lines .
They function much like appliances , only they create energy rather than consume it .
Still , at those prices , it can take years to recover the cost of a system .
In the most optimal example of a household that spends $ 200 / month on electricity and realizes savings of 80 % from a turbine , it would take almost eight years to recover the cost of a $ 15,000 system .
A system can last 20 to 30 years , so depending on how long the payback , it could significantly cut down the electricity bill over its lifetime .
Homeowners in several states , though , can get help with the initial costs of buying and installing a wind turbine through rebates or tax credits .
California was the first state to offer incentives in the 1990s .
Since then , other states such as New York , New Jersey , Colorado , among others , have followed suit .
In New York , for instance , the state pays cash rebates .
The size of the rebate varies widely depending on the model installed but in some cases can be over 40 % of the initial cost .
New York pays homeowners 65 % of that rebate upon installation , and the other 35 % once the turbine has been connected to the power grid and approved by the local utility .
Another incentive that is being offered in New York as well as other states is known as net metering , under which customers can get credits from utilities for any excess electricity that their turbine adds to the power grid .
Those credits can help offset times of lax generation when the wind is n't blowing strongly .
When does it make sense ?
For all its benefits , a wind turbine is not for everyone .
Customers who are paying over 10 cents per kilowatt hour will benefit the most from having their own system .
Any rate under that creates a longer payback period .
Most important is the wind in the area .
According to Robbins , consumers should have at least 10 - 12 mph of wind in their area in order to consider a turbine .
The height of the tower on which the turbine sits is another crucial factor .
The taller the tower , the stronger the wind will be .
For an average turbine , the tower stands about 80 feet tall .
Some can reach as high as 120 feet .
The turbine should also clear all other surrounding surfaces , such as trees and roofs , by at least 20 feet .
This will ensure a steadier , unobstructed wind supply .
" Do n't put a turbine on the roof , " says Stimmel .
" No matter how good the turbine is , the wind will not be strong up there . "
He adds that turbulence will even wear down the system .
Prospective consumers should also be aware that they will need about one acre of land , and knowledge of the zoning rules in their area .
Some communities have height and building restrictions on property that may prohibit erecting a wind system .
COMPTON – Two taggers spray painted a 6 - year - old boy ’s face and body after he spotted them scrawling gang signs on a wall , officials said today .
Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Capt .
James
Hellmold said the boy suffered burns to his eyes in the June 25 attack and was sprayed over his arms and other parts of his body .
He suffered no permanent damage and was doing well , Hellmold said .
“ This definitely shocks the consciousness and is out of the ordinary , even in the gang culture , ” Hellmold said .
“ It makes no sense to the normal human being . ”
One of the suspects , a 15 - year - old accused of dispensing the spray , was arrested Tuesday and charged with assault with a caustic chemical , kidnapping and felony vandalism .
His accomplice , who allegedly restrained the boy , remained at large .
Sheriff ’s deputies estimated him to be between 15 and 17 years old .
The two suspects were tagging a wall in Willowbrook , an area rife with gangs just north of Compton .
Mild Alzheimer 's disease patients with higher physical fitness had larger brains compared to mild Alzheimer 's patients with lower physical fitness , according to a study published in the July 15 , 2008 , issue of Neurology ® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
For the study , 121 people age 60 and older underwent fitness tests using a treadmill as well as brain scans to measure the white matter , gray matter and total volume of their brains .
Of the group , 57 were in the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease while the rest of the group did not have dementia .
" People with early Alzheimer 's disease who were less physically fit had four times more brain shrinkage when compared to normal older adults than those who were more physically fit , suggesting less brain shrinkage related to the Alzheimer 's disease process in those with higher fitness levels , " said study author Jeffrey M. Burns , MD , of the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Kansas City and member of the American Academy of Neurology .
The results remained the same regardless of age , gender , severity of dementia , physical activity and frailty .
There was no relationship between higher fitness levels and brain changes in the group of people without dementia .
" People with early Alzheimer 's disease may be able to preserve their brain function for a longer period of time by exercising regularly and potentially reducing the amount of brain volume lost .
Evidence shows decreasing brain volume is tied to poorer cognitive performance , so preserving more brain volume may translate into better cognitive performance , " Burns said .
" This is one of the first studies to explore the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and Alzheimer 's disease , " said Burns .
Burns says people should be cautious when interpreting the study results because scientists only observed the standard measure of fitness at one point in time .
The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging , the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , the University of Kansas Endowment Association , the Fraternal Order of Eagles and the Oppenheimer Foundation .

You know , as an outsider looking in I think Conyers is a good , honest , man but has been silenced by " whom ever " , Pelosi ?
The investigation on his wife ?
Threats ?
I look at recent pictures of him and you can see the sadness in his expression .
I think this is killing him .
I do n't know what is going on but I think he has been " silenced " .
What really happened to Kucinich 's brother , has that ever been investigated ?

The " Silencing " was done at the behest of one of our native fascists , Felix Rohatyn by name .
As a financier of note , he furnished the money necessary for the takeover of the Chilean government by Pinochet ; we all know how that came out .
Unfortunately , he also supplies a lot of money for the Democrats ' war chest , and has cultivated Nancy Pelosi as a personal friend .
He says " Do n't do something , " and the House does n't do it , because Nancy is in control of all of the Committee chairmen .
As long as Politics is financed by the criminal element , we are going to have Congressmen and women who refuse to obey their oaths to defend the Constitution .
Nowadays since the Lansky - Bronfman Organized Crime Syndicate furnished money to BOTH parties , we have a reallyy strange bunch in DC .

To the Honorable John Conyers , Jr .
Mr. Congressman ,
Have you sent a copy of these concerns to Speaker Pelosi ?
Because she has stated more than once that if only someone would bring to her attention an actual CRIME our george has committed , well THEN she would , of course , leap to follow the law & begin impeachment proceedings .
Still , I do have my doubts .
After all , invading countries is nothing new .
Neither is stealing elections .
Kidnapping , torture , rendition ... all probably safely within the law , especially given his signing statements .
Outing a covert agent & her network is a bit sticky ; but even that was understandable given that cocky know - it - all Wilson .
And really , raining death , destruction , maiming and misery down on tens of thousands is simply the stuff of war .
Katrina , though : letting a cityful of your own citizens die of starvation and drowning , refusing countless offers of food , water & medical supplies ... that does look bad .
And all the cronyism & propaganda ... ach !
but that was all so long ago .
People forget .
The Olympics will help !
Bypassing FISA ... phfft !
We would n't even have HAD the damn FISA court if it were n't for Nixon being so sloppy !
That was clearly HIS fault .
And that antiquated habeas corpus nonsense ... honestly , most people do n't even know what that means .
You know Congressman , I can see now that I 've been worrying needlessly .
So what if half our votes end up in a dumpster .
Most people do n't even vote !
I guess Nan 's right after all : nothing this president has done rises --- if you 'll forgive the pun --- to the level of the high crime of fellatio .

Howdy Folks ,
So what are the scenerios here ?
1 . Pelosi and Conyers submit impeachment proceedings against George w .
What are the concequences ?
Darth Cheney becomes president .
2 . Pelosi and Conyers arrests Addington , Myers , etc. for contempt of Congress .
George W. grants them all a pardon .
If the American people are lucky enough to survive George Dubya 's reign as Terrorist King , himself , Darth Cheney , Addington , Meyers , and yes , all the neocons should be shipped to The Hague .
I suggest we wait until they are all out of office and then have them arrested for violating the Geneva Conventions .
Violating the Geneva Conventions could bring Death Warrants .
I 'd be a happy man .

I am as frustrated as anyone else , but it does look like Conyers is being corralled by Pelosi .
All of these hearings are on the public record and are helping to embarrass the republicans a little at a time .
I loved it when he held up Vincent Bugliosi 's book at the disguised impeachment hearing .

Continuing with the same pattern .

Whoops forgot to tie those shoestrings again ( metaphor ) If Cindy Sheehan get 's elected , we need to make sure she has shoes or boots with velcro ™ fasteners ( metaphor ) .
Sugar and chocolate only go so far ( metaphor ) , and the do nothing to fix real problems .
The democrats shoe supplier is a front for fascist enablers ( metaphor ) , when every time they need shoes to kick ass ( metaphor ) , slip them on fast ( metaphor ) and arrive on time ( metaphor ) for important bills in the Senate , they always manage to trip over the shoestring ( metaphor ) showing up late ( metaphor ) , or usually not at all .
( metaphor ) Usually on the most important legislation .
Republicans are all wearing the black steel - toe combat boots with lots of scratches ( metaphor ) , showing up first ( metaphor ) and staying late .
( metaphor ) Will Democrats just attempt ( then fail ) to ban combat boots in the Senate again this year ?
( metaphor )
Or will they set their alarm clocks an hour or two early ( metaphor ) , and call their family and say they 're coming home late ?
( metaphor ) I predict more of the same pattern , e.g. the former .
( metaphor ) I call this style of English , " echoing metaphor English " it 's similar to the " repeating the propaganda " fascist brand of English , but in fact the opposite .

It 's obvious that we already have the fascist government we deserve , do we really need to push the issue ?
Do we really need Conyer 's and Kucinich 's failure to persuade the brickheaded representatives to consider impeachment , etc to further remind us and further reinforce how disempowered , boring , inert , ineffective , castrated , impotent , insubstantial , characterless yet unyieldingly and blindly authoritarian , how utterly irrelevant and traitorous Congress is at present ?

... Citizens Arrest said on 8/12/2008 @ 12:37 am PT ...
Here 's a suggestion :
If for whatever reasons the assorted criminals involved in this administration should not be held accountable during the remainder of Bush 's term , perhaps we as citizens can do something once they are out of office .
Case in point , the attempted citizen 's arrest of Karl Rove the other week in Iowa .
While some states are not friendly to the Citizens '
Arrest process , others seem to spell it out as quite feasible to perform a citizen 's arrest of a known felon .
This could make life interesting for these criminals in many states should they travel to them .
Here 's an excerpt of California 's Penal Code : 837 .
A private person may arrest another :
1 . For a public offense committed or attempted in his presence .
2 . When the person arrested has committed a felony , although not in his presence .
3 . When a felony has been in fact committed , and he has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it .
If a handful of legal scholars could help craft a national list of where this can be done , what the exact laws are and what must be told to responding law enforcement who have likely never dealt with this , perhaps we could achieve a modicum of accountability in this manner .
Likewise , there would be a need for a concise list of names , felonies committed and brief evidence notes in one readily accessible easily printed database .
These " cheat sheets " could then be carried in one 's pocket to show authorities during any citizens ' arrest .
If Congress can't do it , maybe we the people can .
At the very least it could make travel , fundraising and speeches very awkward for these criminals .
Any thoughts on this idea ?

I think one answer could be to greet our elected officials when they return to Washington from the vacation and inform them of the crimes that have been in our names and that We the People will not let these aggressions stand any longer .
It took mass marches on Washington DC to stop the Vietnam War and it will take even a larger action by the people to get the attention of todays compromised politions .

Yeah , the last two episodes of Democracy Now are a must see if you have broadband , a must hear or read if you have dial - up !
Thank You Democracy Now !
We can't put the entire load on John Conyers .
He is right that the media is a huge problem .
Just look at the non-coverage and lies about the Anthrax !
Ron Suskind is bringing me hope that the American people are finally waking up to their ability to participate and change the direction of this country .
We are going to win !

Sue Garber slides a small piece of paper across the table : a drawing done by her daughter , Emily Rae Rice , of Emily 's hamster , Leche .
" She called him ' Leche ' because he was white , " Sue explains .
Two days before she died in the Denver City Jail , Emily had given the picture to her mother as a joke .
Sue was leaving the house she shared with Emily to get a bite to eat when the 24 - year - old playfully informed her mother that if she did n't return with something for her , too , she would hide Leche , who has a nasty tendency to nibble , in the sheets of her bed .
Info Emily Rae Rice
" So of course I came home with something for her to eat , " Sue remembers .
" Then later I found this drawing on my pillow .
She was so funny . "
Related Stories What You Don't Know About Story of Woman Giving Birth in Denver Jail
" She loved life , and life loved her , " recalls Emily 's father , Roy Rice .
" From the minute anyone ever met her , they were in love with her because she was just this glowing person .
Even when she was little -- it was almost a problem .
Standing out in the yard , anybody walking down the street was her best friend .
She 'd yell hello , invite them to come in .
She knew no stranger .
She really had an effect on people . "
Now all those people can do is remember .
On February 17 , Emily worked her normal shift as a waitress at Herman 's Hideaway , the popular South Broadway concert venue where she had been employed for the past two and a half years .
Emily had had a couple of drinks that evening , so she decided to leave her car in Herman 's parking lot and split a cab with her friend , DJ Busenbark .
" She seemed fine when I dropped her off , " Busenbark says .
" Not that drunk at all , really , just normal and fine . "
Emily called her mother , who was n't home yet , around 2:30 a.m. , and talked to her boyfriend about twenty minutes later .
A few other friends remember text - messaging with her after that , and Busenbark says he chatted with her until after 5 a.m.
Around 6:45 , Emily hopped in her mother 's car and went out for some smokes .
She headed westbound on East Hampden Avenue , according to the traffic - accident report , and stopped at the South Elm Street intersection to make a left into a Conoco station .
An employee working at the gas station remembers two cars heading eastbound on Hampden , one after the other .
Emily let the first car pass , then took the left turn and collided with a 1988 Honda Accord .
When police responded to the scene , they checked Emily out and found injuries severe enough to require immediate medical attention .
They also slapped her with a DUI and charged her with driving with a suspended license , the result of a failure to pay restitution from a previous traffic accident .
She was transported to Denver Health Medical Center , where she was treated and released back into custody .
( The incident report did not indicate what happened to the other driver ; he did not return Westword 's phone calls . )
Meanwhile , Sue was worried because she had n't heard from her daughter since their late - night phone call .
She frantically phoned around to try to locate her , but with no success .
Finally , at around 4:45 p.m. on February 18 , she got a call from Emily , who was in the Denver City Jail .
" I asked her , ' Baby , are you okay ? ' "
Sue remembers .
" And she said , ' Mommy , I can't feel my feet . ' "
Emily then told her mother that she had gone out for cigarettes and had gotten into an accident .
" What did you hit ? "
Sue asked her .
" I do n't know , " Emily said .
Sue told her that she would be right there .
She tracked down $ 400 , the amount she says jail officials told her was necessary for the bond , and went to get Emily .
But when she arrived , the cash - only bail had more than quadrupled .
Sue did n't have that kind of money on her , nor the means to access it immediately , as it was early evening on a Saturday .
Unable to see or help her daughter , she left .
" I was devastated , " Sue relates .
" I tried to get a message to her .
I told them to tell her we were coming for her , that we did n't have enough money right then , but that we would be there first thing in the morning . "
But Emily did n't make it till morning .
She died from internal injuries not long after her mother had left .
The police report from Emily 's brief stay at the jail reads as follows : " On listed date , just prior to listed times victim was contacted by Denver Sheriff 's Department deputies .
DSD officers asked if victim wanted to eat , victim refused .
Victim was unable to move her legs .
DSD nurses were called to cell , where victim was found unresponsive , ambulance was called to scene to transport to Denver Health Medical Center .
Victim was pronounced Dead on Arrival at DHMC . "
Emily 's mother and father have hired former Arapahoe County district attorney Bob Gallagher to represent them in a potential lawsuit , but Gallagher , who 's waiting to receive an autopsy report and certain medical and jail records , has not yet initiated any legal action .
He does find it disconcerting , though , that Emily 's injuries seem to have been overlooked by staff at both Denver Health Medical Center and at the jail .
" I just do n't see why nobody caught this , " he says .
Gallagher also says that during his initial research , he found that some of Emily 's complaints to jail officials of numbness and trouble breathing were met with mulish advice to " sleep it off . "
" We 're still waiting for the results of the autopsy to determine the actual cause of death , " says DPD spokeswoman Virginia Quiñones .
" Our homicide investigators have taken over the case , as they would in any death . "
Dee Martinez , director of public relations and marketing for DHMC , would not comment on Emily 's injuries , saying that the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) prevents the hospital from discussing the care of any patient .
But while the police and the hospital are n't talking , news of Emily 's passing hit the Denver community fast and hard .
As word got around , the Denver Message Board quickly filled with thoughts and prayers from her many friends and acquaintances .
" That 's chilling , " one message reads .
" Uggggg .
That 's my guts ripping out again , " says another .
At Herman's , employees swap Emily stories , telling them as though the girl who began as a valet on the curb out front will walk through the door at any second .
" She was bubbly , energetic , kind , sweet and funny , " says Deb Seigerman , head waitress at Herman's .
" She filled the room with smiles .
I remember once there was a guy sitting at the bar one night .
He was sitting down and his pants were loose , and he had a bit of a plumber 's crack hanging out .
I kept noticing it all night .
Then , toward the end of the night , Emily walks by and real nonchalantly drops a pen down the back of his pants .
He did n't even feel it ; he had no idea .
Ten minutes later , she walks over to the same guy and asks him if she can borrow a pen . "
" There are not too many people that you meet , and the moment you meet them you know they just have no negative side whatsoever , " says Mike Roth , one of Herman 's owners .
" Emily was like that .
I never saw her upset or out of line .
She was just a really nice , good person .
She treated everyone like a friend . "
A couple of days after Emily passed away , one of her friends stopped by to see Emily 's mom .
Sue says the woman told her she had n't been able to stop thinking about Emily and that she seemed to have involuntarily appropriated one of Emily 's quirks : hanging pay - phone receivers upside down .
" It was just something that Emily always did , " Sue says .
" Her friend told me that now she could n't pass a pay phone anymore without doing it , too . "
At a benefit concert to celebrate Emily and raise money for her family this past Monday , other friends reported adopting the quirk as well , flipping phones across the city as a tribute to the irreverence , playfulness and sense of fun that their friend brought to the world every day .
Hopes languished last September when a promising candidate HIV vaccine failed to work .
Despite this setback , many researchers still believe immunization is possible , and a new study suggests they 're correct — at least at the cellular level .
Working in mice infected with HIV , a team used a method called RNA interference to knock down three genes in T cells , protecting them from the virus .
This method seemed to prevent HIV from jumping between cells in the mice .
" For the first time , we 've used RNAi to dramatically suppress HIV infection in an organism , " says corresponding author Premlata Shankar , who conducted the work while she was a junior investigator at the Harvard Medical School - affiliated Immune Disease Institute and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School .
Shankar is now a professor at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso .
Although labs must verify the findings in other animal models before attempting clinical trials , this method — published online Aug. 7 in Cell — may eventually supplement or replace the harsh drug cocktails currently prescribed to patients with HIV , reducing the side effects of treatment .
When the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 2006 for the discovery of RNAi , the judges speculated that it might " lead to novel therapies in the future . "
Researchers hoped to flood specific cells in patients with short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) , molecules that silence genes by disrupting the protein templates they produce .
But scientists were n't sure how to deliver the siRNAs exclusively into relevant cell types within an organism .
In collaboration with Sang - Kyung Lee of Hanyang University , Shankar 's lab overcame this obstacle , delivering siRNAs directly into T cells , which are targeted by HIV .
The team used an apparatus analogous to a truck equipped with GPS and a trailer hitch to haul the siRNAs to their destination .
The truck — in this case , a single - chain antibody developed by Georg Fey of the University of Erlangen in Germany — homed to a protein found exclusively on the surface of T cells .
The trailer hitch — an oligo - 9 - arginine — pulled siRNAs along for the ride .

This new antibody delivery vehicle lends itself to mass production in a dish .
The team built thousands of these carriers for use in experiments , loading them with siRNAs targeting three key genes .
One encodes a human protein called CCR5 , which dots the surface of T cells and allows HIV to gain entry .
The others encode proteins produced by the virus within cells upon infection .
Harvard Medical School postdoctoral researcher and first author Priti Kumar mixed the siRNAs with the antibody carriers and injected them into the veins of mice that harbor human T cells rather than their own .
These mice serve as an animal model of HIV .
After being infected with the virus , the mice mirror progression of the disease in humans .
Developed by study co-authors Leonard Shultz of the Jackson Laboratory and Dale Greiner of the University of Massachusetts , these mice lack their own immune systems , so they tolerate tissue from other species .
The team injected the mice with human blood stem cells , which divided time and again , building a human immune system in their hosts .
When infected with HIV , the synthetic immune system seemed to respond as it would in humans , since T cell levels followed the same pattern in both species .
Kumar 's siRNAs halted T cell destruction in the mice , essentially stopping the virus in its tracks .
" Both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens proved successful , " said Kumar .
" Apparently , the siRNAs kept HIV from entering most T cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside . "
Kumar and Shankar caution that labs need to confirm the findings in other animals , tweak the dosage , and tinker with the siRNA delivery vehicle before attempting clinical trials .
In addition , the molecules degrade with time , so periodic shots may be necessary to maintain cellular immunity , precluding large - scale vaccination .
advertisement
" I 'm not saying we 've developed tomorrow 's therapy , but this is a major step forward , " says Shankar .
" We 've used a small animal model for HIV and proven that RNAi works in that model . "
John Rossi , a pioneer in RNA - based therapeutics who was not part of the study , hopes labs will use the new animal model to compare the side effects of potential and existing therapeutic regimens .
" The number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity , " says Rossi , a professor at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope .
He wonders if siRNAs will eventually enable doctors to lower the doses of existing drugs in patients .
Perhaps siRNAs will one day supplement or replace harsh antiretrovirals .
" Overall , I see this work as an exciting proof of principle , " says Rossi .
" This is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans . "
This research is supported by the National Institutes of Health , the Korea Ministry of Education and Science Technology , and the Center for AIDS Research at Harvard .
I ’m a sucker for concept art .
Seeing where a game came from and witnessing the creators ’ imaginations working overtime often makes the inspiration behind some games immediately obvious .
You could drown in the Norse mythology and fairy tale references in The Witcher , and God of War is of course an amped - up reworking of Greek legends , gods , and monsters , more or less .
But did you know Destiny was based on a science - fiction French version of Dungeons & Dragons ?
Or that you could experience the same genetic memory as Desmond from Assassin ’s Creed ?
Neither did I . Read on for revelations galore !
Destiny : inspired by Dune , Star Wars ( surprise surpise ) and ... Thundarr the Barbarian ?
In an interview with Glixel , Christopher Barret , the game director of Destiny ’s Rise of Iron , listed off the numerous inspirations behind Destiny .
Unsurprisingly Star Wars is in there , as well as Dune , the best - selling science fiction novel by Frank Herbert which is kind of like Game of Thrones , but set in space , with a lot of drugs .
But what on earth is Thundarr the Barbarian ?
From the way Barrett describes it , it sounds like a mix between Fallout and Dungeons & Dragons , set in a “ post - apocalyptic world in the future with fantasy elements ” .
Getting even more niche , Barrett also says that an animated science - fantasy French movie called Light Years was a big inspiration .
The entire film is on YouTube , so check it out if you want to take a trip back to the ‘ 80s .
Overwatch ’s Zarya : inspired by Blizzard ’s real - life 3D artist Tamara
I ’m sure I ’m not alone in having the sudden urge to chop all my hair off and dye the resulting pixie cut pink after seeing Zarya from Overwatch mow down foes with her particle cannon .
Turns out even if I did that to my luscious locks right this second I would n’t be the first , as Zarya is actually based on Tamara Bakhlycheva , one of Blizzard ’s 3D artists .
Take a look at the picture yourself to see the resemblance !
Assassin ’s Creed : inspired by the real case of genetic memory ( or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance )
Got an irrational fear of the number 5 , or find you heart beating a little faster when you sniff cherry blossom ?
You might be experiencing the same trip down genetic - memory - lane as Desmond does in each Assassin ’s Creed game , as researchers have determined that you can inherit phobias based on traumatic events which might have happened to your ancestors .
So if you ’ve got a special fear of geese , it might turn out that your great - grandmother got chased by a pack when she was young , and the memory of this was passed on to you .
The real question is , could more than fear be stored in our heads ?
What if , like Desmond , we could relive our ancestors ’ lives by accessing these hidden strands of DNA ?
Hopefully no ominous multinational corporate conglomerate like Abstergo would appear at the same time .
BioShock Splicers : inspired by the first WW1 skin grafts
In the damp and dingy docks of Rapture , you can hear the religious mumblings of the Wader splicer reverberate off the walls .
Armed with a pipe , bombs , or those creepy hooks Spider Splicers use to swing about on the walls , if you pause a moment to take a look over his corpse once you ’ve pumped him full of electricity , lead , or bees , you ’ll notice that his eyes are covered by what looks like a mask made of skin .
The inspiration behind the Splicer came from the soldiers who came back from World War One with severe facial injuries .
They were treated with a pioneering plastic surgery technique in the form of skin grafts , with the sailor Walter Yeo as the first to get this treatment .
The Last of Us : inspired by zombie fungus
You ’ll have to take a deep breath if you want to pronounce this all in one go : ophiocordyceps unilateralis .
Sound familiar ?
Probably not , but it might look familiar .
This is pretty much the same zombie fungus from The Last of Us , which infects people and turns them into Clickers and spore - spewing mushroom heaps .
The fungus controls the infected ant and makes it abandon its nest for the forest floor , where the ant will find a leaf , sink its teeth into it , and then expire , leaving the fungus able to soak up all the delicious humidity around the corpse .
Do n’t worry though , as it only infects ants in Thailand and Brazil .
So far , that is .
Kratos from God of War : inspired by American History X
We all know that God of War is a riff on Greek legend - and no wonder , because Greek legend is brutal and makes for a great action game - but did you know that Kratos ’ design was based on Ed Norton in American History X? Neither did I .
In an interview , designer David Jaffe said that the idea came from the scene where Norton is arrested .
In Jaffe ’s own words :
“ ... you just see how buffed and built he ’s gotten .
I showed that to the artist and I said , ‘ Okay , that sense of power and aggression that you just see in his face , can we somehow take that , the essence of what he ’s exuding , and somehow turn that into a character that fits into this Greek mythology world ? ” .
Lo and behold , they did .
Kratos , with all his roaring and glorious rage , was born .
An international research team , including University of Minnesota researcher Craig Packer , has found the first clear example of how climate extremes , such as the increased frequency of droughts and floods expected with global warming , can create conditions in which diseases that are tolerated individually may converge and cause mass die - offs of livestock or wildlife .
The study suggests that extreme climatic conditions are capable of altering normal host - pathogen relationships and causing a " perfect storm " of multiple infectious outbreaks that could trigger epidemics with catastrophic mortality .
Led by scientists at the University of California , Davis , the University of Illinois and the University of Minnesota , the research team examined outbreaks of canine distemper virus ( CDV ) in 1994 and 2001 that resulted in unusually high mortality of lions in Tanzania 's Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater .
CDV periodically strikes these ecosystems , and most epidemics have caused little or no harm to the lions .
But the fatal virus outbreaks of 1994 and 2001 were both preceded by extreme drought conditions that led to debilitated populations of Cape buffalo , a major prey species of lions .
The buffalo suffered heavy tick infestations and became even more common in the lions ' diet , resulting in unusually high levels of tick - borne blood parasites in the lions .
( These parasites are normally present in lions at harmlessly low levels . )
The canine distemper virus suppressed the lions ' immunity , which allowed the elevated levels of blood parasites to reach fatally high levels , leading to mass die - offs of lions .
In 1994 the number of lions in the Serengeti study area dropped by over 35 percent after the double infection .
Similar losses occurred in the Crater die - off in 2001 .
The lion populations recovered within 3 - 4 years after each event , but most climate change models predict increasing frequency of droughts in East Africa .
" The study illustrates how ecological factors can produce unprecedented mortality events and suggests that co-infections may lie at the heart of many of the most serious die - offs in nature , " said Packer , Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Ecology , Evolution and Behavior at the University of Minnesota .
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Morris Animal Foundation .
In a brilliant pair of videos , , Prof. James Duane of the Regent University School of Law and Officer George Bruch of the Virginia Beach Police Department present a forceful case for never , ever , ever speaking to the police without your lawyer present .
Ever .
Never , never , never .
It 's a long commitment — 45 minutes to watch them both — but boy is it worth it .

Eight reasons even the innocent should n't talk to the police
( via Waxy )
A couple of weeks ago , the state of California sent cease - and - desist letters to 13 genetic - testing companies asking them to stop directly marketing their tests to consumers .
Since then , debate has raged in the blogosphere about whether the health department should have engaged in such regulatory action .
But what if health department officials do n't see their action as a choice , but rather as dictated by the current ( correct or incorrect ) state law ?
A look at the clinical laboratory regulations in California law does seem to support the idea that the health department has a case that its actions were required by law .
And given that the agency 's clinical laboratory oversight is currently in the midst of a statutory state audit , it might not be in a position to play softball with a widely publicized industry that 's in a murky legal place .
The department is claiming jurisdiction over genetic tests because they say they constitute a " clinical laboratory test . "
The state 's Business and Profession Code provides this long and hairy definition for such a test ( 1206.A.4 ) :
" Clinical laboratory test or examination " means the detection , identification , measurement , evaluation , correlation , monitoring , and reporting of any particular analyte , entity , or substance within a biological specimen for the purpose of obtaining scientific data which may be used as an aid to ascertain the presence , progress , and source of a disease or physiological condition in a human being , or used as an aid in the prevention , prognosis , monitoring , or treatment of a physiological or pathological condition in a human being , or for the performance of nondiagnostic tests for assessing the health of an individual .
Simplifying , one can say that a regulated lab test is composed of four parts : 1 ) a biological specimen from a human 2 ) containing some substance ( say , DNA
or white blood cells ) that 3 ) is measured 4 ) to give information about a human 's disease - state or health .
Any test that fits this definition must be ordered by a doctor , just like a prescription drug , so offering them online – without a doctor 's involvement – would be considered illegal .
Checking genetic tests against the first three parts of this very broad definition , it 's not difficult to see why California 's public health department feels that it can ( and should ) regulate genetic testing :
1 ) spit , a biological specimen , is collected
2 ) spit contains DNA
3 ) genetic testing companies measure and analyze the DNA against known genetic variations
The real question , then , is only on the final component :
Do genetic testing companies provide information that could be construed as aiding the prevention of a disease ?
Is providing a personalized genetic risk assessment based on scientifically published genetic correlation studies an aid to the prevention of , say , colon cancer ?
23andMe , for example , has argued that the testing they provide is n't a prevention aid , but merely offers " individuals contextual information about their genetic makeup , including ancestry and applicable scientific research . "
Whether or not 23andMe will ultimately be able to wiggle away from regulation with this article remains to be seen .
If they can , they 'd find themselves with a much easier time going direct to consumers than other companies .
For example , Navigenics ' website promises that the company provides " analysis of your predisposition for a variety of common conditions , and the information , support and guidance to know what steps you can take to prevent , detect or diagnose them early . "
Given that description , it would be difficult for the company to argue that its tests should n't be regulated as clinical laboratory tests .
And indeed , the company seems to have planned to be subject to the clinical laboratory test regulations .
That said , the company 's CEO expressed surprise to Wired.com at the aggressiveness of the California regulation .
Navigenics is currently in the midst of preparing their response to the health department 's cease - and - desist letter .
One intriguing legal possibility is that one or more of the companies could sue to have the lab regulation 's application to genetic testing struck down .
Thomas Goetz argued on these virtual pages , " My DNA is my data , " and it would be a fascinating case to see if the state 's court system would agree .
We have n't heard of any direct precedent to guide the courts , but it 's possible that the right to privacy , which guarantees a woman 's right to choose , could be applied to the genetic testing realm .
The argument would be that if it 's inside your body – be it a baby or DNA – the decisions relating to it are yours alone to make , without the interference of the state .
A less interesting , but perhaps faster and more effective option for the genetic testing industry would be to lobby the California legislature to turn some subset of genetic tests into explicitly over - the - counter tests like those for pregnancy or paternity .

Fossilized flatfish settle evolutionary conundrum .
A trio of fossilized fish has finally settled an evolutionary conundrum that once puzzled Charles Darwin .
Fossilized fish provide a snapshot of evolution in action .
Nature
The flatfish has always been regarded as an oddity .
Although the immature fish has eyes on opposite sides of its head , one of the eyes migrates around its skull before it reaches maturity .
Yet there was no evidence for this development process in the fossil record .
Some evolutionary biologists , including Darwin , have argued that the trait evolved gradually over many generations of flatfish .
If true , intermediate flatfish with partially offset eyes would once have lived — but no such fossils have ever been identified , giving succour to both creationists and those arguing for sudden jumps in evolution .
But Matt Friedman , a PhD student studying evolutionary biology at the University of Chicago in Illinois , has now found three examples of these transitional forms .
In the process , he unearthed an entirely new species of ancient flatfish in Vienna and re-interpreted already known fossil fish in London .
His work is reported in this week 's Nature1 ( see video ) .
Fossil power
Friedman says that the fossils are important because " they help to settle a long - standing evolutionary debate and shed light on the mode and tempo of evolutionary change " .
" From my standpoint as a palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist , I " m pleased that I 've been able to showcase the power of fossil data in solving a problem that seemed so baffling from examining living diversity alone , " he adds .
The new species , named Heteronectes chaneti , was unearthed in the Natural History Museum in Vienna .
" When I first noticed the fossil , it was sitting unidentified in a drawer of indeterminate fossil fish pieces from Monte Bolca [ in Italy ] , " he says .
" And believe me , it did n’t look like much at the time — it was an incomplete specimen covered with dust and soot . "
After applying weak acid to the rock and exposing the fossil it became clear that it was in fact a new species , and one with a clearly asymmetrical skull .
Friedman also used an X - ray technique called computed tomography to analyse two specimens of a known species called Amphistium residing in the Natural History Museum in London .
Although palaeontologists had noticed that this animal was ' flatfish - like ' , Friedman says that they had thought the fossil was symmetrical and had been distorted in the fossilization process .
Friedman 's scans show that the degree of asymmetry of Amphistium is the same in both specimens , suggesting that it is not due to such distortion .
Flatfish eyes move early during their development but Friedman says the specimens he describes are clearly adult , as they are too large to be very young fish .
And the bones of living flatfish do not ossify until after metamorphosis — in these fossils , the bones are present and fully formed .
" There are , as we sadly know , people who are uncomfortable about the idea of evolution , " says Per Ahlberg of Uppsala University in Sweden .
" It 's always nice to demonstrate that even for major morphological transitions , the steps are in the evolutionary record . "
" From a more scientific point of view , these are the changes that are most difficult to understand , " he adds .
" It 's all very well knowing it must have happened , but that ’s still not a complete picture of how this works . "
It 's possible that the asymmetrical eyes may have allowed the creatures to bottom - feed , watching for predators above while lifting themselves up on their fins to look for prey on the sea floor .
Basement discoveries
Friedman is making something of a career finding things that others have missed in dusty collections .
In 2006 he authored a paper with his colleague Michael Coates which showed a fossil previously thought to be a ray - finned fish was in fact a coelacanth2 .
" Many of my most interesting discoveries have been made in museum basements rather than in a quarry at some exotic field site , " he says .
" I suppose there is a general perception that museum collections are dusty , static archives , and that everything in them has been carefully studied and precisely identified .
But the truth is that they are much more than just long - term storage , because as our interpretive framework matures , we can begin to make sense of specimens that evaded or baffled earlier generations of researchers , or draw new conclusions about materials we mistakenly thought we had figured out ages ago . "
Zerina Johanson , curator for fossil fishes at London 's Natural History Museum , agrees : " There are definitely many more discoveries to be made in fossil fish collections . "
Within hours of taking the throne , in August AD117 , the emperor Hadrian made one major strategic decision .
He issued the order to withdraw the Roman troops from Iraq ( or Mesopotamia , as he would have called it ) .
His succession had been a messy one , in the usual Roman way .
Despite a well - earned reputation for effective administration in most areas , the Romans never really sorted out the transfer of imperial power .
Hadrian 's leadership bid was more reminiscent of what goes on in the Labour party than in the House of Windsor .
It involved a good deal of manipulation , double - dealing , back - stabbing ( in Rome this was real , not metaphorical ) and perfect timing .
A couple of rivals had made their bid too soon , leaving Hadrian as the only plausible candidate to be adopted by his elderly predecessor Trajan , just a few days before he died .
Hadrian was instantly faced with a problem in the Gulf .
Trajan had sponsored ambitious expeditions in the east - determined to get control of the rogue states threatening Roman interests there , and in his wider dreams to follow in the conquering footsteps of Alexander the Great .
He had reached the enemy capital at Ctesiphon , just south of modern Baghdad , where he made his own premature declaration of " Mission Accomplished " ( in Latin , " Parthia capta " - a phrase blazoned across the commemorative coinage ) .
He had then moved on to Basra , where he planted the Roman flag , and sensibly decided that he was too old to take the Alexander trail to India .
This whole enterprise was already going horribly wrong before Trajan 's death in 117 .
He had tried the trick of restoring some form of local control in Ctesiphon , in the shape of a puppet king ( another series of coins vainly celebrated the restoration of constitutional government , much as we have celebrated the restoration of Iraqi " democracy " ) .
But the rival factions and insurgencies undermined all attempts to bring peace and order .
Hadrian saw the impossibility of the task and straightaway pulled the troops out , leaving the various local warlords to fight it out themselves .
He diverted the legions to more winnable campaigns elsewhere .
There was unrest , as usual , in the Balkans .
And in the near east he had to finish stamping out a Jewish revolt which , according to some wild and fearful Roman estimates , had cost half a million Greek and Roman lives .
Fifteen years later , prompted among other things by a recent ban on circumcision , the Jews rebelled again under Shimon bar Kokhba .
Charismatic or charlatan , depending on your point of view ( the predictably hostile Saint Jerome later claimed that he " fanned a lighted straw in his mouth so that he appeared to be breathing out flames " ) , he commanded a force that was at first a match for the Romans .
In the end , Hadrian 's forces had to resort to the most ruthless form of ethnic cleansing , constructive starvation and mass slaughter of the enemy that went far beyond the casualties inflicted by the Jews .
In Rome , and among generations of antisemitic ideologues up to the 20th century , the victory was hailed a triumph over religious fanaticism and political insurrection .
The new exhibition at the British Museum , Hadrian : Empire and Conflict , features evocative objects from both sides of this Jewish war .
There are simple everyday items recovered from a Jewish hideout : some house keys , a leather sandal , a straw basket almost perfectly preserved in the dry heat , a wooden plate and a mirror - evidence of the presence of women , according to the exhibition catalogue ( as if men did not use mirrors ) .
But with or without the women , these are all bitter reminders of the daily life that somehow managed to continue , even in hiding and in the middle of what was effectively genocide .
From the other side , there is a magnificent bronze statue of the emperor himself , which once stood in a legionary camp near the River Jordan .
The distinctive head of Hadrian ( bearded , with soft curling hair and a giveaway kink in his ear lobe ) sits on top of an elaborately decorated breast - plate , on which six nude warriors do battle .
It is a striking combination , even if - here as elsewhere - the catalogue raises doubts about whether the head and body of this statue originally belonged together .
Far away from Judaea , on the other side of the Roman world , Hadrian 's military operations in Britain were less bloody .
Apart from the low - level guerrilla warfare endemic in most Roman provinces , he had his troops occupied in building the famous wall running across the north of the province .
This was a project inaugurated when Hadrian himself visited in 122 , one of the few Roman emperors ever to set foot in the empire 's unappealing northern outpost .
It is now far from certain what this wall was for .
The obvious explanation is that it was built to prevent hordes of nasty woad - painted natives from invading the nice civilised Roman province , with its baths , libraries and togas .
But - leaving aside the rosy vision of life in Britannia that this implies ( baths , libraries and togas for whom exactly ? ) - this overlooks one crucial fact .
The impressive masonry structure , which provides the iconic photo - shot of the wall , makes up only part of its length .
For one - third of its 70 miles the " wall " was just a turf bank , which would hardly have kept out a party of determined children , never mind a gang of barbarian terrorists .
There are all kinds of alternative suggestion .
Was it , for example , not much more than a fortified roadway across the province ?
Or was it more of a boast than a border - an aggressive , but essentially symbolic , Roman blot on the native landscape ?
Most likely it was for the control rather than the exclusion of people .
The aim was to channel regular movement into certain standard crossing points ( even the turf bank would have been inconvenient to cross with a loaded cart ) , to police the migration of people both ways , and possibly also to tax the goods that came and went .
On the spectrum of modern walls , that would make it closer to the Mexican border fence than to the Berlin wall .
If all this seems rather familiar , that is partly because there really are significant overlaps between the Hadrianic empire and our own experience of military conflict and geopolitics .
We are still fighting in many of the same areas of the world and encountering many of the same problems .
We are still claiming victory long before we have won the war - or indeed , in the Iraqi case , instead of winning the war .
We still turn to masonry ( plus , in the modern world , barbed wire ) to separate one arbitrary nation from another and to police arbitrary boundaries .
It is not going too far to suggest that there are political lessons we can still learn from the failure , or success , of Roman enterprises in the Gulf and elsewhere .
But there is a more complicated and interesting story here , too .
For Hadrian himself has long seemed a familiar figure in many other respects .
He is not exactly " one of us " , perhaps , but he is at least one of those rare characters from the Roman world to whom even now we can feel quite close .
In contrast to the sheer madness of Nero or Caligula , or to the disconcerting and implausible probity of the first emperor Augustus , Hadrian is the kind of political leader whose behaviour seems distinctly recognisable , whose ambitions and conflicts we can almost share .
That feeling of familiarity has been boosted by Marguerite Yourcenar 's fictional , pseudo - autobiography of the emperor , Memoirs of Hadrian .
Published in 1951 , and once hugely popular ( it now seems to me rambling and frankly unreadable ) , it took the modern reader inside Hadrian 's psyche - presenting the emperor as a troubled and intimate friend , in much the same way as Robert Graves made the emperor Claudius a rather jolly great - uncle .
But Yourcenar 's fictional construction is not the only reason for Hadrian 's apparent modernity .
There are all kinds of ways in which Hadrian 's life and interests seem to match up to our own expectations of monarchs and world leaders , and to modern interests and passions .
He was the sponsor of Mitterand - style grands projets , a great traveller to the outposts of his dominion ( including that trip to Britain ) , as well as an enthusiastic collector of art .
And to cap it all , he had an intriguing , and ultimately tragic , sex life .
The British Museum exhibition makes a good deal of his building work and his art collecting .
Unsurprisingly , perhaps , given that the museum itself is the descendant and direct beneficiary of Hadrian 's passion for architectural design and classical sculpture .
His most famous building in Rome was the great Pantheon .
One of the few ancient Roman buildings to remain standing to its full height , and even now in active use as a church , it is crowned with what is still the largest dome ever built with unreinforced concrete .
This has been the inspiration behind almost every great dome built since , from St Sophia in Istanbul ( a grand projet of one of Hadrian 's eastern successors , the emperor Justinian ) to the dome of the museum 's own round reading room .
By a nice symmetry , it is here that the Hadrian exhibition has been displayed - placing the emperor , so to speak , in his own dome .
It is also the case that a substantial part of the museum 's collection of Roman sculpture came from what is known as Hadrian 's " villa " at Tivoli , some 20 miles outside Rome .
This was in fact a vast , sprawling palace and pleasure gardens built by the emperor , occupying the space of a large Roman town ( it is at least twice as big as Pompeii ) .
Here Hadrian created an extraordinary microcosm of his own empire , replicating in miniature all kinds of famous landmarks and artistic masterpieces from across the Roman world .
The lovely long pool that is a highlight of the site for modern visitors seems to have been a version of a celebrated Egyptian waterway , the Canopus canal .
In another part of the palace , he not only had a copy of one of the most renowned Greek statues , the fourth - century BC nude Aphrodite from the town of Cnidus , by Praxiteles ( reputed to be the first Greek female nude ever ) , but he displayed it within a replica of the very temple in which she was kept in Cnidus .
The " villa " offered , in Roman terms , a vision of universal culture , not wholly different from British Museum director Neil MacGregor 's idea of the " universal museum " .
It also housed an enormous quantity of sculpture .
And Tivoli , unlike many of the crucial areas of the city of Rome itself , was not built over in the centuries that followed the fall of the empire .
From the 17th century on , the site was an easy gold mine for archaeologists , collectors and art dealers in search of antiquities to draw , to sell or take home ( you can still see on one of the villa walls Piranesi 's signature , scrawled in red pencil during a drawing expedition in 1741 ) .
There was plenty of stuff to go round , and a number of major European sculpture collections were formed around a nucleus of material that had been excavated at Tivoli .
Among them was the collection of Sir Charles Townley , most of which was bought by the British government in 1805 and became the basis of the British Museum 's Greek and Roman collection .
Several of Townley 's pieces are on show in the new exhibition , including a Hadrianic relief of a boy with a horse , obviously inspired by the Parthenon frieze - which was in Hadrian 's day still in its original place on the Parthenon .
This is a wonderful vignette of the complex history of collecting , and its surprising overlaps and intersections .
Not only do we find the collection of Hadrian becoming part of the collection of Townley , and then of the British Museum .
But whatever your view on the repatriation of the Elgin marbles , it is hard not to be struck by the marvellous irony of Hadrian 's copy of the Parthenon frieze ending up in the same museum as much of the original .
Another major theme of the new show is Hadrian 's relationship with Antinous , a boy who came from Bithynia , in modern Turkey .
We know no details whatsoever of what went on between the two , but the usual story - misogynist as so many such stories are - contrasts the emperor 's passion for this beautiful lad with the loveless , childless marriage to his bad - tempered and scheming wife , Sabina .
What is certain is that Antinous died young , drowned in AD130 in the River Nile ( murder , esoteric sacrifice , suicide and tragic accident have all been suspected ) , and that following his death Hadrian devoted enormous energies to his commemoration .
He had him made into a god .
He founded and named a city after him , Antinoopolis , on the banks of the Nile where the boy had drowned .
At Tivoli , near one of the main entrance - ways to the palace , he greeted visitors with an elaborate cenotaph for Antinous , in distinctive Egyptian style - complete , it seems , with palm trees .
He also flooded the Roman world with his statues .
About a hundred portraits of Antinous are known , more than we have for any other individual Roman , apart from the first emperor Augustus and Hadrian himself .
These come in all shapes , sizes and styles , from colossal images in the guise of an Egyptian god to precious miniatures in silver .
But the standard , instantly recognisable type is of a languorous young man , pouting , heavy - lipped and sultry - an image that has come to be almost a shorthand for " sex in stone " .
It is perhaps no surprise that JJ Winckelmann , the 18th - century art historian , archaeologist and homosexual , steamed over one particular sculpture of the boy in a private collection in Rome .
In fact , the most famous portrait of Winckelmann shows him studying an engraving of that very statue .
But even now the sight of Antinous can work its magic .
One of the portrait heads in the British Museum exhibition is a vast sculpture from the Louvre , known as the " Mondragone Antinous " , after the place in Italy where it was first put on show in the early 18th century .
Although a few recent critics have gone against the grain and deemed it a faintly repulsive , pouting monstrosity , others have made no secret of their admiration .
When it was unpacked from its crate in Leeds a few years ago , where it was due to star in an exhibition devoted to Antinous at the Henry Moore Institute , it bore on its cheek the clear traces of a bright red lipstick kiss .
Traveller , patron , grief - stricken lover , art collector , clear - thinking military strategist .
How do we explain why Hadrian seems so approachably modern ?
Why does he seem so much easier to understand than Nero or Augustus ?
As so often with characters from the ancient world , the answer lies more in the kind of evidence we have for his life than in the kind of person he really was .
The modern Hadrian is the product of two things : on the one hand , a series of vivid and evocative images and material remains ( from portrait heads and stunning building schemes to our own dilapidated wall ) ; on the other , the glaring lack of any detailed , still less reliable , account from the ancient world of what happened in his reign , or of what kind of man he was , or what motivated him .
The only fully surviving ancient biography is a short ( 20 pages or so ) life - one of a series of colourful but flagrantly unreliable biographies of Roman emperors and princes written by person or persons unknown , sometime in the fourth or fifth centuries AD .
This includes one or two nice anecdotes , which may or may not reflect an authentic tradition about Hadrian .
My own particular favourite features his visits to the public baths .
The story goes that on one occasion Hadrian spotted a veteran soldier rubbing his back against the marble wall .
When he inquired why he did this , the old man replied that he could not afford a slave .
So Hadrian presented him with some slaves , and with the money for their upkeep .
On his next visit , there was a whole crowd of old men rubbing their backs against the wall .
Far from repeating his gift , he suggested that they take it in turns to rub each other down .
There were a number of morals here .
Hadrian was a man of the people , not above mixing with the plebs in the public baths .
He had his eyes open for his subjects ' genuine distress and personally intervened to help .
But you could n't take him for a ride .
Sadly , very little of the life is up to this quality .
Most of it is a garbled confection , weaving together without much regard for chronology allegations of conspiracies , accounts of palace intrigue , and vendettas on Hadrian 's part - plus an assortment of curious facts and personal titbits ( his beard , it is claimed , was worn to cover up his bad skin ) .
To fill the gaps , to make a coherent story out of the extraordinary material remains of his reign , to explain what drove the man , modern writers have been forced back on to their prejudices and familiarising assumptions about Roman imperial power and personalities .
So , for example , where - thanks to the surviving ancient literary accounts - it has been impossible to see Nero as anything other than a rapacious megalomaniac , Hadrian has morphed conveniently into cultured art collector and amateur architect .
Where Nero 's relationships with men have to be seen as part of the corruption of his reign , Hadrian has been turned into a troubled gay .
Hadrian seems familiar to us - for we have made him so .
The British Museum exhibition presents Hadrian as an appropriate successor to the first emperor of China and his terracotta army , both key figures in the foundation and development of early imperial societies .
Maybe so .
But an even better reason to visit this stunning show is to see how the myth of a Roman emperor has been created - and continues to be created - out of our own imagination and the dazzling but sometimes puzzling array of statues , silver plates and lost keys of slaughtered Jewish freedom - fighters .

Chad laments that we do n't hear that much about the decathlon any more , because Americans are n't really competitive .
I also think it 's a shame , because any sport in which your score can be a complex number deserves more attention .
Yes , it 's true .
The decathlon combines ten different track and field events , so to come up with a final score we need some way to tally up all of the individual scores so that each event is of approximately equal importance .
You know what that means : an equation .
Let 's imagine that you finish the 100 meter dash in 9.9 seconds .
Then your score in that event , call it x , is x = 9.9 .
This corresponds to a number of points , calculated according to the following formulas :
points = α( x0 - x ) ^β for track events , points = α( x - x0 ) ^β for field events .
That 's right -- power laws !
With rather finely - tuned coefficients , although it 's unclear whether they occur naturally in any compactification of string theory .
The values of the parameters α , x0 and β are different for each of the ten events , as this helpful table lifted from Wikipedia shows :
Event α x0 β Units 100 m 25.437 18 1.81 seconds Long Jump 0.14354 220 1.4 centimeters Shot Put 51.39 1.5 1.05 meters High Jump 0.8465 75 1.42 centimeters 400 m 1.53775 82 1.81 seconds 110 m Hurdles 5.74352 28.5 1.92 seconds Discus Throw 12.91 4 1.1 meters Pole Vault 0.2797 100 1.35 centimeters Javelin Throw 10.14 7 1.08 meters 1500 m 0.03768 480 1.85 seconds
The goal , of course , is to get the most points .
Note that for track events , your goal is to get a low score x ( running fast ) , so the formula involves ( x0 - x ) ; in field events you want a high score ( throwing far ) , so the formula is reversed , ( x - x0 ) .
Do n't ask me how they came up with those exponents β.
You might think the mathematics consultants at the International Olympic Committee could tidy things up by just using an absolute value , |x - x0 | ^β .
But those athletes are no dummies .
If you did that , you could start getting great scores by doing really badly !
Running the 100 meter dash in 100 seconds would give you 74,000 points , which is kind of unfair .
( The world record is 8847 . )
However , there remains a lurking danger .
What if I did run a 100 - second 100 meter dash ?
Under the current system , my score would be an imaginary number !
61237.4 - 41616.9i , to be precise .
I could then argue with perfect justification that the magnitude of my score , | 61237.4 - 41616.9i | , is 74,000 , and I should win .
Even if we just took the real part , I come out ahead .
And if those arguments did n't fly , I could fall back on the perfectly true claim that the complex plane is not uniquely ordered , and I at least deserve a tie .
Do n't be surprised if you see this strategy deployed , if not now , then certainly in 2012 .
Barcelona , Spain :
For the first time in the world scientists have succeeded in developing human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) from a single cell , or blastomere , of a 4 - cell stage embryo , the 24th annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology heard today ( Wednesday 9 July ) .
Dr. Hilde Van de Velde , from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel ( VUB ) , Brussels , Belgium , said that their research meant that it might be possible in the future to produce hESC lines at an earlier stage without destroying the embryo .
Blastomeres are formed in the very early stages of embryonic development .
About 24 hours after fertilisation the egg divides into two cells .
Division into four cells occurs after 48 hours .
After 96 hours , at the morula stage , the fertilized egg has divided four to five times .
During this time the size of the embryo does not increase , so the cells become smaller and smaller and they are strongly attached to each other which makes them more difficult to manipulate .
At this early stage important decisions are taken : inner cells will become the foetus ( including germ cells ) and outer cells will become trophoblast ( the outermost layer of the embryo that attaches to the wall of the uterus and serves as a nutritive pathway ) .
There was , until now , uncertainty about which stage of early development the blastomeres ceased to be totipotent , i.e. able to develop into all cell types of the body .
Worldwide , the majority of established hESC lines have been derived from the inner cells at the blastocyst stage ; these are said to be pluripotent .
" Previously , scientists have been able to derive hESC lines at the 8 - cell stage , " said Dr. Van de Velde , " but success rates were variable and it was necessary to culture them by mixing with established hESC lines .
We have been able to derive hESCs at an earlier stage of embryonic development , and without the need for co-culture with established hESC lines .
Now we have derived a second hESC from one cell of a 4 - cell stage embryo .
Given the complex nature of earlier attempts , we were pleased that we could develop a technique that seemed simple and was also reproducible . "
The scientists used mature eggs donated by couples being treated at the University 's IVF centre .
Embryos were obtained after ICSI using sperm from a consenting donor .
Three , good quality 4 - cell stage embryos were split into 12 single blastomeres and allowed to grow in vitro to produce twelve morulas that were cultured in the conventional way for hESC derivation .
From these twelve , one resulted in a stable hESC line .
The scientists concluded that at least one cell was pluripotent .
These new data confirm their recent report that at the 4 - cell stage the cells are equal and totipotent .
" Now we will try to derive four hESC lines from the same embryo in order to compare the potency capacity of all four cells , " said Dr. Van de Velde .
The work could have major ramifications for preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) , by enabling the biopsy of one cell from a 4 - cell stage embryo , allowing the remaining three cells to develop into a blastocyst ( five day embryo ) which could be transferred into the uterus and develop into a healthy baby .
" Currently , PGD is performed at the 8 - cell stage , when one or two cells are removed ; others have derived stable hESC lines at this stage but with low efficiency .
If hESC derivation at the 4 - cell stage turns out to be more efficient then at the 8 - cell stage , we might consider to change our PGD policy in cases where we perform human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) typing , " said Dr. Van de Velde .
HLA molecules play an important role in the immune system by ensuring that our bodies recognise their own cells as their own .
By being able to select an HLA - identical embryo , the cord blood of the ' saviour siblings ' could help cure an older brother or sister suffering from a genetic disease affecting the production and / or function of hematopoietic ( blood producing ) stem cells .
" We could also combine the pregnancy of an HLA - matched healthy baby with the derivation of a personal hESC line that could be used to generate in vitro hematopoietic stem cells as an additional source of hematopietic stem cells , " she said .
" We need to determine whether the removal of one cell at the 4 - cell stage impairs the capacity of the embryo to develop into a healthy child in comparison with the removal of one / two cells at the 8 - cell stage .
We understand that some people may have ethical concerns about the production of hESCs , " said Dr. Van de Velde , " but we already know from cryopreserved embryos that the loss of one cell from a 4 - cell stage embryo does not affect its capacity to implant in the womb .
We believe that by making it possible to intervene at an earlier stage , and without destruction of the embryo , these ethical concerns will be diminished . "
In fact , opinion among the public is very much in favour of stem cell research , another researcher told the conference .
Ms Jaclyn Friedman , a clinical embryologist at Reproductive Biology Associates , Atlanta , Georgia , USA , undertook an on - line survey looking at attitudes towards IVF around the world .
Two questions related specifically to human embryonic stem cell research and use in therapy .
" This is the first time an on - line questionnaire has been used to establish a cross-sectional view of ethical opinion in the global community , " said Ms. Friedman .
" Because stem cell research is increasingly important , we felt that we needed to gauge opinion among members of the public , as well as IVF patients , doctors and scientists working in the field . "
The researchers analysed the following two questions :
" I believe that it is morally wrong to use embryonic stem cells for research "
and
" I believe that it is morally wrong to use embryonic stem cells for medical treatment . "
573 people responded to these questions .
The researchers found that 47.1 % strongly disagreed with the viewpoint posed in question 1 , whereas only 4.5 % strongly agreed .
4.1 % agreed , 10 % were neutral , and 31.2 % disagreed , meaning that in total 78.3 % of respondents disagreed with the view that it is wrong to use hESCs in research .
For the second question , the results were broadly similar , although fewer people ( 3.1 % ) felt that it was morally wrong to use ESCs in medical treatment than in research .
" We found no difference between male and female attitudes towards using hESCs for research , but when it came to medical treatment , men showed significantly more support than women .
" We found no significant differences when we looked at particular age groups , but a higher level education of respondents correlated with greater support for the use of hESCs , both in research and medical treatment .
There were no important differences among regions of the world .
" We hope that this questionnaire might act as a pilot study for something much larger and more representative of the views of the international community .
But even with our existing numbers , we found enough difference between the views of people working in the field , the general public , and patients , to know that the results have statistical significance .
Our study shows that public , patient , and scientific opinion is very much in favour of both stem cell research and the therapeutic use of stem cells in medical treatment .
This is different from the perceived equal distribution for and against hESC use reported in the news media , " she said .
The full results from the questionnaire will be available later this year on IVF .

The Handil Oil Field
Handil is a giant oil field in the Mahakam Province of Indonesia , discovered in 1974 and still operated by ' TOTAL Exploration and Production Indonesia ' .
The International Society of Petroleum Engineers had a feature article on ' Reviving the Mature Handil Field ' in the January 2008 addition of their Journal of Petroleum Technology [ 1 ] .
Figure 1 : Location of the Handil Oil Field
Source : Wikipedia and LNGplants.com
From the JPT article : The Handil field comprises 555 unconnected accumulations ( reservoirs ) in structurally stacked and compartmentalized deltaic sands .
The reservoirs are trapped by the Handil anticline , which is cut by major impermeable fault dividing the field into two compartments : north and south .
The reservoirs are between 200 and 3500 metres subsea and cover an area 10 km long by 4 km wide .

Oil Recovery
Before proceeding , it is important to understand the basic mechanisms of recovering oil from a reservoir :
Pressure on the fluids in a reservoir rock causes the fluids to flow through the pores into the well .
This energy that produces the oil and gas is called the reservoir drive [ 2 ] .
Primary Recovery is the oil produced by the original reservoir drive energy .
The two most important natural reservoir drive mechanisms are Gas Depletion and Water Drive :
Gas Depletion Drive :
In the subsurface , the oil is under high pressure and has a considerable amount of natural gas dissolved in it .
When a well is drilled into the reservoir , pressure in the reservoir decreases and gas can bubble out of the oil which can form a gas cap .
Dissolved gas drive is very inefficient and will produce relatively little of the original oil in place from the reservoir .
While this drive mechanism is commonly used to produce gas fields , rarely would it be relied upon for oil production .
In the subsurface , the oil is under high pressure and has a considerable amount of natural gas dissolved in it .

Dissolved gas drive is very inefficient and will produce relatively little of the original oil in place from the reservoir .
While this drive mechanism is commonly used to produce gas fields , rarely would it be relied upon for oil production .
Water Drive : Water Drive reservoirs are driven by water adjacent to or below the oil reservoir .
The produced oil is replaced in the reservoir by water .
An active water drive maintains an almost constant reservoir pressure and oil production through the life of the wells .
The amount of water produced from a well sharply increases when the water reaches the well .
The recovery of oil in place from a water - drive reservoir is relatively high .
It depends highly on the type of reservoir drive , the viscosity of the oil and permeability of the reservoir , but primary recovery produces on average 30 - 35 % of the oil initially in place ( OIIP ) , although it can be as low as 5 % .
Generally this leaves a considerable amount of oil in the reservoir , so additional recovery techniques may be employed :
Secondary Recovery :
This involves injecting water into the field through injection wells .
It can be initiated before or after the natural reservoir drive has been fully depleted .
The aim is to use the water to sweep some of the remaining oil to producing wells .
A waterflood can recover anything from 5 - 50 % of the remaining oil in place that would not have been produced using primary recovery alone .
The actual amount achieved depends enormously on the properties of the particular field .
Tertiary Recovery ( Enhanced Oil Recovery ) :
In some cases , where Secondary Recovery still leaves a significant amount of oil in place in the reservoir , enhanced oil recovery may be effective .
Enhanced Oil Recovery ( EOR ) includes thermal , chemical and miscible gas processes - injecting substances into the reservoir that are not naturally found there .
Secondary Recovery techniques have been widely used since the early days of the industry .
They are already in place in almost all fields where it is necessary or effective .
The history of Tertiary recovery also goes back more than half a century .
Tertiary Recovery , however , is only effective for a narrow selection of fields and involves substantially higher costs and effort .
Lifecycle of a Giant Oil Field
In their 1986 assessment of the world 's 500 " Giant Oil and Gas Fields " , Carmalt and St John [ 3 ] ranked Handil number 303 with an estimated 800 million barrels of ultimately recoverable oil .
We can see that this 20 year - old estimate is very close to the mark in terms of the amount of oil produced with primary and secondary recovery ( see Table 2 ) .
This should give us increased confidence in the Carmalt and St John estimates for other giant fields , including those in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries where current data transparency is inadequate .
Figure 2 : Handil Oil Production History
Adapted from this Presentation : Mature Kutei Basin of Indonesia
JPT : To maintain production and reservoir pressure , water injection was started in 1978 which maintained the 160,000 BOPD production until 1985 .
The production profile here presents a common picture of the lifecycle of a giant oil field .
Secondary recovery ( water injection ) is used to maintain an oil production plateau for as long as possible before more significant decline becomes inevitable .
After that , owners of the field have to decide whether intensive efforts to study , develop and apply tertiary ( enhanced ) recovery will recover enough additional oil to make it economically attractive .
Mature Field Revitalization
JPT : In November 1995 a lean gas injection project was initiated in five reservoirs .
The project boosted the production of the five large reservoirs and altered the overall decline rate of the field .
Therefore , the project was extended in 2000 to six other large reservoirs , which resulted in more than 25 per cent of the field reserves being under a tertiary - recovery mechanism .
Tom Standing ( ASPO USA Newsletter , November 5 , 2007 ) : Oil extraction by miscible gas injection goes beyond conventional pressure maintenance by injecting a gas with specific properties , at pressures sufficient to create a highly mobile gas / oil fluid phase that swells and fills pore space in the reservoir rock .
Compression energy from the surface pushes this miscible phase toward wellbores .
Injected gas cannot be chemically reactive in the reservoir .
Of the 8 million barrels produced using enhanced recovery mechanisms up to 2002 , 6 million was from Phase 1 Lean Gas injection and 2 million from Phase 2 Lean Gas injection .
Spurred on by their early success with lean gas injection , TOTAL kicked off a bigger campaign of ' Mature Field Revitalization ' in 2003 , including the following activities :
Dynamic Modeling and Sweet Spot Mapping : Dynamic computer models combined with well logs and other static historical production data are used to identify the location of bypassed oil and smaller undrained areas of reservoir .

Light Workovers ( LWOs ) :
Well interventions performed without pulling the completion at the bottom of the well .
These LWOs are used to isolate water producing zones and target prospective new reservoir sections .

Where a Light Workover cannot be used because of the condition of the well , drilling new wells recovers the potential reserves in areas identified by Sweet Spot Mapping .

Enhanced Oil ( Tertiary ) Recovery and Optimization : Miscible Gas Injection ( described above ) , in this case using natural gas , is injected into the crest of the reservoir and attempts to sweep oil that has been bypassed toward the producing wells .
JPT : In 2005 , 26 LWOs were performed , of which 19 were successful .
The project resulted in 1.7 million STBO ( stock tank barrels of oil ) production during the year and 4 million STBO of incremental reserves .
The total cost was approximately USD 2 million .
The stated costs for LWOs yield a figure of $ 2 per barrel added as reserves - very economical but the potential is of course very limited ( production costs are in addition to this ) .
The more expensive infill wells were used for shallow reservoirs with heavy oil , or multi-lateral wells to target multiple small reservoirs which did not justify single wells previously .
The Results
Hopefully it is clear that what is simply described as ' Mature Field Revitalization ' comprises many years of technically challenging study and modeling followed by intensive application in the field .
For the engineers and geologists involved this was no doubt rewarding work .
While all of these activities can be considered the application of ' new technology ' , only the final step is considered Enhanced Oil Recovery .
JPT : These key elements increased the production from 12,500 BOPD in 2003 to 23,000 BOPD in 2007 .
For a substantial investment of time , money and effort in the giant Handil oil field , we gain just 10,000 barrels per day of oil production .
Yet this case study has appeared in the Journal of Production Technology because it is a prime example of what can be achieved ( the two other case studies in the same issue showed only very mediocre gains ) .
While there will be isolated fields that perform better , there will be many more that fail to make the pages of the Journal of Petroleum Technology because they provide far less spectacular returns .
In many cases , after intensive appraisal and assessment the schemes never get off the drawing board .
Tom Standing ( ASPO USA Newsletter , October 1 2007 ) :
An aspect of EOR that is seldom discussed is that recovery processes target oil fields with highly specific properties of reservoir rock and fluids .
In brief , EOR processes are not universally applicable .
With long years of research and field trials , the industry has developed two categories of EOR success .
Thermal methods in highly permeable reservoirs containing heavy viscous oil
Carbon dioxide or nitrogen ( or natural gas ) injection at miscible pressures in reservoirs with poor permeability
The vast population of oil fields with light oil and good permeability generally have not responded to EOR efforts [ because Secondary Recovery alone is already highly effective ] .
The Impact of Technology
TOTAL would be pleased if their efforts with the Handil oil field can increase the ultimate amount of oil recovered by even 5 % ( 40 million barrels ) compared to primary and secondary recovery alone .
A 10 % increase in this case looks unlikely .
The returns look pretty small when averaged across the world 's oil fields , given that only a proportion of them deliver a reward for this kind of effort .
While these aspects of ' advanced oil field technology ' can increase production from particular oil fields , thereby attractively increasing profits for the owner , they do not significantly alter the picture of global oil resources .
Figure 3 : World Oil Discovery and Production
The Law of Diminishing Returns
Economists seem to have trouble understanding geological and technical limits to oil production , but they should understand the law of diminishing returns ( Wikipedia ) :
According to this relationship , in a production system with fixed and variable inputs , beyond some point , each additional unit of variable input yields less and less additional output .
Conversely , producing one more unit of output costs more and more in variable inputs .
In our case we have finite , bounded oil fields .
Until the mid 1980s , discovery of new oil fields exceeded our consumption rate , so there was little need to increase recovery from existing fields .
As the discovery rate declined , companies had greater motivation to extract more from their existing fields .
While at first they found easy gains , in the last decade especially the amount of effort required has climbed and yet the returns are falling : is it any surprise that oil industry inflation is rampant ?
Oil field reserves may have ' grown ' 10 - 20 per cent since the Carmalt and St John assessment in 1986 , but we should not expect the next 20 years to deliver the same gain .
Discovery of new fields has tapered off to low levels and the easy pickings for increased recovery have already been had .
Unconventional oil sources will yield similarly small returns for extraordinary amounts of effort .
The numbers simply do not stack up for oil production continuing to expand for another decade against the decline in large mature conventional oil fields .
Summary
How can you double something and still have ten times less than you started with ?
In the case of the Handil Oil Field , a concerted campaign to revitalize the field almost doubled production from 12,500 barrels per day in 2003 to 23,000 in 2007 .
Yet this field had once produced nearly two hundred thousand barrels per day .
This is a representative picture of the role of technology and enhanced oil recovery : merely extending the tail end of production in oil fields that are well past their own peak in production .
So while the Society of Petroleum Engineers and other optimists tell us that technology and enhanced oil recovery will delay peak oil , a more objective look at the data suggests that production declines are relentless and they are stacking up much faster than incremental technological gains .

Enlarge Activision
An animated Ozzy Osbourne appears at a virtual Ozzfest in the upcoming video game Guitar Hero World Tour .
The latest artist announced to join Guitar Hero World Tour ?
Ozzy Osbourne .
He and guitarist Zakk Wylde will appear in the game , due this fall , as will songs such as Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley .
Those songs will be playable in a virtual Ozzfest venue .
Osbourne chatted on the phone — just days before this year 's Ozzfest Saturday in Dallas — with me about video games and technology .
Q : So you are going to be in a video game ?
A : Yeah .
I 've been involved with it for quite a while .
They ( Activision ) liked my music and I have a big young following , I 've been told .
I 'm from the old school .
I do n't own a computer .
I just got an iPod that I 've organized .
I have got to learn how to turn it on .
That 's about it , you know .
I can't download .
I can't do any load .
Q : So it 's really you in the game , right ?
A : I had to put on this black suit with all these little ping - pong ball - like things all over me , motion capture .
I had to dance around like I 'm on stage when one of my songs are on .
I do n't really know how it works , but I have seen a run of it .
It is really interesting .
The image of me , I wish I had the energy it has .
The graphics are really , really good .
Q : What do you think of these video games as a way for music lovers to interact with music ?
A : The music thing is OK , but there are so many other video games .
Like I went " wow " at the one with carjacking and all of that .
Some desensitize kids , you know .
It 's a changing time .
Of course , I used to see horror films when I was a kid and to lie that you were over 16 to get in .
My son Jack , he wo n't return your call .
You have to text him .
I have a cellphone , but I can't say I 'm in love with the thing .
You have to be pretty bright to keep up with the changes , and just when you learn something , it 's time to learn something else .
Q : Do you see video games as a good way for musicians to get their music heard ?
A : I guess it is .
The download epidemic has killed record sales .
It 's kind of like the new thing to do , I suppose , because it 's one way of getting your music to kids and keeps the tours going .
I used to make a record , and more or less it would sell a million and it would go a while , you know .
Now , it 's like you get 750,000 or 800,000 and it slows down .
For every one you sell , 10 get downloaded .
But it 's technology .
You ai n't gonna stop it now .
Q : Anything new you can tell me about your upcoming Osbournes ' TV project ( a six - episode hourlong variety show on Fox ) ?
A : There 's a word that scares me a little ( used to describe the new show ) , the word " variety . "
If we do a Christmas show , believe me , I 'm not going to be sitting at a cozy fire with a scarf on and singing , " I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas . "
I 'm making that perfectly clear right now .
I 'm not singing any ( crappy ) little f—- ing Christmas songs .
It 's kind of like an unscripted ( thing ) .
I hope it turns out because Mama , Sharon , is kind of the TV person .
She said it would be great if we could all get back together and put this thing on .
You know what ?
OK .
We nearly lost her a few years ago when she had cancer .
So her passion is for TV .
She loves it , so we all love it with her , you know .
But I 'm not going to become the weatherman or the next Larry King .
I 'm just going to check it out .
Q : Can you say anything about next year 's Ozzfest ?
( This year 's is a one - off concert with Metallica and System of a Down Saturday in Dallas ) .
A : I guess my wife has a plan up her sleeve .
There will be something next year .
I think it will be the Ozzfest again , back to normal ( a multi- date tour ) .
But I do n't know at this point .
Q : Anything else in the works ?
A : I am recording another album soon .
I 've got a Pro Tools machine downstairs in my house now , which I record from home now .
I can't turn the f —— ing thing on .
( Laughs ) .
It 's like the brain of the house .
But when you have somebody who knows what they are doing , it 's so easy to make records now , it 's not even funny .
The art of making records is somewhat diminishing .
It 's taking the passion out of it .
But I will try to give it as much real me as I can .
There 's so many tricks I can use .
I want to make two albums .
Make one and go out on that one , and make another one and go out on that .
Time is very valuable to me now .
I 'm 60 this December .
It does not seem 10 years since I was 50 .
It really does n't .
My mission now is to do as much as I can .

Three weeks earlier , Cardinal Pell had received a report from an independent investigation by Howard Murray into Father Goodall .
This advised him that the complaints of both men should be upheld , but Cardinal Pell 's letter to Mr Jones directly contradicted that advice .
Cardinal Pell did not respond last night .
But Mr Jones told the Herald he believed Cardinal Pell should resign .
" The apology that the Pope may give [ to church abuse victims ] has no meaning if the Archbishop of Sydney is still covering up sexual assaults , " he said .
" [ Pell ] assaulted me all over again through his lies .
I had to live through these two sexual assaults through his lies . "
Mr Jones , now a 54 - year - old disability pensioner , was 29 and training as a teacher when Father Goodall assaulted him in a Sydney pool - and then again that night in a presbytery - in 1982 .
Cardinal Pell , in his letter to the other victim , acknowledged that Father Goodall had also engaged in " inappropriate behaviour " with altar boys .
In 2005 , Father Goodall pleaded guilty to two counts of indecently assaulting Mr Jones .
He had also been charged with attempted buggery , but pleaded guilty only to indecent assault .
He was sentenced under old laws which , at the time of the encounter , had banned even consensual sexual contact between men .
The case was controversial for its retrospective use of the laws - and Father Goodall was given a token sentence of four seconds .
Mr Jones first complained to the church in the days after the assault .
In 2002 , he complained again , as did the other victim .
The report into their complaints was delivered to Cardinal Pell a month before he wrote to the victims in 2003 .
Contrary to Cardinal Pell 's claim to Mr Jones , the report did not indicate that Father Goodall " categorically denies the accusation " .
Nor did it recommend the two victims be dealt with in a different manner .
" Given the admission volunteered by Fr Goodall , it can be concluded that the allegations made by Tony and [ Boy X ] are sustained , " Mr Murray , the independent assessor , wrote .
He recommended " both Tony and [ Boy X ] be informed in writing that their allegations have been sustained " .
He found " Fr Goodall readily admitted to the behaviour complained of by Tony …
He agreed that he had fondled Tony 's penis without consent in the pool as a result of ' a physical attraction ' . "
According to the report , Father Goodall agreed generally with Mr Jones 's account of the events that then took place on a bed , although said it was " more consensual , than forced upon Tony " .
" He cannot recall whether he ejaculated , as alleged by Tony , but agreed it was likely , " the report found .
In his letter to the other victim , Cardinal Pell accepted that he had been attacked by Father Goodall .
" After examining all the material , Mr Murray provided me with a report in which he recommended that the complaints of inappropriate behaviour with altar boys and of indecent assault of you when a young boy be found to be substantiated . "
Mr Jones said the second victim validated his case beyond the technical issue of homosexuality .
The victims ' support group Broken Rites called for Cardinal Pell to stand aside while the matter was investigated .
Despite repeated requests , the Herald had received no response from Cardinal Pell at the time of publication .
But early this morning Cardinal Pell issued a statement denying there was a cover - up or that he tried to mislead Mr Jones .
" There was no attempt at a cover - up , " he said .
" The letter to Mr Jones was badly worded and a mistake - an attempt to inform him there was no other allegation of rape . "
" However , I signed both letters of February 2003 mentioned in the ABC's Lateline program , and any fault in the drafting was mine .
" The accusations against Father Goodall were investigated by the church and the police and Father Goodall was stood down .
" In a subsequent letter soon after the February 2003 letter I expressed my sorrow at what Mr Jones had suffered and offered to meet him .
" There was no attempt to mislead him .
I apologise for the confusion caused to Mr Jones . "

In a word : energy .
Dragging yourself to a job you hate takes effort .
Being civil with a crazy boss and the lazy jerks called co-workers takes effort .
The job itself is boring and repetitive , so staying on task takes effort .
By the end of the day , you ’re worn out , so you eat whatever ’s handy and go to bed .
From here it ’s a downward spiral because you ’re not replenishing your energy .
The next day you get up and go through the same routine again .
Now what happens when you have a boring repetitive routine ?
Your mind goes on autopilot .
Sometimes habit is a good thing .
If you had to relearn how to tie your shoelaces every morning , how much would you accomplish with your life ?
In this case autopilot is dangerous because you ’re locking into a self - destructive pattern .
Getting out of the rut is a classic catch - 22 because you ’re required to exert yourself when your personal energy gauge is pointing at empty .
The trick is to start small , taking one step at a time .
** First listen to yourself .
**
Are you joining the gripe sessions on work breaks ?
Are you whining to all your friends about how tired you are ?
Positive affirmations work by programming your mind through repetition , and negative affirmations work the same way .
Every time you tell someone you ’re tired , you actually make yourself feel more tired .
So stop .
If your co-workers wo n’t change the subject — apparently some people get an addictive adrenaline charge from complaining — find something else to do on your breaks .
** Then shake up your routine . **
If you normally wear dark colors , wear something in a lighter color .
Take a different route to work one morning .
Drink a different beverage on break .
Eat a decent supper , or at least pick up better quality fast food .
Little victories lead to bigger ones .
The more you stay off autopilot , the better you ’ll feel .
** Make a plan . **
Time wasted on whining is better spent brainstorming ways to escape .
Make sure your friends understand you ’re talking about a real life escape .
I ’ve discovered the hard way that some people love to daydream out loud with you , but they have no intention of doing anything .
To them it ’s just part of hanging out , sort of like playing Dungeons & Dragons without dice .
( If they ’re happy with their own lives , they ’re being ultra polite in not telling you that your dream of telecommuting is rather lame as fantasies go . )
You need someone who ’ll hold you accountable .
If you ca n’t find a serious goal buddy , consider getting a life coach .
** Finally , carry out the plan . **
Where do you want to be ?
What specifically do you need to do to get there ?
Break it down into simple steps .
Take a step every day .
Even if you just send one networking email or make just one phone call , you ’ll have moved forward .
Some days you ’ll have more momentum .
Some days you ’ll have less .
Just keep moving forward .
Research led by UK and Australian scientists sheds new light on the role that our ancestors played in the extinction of Australia 's prehistoric animals .
The new study provides the first evidence that Tasmania 's giant kangaroos and marsupial ' rhinos ' and ' leopards ' were still roaming the island when humans first arrived .
The findings suggest that the mass extinction of Tasmania 's large prehistoric animals was the result of human hunting , and not climate change as previously believed .
Scientists have long argued over the reasons behind the worldwide mass extinctions that took place towards the end of the last ice age .
The main culprits are generally thought to be climate change or some form of human impact .
People only arrived in Tasmania around 43,000 years ago , when the island became temporarily connected by a land bridge to mainland Australia .
None of Tasmania 's giant animals , known as ' megafauna ' were known to have survived until this time .
This appeared to clear humans of any involvement in the disappearance of the island 's large megafauna .
This new international study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA , reports the discovery of giant kangaroos surviving in Tasmania until people arrived , placing humans back on the list of likely culprits for the subsequent extinction of the megafauna .
Using the latest radiocarbon and luminescence dating techniques , the team were able to determine the age of the fossilised remains of the megafauna more accurately than ever before .
The results showed that some of these animals survived until at least 41,000 years ago — much later than previously thought and up to 2,000 years after the first human settlers arrived .
As climate in Tasmania was not changing dramatically at this time , the researchers argue that this is evidence of these species being driven to extinction through over - hunting by humans .
Professor Chris Turney of the University of Exeter , lead author of the paper , said : " Ever since Charles Darwin 's discovery of giant ground sloth remains in South America , debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the world 's megafauna .
Now , 150 years on from the publication of Darwin 's seminal work The Origin of Species , the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined .
It is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species – and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today . "
The researchers believe that the tale from Tasmania is relevant to many other parts of the world .
Given Tasmania 's history as an island , these findings should help to disentangle the role of humans and climate change in other island environments , such as Britain .
Author Professor Tim Flannery of Macquarie University , Australia , said " Island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses .
They typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed . "
Previous research by Professor Flannery and Professor Bert Roberts of the University of Wollongong , Australia , has shown that 90 per cent of mainland Australia 's megafauna disappeared about 46,000 years ago , soon after humans first settled the continent .
But humans did not reach Tasmania until a few thousand years later , when the island became connected to the mainland by a land bridge as sea levels fell during the last glaciation .
" The Tasmanian results echo those on mainland Australia , putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction " , said Professor Roberts .
The most recent discoveries were made serendipitously by cavers exploring a labyrinth of tunnels under the rainforest - clad Mt Cripps in north - west Tasmania .
Author Craig Reid at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Tasmania , said " The skeletal remains provide key evidence of Tasmania 's final megafauna in the dim , if not - too - distant , past . "
The victims of Tasmania 's first humans :
Zygomaturus trilobus .

Mobile phone usage has been associated to a number of diseases ; however , causal relations have not been proved yet .
A pilot human volunteer study , conducted by the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority ( STUK ) , has recently revealed that exposure of living human skin tissues to mobile phone radiation may alter protein expression in these tissues .
This radiation ’s influence on health is not yet known .

Mobile phones have become an essential component of modern living .
However , the marked increase in the use of wireless mobile telephony throughout the world has also raised some serious health concerns , as mobile phones utilize electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range .
While currently available data does not show any negative health effects resulting from the low levels of electromagnetic energy emitted by mobile phones , there is some conflicting scientific evidence that may be worth additional study , according to FDA .
“ We do n’t see a risk looking at currently available data , but we need more definite answers about the biological effects of cell phone radiation and about the more complicated question of whether mobile phones might cause even a small increase in the risk of developing cancer ” says David Feigal , M.D. , director of FDA ’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health .
Early laboratory tests have shown that mobile phone radiation , also known as RF - EMF ( radiofrequency modulated electromagnetic fields ) alters protein expression and activity in human endothelial cell samples ( cells that originally pad blood and lymph vessels ) .
A recent study conducted by the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority ( STUK ) has examined for the first time whether or not a local exposure of human skin to RF - EMF causes changes in protein expression in living people .
The researchers exposed a small area of the forearm skin of ten female volunteers to RF - EMF for one hour and collected biopsies from exposed and non-exposed areas of their skin .
Expression analysis of 580 extractable proteins identified 8 proteins that were statistically significantly affected by the exposure .
Two of the proteins were present in all 10 volunteers .
These findings suggest that exposure to RF - EMF might affect protein expression in human skin .
” Mobile phone radiation has some biological effect .
Even if the changes are small , they still exist ” says Dariusz Leszczynski , research professor at STUK .
He adds , however , that it is much too early to determine whether the changes induced by mobile phone radiation have any effect on health .
STUK plans to launch a more extensive study , with 50 to 100 volunteers , in 2009 .
This study and similar studies are expected to shed some light on the ambiguous influence of mobile phone radiation on the human body and health .
While the possible harmful health effects of mobile phone radiation are being examined , these phones may also have some medically beneficial applications .
A couple of cell phone - related studies recently covered by TFOT deal with cell phone based medical diagnosis , as they help in the development of a process for transmission of medical images via cellular phones , and cell phone microscopy which is intended to enable visualization of samples critical for disease diagnosis .

JERUSALEM – As Israel marks its 60th anniversary , Israelis are deeply pessimistic about the prospects of peace with their neighbors , with an overwhelming majority believing they will be at war again within the next five years .
According to the April issue of Tel Aviv University ’s monthly War and Peace Index [.pdf ] , 70 percent of the Jewish public in Israel does not hold out hope for an agreement with the Palestinians , while 66 percent expressed similar sentiments regarding a deal with Syria .
Some 75 percent of the Jewish public said they thought Israel would find itself at war with " one or more Arab states " in the next five years .
The survey found similar attitudes among Israel ’s Arab population .
But the War and Peace Index , which polls 600 people and has been conducted every month for the last 15 years , also reveals that 57 percent of the Jewish public supports negotiations with the Palestinians while only 34 percent oppose talks .
An even bigger majority of 70 percent are in favor of the " two states for two peoples " solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , with only 25 percent opposing this formula .
The most recent issue of the survey may appear somewhat contradictory , but it reflects both the deep disillusionment among Israelis over the prospects for peace , and an understanding that the long - term survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state is dependent on unlocking their conflict with the Palestinians .
In the last decade , Israelis have seen the collapse of the Oslo peace accords , the eruption of the second Intifada uprising , and have watched as unilateralism , which they supported overwhelmingly , imploded .
In 2005 , a clear majority of Israelis enthusiastically supported then prime minister Ariel Sharon ’s decision to unilaterally pull the army and all the settlers out of the Gaza Strip .
Having lost faith in the Left ’s assertion that the Palestinians were a viable negotiating partner and in the Right ’s contention that Israel could continue to control the occupied territories and its 3.5 million Palestinians , Israelis were enchanted by a plan that would see them start withdrawing from those territories but without having to engage in negotiations with the Palestinians .
Today , unilateralism has been discredited in the eyes of most Israelis .
Islamic militants fire rockets from Gaza into Israel on an almost daily basis .
Over 4,000 rockets have been fired since Israel left Gaza in August 2005 , killing 11 people and terrorizing the residents in the southern town of Sderot , which has been hardest hit .
The takeover of the coastal strip by the Islamic Hamas movement , which does not recognize Israel ’s right to exist , has further convinced Israelis that a similar move in the West Bank would be folly .
The result : Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has had to shelve his plan for a unilateral withdrawal from much of the West Bank .
Pessimism about the prospects of peace with the Palestinians has increased because there appears to have been little tangible progress in talks between the sides , which were re-launched last December after a seven - year hiatus .
But if Israelis are deeply skeptical about the prospects of ending the conflict with the Palestinians , the War and Peace Index nevertheless found that a clear majority of Jews in Israel  some 70 percent  support the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel .
This strong support can be explained , in part , by demographic fears harbored by Israel ’s Jewish population , who worry that if they do n’t relinquish the West Bank , then higher Arab birth rates will ultimately mean that they will be a minority  and the Arabs a majority  in the geographic area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea ( including Israel and the occupied territory ) .
At that point , with a Jewish minority ruling over an Arab majority , Israel would cease to be a democratic state .
Olmert has long been one of the most vigorous exponents of the " demographic " argument , telling his countrymen last year that if they do n’t leave Palestinian areas , Israel would find itself in an untenable apartheid - like situation .
" The day will come when the two - state solution collapses and we face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , " he said .
" As soon as that happens , the state of Israel is finished . "
Israel has the most powerful and sophisticated army in the Middle East , but 60 years after the state came into existence Israelis still have profound existential concerns .
The War and Peace Index found that Iran ’s nuclear ambitions were considered by most Israelis to be " the gravest security danger " facing their country .
While Iran insists its nuclear program is civilian in nature , Israel , the U.S. , and much of Europe is convinced Tehran is bent on acquiring nuclear weapons .
Just over 60 years after Adolf Hitler tried to wipe out the Jews of Europe , many Israelis believe that if Iran is able to build the bomb then they will again face the threat of annihilation .
Interestingly , the survey found that attitudes among Israel ’s Arab population  1.2 million out of a total population of 7.3 million  were similar on many issues to those held by the Jewish public .
A majority ( 52 percent ) said they did not believe talks between Israel and the Palestinians would lead to a peace agreement , while an even bigger majority ( 61 percent ) said they expected Israel to find itself in a war in the next five years .
The Arab public also ranked Iran ’s efforts to attain nuclear capability as the greatest threat facing Israel .
And a clear majority said they expected the security situation to worsen in the coming decade .
SYDNEY , Australia  Pope Benedict XVI used his first major address at the Roman Catholic Church ’s youth festival here on Thursday to warn that the world was being scarred and its natural resources used up by humanity ’s “ insatiable consumption . ”
In a broad criticism of consumer culture , before a crowd of more than 140,000 , Pope Benedict reinforced the Vatican ’s growing concern with protecting the environment , a theme he has addressed before .

Yeah , the ladies will definitely dig a guy wearing this !
But time may be running out for some small and midsize lenders .
They vary in size and location , but their common woe is the collapsed real estate market and souring mortgage loans .
Most of these banks are far smaller than the industry giants that have drawn so much scrutiny from regulators and investors .
Still , only five lenders have failed so far this year , including IndyMac .
In 1994 , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation listed 575 banks that it considered to be troubled .
As of this spring , the agency was worried about just 90 banks .
That number may go up in August , when the government releases an updated list .
“ Failed banks are a lagging indicator , not a leading indicator , ” said William Isaac , who was chairman of the F.D.I.C. in the early 1980s and is now the chairman of the Secura Group , a finance consulting firm in Virginia .
“ So you will see more troubled , more failed banks this year . ”
And yet IndyMac , one of the nation ’s largest mortgage lenders , was not on the government ’s troubled bank list this spring  an indication that other troubled banks may be below the radar .
The F.D.I.C. has $ 53 billion set aside to reimburse consumers for deposits lost at failed banks .
IndyMac will eat up $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion of that fund , the agency estimates , and that could force it to raise more money from the banks that it insures .
The agency does not disclose which banks it thinks are troubled .
But analysts are circulating their own lists , and short sellers  investors who bet against stocks  are piling on .
In recent weeks , the share prices of some regional banks , like the BankUnited Financial Corporation , in Florida , and the Downey Financial Corporation , in California , have stumbled hard amid concern about their financial health .
A BankUnited spokeswoman said the lender had largely avoided risky subprime loans .
In his “ Who Is Next ? ” report over the weekend , Mr. Bove listed the fraction of loans at banks that are nonperforming , meaning , for example , that the assets have been foreclosed on or that payments are 90 days past due .
He came up with what he called a danger zone , which was a percentage above 5 percent .
Seven banks fell in this category .
Bringing a gun to a knife fight
What Barack Obama said :
He warned that the general election campaign could get ugly .
“ They ’re going to try to scare people .
They ’re going to try to say that ‘ that Obama is a scary guy , ' ” he said .
A donor yelled out a deep accented “ Do n’t give in ! ” “ I wo n’t but that sounded pretty scary .
You ’re a tough guy , ” Obama said .
“ If they bring a knife to the fight , we bring a gun , ” Obama said .
What the Republican National Committee said :
“ Why is Barack Obama so negative ?
In the last 24 hours , he ’s completely abandoned his campaign ’s call for ‘ new politics , ’ equating the election to a ‘ brawl ’ and promising to ‘ bring a gun , ’ ” said the RNC ’s Alex Conant .
Now , I guess I know what the RNC means .
“ New politics ” is apparently supposed to mean refraining from playing hardball or giving as good as he gets when it comes to the Republican Smear Machine .
Obama has been promising for a year to be a tougher kind of Dem ; maybe the GOP has n’t been paying attention .
But that said , I have to wonder : if a Democrat brings a gun to knife fight , would n’t that necessarily be a “ new ” kind of politics ?
THE job of an economist , among many other duties , is to put things into perspective .
So , because I am an economist , among other duties , here is a little perspective on the recent turmoil in the stock and bond markets .
First , when the story of this turbulence is reported , the usual explanation mainly has to do with some new loss in the subprime mortgage world — the universe of mortgages and mortgage - backed instruments related to buyers with poor credit histories or none at all .
Here is the first instance in which proportion tells us that something is out of whack :
The total mortgage market in the United States is roughly $ 10.4 trillion .
Of that , a little over 13 percent , or about $ 1.35 trillion , is subprime — certainly a large sum .
Of this , nearly 14 percent is delinquent , meaning late in payment or in foreclosure .
Of this amount , about 5 percent is actually in foreclosure , or about $ 67 billion .
Of this amount , according to my friends in real estate , at least about half will be recovered in foreclosure .
So now we are down to losses of about $ 33 billion to $ 34 billion .
The rate of loss in subprime mortgages keeps climbing .
In time , perhaps it will double , maybe back to $ 67 billion .
This is a large sum by absolute standards , and I would sure like to have it in my bank account .
A San Francisco city commission has taken a defiant stand against Mayor Gavin Newsom 's directive on young immigrant felons by urging officials to permit the offenders to remain in the city and help pay for their housing , job placement services and immigration lawyers .
Newsom announced last month - in an attempt to quell a growing controversy involving San Francisco 's sanctuary city policy - that the city would no longer shield young illegal immigrant felony offenders from federal authorities for possible deportation .
Three weeks later , the city 's little - known , 15 - member Immigrant Rights Commission approved a resolution that ran counter to the mayor 's directive , urging the city to let young immigrant offenders stay in the city .
The commission advises the Board of Supervisors and mayor about issues involving immigrants .
It called on San Francisco to pay nonprofit community groups to screen juvenile offenders to determine whether they should be entitled to city - paid immigration attorneys who would help them seek asylum as victims of abandonment , trafficking or abuse .
It also urged the city to provide adequate resources for placing the youths in " culturally appropriate " community programs approved by the juvenile court system , a policy that federal prosecutors have said was akin to harboring illegal immigrants .
And it advised the city to develop and expand safe housing , jobs and other opportunities for unaccompanied immigrant youth " because these youth are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by adult criminals . "
Decision is up to the mayor
The three - page resolution , which was sent to the mayor and the Board of Supervisors for possible action , did not mention Newsom 's new policy .
Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said the mayor appreciated the commission 's input but " has directed the juvenile probation department in no uncertain terms " to turn over juvenile felons to federal immigration authorities .
" Ultimately , the decisions must be made by the mayor , and that is where the buck stops , " Ballard said .
Newsom announced his new policy July 2 after The Chronicle reported that federal officials had warned the city that it was illegally providing offenders free flights home and paying for them to live in group homes outside the city in lieu of deportation and that several had fled from unlocked group homes .
Two days earlier , Newsom said he had no direct authority to order the change but then reversed course as the controversy grew .
Since then , according to Newsom 's aides , the mayor 's office has been doing a " top- to - bottom " review of San Francisco 's practices and programs under the sanctuary law .
The Immigrant Rights Commission , made up of 11 members appointed by the Board of Supervisors and four by the mayor , approved the resolution on July 21 , by 13 to 1 .
The dissenting vote was cast by a local developer , Angus McCarthy , who was unavailable for comment .
The chairman did not vote .
" This is our position , the position the commission took , " said commission Chairman Jamal Dajani .
" The mayor can accept it or not , that is his prerogative . "
But , Dajani said , changing the policy as Newsom did risks the whole notion of a sanctuary city .
" Are we a sanctuary city , are we not a sanctuary city ? " he said .
" We should n't make knee - jerk reactions or abrupt decisions .
We need to have a healthy discussion . "
Aaron Peskin , president of the Board of Supervisors , called the resolution " entirely advisory . "
He would not comment Monday about the content of the resolution , saying he had not seen it .
Suspect spared deportation
The commission took its action the day after The Chronicle reported that Edwin Ramos , 21 , suspected in the June 22 slayings of Anthony Bologna and his two sons , Michael and Matthew , had committed two violent offenses when he was 17 but was spared from deportation to his native El Salvador under the city 's sanctuary policies .
Ramos is in custody in connection with the three slayings .
Ramos was identified by police as a member of a violent street gang , MS - 13 .
He had committed an assault and attempted robbery as a 17 - year - old .
Each time , he was reunited with family living in the city and spared deportation .
It is unclear how his case would be handled under the commission 's resolution , but the commission urged that undocumented immigrant offenders , " where appropriate , " be reunited " with their family and in their community in San Francisco . "
In its resolution , the commission reasoned that the youthful immigrants to the United States are often left without parents and had suffered hardships , including trauma , abuse , neglect and abandonment , and should be entitled to seek asylum .
The juvenile courts , not the federal government , should dictate how the offenders are handled , the commission said .
Dajani said he did not vote because of his role as the presiding commissioner over the hearing .
However , he said he supported the resolution .
" We are saying we should treat juveniles as juveniles regardless of their status , " he said .
" We had a hearing , we had a roomful of different organizations representing various immigrant groups from people dealing with juvenile law . "
He said the Ramos case has drawn a lot of attention .
" What happened in that unfortunate murder case created a lot of political debate , but , in the end , you cannot make a blanket policy to treat all juveniles the same , " he said .
" We should n't be punishing everyone because of one case , where we had a breakdown in the system . "

Forming new habits can be life - changing — if you start meditating , create a simple exercise habit , and eat more vegetables , you health and happiness can be transformed in a matter of months .
But sticking to a habit can be difficult , because life gets in the way .
And we get discouraged when the habit gets disrupted .
How can we form habits without all the struggle ?
I ’m going to share two strategies that I ’ve found to be priceless :
Slipping into the habit ; and Leveraging your smartphone
They ’re so painless you will barely feel them .
And your life can be changed as a result , with very little effort .
Slipping Into the Habit
The first strategy is not to try to create a full habit , but to slide into it effortlessly .
Let ’s say you want to meditate every day .
Instead of setting aside 20 minutes and a meditation space for your new habit … slip into it .
When you ’re getting out of bed , just pause for a few seconds and pay attention to your breath .
That ’s it , just a few seconds .
That ’s so easy you will barely notice the habit .
Do n’t try to become the world ’s greatest meditator , do n’t try to master the habit , just do a few seconds of it , and get on with your day .
After this becomes something you do without thinking about , try doing it for 30 seconds , then a minute .
But do n’t rush into this , take a week or two before you increase .
It will seem ridiculously easy .
You can try the same thing for exercise — instead of going to the gym or doing a 30 - minute run , try just doing a pushup when you ’re about to take a break from your computer .
Just one pushup .
Or try doing a plank as you watch TV , just for 10 seconds .
Make it super super easy to start with .
Leveraging Your Phone
This one is a version of Slipping Into the Habit … but it takes advantage of how often we check our phones .
It ’s simple and obvious : put a photo with a message on your phone ’s lockscreen .
For example , put a message that says , “ Breathe ” on your lockscreen .
Or perhaps “ Get fit . ”
Then , when you check your phone and notice this message , slip into your new habit .
If the phone says “ Breathe , ” then pay attention to your breath for just a few seconds .
If it says “ Get fit , ” then simply do a pushup or something like that .
Obviously you ca n’t do that every single time you look at your phone , but if you do it a few times a day , you ’ll be slipping into a new habit effortlessly , and soon you ’ll be on your way to a healthy habit that could change your life .

An interview Wolf Blitzer did with Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama aired on CNN ’s Late Edition program today .
During the interview Obama was asked about Mitt Romney ’s remark that Obama had never done anything with his life and has no experience .
Romney ’s full remark was , “ He has not accomplished anything during his life , in terms of legislation , or leading an enterprise , or making a business work or a city work or a state work .
He really has very little experience .
And the presidency of the United States is not an internship . ”
Obama responded sharply , “ Yes .
Well , the contest did n’t work out so well for Mitt Romney .
I think he was making those same arguments against John McCain , suggesting that John McCain , as a senator , had n’t done what Mitt Romney had done .
And , yet , here we are , and there Mitt Romney is . ”

Obama said good judgment is more important than experience , “ Look , when it comes to national security , I think that what people are looking for is good judgment .
They ’re looking for somebody who is going to be able to assess the very real risks that are out there and deploy our forces , not just military , but diplomatic , political , economic , cultural , in a way that makes the American people safe . ”
The Republicans will soon find out what Hillary Clinton already knows .
Beneath the powerful oratory of Obama is a level of political toughness , and a willingness to fight back .
If the McCain strategy is going to be to make the experience argument , then they might as well not even try .
We all know that they are going to try and do the same thing to Obama that have done to every other Democratic nominee since 1980 .
They are going to label him a tax and spend liberal whose big government ideas are a danger to the American people .
It is a pretty safe bet that this wo n’t work .
Obama is n’t the typical Democratic nominee .
He is an exciting candidate , who is someone people can rally around .
For too long Democrats have had the right ideas , but the wrong people presenting them to the American people , but in 2008 the party finally stopped picked the candidate who screamed about their electability the loudest .
The Democrats finally went with their heart and picked a good nominee .
Romney ’s comments illustrate the narrow minded tunnel vision of the GOP .
If you have not been a politician or run a business your whole life , then you are n’t qualified .
He completely disregarded Obama ’s work as a community organizer as nothing .
It is this kind of attitude that the American people are sick of .
We need a president that understands all of America , not just the white corporate part .

an important anniversary this year , and like most of our anniversaries , we 'll be celebrating it largely alone .
A century ago , a traveling salesman named Peter L. Robertson invented a new kind of screwdriver -- and its companion screw -- so prompted after he sliced himself silly with a flathead .
Today , his namesake No. 2 remains the Canadian handyman 's standard : A square head with a point , it is a design so simple and perfect that your eschewing it bewilders us .
The Robertson never slips , and it never strips , and it can be driven one - handed with nary a wobble .
And while there are pockets of reported Robertson activity in Florida , Texas , and Indiana , thanks mostly to the freethinking folks in the RV industry , you 're probably missing it from your toolbox , and that 's an even greater national tragedy than your ugly money .
In a recent ranking of great Canadian inventions , the Robertson ranked seventh , ahead of the zipper and the retractable beer - carton handle , just one spot behind the pacemaker .
But the Robertson is the real lifesaver , rescuing us from both flatheads and Henry M. Phillips 's vastly inferior product .
That sham artist actually had the nerve to suggest that his screwdrivers were designed to slip , to prevent " over - tightening . "
Up here , there 's no such word .

Advertisement Angry investors have attacked the Karachi Stock Exchange ( KSE ) in protest at plunging Pakistani share prices .
More than 200 people took part in the demonstration at the country 's main stock exchange in the southern city .
A number of windows were broken and at least two people injured , Reuters news agency reports .
The protesters demanded a temporary closure of the KSE to stop further slides .
It is down 14 % since Monday and reached an 18 - month low this week .
There were smaller protests in the cities of Islamabad and Lahore , where demonstrators burned tyres near the local exchanges .
A growing company and consumer debt burden and surging inflation have led to a crisis of confidence in Pakistan 's economy , analysts say .
Concern has also been fuelled by political infighting between the new coalition government and its allies , as well as growing US pressure on the authorities to crack down on Islamic militancy in the country .
Smashed windows
The small investors who gathered in the main hall of the Karachi Stock Exchange were alarmed by stock prices falling for the 14th day in a row .
What is needed at this point , is aggressive action from the government to lift sentiment
Shuja Rizvi ,
Capital One Equities
Investors speak out By about midday ( 0600 GMT ) on Thursday share values on the KSE had fallen more than 4 % , or 433.51 points , to 10,058.37 .
The rupee also dropped by 1.3 % , continuing a slide which has seen it lose 16.9 % of its value against the dollar so far this year .
Investors in Karachi demanded a temporary halt to trading .
When this was denied , some went on the rampage , smashing windows and lights until they were dispersed by police .
" We are looking at the situation and there is no question of suspending the market , " Razi-ur - Rahman , chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan ( SECP ) , told Reuters .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says there has been a slump in investor confidence amid doubts that Pakistan 's newly - elected government can deal with economic challenges like run-away inflation and wide trade and budget deficits .
A slump in investor confidence has accelerated
The authorities have inherited much of the problem from the previous government , and that has been compounded by high world oil and food prices , our correspondent says .
But economists say lack of leadership from the weak coalition is one of the main risks to macroeconomic stability .
" What is needed at this point , is aggressive action from the government to lift sentiment , " Shuja Rizvi , director of broking operations at Capital One Equities , told Reuters .

What are these ?
Up to 30 hungry and desperate bears have attacked and eaten two men in Russia 's wild far eastern region of Kamchatka , and have trapped a group of geologists at their remote site .
The bears - apparently starving - killed the men last Thursday , Russian agencies reported .
The bears had surrounded a local platinum mining company .
Both victims worked at the mine as security guards .
About 400 geologists and miners are now refusing to return to work , afraid of further attacks .
Attempts by local officials to fly to the scene by helicopter and shoot the bears have so far failed , because of bad weather , agencies reported .
Kamchatka , 7,500 miles and nine time zones east of Moscow on Russia 's Pacific coast , is one of the world 's last truly great natural wildernesses .
The remote volcanic peninsula is home to the rare Steller 's sea eagle , as well as puffins and brown bears , who roam its geysers and snow - covered calderas - collapsed volcanoes .
Kamchatka's 12,000 strong bear population is the largest in Eurasia .
Recently , however , the bears have faced unprecedented ecological pressures .
Poaching has led to a dramatic decline in the bear 's main food source - the Pacific salmon .
Kamchatka is home to a quarter of the world 's salmon .
But the fish is now disappearing .
Poachers have cleaned out entire species by netting rivers .
Last year hunters also shot dead at least 300 bears - picking off most of the large ones .
At least another 600 were killed illegally , conservationists estimate .
" It 's always the bear 's fault , " Laura Williams , the director of WWF 's Kamchatka office told the Guardian yesterday .
Speaking from Moscow , she said she was seeking further details of the standoff amid reports that a jeep had been sent to the region to finish the bears off .
About 10 bears have also been seen near the village of Khalino , sniffing fish remains and other garbage , agencies reported yesterday .
Village official Viktor Leushkin told Itar - Tass that a team of hunters would be dispatched to shoot or chase off the bears .
" These predators have to be destroyed , " he said , adding : " Once they kill a human they will do it again and again . "
Officials from Russia 's emergency situations ministry conceded there was too few fish this year or too many bears .
" Either way there is not enough food , " an official told yesterday 's Moscow Times .
Bears have been known in the past to attack humans in the scarcely populated region .
Most humans live in the grey and foggy regional capital , Petropavlovsk - Kamchatky , on the peninsula 's east coast .
Bears are now encroaching on towns , rummaging in bins and scoffing the remains discarded by food factories .
Officials believe that 100,000 tonnes of salmon are being illegally fished each year .
Ryan gave us 15 Crazy Ways People Make Money in Today ’s Economy .
I give you number sixteen : Jeans Insurance .
Bertie Ranger has tapped into a need of thousands of dieters and vain women everywhere .
I ’ll be watching to see if this one takes off !
The Problem
You want to look your best so you stock up on rice cakes and hit the treadmill .
Your reward ?
A new pair of jeans !
If you ’re like many consumers these days , you shell out $ 100 – $ 200 for the pair that makes your butt look good .
But maybe you ’re too successful .
What if your high fiber and power sets take you down an extra size ?
Or perhaps you have a lot to lose .
It ’s not like you can hold out for your ideal size before buying a pair of good jeans .
But who can afford all those different sizes on the way down ?
The Solution
Bertie Ranger ’s insurance for jeans could be the answer to the weight loss dilemma .
This clever entrepreneur charges 30 % for a policy .
All you have to do is send in the original purchase receipt and your fee and your jeans are insured against weight loss for up to a year .
When you lose weight , you send the old jeans in for a refund of the full purchase price .
The Business
Ranger started the business out of frustration over her own weight loss and subsequent need for successively smaller sized jeans .
A simple site facilitates the transactions and she ’s actively promoting her insurance throughout the BlogHer network .
Will she succeed ?
Maybe .
I think she ’s tapped into two distinct micro-niches .
First there ’s the one she ’s identified as dieters in need of new jeans as they continue to lose weight .
She also may get some good business from the super vain and trendy who just want to keep buying different designer jeans .
The first niche should be fairly profitable when you account for the customers who will never either a ) lose weight , or b ) cash in on the policy .
( Of course , there does n’t seem to be any restriction against gaining weight and buying larger jeans . )
Presumably she has identified a secondary market for the used jeans so she has that income in addition to the insurance revenue .
She may have to put some restrictions on that second niche .
There are certainly women I know who would love the chance to get a new pair of jeans once a month !
What is out there just waiting for you to think of ?
There should be little doubt that the Israeli government is making every effort to jump - start a war against Iran sooner rather than later .
Many Israelis not surprisingly believe it is in their interest to convince the United States to attack Iran so that Israel will not have to do it , and they are hell - bent on bringing that about .
Unfortunately , their efforts are being aided and abetted by a U.S. mainstream media that is unwilling to ask any hard questions or challenge the assumptions of the Israeli government .
Israeli intellectuals such as Benny Morris have been provided a platform to argue implausibly that a little war is necessary right now to prevent a larger nuclear conflict .
The repeated visits to Washington by Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi to pressure Washington to commit to a military option are generally unreported in the U.S. media , and no one is asking why the United States should be involved in what is clearly a " wag the dog " scenario .
For once , however , some officials in Washington appear to have developed a backbone and are pushing back .
A flurry of visits to Israel by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.
Michael Mullen , and intelligence chiefs Mike McConnell and Michael Hayden have made clear that there is considerable opposition at the Pentagon and in intelligence circles to starting a third war at this time .
Israel says that Iran is about to obtain a nuclear weapon while the Pentagon and American intelligence services are providing a more cautious assessment , putting forward the U.S. view that Iran is still far removed from having nuclear capability .
Mullen went so far as to tell the Israelis flatly that Washington does not want another war .
He even brought up the subject of the USS Liberty , a not - so subtle hint that Washington knows that Israel might try to engineer a Gulf of Tonkin - type surprise to force American involvement .
Mullen may have been implying that any incident in the Persian Gulf that might lead to armed conflict will be scrutinized carefully to determine if it is a false flag operation initiated by Tel Aviv .
On the home front there is also some additional good news for those who prefer diplomacy to warfare : Congress is in recess and wo n’t be able to do anything truly stupid , at least not until next month .
House Resolution 362 has 261 co-sponsors , but it is still in committee and the word is that it will be rewritten because of concerns about some of its language .
Though not binding , it would have recommended a blockade of Iranian ports to stop the import of petroleum products , which many have rightly seen as an act of war .
Senate Resolution 580 , which has 49 senators as co-sponsors , is also reportedly being redrafted .
The antiwar movement has claimed some credit for stopping the two resolutions in their original versions because of a mobilization that produced thousands of calls to congressmen , but AIPAC has been lobbying heavily for the approval of both resolutions .
I expect that the Israel lobby will prevail .
Both resolutions should pass with overwhelming majorities when Congress reconvenes after Labor Day .
The principal problem in attempting to derail the rush to war has been the mainstream media , which provides a bully pulpit for those who want war .
The media also accepts the framework of the Iran " problem " as defined by Washington and Tel Aviv , refusing to enter into any kind of serious , adult discussion of how the outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran might be resolved .
A good example of how it all works was provided on Aug. 3 , when Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was interviewed on CNN ’s Late Edition by Wolf Blitzer , who himself once worked for AIPAC .
Livni has an interesting resume .
Her father was one of the Irgun terrorists who blew up the King David hotel in 1946 and later massacred Arab villagers in Deir Yassin .
As a teenager , Livni participated in demonstrations on behalf of the nationalist extremist group Greater Israel , which advocated expelling all Arabs and extending Israeli domination over all of historic Palestine to include the West Bank , parts of Jordan , up to the Litani River in Lebanon to the north , and down to include Sinai and the Suez Canal in the south and west .
She is reported to have mellowed somewhat since that time .
She was close to Ariel Sharon , became justice minister , switched over to Kadima with Sharon , and was elected to the Knesset .
She was rewarded with the Foreign Ministry by Sharon and now serves Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
She is a former intelligence officer , a lawyer by training , bright and articulate , and generally regarded as a " realist " vis-à - vis the Palestinians and the Muslim world , meaning that she supported the Sharon policy of " disengagement " and seeks a negotiated solution and normalization rather than continuing armed conflict .
She appears to be the leading candidate to replace Ehud Olmert when he steps down later this year due to his acceptance of gifts from an American businessman .
Livni has been reported as having said privately in October 2007 that Iran poses no existential threat to Israel and was highly critical of attempts to hype the danger , but her private views have not in any way influenced her public pronouncements .
In her interview with CNN she made a number of statements that are inaccurate or at best speculative , but predictably , she was not challenged in any way by Blitzer .
Most viewers probably came away from the interview convinced that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , is unwilling to negotiate over its nuclear enrichment program , and is a danger to the entire world .
Following a lead - in by Blitzer affirming that Iran is " showing absolutely no indication they ’re going to stop enriching uranium , " Livni  representing a country that has ignored more UN resolutions than any other , engaged in ethnic cleansing , and attacked all of its neighbors without warning  asserted that " It is clear that Iran does n’t pay attention to talks Iran is a threat , not only to Israel , but this is a global threat . "
Blitzer then obligingly provided another softball , referring to Ehud Barak ’s assessment that there is only a window of 15 to 36 months before Iran crosses the " line of no return . "
While it is not clear what the expression " line of no return " means , Livni jumped on it , saying that " any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the Iranians as weakness .
Iran is a threat to its neighbors , as well .
We should n’t wait for what we call ‘ point of no return . ’ "
Blitzer then asked , " You do n’t even give them 15 months necessarily .
You think it ’s a more urgent matter ? "
" Yes , " Livni answered .
Blitzer then suggested that the U.S. might not ready for a " third front " in the Middle East at the present time , to which Livni replied , " [ T ] he world cannot afford a nuclear Iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region , in the hands not only of states , but also of terrorist organizations . "
Livni clearly believes that it is all right for Israel to have a secret nuclear arsenal but unacceptable for any of Israel ’s neighbors , because they can not be trusted to behave responsibly .
The allegation that Tehran would give nuclear weapons to terrorists surfaces frequently from Israeli and neocon sources .
It is speculative and in all likelihood a complete fantasy , given the apocalyptic consequences of such an action for Iran , but Blitzer failed to contest the point .
The terrorist argument is an essential line in the script for those who want the U.S. to engage in a war with Iran .
Tzipi Livni should not be blamed for reciting her lines in spite of her personal misgivings , because she is , after all , the government official responsible for explaining Tel Aviv ’s foreign policy .
It is the American media that continues to play the patsy .
If interviewers like Wolf Blitzer are the best that the U.S. mainstream media can come up with , then we are in serious trouble .
The interview format itself is a travesty , particularly as it suggests that some rational process is being applied to either critique or validate what the interviewee is saying .
As the Livni interview demonstrates , if the subject is the Middle East and the interviewer is Wolf Blitzer , that is not likely to be the case .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The swollen Mississippi River has flowed over the top of 19 levees in Missouri , Iowa and Illinois , and another 29 levees are at risk , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Wednesday .
The river overtopped at least nine levees overnight as water levels rose in the Midwest ’s worst flooding in 15 years .
The river was cresting in Burlington , Iowa , but has yet to reach its peak in many areas where the levees have already failed .
The compromised levees stretch from Dubuque , Iowa , to St. Louis and protect hundreds of thousands of acres of homes and farmland .
“ We basically have about three dozen levee systems we ’re concerned about overtopping as the river continues to rise , ” said Ron Fournier , spokesman for the Corps ’ Rock Island District , which had 11 of the 19 levees overtopped .
The 11 levees in the Rock Island District were protecting 68,000 acres , according to a map from the Corps of Engineers .
The eight levees north of St. Louis protect 2,200 people and about 40,000 acres of agricultural land .
Once the river flows over the levee , it usually erodes the levee from the other side , causing a breach .
The levees in New Orleans broke during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , causing catastrophic flooding .
It 's a swimsuit so revolutionary that one athlete has claimed that it makes you feel like you 're " swimming downhill " .
And , since it was launched in February , 38 world records have been broken by swimmers wearing it .
Little wonder , then , that Olympic swimming teams are now falling over themselves to ditch their sponsors in order to get Speedo's LZR Racer swimsuit in the run-up to Beijing .
So what 's all the fuss about ?
Would those records have been broken if a different suit had been worn ?
The suit took nearly four years to develop and involved enlisting the help of Nasa and a technique called computational fluid dynamics , says Jason Rance , head of Speedo 's Aqualab , the company 's global research and development facility .
He says the swimsuit can reduce drag by up to 24 % .
Existing all - over bodysuits , which have been used in competition swimming for 15 years , are all designed to reduce drag .
One popular and somewhat counter - intuitive way of doing this is to engineer the surface so that it is rough not smooth .
This has the effect of creating a small amount of turbulence in the thin layer of water flowing close to the material 's surface .
The aim here is to prevent water from passing over it evenly , and so clinging to it - the same principle behind the dimples in golf balls and why the hulls of ships are rough , according to Mike Caine , director of the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University .
But the LZR does something different , says Rance .
It is made up of two types of material , one woven and coated with water repellant , the other an extremely smooth polyurethane membrane .
Both are engineered to create very little friction when water flows over it .
Another feature of the LZR is compression : it is designed to hug the body 70 times tighter than other suits .
This has the effect of squashing the body together like a corset to make it more streamlined .
" You 're not going to want to wear it at the beach , " says Rance .
But for athletes the benefits appear to outweigh how uncomfortable it might be .
But if the suit really does work , does n't this amount to an unfair advantage ?
" It 's clearly not cheating because it does n't break any of the rules , " says Caine .
It 's no worse than one athlete training with a better exercise machine than another , he says .
Even so , for the have - not swimmers it may amount to little more than technological doping .
Some years ago ( 1999 ’ish ) I was in a job where I needed to bring in a lot of software contractors in a short space of time .
As a result I ended up dealing with a good number of IT contracting agencies .
To help the process I wrote very specific job / task descriptions , and sent these to all agencies .
Generally I would receive agency - specific CVs , where they had reformatted the candidate ’s CV , and in places tweaked the content .
Over time it became clear that some agencies certainly did a lot more than reformatting , adding things they thought I wanted to see .
This was really annoying , as the fabrication would reveal itself at some point in the process , sometimes after wasting time on a candidate .
We needed a software tester , and while writing the task description I decided to see how far the agencies would go .
The descriptions all had a section listing required skills and experience , and another listing desirables .
In the required section I listed “ Pink box testing experience ” .
There ’s no such thing as Pink box testing ( see below ) – I made it up to see if I received any CVs with pink box testing listed .
Sure enough , a week or so after putting out the description , I received a CV for a software tester .
He clearly had a lot of relevant experience , but the agency had added pink box testing as one of his strengths ( it was an agency modification , not a claim of the candidate ) .
It was fun ringing up the agent and explaining that he ’d been caught in my trap , and listening to him trying to weasel his way out .
No such thing as Pink Box testing ?
I ca n’t remember exactly when this was , but from my memory is was most likely 1999 or early 2000 .
At the time I did a quick web search to see if there was any such thing as pink box testing , and a quick skim of my testing books .
Certainly did n’t seem to be at that time .
As several commenters have pointed out , there are ( now ) several valid definitions of pink box testing , not all of them appropriate for polite conversation .
The term “ pink box ” was clearly relevant to phone phreakers at that time , so the term “ pink box testing ” made sense in at least that context , but in the context of software testing it did n’t .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Taliban insurgents killed 10 French soldiers and wounded 21 in a major battle in Afghanistan , the French president ’s office said on Tuesday , the biggest single loss of foreign troops in combat there since 2001 .
Bodies of suicide bombers are seen after they detonated themselves in Khost province , eastern Afghanistan , August 19 , 2008 .

The Taliban have gradually closed in on Kabul in the past year , making travel south , west or east of the capital extremely hazardous for troops , aid workers and civilians and spreading fear among the population .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is to travel to Afghanistan on Tuesday in response to the attack , his office said .
“ My determination is intact .
France is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom .
The cause is just , ” Sarkozy said in the statement .
The French soldiers were killed in a major battle that erupted when Taliban fighters ambushed their reconnaissance patrol from three sides in mountainous country in the Sarobi district , about 60 km ( 40 miles ) east of Kabul on Monday .
Nine were killed immediately when the lead section of the patrol dismounted from their vehicles at around 1:30 p.m. ( 0900 GMT ) to reconnoiter on foot .
A 10th died later when the vehicle he was in overturned .
The battle that ensued lasted deep into the night and the mixed French , Afghan and U.S. force summoned reinforcements and air support , General Jean - Louis Georgelin , chief of the army general staff , told a news conference in Paris .
A “ large number ” of insurgents were killed in the fighting , NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) said .
France has 2,600 troops in Afghanistan , after Sarkozy sent an extra 700 soldiers this year in response to a U.S. call for NATO allies to provide more forces to check a surge in violence .
The deaths brought to 24 the number of French troops killed in Afghanistan since U.S. - led and Afghan forces ousted the Taliban in 2001 for refusing to give up al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 attacks .
The 10 dead and 21 wounded soldiers were from the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment , the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment and the Regiment de marche du Tchad , a mechanized marine unit .
The Afghan Defence Ministry said 27 insurgents were killed or wounded in the fighting and at least two Afghan soldiers were wounded .
The Taliban Web site said 20 U.S. soldiers had been killed in the fighting , which they said started after militants ambushed a convoy of Afghan and foreign forces late on Monday .
The insurgents commonly refer to all foreign troops as American .
TALIBAN CLOSING IN
The Taliban have stepped up attacks in provinces bordering the Afghan capital over the past year , closing in from the volatile south and east , where the bulk of the fighting has occurred since militants relaunched their insurgency in 2005 .
“ What we ’ve noticed in recent operations is a greater capacity from the Taliban to organize and maneuver and as we saw in this incident , they do n’t seem to have any problems securing ammunition , ” Georgelin said .
Kabul has had fewer suicide bombings so far this year compared to 2007 , but the attacks have been far more daring and have hit higher - profile targets , increasing the sense of insecurity in the capital .
While fighting raged east of Kabul , a wave of Taliban suicide bombers and gunmen attempted to attack the main U.S. base in southeastern Afghanistan .
They were repelled by ground troops and attack helicopters , NATO - led forces said .
ISAF troops killed seven of the insurgents , six of them suicide bombers , after they spotted them preparing to attack about 1,000 meters ( yards ) from the base .
Soldiers opened fire with small arms , then “ helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene ” , ISAF said in a statement .
“ Three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests .
ISAF forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests .
There were no ISAF casualties in the attack , ” it said .
A suicide car bomber rammed the gates of the same base , close to the border with Pakistan , on Monday , killing 10 Afghan civilians and wounding 13 more .
Camp Salerno is a large , sprawling base with a runway and helicopter landing pads close to the town of Khost and is the main hub for mostly U.S. troops in southeastern Afghanistan .
More foreign troops have been killed in Afghanistan in the past three months than in Iraq where the United States has twice as many soldiers than all the international forces fighting the Taliban .
US Congress approves government bailout of mortgage giants
By Barry Grey and Andre Damon
28 July 2008
Less than two weeks after the Bush administration called on Congress to approve an unprecedented plan to authorize the use of unlimited public funds to bail out the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Senate on Saturday joined the House of Representatives in passing the necessary legislation and sending it to the White House for President Bush ’s signature .
The bill passed by Congress gives the treasury secretary unilateral authority to allocate taxpayer funds to rescue the two corporations , which are chartered by the government but privately owned .
To make room for the bailout , the bill raises the federal government ’s debt ceiling by $ 800 billion to $ 10.6 trillion .
This increases the cushion between the debt limit and the current federal debt to $ 1.1 trillion .
The legislation thus opens the way for a government bailout of Wall Street that would make the $ 160 billion rescue of the savings and loan industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s pale in comparison .
The House passed the bill last Thursday by a vote of 272 to 152 , with 45 Republicans joining 227 Democrats in favor .
The Senate vote , conducted in a rare Saturday session , was 72 to 13 , with all of the Democratic senators voting to pass the bill .
The extraordinary rapidity by which the bailout legislation was passed demonstrates the most fundamental fact of American political life : the complete subordination of Congress and both parties to the American financial aristocracy .
When it comes to the vital interests of Wall Street , the much bemoaned gridlock in Congress disappears and both parties jump to attention and provide the votes needed to bail out the big financial interests .
( See “ US bailout of mortgage giants : The politics of plutocracy ” )
The emergency bailout provisions in the bill were attached to Democratic - sponsored housing legislation that had been wending its way through Congress for months .
Under conditions in which millions of Americans were losing their homes as a result of predatory and reckless lending practices by mortgage companies and banks , Congress had failed to act to provide even the minimal relief contained in the Democratic proposal .
Only the near - collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which hold or guarantee more than half of the country ’s $ 12 trillion mortgage debt , prompted Congress to pass the housing bill to which the lenders ’ bailout had been appended .
The actions of President Bush underscore the plutocratic reality behind the façade of American democracy .
Bush had for months threatened to veto the housing bill , citing a provision allocating $ 4 billion to states and localities to buy and refurbish foreclosed homes .
He reiterated his veto threat earlier last week .
But within days , after a discussion with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson — the former CEO of Goldman Sachs whose net worth is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars — Bush reversed himself and said he would sign the combined housing and Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac bailout legislation .
The bill passed by Congress is 694 pages long .
It is certain that few , if any , of the congressmen and senators who voted for it even read the massive text of the legislation .
The New York Times reported Sunday one “ little - noted provision ” hidden in its language that gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation greater authority to shore up the savings and loan system .
It allows the FDIC to create “ bridge institutions ” for failing savings and loans banks such as California ’s IndyMac , which failed earlier this month , along the lines of a power that has existed since 1991 for failed banks .
The legislative package also provides $ 15 billion in housing - related tax breaks , a portion of which fund a $ 7,500 tax credit for first - time homebuyers , with the rest going to home builders and other large corporations .
There are other items “ buried deep in the legislation , ” according to the Times , which provide special favors to specific corporate interests .
The Times writes : “ And there is a provision tailored narrowly for Chrysler to ensure that it can benefit from a corporate tax incentive even though the company is now structured as a partnership not a corporation . ”
The rest of the bill amounts to a pittance for ordinary mortgage holders .
The legislation includes provisions to assist several hundred thousand homeowners facing foreclosure by allowing banks to refinance their mortgages with government insurance on slightly more favorable terms .
If everyone who qualifies for the program decides to refinance under the new terms , only one sixth of the 2.5 million homeowners expected to foreclose this year will be affected .
But of the 400,000 people who qualify for the provision , only a fraction are expected to receive assistance .
Moreover , since the government insurance plan will be offset by additional fees to homeowners , the actual government expenditure is expected to be negligible .
The congressional budget office estimates the homeowner assistance portion of the bill will cost the Federal Government only some $ 2.5 billion over the course of the next five to seven years .
This figure stands in stark contrast to the essentially unlimited government funds being made available to the financial companies , under the sole discretion of the treasury secretary .
The federal government chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1938 and 1970 , respectively , to expand financing options for homeowners .
In recent years the firms have been partially supplanted as the secondary mortgage market expanded .
But Fannie and Freddie retained a competitive advantage because markets assumed that their debt was guaranteed by the government , allowing them to borrow at lower rates .
Despite a string of management scandals , the firms retained their privileged position through their formidable lobbying efforts .
Before Paulson ’s call for government assistance two years ago , the US government had no expressed commitment to defending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Testifying before Congress in October 2003 , former Treasury Secretary John Snow said , “ We do n’t believe there is any government guarantee ” for the two lenders , adding , “ It ’s not in our view a reality , but it ’s a perception of an implied guarantee . ”
Regardless of this stated position , both parties and all sections of the government have now sprung to the companies ’ rescue .
The new bill ’s rapid and overwhelming passage underscores the fact that both parties are united in support of Wall Street , with the Democrats in many cases taking the lead over Republicans in calling for more government funds to be channeled into troubled financial firms .
Immediately following the bill ’s passage in the Senate , Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama gave his implicit approval to the unlimited Wall Street bailouts advocated by Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , commenting , “ I think that Chairman Bernanke was handed a pretty tough hand and I think some of the decisions he ’s made have been the right ones . ”
War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings .
War… is harmful , not only to the conquered but to the conqueror .
To defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable .
The main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war .
The root of the evil is not the construction of new , more dreadful weapons .
It is the spirit of conquest .
— quotations from Ludwig von Mises ( 1881 - 1973 )
There are people in charge who think that provocation and aggression can be acceptable government policy .
The sudden conflict between the former Soviet province of Georgia and Russia in the Caucasus in Eurasia is a good case in point .
What ’s behind this conflict that erupted last Friday at the outset of the Beijing Olympic Games ?
First and foremost , let us keep in mind that the real and first aggressors in this conflict is the belligerent government of Georgia , led by an impulsive politician named Mikhail Saakashvili , who is openly supported by the governments of the U.S. and of Israel .
Early Friday , August 8 , Georgian tanks and infantry , assisted by American and Israeli military advisers , launched an early morning massive artillery and rocket barrage on the capital of breakaway South Ossetia , Tskhinvali , thus directly provoking Russia , which had soldiers in that province .
At first blush , most people could easily arrive at the conclusion that Saakashvili is completely out of his mind for having declared war against its neighbor Russia , a country more than 50 times larger , with the goal of reoccupying the Russian - speaking province of South Ossetia , de facto independent since 1992 .
The only logical explanation would seem to be that the Georgia President believed , or had some form of assurance , that the Bush - Cheney administration would side militarily with him .
Did he really believe that the Bush - Cheney administration , already deeply involved in two military conflicts in Iraq and in Afghanistan , would risk a world war to salvage an oil pipeline and a newly acquired colony in that far away part of the world ?
This would seem to be another insane idea .
It is a little known fact that the U.S. and Israel have been training and arming the Georgian military since 2002 .
This situation is tantamount to risking a restart of the Cold War with Russia .
It has also sown the seeds of a much larger conflict in that part of the world by encouraging Georgia to embark on military maneuvers .
Little Georgia ( 4.5 m. inhabitants ) even has 2,000 troops in Iraq , soldiers that the U.S. is now quickly flying back to Georgia .
This goes a long way towards explaining how involved the Bush - Cheney administration and its Israeli surrogates have been in sticking it in the eyes of Russia .
And now , the Russian bear is reacting .
This is brinkmanship at a high level .
In the summer of 1914 , a similar miscalculation resulted in igniting World War I .
This was a conflict that started with a single death ( the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28 , 1914 ) but which resulted , in the end , in 40 million deaths .
The catastrophe was the result of a chain reaction of war declarations by various countries involved in the affairs of other countries .
This remains an example of how relatively minor regional conflicts can escalate into conflagrations when hotheads are in command .
The Georgia - Russia spat represents a good opportunity for the U.N. Secretary - General , Mr. Ban Ki-moon , to show leadership and not to let things degenerate .
Indeed , there is always the possibility that one politician after another will try not to lose face by escalating things .
For example , the U.N Secretary - General should obtain from the Security Council the mandate to visit immediately the two capitals directly involved , and he should attempt to broker an immediate face - saving end to the hostilities .
He should persuade the Russian leaders not to overreact to the Georgian President ’s provocations .
As for the latter , he has demonstrated that he is not worthy of occupying his functions .
Time is of the essence in such circumstances , because there are always some interests that stand to profit from a worsening situation .
For one , the presumptive Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who never met a war he did n’t like , has already tried to stoke the fire of conflict by calling for the 26 - country NATO to get involved in what is essentially a local ethnic conflict .
On the campaign trail , John McCain said : “ We should immediately call a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to assess Georgia ’s security and review measures NATO can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation . ”
Incredibly , the republican candidate is attempting to profit politically from this faraway crisis by advancing the frightening prospect of turning a small regional conflict into a world war .
This could have something to do with the fact that Mr. McCain ’s main foreign policy adviser is a former lobbyist for the government of Georgia and is a former neocon lobbyist for the U.S. military invasion of Iraq .
This would seem to be a direct conflict of interests and reason enough for Mr. McCain to refrain from throwing oil on the fire .
I have said it before , and this incident confirms it ; this man would seem to be unfit to be in charge of a heavily armed country .
Illuminati Cash " Slush Fund " Estimated At 65 Trillion Dollars ; Illegal Federal Reserve At Heart Of Problem As Minnesota Judge Allegedly Poisoned In 1969 After Ruling Against Corrupt Banksters
by Greg Szymanski , Mar 23 , 2006
The New Underworld Order 's bank accounts are used for bribery , murder and corruption world wide as private Illuminati - controlled bankers make money out of thin air .
European investigators trying to trace the illegal funds , say the Illuminati's Global Security Fund needs to be stopped and is the difference between freedom and slavery in America .
Greg Szymanski
he Illuminati's cash cow , grazing freely on the world wide pasture of greenbacks , is n't called " Elsie " but instead is called the Global Security Fund , a name actually meaning in the secret cult 's language Global Terrorist Fund .
In simple terms , it 's a gigantic illegal trust fund , estimated by undercover overseas financial investigators at 65 trillion dollars , set - up for " Illuminati rainy days " and established when it is desperately needed in a pinch for bribery , assassinations and sponsoring world wide terrorist activities .
Recently , Ashley Mote of the European Union ( EU ) asked this volatile question in a public EU meeting , a question never answered , as Mr. Mote merely by asking it was immediately scratched from the White House Christmas card list and placed on its top ten hit list :
" Mr President , I wish to draw your attention to the Global Security Fund , set up in the early 1990s under the auspices of Jacob Rothschild .
This is a Brussels - based fund and it is no ordinary fund : it does not trade , it is not listed and it has a totally different purpose .
It is being used for geopolitical engineering purposes , apparently under the guidance of the intelligence services .
" I have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the European Union 's own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts , and I still await a reply .
To that question I now add another : what are the European Union ''s connections to the Global Security Fund and what relationship does it have with European Union institutions ?
Although the fund is cloaked in secrecy and made possible by the Western civilization 's Federal Reserve banking system , investigators trying to pry into the Illumnati's secret treasure trove have uncovered some interesting facts .
Before looking at some of the startling information behind how the " Illuminati banksters " create money out of thin air , ask why the 1968 Minnesota Trial Court 's decision holding the Federal Reserve Act unconstitutional and void and holding the National Banking Act unconstitutional and void was never appealed or vacated ?
The answer is even the legal manipulators and corrupted high court judges can't get around this decision , figuring it better to just let the case of the First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly die in the cold Minnesota snow along with Justice Martin V. Mahoney who was found suspiciously poisoned to death six months after he issued the ruling that exposed the illegality of what has been called the Queen of England 's illegal banking scam .
This decision , which is still good law , has the effect of declaring all private mortgages on real and personal property , and all U.S. and State bonds held by the Federal Reserve , National and State Banks to void .
According to legal scholars and Bill Drexler , who worked on the case with Judge Mahoney , " This amounts to an emancipation of this nation from personal , national and State debt purportedly owed to this banking system .
Every True American owes it to himself / herself , to his or her country , and to the people of the world for that matter , to study this decision very carefully and to understand it , for upon it hangs the question of freedom or slavery . "
Saying this was the most important jury decision of modern times , Drexler who was present in the Minnesota courtroom the day the decision came down , added :
The banker testified about the mortgage loan given to Jerome Daly , but then Daly cross examined the banker about the creating of money " out of thin air , " and the banker admitted that this was standard banking practice .
When Justice Mahoney heard the banker testify that he could " create money out of thin air , " Mahoney said , " It sounds like fraud to me . "
I looked at the faces of the jurors , and they were all agreeing with Mahoney by shaking their heads and by the looks on their faces .
" Both Jerome Daly and Justice Martin V. Mahoney are truly the greatest men that I have ever had the pleasure to meet .
The Credit River Decision was and still is the most important legal decision ever decided by a Jury . "
Is nuclear power the answer for a warming planet ?
Or is it too expensive and dangerous to satisfy future energy needs ?
Interest in nuclear power is heating up , as the hunt intensifies for " green " alternatives to fossil fuels like coal and natural gas .
Even some environmentalists have come on board , citing the severity of the global - warming ...

Package : openssh Vulnerability : predictable random number generator Problem type : remote Debian - specific : yes CVE Id(s ) : CVE -2008-0166
The recently announced vulnerability in Debian 's openssl package ( DSA - 1571 - 1 , CVE - 2008 -0166 ) indirectly affects OpenSSH .
As a result , all user and host keys generated using broken versions of the openssl package must be considered untrustworthy , even after the openssl update has been applied .
1 . Install the security updates
This update contains a dependency on the openssl update and will automatically install a corrected version of the libss0.9.8 package , and a new package openssh - blacklist .
Once the update is applied , weak user keys will be automatically rejected where possible ( though they can not be detected in all cases ) .
If you are using such keys for user authentication , they will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced ( see step 3 ) .
OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH security update is applied .
The update will prompt for confirmation before taking this step .
2 . Update OpenSSH known_hosts files
The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the known_hosts file .
The warning will look like this : @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @ WARNING : REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED ! @ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY !
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now ( man - in - the - middle attack ) !
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed .
In this case , the host key has simply been changed , and you should update the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message .
It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the server key .
It is found in the file /etc/ssh / ssh_host_rsa_key .pub on the server ; it 's fingerprint can be printed using the command : ssh - keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
In addition to user - specific known_hosts files , there may be a system - wide known hosts file / etc / ssh / known_hosts .
This is file is used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts .equiv functionality .
This file needs to be updated as well .
3 . Check all OpenSSH user keys
The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys , except where it can be established to a high degree of certainty that the key was generated on an unaffected system .
Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh - vulnkey tool , included in the security update .
By default , ssh- vulnkey will check the standard location for user keys ( ~/.ssh/id_rsa , ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity ) , your authorized_keys file ( ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 ) , and the system 's host keys ( /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key ) .
To check all your own keys , assuming they are in the standard locations ( ~/.ssh/id_rsa , ~/.ssh/id_dsa , or ~/.ssh/identity ) : ssh-vulnkey
To check all keys on your system : sudo ssh- vulnkey -a
To check a key in a non-standard location : ssh- vulnkey / path / to / key
If ssh- vulnkey says " Unknown ( no blacklist information ) " , then it has no information about whether that key is affected .
In this case , you can examine the modification time ( mtime ) of the file using " ls - l " .
Keys generated before September 2006 are not affected .
Keep in mind that , although unlikely , backup procedures may have changed the file date back in time ( or the system clock may have been incorrectly set ) .
If in doubt , generate a new key and remove the old one from any servers .
4 . Regenerate any affected user keys OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated , including those which may have since been transferred to a different system after being generated .
New keys can be generated using ssh- keygen , e.g. : $ ssh - keygen Generating public / private rsa key pair .
Enter file in which to save the key ( /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa ) : Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : Enter same passphrase again : Your identification has been saved in /home / user/.ssh/id_rsa .
Your public key has been saved in /home / user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
The key fingerprint is : 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host
5 . Update authorized_keys files ( if necessary )
Once the user keys have been regenerated , the relevant public keys must be propagated to any authorized_keys files ( and authorized_keys2 files , if applicable ) on remote systems .
Be sure to delete the lines containing old keys from those files ..
In addition to countermeasures to mitigate the randomness vulnerability , this OpenSSH update fixes several other vulnerabilities : CVE - 2008 - 1483 : Timo Juhani Lindfors discovered that , when using X11 forwarding , the SSH client selects an X11 forwarding port without ensuring that it can be bound on all address families .
If the system is configured with IPv6 ( even if it does not have working IPv6 connectivity ) , this could allow a local attacker on the remote server to hijack X11 forwarding .
CVE - 2007 -4752 : Jan
Pechanec discovered that ssh fails back to creating a trusted X11 cookie if creating an untrusted cookie fails , potentially exposing the local display to a malicious remote server when using X11 forwarding .
For the stable distribution ( etch ) , these problems have been fixed in version 4.3p2-9etch1 .
Currently , only a subset of all supported architectures have been built ; further updates will be provided when they become available .
For the unstable distribution ( sid ) and the testing distribution ( lenny ) , these problems have been fixed in version 4.7p1 - 9 .
We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages and take the measures indicated above .
